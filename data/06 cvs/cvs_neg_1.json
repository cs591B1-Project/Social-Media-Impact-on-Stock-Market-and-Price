      "title": "CVS shares sink on lower guidance, revenue shortfall - MarketWatch",
      "text": "CVS Health Corp. CVS, +1.31% shares sank 11.3% in Tuesday premarket trading after the pharmacy chain lowered and narrowed its full-year guidance and missed on revenue. Net income was $1.54 billion, or 1.43 per share, up from $1.25 billion, or $1.10 per share, for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.64, beating the $1.57 FactSet consensus. Revenue was $44.6 billion, up from $38.6 billion, but missing the $45.3 billion FactSet consensus. Same-store sales increased 2.3%, and pharmacy same-store sales rose 3.4%. Pharmacy same-store sales were affected by about 340 basis points because of recent generic drug introductions, the company said. CVS lowered and narrowed its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $5.81 to $5.89 from $5.77 to $5.83. For the fourth quarter, CVS expects adjusted EPS $1.64 to $1.70. Pharmacy network changes, which are expected to cause some prescriptions to migrate out of its pharmacies, and slowing subscription growth are the reason for the guidance cut. CVS expects full-year 2017 adjusted EPS in the range of $5.77 to $5.93, which includes the projected loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions. The board has approved a new share repurchase program for up to $15 billion. CVS shares are down 14.7% for the year so far while the S&P 500 Index SPX, +2.22% is up 4.3% for the same period.",

      "text": "CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS ) delivered better than expected EPS for the third quarter though revenue missed. However, the company offered downbeat guidance for the fourth quarter and next year. Reports 28 percent increase in adjusted EPS to $1.64, beats by $0.07. Delivers 15.5 percent growth in revenue of $44.6 billion; misses by $0.69 billion. Offers adjusted EPS forecast of $1.64-$1.70 for the fourth quarter versus $1.79 expectations. Lowered and Narrowed full year adjusted EPS from $5.81-$5.89 to $5.77-$5.83 compared to $5.85 expected by the Street. For the full year 2017, CVS expects adjusted EPS of $5.77-$5.93 versus $6.53 expected by analysts. Announces a fresh share buyback program of a maximum of $15 billion. \nCVS Health President and CEO Larry Merlo stated, \"We are currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market as well as a soft seasonal business. These factors combined are leading us to reduce the mid-point of our guidance for this year by five cents per share. The network changes have more significant implications for our 2017 outlook. While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth.\" \nThe stock plunged 11.98 percent to $73.40 in the pre-market session.

      "text": "CVS Health Inc. warned that fewer people will fulfill retail prescriptions at its pharmacies, as its integrated model is being challenged by competitors including Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.\nShares dropped 11% to $73.94 in premarket trading as the company also slashed its annual expectations and gave downbeat projections for the coming fiscal year.\nCVS Health's model of operating both a chain of retail store-pharmacies and a pharmacy benefit manager has been pressured by other pharmacy-benefit managers who have struck deals with competitors. In August, Walgreens struck a deal with Prime Therapeutics to become its preferred pharmacy.\nChief Executive Larry Merlo said recent pharmacy network changes have caused some retail prescriptions to move out of its network in the quarter.\nHe also cited slowing prescription growth in the market overall. The drug industry has recently shown signs that it is slowing the pace of price increases after years of hefty hikes, after pressure from politicians, consumers and employers.\nCVS also cut its guidance. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $5.77 and $5.83, down from $5.81 to $5.89 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings per share of $5.85. For 2017 it expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.77 to $5.93. Analysts had expected $6.52.\nPharmacy-benefits managers, which include companies like Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health's Caremark, operate as middlemen between insurance companies, corporations that pay for health coverage, drugmakers, and pharmacies. They help process claims for prescriptions drugs while also negotiating with drugmakers and insurance companies over the price of medications.\nThe Woonsocket, R.I.-based drugstore giant has increasingly relied on its pharmacy benefits management division for growth.\nIn all for the quarter, CVS reported a profit of $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share, up from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, per-share profit rose to $1.64 from $1.28.\nRevenue increased 15% to $44.62 billion.\nAnalysts predicted $1.57 in adjusted earnings a share and $45.29 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch 'Gerries': The Case for Women Over 35 Having Children Coal-mining boss: ‘Tesla is a fraud’ The worst thing at the debate wasn’t anything Donald Trump said or did",

      "text": "  07:27 AM EST CVS Plummets 12% As Pharmacy Network Changes Will Hamper Earnings \nDrug store chain operator CVS Health Corp ( NYSE:CVS ) early today posted mixed Q3 earnings and offered a very weak outlook, as big pharmacy network changes will lead to the loss of over 40 million prescriptions. \nThe Woonsocket, RI-based company reported Q3 EPS of $1.64, beating out Wall Street’s $1.57 estimate by 7 cents. Revenue rose 15.5% from last year to $44.62 billion, however, missing analysts’ $45.29 billion view. \nLooking ahead, CVS offered a much weaker-than-expected outlook due to massive marketplace changes. The company said it would lose over 40 million retail prescriptions as many retail pharmacy networks begin excluding CVS Pharmacy drugstores. CVS expects Q4 EPS of $1.64 to $1.70, below analysts’ $1.79 view, and full year EPS of $5.75 to $5.83, versus Wall Street’s $5.85 estimate. \nOn a positive note, CVS boosted its cash flow guidance for 2016, now expecting cash flow from operations of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion, and and 2016 free cash flow of $6.8 billion to $7.0 billion. \nThe company commented via press release: \n“We posted a solid third quarter with the PBM exceeding our expectations and retail performing at the lower end of our expectations. However, very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter. In addition, we are currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market as well as a soft seasonal business. These factors combined are leading us to reduce the mid-point of our guidance for this year by five cents per share. The network changes have more significant implications for our 2017 outlook. While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth.” \nCVS shares fell $10.40 (-12.47%) to $72.99 in premarket trading Tuesday. Prior to today’s report, CVS had already fallen 14.71% year-to-date. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content.

In August, Walgreens struck a deal with Prime Therapeutics to become its preferred pharmacy. \nHe also cited slowing prescription growth in the market overall. The drug industry has recently shown signs that it is slowing the pace of price increases after years of hefty hikes, after pressure from politicians, consumers and employers. \nCVS also cut its guidance. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $5.77 and $5.83, down from $5.81 to $5.89 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings per share of $5.85. For 2017 it expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.77 to $5.93.

      "text": "CVS Health Corp (CVS) Stock Is a Black-and-Blue Buy Now CVS stock battered despite a Q3 earnings beat thanks to an ugly look down the road By Dana Blankenhorn , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 8, 2016, 8:02 am EST View All Posts \nAnalysts looking at CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS ) entered its earnings period with a healthy dose of skepticism. CVS stock was down 20% over the past six months, as revenue growth seemed to stall and earnings began falling. Its rebranding has it seen as a health care stock, rather than a retailer. But now that healthcare is out of favor, it’s suffering for that. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr \nThe company has already responded to earnings pressure by laying off 600 people , almost half of them at its Rhode Island headquarters. Analyst estimates for the quarter were modest — $1.57 per share in earnings on $45.31 billion in revenue — and some were calling the company oversold. \nBut apparently, CVS stock wasn’t oversold enough. CVS Earnings Beat, But … \nCVS did handily beat expectations on earnings for the quarter ending in September, with net income of $1.54 billion, or $1.64 per share. However, revenue fell short of expectations, at $44.615 billion. \nThe fans were not cheering. The bottom-line beat was based in part on a favorable tax ruling that wasn’t expected to come down until the fourth quarter, adding 5 cents per share to earnings. Without it, earnings were just 2 cents per share ahead of expectations. CVS also cut its earnings guidance for the year, from a range of $4.92-$5 per share to a range of $4.84-$4.90. The company also said next year’s earnings should only advance about 20 cents per share from that figure. \nThe press release was downbeat, too. CEO Larry Merlo wrote that “very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter” and that “we are currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market.” During the quarter, CVS opened 48 new outlets and closed 6, while relocating another 11. \nCVS stock crashed again in response, falling almost 15% in premarket trade. \nThe good news is that new investors will now find a better yield than the previous 2.04%. The bad news is that anyone who bought the stock over the last year, like me, is completely out of the money. Time to Give Up? \nCVS made big news a few years ago when it dropped cigarettes from its stores, rebranding itself as CVS Health. This seemed to have no impact on near-term results, and the shares rose through the middle of 2015, reaching a high of over $112.",

CEO Joseph Papa did say the company is making progress with its ongoing restructuring of operations. \nTesla — Tesla announced a deal to buy German engineering firm Grohmann for an undisclosed amount, in a move the automaker said would further its push into high-volume manufacturing. \nCVS Health — The drugstore operator earned an adjusted $1.64 per share for its latest quarter, seven cents a share above estimates. The company's revenue fell short of estimates, however, and it cut its full-year forecast. CVS said it was seeing slowing prescription growth as well as a soft seasonal business. Separately, CVS announced a new $15 billion stock buyback program. \nDR Horton — The homebuilder fell two cents a share short of estimates, with quarterly earnings of 75 cents per share. Revenue also came in slightly below forecasts. Its results were impacted by a jump in cancellations. DR Horton also announced a 25 percent quarterly dividend increase to 10 cents per share. \nWayfair — The online home furnishings retailer lost 54 cents per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the 60 cent loss that analysts were expecting. Revenue came in above forecasts. Wayfair said it gained significant market share during the quarter and remains optimistic about its long-term profit potential. \nXerox — The company's board approved the terms of Xerox's upcoming split into two separate companies, and expects to complete the split by December 31. Xerox shareholders will get one share of the new company known as Conduent for every five Xerox shares they now hold. \nGoldman Sachs — Citi downgraded Goldman to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" in a call based on valuation relative to earnings expectations. \nBank of America — Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" noting the strong performance of the stock from 2016 lows and what it sees as modest additional upside potential. \nAnheuser-Busch InBev — The beer brewer has gotten at least six bids for brands that it is selling, according to Reuters. Among the reported bidders: Japan's Asahi Group, and private-equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts . \nSeaWorld — The theme park operator posted quarterly profit of 77 cents per share, well short of the $1.08 a share expected by analysts. Revenue did beat estimates, but the bottom line was impacted by a 20 percent jump in overhead costs. \nBest Buy — Evercore cut its rating on the electronics retailer to \"sell,\" based on valuation as well as a saturated smartphone market and a shift in high end TVs toward discounters and online sellers. \nPriceline Group — Priceline reported adjusted quarterly profit of $31.18 per share, beating estimates of $29.91 a share. The travel services company also saw revenue beat forecasts, as well as the number of bookings, but its current-quarter guidance falls below consensus estimates. It also announced a $941 million write-down related to its OpenTable service. \nNews Corp. — News Corp. lost an adjusted one cent per share for its latest quarter, slightly worse than the breakeven quarter analysts had expected. The media company's revenue came in very slightly ahead of estimates, but its results were hurt by a tough print ad market, as well as foreign currency issues. \nMarriott — Marriott came in three cents a share ahead of estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 91 cents per share, but the hotel operator's revenue came in below forecasts. Its overall profit was hurt by costs related to its now-completed acquisition of rival Starwood. \nHertz — Hertz reported quarterly profit of $1.58 per share, substantially below estimates of $2.73 a share. Revenue also missed forecasts. The car rental company cut its outlook for the year, as well, as car-rental levels continue to be weak. Rival Avis Budget 's shares fell in sympathy following Hertz's quarterly report. \nAlign Technology — The maker of the Invisalign dental brace system reported quarterly profit of 63 cents per share, beating estimates by 11 cents a share. Revenue also beat forecasts on a surge in Invisalign case volume.

The FedEx jet contains the engine that GE identified. \nMylan — Mylan would be the subject of an antitrust probe over its EpiPen product if a Senate panel gets its way.

The results topped analysts' forecasts. \nDow Chemical , DuPont — Reuters reports that a group of state attorneys general have joined a federal antitrust probe into the planned merger between the two chemical companies. \nTwitter — Twitter is considering offers to buy its Vine service, according to TechCrunch, despite having announced plans last month to shut down the short-form video service.

      "text": "CVS Health Inc. warned that it stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as deals signed by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. with other participants in the drug supply chain shut out CVS stores.\nThe restricted networks caused the country's largest drugstore operator to temper its profit outlook for the rest of this year and next year, sending shares down 15% in premarket trading.\nCVS Health shares have already fallen nearly 15% this year, as investors fretted over push back to rising drug prices. That trend has the potential to harm the company's large business that manages prescription drug plans, which negotiates prices paid by large employers and captures some of the rebates built into drug prices. CVS filled 1.03 billion prescriptions in 2015, the last full year available.\nBut another challenge is coming from the drugstore space, where competitors like Walgreens are joining to create networks that exclude CVS stores.\nUnder Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, Walgreens has been aggressively pursuing deals that makes its pharmacies part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount. It has had a number of wins too, including becoming the preferred pharmacy for United Healthcare Inc.'s OptumRx and for Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.\nLast month, Walgreens signed a deal to become the preferred network for Tricare, the Defense Department's health care network, supplanting CVS Health.\nCVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said Tuesday that recent pharmacy network changes have caused some retail prescriptions to move out of its network in the latest quarter. He also cited slowing prescription growth in the market overall. The drug industry has recently shown signs that it is slowing the pace of price increases after years of hefty hikes, after pressure from politicians, consumers and employers.\nOn Tuesday, CVS lowered its financial targets. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $5.77 and $5.83, down from $5.81 to $5.89 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings per share of $5.85. For 2017 it expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.77 to $5.93. Analysts had expected $6.52.\nPharmacy-benefits managers, which include companies like Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health's Caremark, operate as middlemen between insurance companies, corporations that pay for health coverage, drugmakers, and pharmacies. They help process claims for prescriptions drugs while also negotiating with drugmakers and insurance companies over the price of medications.\nBy owning Caremark as well as thousands of drugstores, CVS Health has been able to closely align both businesses to encourage patients to fill their prescriptions somewhere within the CVS empire. For instance, under its Maintenance Choice program, patients can get 90-day prescriptions filled either through the pharmacy benefit program's mail order business or at CVS stores at the same lower price.\nThe Woonsocket, R.I.-based drugstore giant has increasingly relied on its pharmacy benefits management division for growth. In the latest quarter, CVS reported a profit of $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share, up from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, per-share profit rose to $1.64 from $1.28.\nRevenue increased 15% to $44.62 billion.\nAnalysts predicted $1.57 in adjusted earnings a share and $45.29 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com and Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch GOP Lawmakers Withdraw Support for Trump Over Lewd Video Trump 'Regrets' Crude Words He Spoke About Women in 2005 Surging oil prices, dollar boost Asian stock markets",

These factors combined are leading us to reduce the mid-point of our guidance for this year by five cents per share.\" \nIn a statement, CVS said it expected full-year adjusted earnings per share between $5.77-$5.83, down from a previously announced range of $5.81-$5.89, and below analysts' estimate for $5.85. \nFor the third quarter, CVS reported net revenue of $44.6 billion, below the forecast for $45.3 billion according to Bloomberg. \nThe stock lost 15% this year through the market close on Monday.

      "text": "Stock Futures Effectively Flat; Priceline, Hertz, CVS Health Book Big Moves (Investor's Business Daily) \nThe holiday season reinvigorates consumers in a big way as they vie with one another in splurging money on purchases, especially on gifts for themselves, family, friends and others. Retailers make use of this psyche of consumers and come out with several luring propositions, including offers, deals, coupons, discounts, free shipping, etc. \nAlthough retailers are said to be the prime beneficiaries of the holiday buying binge, there are other sectors, too, which vie for a piece of the holiday spending cake. Hotels, airline and travel & tour operators are among the overlooked sectors that reap in benefits of the frenzy to travel home to be with near and dear ones during the holiday season or to travel away from home with family in tow. Historical Performance And Proxies \nPerformance of the shares of tour & travel operators during the holiday season (though there is no official start and end date for the season, it is safer to assume it coincides with the November-December months), could be taken as a proxy for the prospects for these companies. \nAssuming a four-year perspective gives a fairly accurate picture on the trend, stock performance for four years during the holiday shopping season relative to the rest of the year was calculated to arrive at the correlation. That said, a statutory warning is deemed essential, as there could be noise due to extraneous factors such as economic condition and geopolitical tensions like natural calamities, terror strikes, etc. Seasonal Comparative Analysis \nBelow is a look at how different stocks have historically performed in the November–December period versus the January–October period. \nPriceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN ) 2012: +8.13 percent versus +22.66 percent. 2013: +10.30 percent versus +69.87 percent. 2014: (-5.47 percent) versus +3.77 percent. 2015: (-12.33 percent) versus +27.54 percent. \nTripadvisor Inc (NASDAQ: TRIP ) 2012: +38.40 percent versus +20.15 percent. 2013: +0.13 percent versus +97.32 percent. 2014: (-15.79 percent) versus +7.04 percent. 2015: +1.76 percent versus +12.22 percent. \nExpedia Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE ) 2012: +3.87 percent versus +111.72 percent. 2013: +18.13 percent versus +13.38 percent. 2014: +0.46 percent versus +22.54 percent. 2015: (-8.80 percent) versus +45.62 percent. Outcomes \nPerformances of stocks of tour and travel operators have been underwhelming in the holiday period, much against expectations of a notable move orchestrated by the holiday-travel mania. \nLooking at revenues for the period, there isn't any significant increase for the holiday season. Revenues for Priceline's fourth quarter, comprising the November–December period, came in at $2 billion in 2015, which accounts for roughly 22 percent of the total revenues for the year. In the case of Tripadvisor, the story isn't any different. The company's fourth-quarter 2015 revenues were $309 million or 20.7 percent of the total annual revenues. \nThus, the two key months of the holiday season aren't exactly the hot period for either fundamental performance or stock showing. This is probably because of the summer driving season running from April to August takes precedence over the last two months of the year from travel point of view. There isn't much to look forward to from these stocks despite the hype surrounding the holiday season. At Last Check ... Expedia shares were up 1.13 percent in Tuesday's pre-market session at $127.92. Priceline Group was up 4.17 percent in Tuesday's pre-market, trading at $1,542.01. Tripadvisor closed Monday at $63.43. © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.",

      "text": "CVS Q3 Earnings: What To Expect? November 07, 2016, 03:45:05 PM EDT By Trefis Team, Trefis Shutterstock photo \nCVS Health ( CVS ) is slated to announce its third quarter results on Tuesday, November 8th before the markets open. In the current quarter, we expect the company to show an uptick in revenues - aided by strong volumes and growth in Medicare Part C Plans - as well as margins, aided by volume growth and the completion of the acquisition of Target's pharmacies. \nFollowing its second quarter earnings, the company released a strong outlook for the third quarter, in which it expected revenues to grow in the range of 16.5% to 17.75% over the same period last year. Per the company's guidance, Retail Pharmacy revenues are expected to grow by 11.5% to 13% over the prior year quarter, aided by a 1% to 2.25% surge in same store sales, while Pharmacy Services are expected to grow by 21.25% to 22.5% over the same period last year.. \nCVS's Pharmacy Services division, the company's main revenue contributor, continues to grow at a faster pace than the company's other divisions, driven by an aging population and growing spending on specialty drugs. Moreover, the acquisitions of Omnicare and Target pharmacies have helped the company increase its store count in the country, aiding in new customer addition and significantly boosting revenue and prescriptions filled. \nIn the upcoming Q3 results, analyst consensus expect CVS's revenues to be $45.4 billion, an uptick of 17.5% over the prior year quarter, and adjusted EPS to be $1.57, an uptick of 21.7% over the same period last year. \nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):",

      "text": "Stock Futures Edge Lower; Priceline, Hertz, CVS Health Book Big Moves (Investor's Business Daily) \nAscendiant Capital Markets maintains its Buy rating on Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN ) as continued strong hotel growth and international momentum led to better-than-expected results for the third quarter. \nAlso, the brokerage said the $941 million OpenTable write -down is not material, as it represents only a small fraction of Priceline’s overall business. Priceline, which paid about $2.6 billion for OpenTable in 2014, has decided to scale back expansion plans for its OpenTable dining service. Q3 And Q4 Guide \nFollowing is a gist of Priceline’s third-quarter results : Pro forma EPS $31.18 versus Ascendiant estimate of $30.32, consensus of $29.32 and guidance of $28.30–$29.80. Revenue $3.69 billion versus Ascendiant estimate of $3.60 billion, consensus of $3.62 billion and guidance of $3.48–$3.63 billion. Gross bookings rose 25 percent to $18.5 billion, topping Ascendiant estimate of $17.6 billion and guidance of $16.8 billion–$17.6 billion. \nPriceline, which had another strong quarter with a strong summer travel season, saw 29 percent growth in room nights. \nFor the fourth quarter, the company guided pro forma EPS of $12.20 –12.80 and gross bookings growth of 16–21 percent. \n“We believe that guidance is conservative given its recent positive momentum (and beating its own guidance every quarter in 2013, 2014, 2015, and so far in 2016) and the overall positive travel industry,” analyst Edward Woo wrote in a note. Bottom Line \nThat said, Woo acknowledged that the growth rates should trend lower given Priceline’s scale and large F/X exposure. But, he noted that Priceline should carry forward its high growth and strong momentum, despite moderating, into 2017. \nAs such, the analyst raised his 2016 estimates for revenue to $10.77 billion from $10.54 billion, and for EPS to $68.70 from $68.17. \nShares of Priceline closed Monday’s trading at $1,480.33. In the pre-market hours Tuesday, the stock was up 4.71 percent to $1,550.00. Woo also hiked his price target to $1,700 from $1,600. Latest Ratings for PCLN",

      "text": "CVS Warns of Prescriptions Shift, Shares Tumble on Profit Warning -- Update November 08, 2016, 08:51:  By Paul Ziobro and Austen Hufford \nCVS Health Inc. warned that it stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as deals signed by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. with other participants in the drug supply chain shut out CVS stores. \nThe restricted networks caused the country's largest drugstore operator to temper its profit outlook for the rest of this year and next year, sending shares down 15% in premarket trading . \nBut another challenge is coming from the drugstore space, where competitors like Walgreens are joining to create networks that exclude CVS stores. \nUnder Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, Walgreens has been aggressively pursuing deals that makes its pharmacies part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount. It has had a number of wins too, including becoming the preferred pharmacy for United Healthcare Inc.'sOptumRx and for Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \nLast month, Walgreens signed a deal to become the preferred network for Tricare, the Defense Department's health care network, supplanting CVS Health. \nCVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said Tuesday that recent pharmacy network changes have caused some retail prescriptions to move out of its network in the latest quarter. He also cited slowing prescription growth in the market overall. The drug industry has recently shown signs that it is slowing the pace of price increases after years of hefty hikes, after pressure from politicians, consumers and employers. \nOn Tuesday, CVS lowered its financial targets. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $ 5.77 and $5.83, down from $5.81 to $5.89 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings per share of $5.85. For 2017 it expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.77 to $5.93. Analysts had expected $6.52. \nPharmacy-benefits managers, which include companies like Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health's Caremark, operate as middlemen between insurance companies, corporations that pay for health coverage, drugmakers, and pharmacies. They help process claims for prescriptions drugs while also negotiating with drugmakers and insurance companies over the price of medications. \nBy owning Caremark as well as thousands of drugstores, CVS Health has been able to closely align both businesses to encourage patients to fill their prescriptions somewhere within the CVS empire. For instance, under its Maintenance Choice program, patients can get 90-day prescriptions filled either through the pharmacy benefit program's mail order business or at CVS stores at the same lower price. \nThe Woonsocket, R.I.-based drugstore giant has increasingly relied on its pharmacy benefits management division for growth. In the latest quarter, CVS reported a profit of $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share, up from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, per-share profit rose to $1.64 from $1.28. \nRevenue increased 15% to $44.62 billion. \nAnalysts predicted $1.57 in adjusted earnings a share and $45.29 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. \nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com and Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com  160851ET  ",

Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts. The average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.57 per share. \nRevenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion in the period, but missed Street forecasts.

Analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.79. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. \nThe company announced Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs to streamline its operations. CVS Health employs more than 240,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. \nCVS Health Corp. runs the nation's second-largest drugstore chain and has more than 9,600 locations globally, counting the Target business. It also runs the second-largest pharmacy benefits management, or PBM, businesses. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions and handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies. \nIts shares fell $10.85, or 13 percent, to $72.64 in morning trading. CVS Health shares have dropped 26 percent in the last 12 months.",

      "text": "CVS Health Inc. ( CVS ) warned that it stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as deals signed by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. with other participants in the drug supply chain shut out CVS stores.\nContinue Reading Below\nThe restricted networks caused the country's largest drugstore operator to temper its profit outlook for the rest of this year and next year, sending shares down 15% in premarket trading.\nCVS Health shares have already fallen nearly 15% this year, as investors fretted over push back to rising drug prices. That trend has the potential to harm the company's large business that manages prescription drug plans, which negotiates prices paid by large employers and captures some of the rebates built into drug prices. CVS filled 1.03 billion prescriptions in 2015, the last full year available.\nBut another challenge is coming from the drugstore space, where competitors like Walgreens ( WBA ) are joining to create networks that exclude CVS stores.\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg Under Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, Walgreens has been aggressively pursuing deals that makes its pharmacies part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount. It has had a number of wins too, including becoming the preferred pharmacy for United Healthcare Inc.'s OptumRx and for Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.\nLast month, Walgreens signed a deal to become the preferred network for Tricare, the Defense Department's health care network, supplanting CVS Health.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales. \nBut its shares fell 13 percent in morning trading Tuesday as revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations and the company trimmed its outlook. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts. The average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.57 per share. \nRevenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion in the period, but missed Street forecasts. Twenty-two analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. Prescription claims volume was the key driver. The retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a long-term care facility unit that CVS bought in 2015. \nFor the current quarter ending in December, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.79. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. \nThe company announced Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs to streamline its operations. CVS Health employs more than 240,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. \nCVS Health Corp. runs the nation's second-largest drugstore chain and has more than 9,600 locations globally, counting the Target business. It also runs the second-largest pharmacy benefits management, or PBM, businesses. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions and handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies. \nIts shares fell $10.85, or 13 percent, to $72.64 in morning trading. CVS Health shares have dropped 26 percent in the last 12 months.",

      "text": "Stocks Open Lower; Priceline, Hertz, CVS Health Book Big Moves (Investor's Business Daily) \nMomo Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ: MOMO ) shares are trading lower by $2.10 (8.5 percent) at $24.62 in Tuesday's session. It has been a wild ride after announcing a Q3 beat of a dime with $27 million more in revenues. \nAfter a much higher open, it rallied another $0.20 to $28.36 before sharply reversing course. That marks a new all-time high for the issue, which debuted in December 2014 at $14.25. Its former all-time high was made in October at $27.00. \nProfit-takers have swarmed the issue as it has pierced Monday's low ($24.60), reaching $24.20, and is attempting to rebound. If the decline continues, there may be additional support at the pair of lows from November 3 ($22.84) and November 4 ($22.94).  ",

      "text": "Yahoo Finance is tracking the stocks you’re following, based on your Yahoo Finance ticker searches.\nCVS ( CVS ) – The company reported sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates and cut its profit outlook for the year. CVS says it expects to see slowing prescription growth in the market overall as fewer people fill their prescriptions.\nHertz Global Holdings ( HTZ ) – The stock is sinking after posting lower-than-expected third-quarter results and cutting its outlook for the year due to weakness in its car-rental business. Hertz reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 on revenue of $2.54 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.73 on revenue of $2.59 billion. The company separated its car rental and equipment rental businesses in June.\nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) – Citigroup ( C ) is turning more bearish on Goldman, downgrading the bank’s rating to neutral from buy. The investment firm cited the pricing in of higher rates and the risk of a possible surprise outcome in the US election as reasons for the downgrade.\nTesla ( TSLA ) – The electric car maker has acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering for an undisclosed amount. The German engineering firm specialized in automated manufacturing processes.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals ( VRX ) – The Canadian drug maker’s third-quarter sales dropped 11% as its non-GAAP earnings plunged 36%. Valeant’s quarterly adjusted profit of $1.55 per share missed analysts’ expectations, weighed down by faltering sales of some of its treatments. The company also cut its full-year profit and revenue forecasts.\nToyota ( TM ) – The Japanese automaker reported US passenger-car sales fell 9% in its recent quarter as its net profit fell 36% from a year earlier. Toyota’s sales were dragged down my American car buyer’s shift to buy trucks and Sport-utility vehicles.",

      "text": "With one bit of bad news, CVS Health has lost more than $12 billion of its stock market value.\nThe pharmacy benefits manager and drugstore chain’s shares fell 16% on Tuesday morning after it said recent moves by health insurers seeking to cut costs by limiting pharmacy choices would slam CVS Health. Those insurers are bringing their business to arch rival Walgreens, costing CVS a big chunk of its drug-filling business.\nCVS warned investors of a likely “loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions related to new restricted pharmacy networks,” the company said in its third-quarter earnings release. Last year, CVS filled or managed approximately 1 billion prescriptions, giving it 21.7% of the market and making it the biggest player.\nCVS’ prescription business has lost a lot of ground to Walgreens WBA of late: In September, CVS lost a contract to fill prescriptions through the Tricare pharmacy network. Tricare, the health care program with 9.7 million members made up of uniformed service members and their families, is owned by large Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which are restricting health plan enrollees to Walgreens as of Jan. 1.\nCVS also recently lost a contract with the fourth-largest U.S. PBM, Prime Therapeutics, which has 22 million members, to Walgreens.\n“Very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter,\" said CVS CEO Larry Merlo.\nThat combined with slowing growth in the overall U.S. prescriptions market led CVS Health, the No.7 company on the Fortune 500, to lower its profit forecast for 2017.\n \nCVS relies on filling prescriptions to bring people into its stores to also buy general merchandise like toothpaste. But dispensing drugs generates about 73% of its retail revenues, which came out to $50 billion in 2015. In the most recent quarter, same-store sales for general merchandise fell 1% as fewer people came into CVS stores. CVS’ Caremark business last year generated $100 billion and is the second largest PBM behind Express Scripts . esrx \nThe company now expects 2017 adjusted profit in the range of $5.77-$5.93 per share, below analysts’ estimate of $6.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.",

CVS cut its 2016 adjusted earnings forecast to $5.77 to $5.83 per share from its prior forecast of $5.81 to $5.89 per share. \nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $5.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nNet income attributable to CVS rose to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding items, CVS earned $1.64 per share. \nNet sales rose 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, helped by strong demand for its pharmacy benefit management services, but missed the average analysts' estimate of $45.29 billion.

      "text": "by Paul R. La Monica @lamonicabuzz November 8, 2016: 11:51 AM ET Target is selling its pharmacies to CVS CVS investors might need some medication for nausea. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager giant reported sales for the third quarter that missed forecasts. CVS ( CVS ) also warned that earnings for the fourth quarter and all of 2017 would be worse than expected. \nShares plunged nearly 15% on the news. \nThe biggest problem for CVS appears to be increased competition from rival Walgreens ( WBA ) , which now owns European pharmacy giant Boots and is also in the process of buying Rite Aid ( RAD ) . \nCVS said that it expects to lose more than 40 million prescriptions . \nRelated: Canada's top pharmacy chain prepares to sell medical marijuana \nCEO Larry Merlo said that some prescriptions have begun \"migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter\" and that the company is \"currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market.\" \nCVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark a few years ago, a deal that may be backfiring on the company. CVS may be alienating some companies who are worried about how much power it holds in the prescription drug business. \nWalgreens has sought to take advantage of those fears. It has partnered with Caremark rival Optum Rx, which is owned by insurance giant UnitedHealth ( UNH ) . \nWalgreens also has a strategic alliance with Prime Therapeutics, the mail order unit of more than a dozen Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \nAnother pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts ( ESRX ) , announced at the end of September that Walgreens will replace CVS as the drug store of choice for Tricare, a prescription plan that Express Scripts runs for members of the U.S. military. \nRelated: Target misses the mark, warns of weak sales ahead \nCVS is trying to diversify its business to deal with these competitive threats. The company has also bought Omnicare, a company that runs pharmacies for nursing homes. CVS also now runs in-store pharmacies at Target. ( TGT ) \nBut many analysts believe that CVS has paid too much attention to its pharmacy benefits and mail order businesses -- at the expense of improving its own stores. \nCVS said same-store sales at the front end of its pharmacies fell 1% in the quarter. The company blamed weak traffic. \nMeanwhile, Walgreens has won raves for investing more in the front end of the store, i.e. beauty care items, food, toys and other items. \n\"CVS is missing out on growth that could be easily attained by a slightly more imaginative approach to its front of store business,\" said Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, in a report. \n\"We continue to be disappointed that the group cannot see the front of house opportunity,\" he added. \nIt's a problem that CVS needs to quickly address before the problem gets worse. Customers aren't the only ones that are unhappy. Investors are annoyed too. The stock is now down more than 25% this year. CNNMoney (New York) First published November 8, 2016: 11:51 AM ET",

      "text": "CVS profit jumps, but revenue disappoints  34  34 AM \n  CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales. \nBut its shares fell 13 percent in morning trading Tuesday as revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations and the company trimmed its outlook. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nRevenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion in the period, but missed Street expectations for $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. Prescription claims volume was the key driver. The retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS bought Omnicare in 2015. \nFor the current quarter ending in December, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.79. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5.\nThe company announced Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs to streamline its operations. CVS Health employs more than 240,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates.\nCVS Health Corp. runs the nation's second-largest drugstore chain and has more than 9,600 locations globally, counting the Target business. It also runs the second-largest pharmacy benefits management, or PBM, businesses. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions and handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies. \nIts shares fell $10.46, or 12.5 percent, to $72.93 in late-morning trading.",

      "text": "CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales. \nBut its shares fell 13 percent in morning trading Tuesday as revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations and the company trimmed its outlook. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nRevenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion in the period, but missed Street expectations for $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. Prescription claims volume was the key driver. The retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS bought Omnicare in 2015. \nFor the current quarter ending in December, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.79. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. \nThe company announced Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs to streamline its operations. CVS Health employs more than 240,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. \nCVS Health Corp. runs the nation's second-largest drugstore chain and has more than 9,600 locations globally, counting the Target business. It also runs the second-largest pharmacy benefits management, or PBM, businesses. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions and handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies. \nIts shares fell $10.46, or 12.5 percent, to $72.93 in late-morning trading.",

CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the ... more Photo: Matt Rourke, AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock selloff. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. Its shares fell $9.36, or 11.3 percent, to $74 in midday trading, with shares six times normal volume already changing hands. The operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. Quarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. The bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. The retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. For the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. The company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. Meanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. The company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. CVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. The company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors. AP Business Writer Damian Troise in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "CVS isn't healthy -- stock plunges nearly 15% Drugstore chain facing increased competition Author: By Paul R. La Monica Published On: Nov 08 2016 10:52:44 AM CST Updated On: Nov 08 2016 11:28:43 AM CST \nCVS investors might need some medication for nausea. Related Content \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager giant reported sales for the third quarter that missed forecasts. CVS also warned that earnings for the fourth quarter and all of 2017 would be worse than expected. \nShares plunged nearly 15% on the news. \nThe biggest problem for CVS appears to be increased competition from rival Walgreens, which now owns European pharmacy giant Boots and is also in the process of buying Rite Aid. \nCVS said that it expects to lose more than 40 million prescriptions . \nCEO Larry Merlo said that some prescriptions have begun \"migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter\" and that the company is \"currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market.\" \nCVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark a few years ago, a deal that may be backfiring on the company. CVS may be alienating some companies who are worried about how much power it holds in the prescription drug business. \nWalgreens has sought to take advantage of those fears. It has partnered with Caremark rival Optum Rx, which is owned by insurance giant UnitedHealth. \nWalgreens also has a strategic alliance with Prime Therapeutics, the mail order unit of more than a dozen Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \nAnother pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts, announced at the end of September that Walgreens will replace CVS as the drug store of choice for Tricare, a prescription plan that Express Scripts runs for members of the U.S. military. \nCVS is trying to diversify its business to deal with these competitive threats. The company has also bought Omnicare, a company that runs pharmacies for nursing homes. CVS also now runs in-store pharmacies at Target. \nBut many analysts believe that CVS has paid too much attention to its pharmacy benefits and mail order businesses -- at the expense of improving its own stores. \nCVS said same-store sales at the front end of its pharmacies fell 1% in the quarter. The company blamed weak traffic. \nMeanwhile, Walgreens has won raves for investing more in the front end of the store, i.e. beauty care items, food, toys and other items. \n\"CVS is missing out on growth that could be easily attained by a slightly more imaginative approach to its front of store business,\" said Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, in a report. \n\"We continue to be disappointed that the group cannot see the front of house opportunity,\" he added. \nIt's a problem that CVS needs to quickly address before the problem gets worse. Customers aren't the only ones that are unhappy. Investors are annoyed too. The stock is now down more than 25% this year. \n ",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Shares of CVS Health ( CVS ) have dropped more than 10% today after beating earnings forecasts but offering disappointing guidance . Leerink’s David Larsen and Matt Dellelo have the details:\nGetty Images This morning CVS reported 3Q:16 earnings . While earnings in the quarter were solid, guidance was disappointing. Adjusted EPS of $1.64 came in ahead of Leerink/consensus of $1.55/$1.57, which includes a $0.05 tax benefit. While the quarter was good, 4Q:16 guidance of $1.64-$1.70 is below Leerink/consensus of $1.79/$1.75. CVS also provided preliminary 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.77-$5.93, which is well below Leerink/consensus of $6.60/$6.50. The lower than expected outlook is due to changes in the retail networking landscape, and soft volumes in the industry.\nWhile 3Q results were decent 4Q:16 guidance is disappointing and the preliminary outlook for 2017 is well below expectations. The midpoint of 2017E EPS guidance of $5.85 is well below consensus of $6.50. The reduced outlook is due to lighter volumes in the industry, and changes in retail contracting – we think driven by Walgreens Boots Alliance’s ( WBA ) new Tricare deal and its agreements with Optum, Prime and Envision.\nShares of CVS Health have tumbled 11% to$73.88 at 12:43 p.m. today, while Walgreens Boots Alliance has fallen 1.6% to $80.18.",

However, while revenue jumped 16% in the period to $44.62 billion, that total missed analysts' estimates.

      "title": "CVS Health (CVS) Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates, Cuts '16 View - November 8, 2016",
      "text": "CVS Health Corporation ( CVS - Free Report ) reported third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.64, up 28.1% year over year. The adjustment considers certain asset amortization, acquisition-related integration costs and the loss incurred on early extinguishment of debt.\nThe quarter‘s adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 by 4.5% and exceeded the company’s guided range of $1.55−$1.58.\nWithout the one-time adjustments, reported EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter increased 30% year over year to $1.43.\nCVS HEALTH CORP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nCVS HEALTH CORP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS HEALTH CORP Quote:\nQuarter in Details\nNet revenue in the third quarter increased 15.5% year over year to $44.6 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.3 billion. The upside was driven by balanced growth in the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments.\nPharmacy Services revenues increased 19.2% to $30.4 billion in the reported quarter on growth in the specialty pharmacy business and higher pharmacy network claims.\nPharmacy network claims processed during the quarter went up 23.3% to 282.6 million, backed by net new business growth. Moreover, the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings reached the Mail Choice processed claim count to 22.4 million, up 2.5%.\nRevenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC improved 12.5% year over year to $20.1 billion, primarily driven by the addition of long-term care (LTC) operations from the Omnicare acquisition, the inclusion of pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation which was taken over in Dec 2015 and pharmacy same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved 2.3%, while front-end same-store sales were down 1% year over year.\nFront-end same-store sales were impacted by soft customer traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in basket size.\nPharmacy same-store sales increased 3.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. Moreover, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes rose 3% on a 30-day equivalent basis.\nThe generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) soared 160 bps to 85.4% at the Pharmacy Services segment and 100 bps to 85.8% at the Retail/LTC segment.\nAlthough gross profit rose 12.4% to $7.4 billion, gross margin contracted 44 bps to 16.7%. Total operating margin during the quarter expanded 28 bps to 6.3% despite a 7.9% increase in operating costs.\nCVS Health exited the third quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.26 billion, compared with $1.21 billion at the end of the second quarter. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.94 billion, up 64.1% from the year-ago period.\nDuring the third quarter, CVS Health opened 48 new retail stores and closed 10. Further, the company relocated 11 retail stores. As of Sep 30, 2016, CVS operated 9,694 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.\n2016 Guidance Updated\nCVS Health has lowered its full-year 2016 earnings expectations. The company currently expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.77–$5.83 (earlier expectation $5.81–$5.89). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $5.86 for 2016, above the projected range.\nThe company however raised its cash flow guidance for 2016. It currently expects to free cash flow of $6.8–$7.0 billion ($6.3–$6.6 billion) and cash flow from operations of $9.3–$9.5 billion ($8.8–$9.1 billion) for 2016.\nCVS Health has also issued its fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted EPS projection. The company forecasts adjusted EPS in the range of $1.64−$1.70. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 is above the guided range.\nPreliminary 2017 Outlook\nThe company has issued its full-year 2017 preliminary outlook. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of $5.77–$5.93. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.53 is above the guided range.\nOur Take\nCVS Health posted mixed third-quarter results with adjusted EPS beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missed the mark. It is also disappointing to see the narrowed guidance which indicates the absence of any near-term catalyst. Nonetheless, year-over-year growth remained impressive with the Pharmacy Services segment benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy and the Retail Pharmacy segments.\nWe take note of the recently completed Omnicare and Target Pharmacy acquisitions, which are currently undergoing the integration process. According to the company, both the acquisitions are strategic fits. CVS Health expects to benefit with multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare and Target in both the near and long term.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nCVS Health currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked medical stocks are GW Pharmaceuticals plc ( GWPH - Free Report ) , Baxter International Inc. ( BAX - Free Report ) and Bovie Medical Corp. ( BVX - Free Report ) . GW Pharmaceuticals and Baxter sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Bovie Medical carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nGW Pharmaceuticals surged 71.6% year to date compared to the S&P 500’s 4.3% over the same period. The company has a four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 41.6%.\nBaxter International rallied 26.5% in the past one year, comparing favorably with the S&P 500’s 2.6%. It has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 27%.\nBovie Medical recorded a 153.5% gain in the past one year, way better than the S&P 500’s 2.6%. The company has a trailing four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 28.7%.\nConfidential from Zacks\nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "CVS Health Rx Exodus Takes Its Toll (CVS, ESRX) By Alan Farley | November 8, 2016 — 11:29 AM EST \nRetail chain CVS Health Corp. ( CVS ) got pummeled in Tuesday’s pre-market, dropping more than 13% after missing third-quarter revenue estimates and lowering guidance for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The drug giant cited a retail prescription exodus that could top 40 million scripts in reaction to recent changes in the pharmacy network marketplace . The decline is set to drop the $90-billion powerhouse to a multi-year low. \nCVS’s shortfall may stem from a controversial drug exclusion list released in August, listing 29 high-priced formularies it would not cover under its 2017 pharmacy benefit plan. In contrast, rival Express Scripts Holding Co. ( ESRX ) excluded just five drugs for 2017, suggesting that startled members aggressively sought out alternatives and found new plans with relative ease. If so, the company may have undermined several years of growth, sounding alarms for current shareholders. \nCVS Long-term Chart (1993-2016) \nThe stock struggled in the first half of the 1990s, caught in a downtrend that reached an 8-year low in the single digits in January 1996. It then entered a new uptrend, gaining ground at a steady pace into the 1999 high at $29.19. The subsequent trading range broke support in the mid-teens after the September 11 attacks, with the decline finally coming to rest at $11.16 in 2003. \nIt took two years for the subsequent bounce to reach resistance at the millennial highs and another year for a breakout to unfold. That uptick failed to catch fire into 2008, stalling just 11-points above the prior peak, ahead of a steady decline during the economic collapse. The stock posted the third higher low in 12-years and turned higher into the new decade, with bears taking control once again and ending the recovery well-below the 2008 high. \nA 2012 breakout finally attracted strong buying interest, lifting price in a graceful uptrend that culminated at $113.58 in August 2015. The bottom dropped out a few weeks later during the mini flash crash, with a rapid descent into the low 80s followed by a lower high in October. An attempt to mount that resistance level in May 2016 failed, attracting competitive selling pressure and a low motion decline that dropped price into a test of last year’s low near $80, just ahead of this week’s earning shock. \nCVS Short-Term Chart (2014-2016) \nThe August 2015 plunge extended a trading range that contained price action for more than 14 months ahead of Tuesday morning’s violent selloff, with the stock set to open the regular session in the low 70s. This marks a classic double top breakdown that signals the start of a secular downtrend lasting for months or years. The decline is also set to break the 200-week EMA, which has offered support since 2011. There are few obvious support levels until the .618 Fibonacci rally retracement at 58, so that marks a logical downside target. \nOn Balance Volume (OBV) peaked with price in the second half of 2015 and turned lower in a steady distribution wave that quickly undercut the August 2015 low. The May bounce failed to staunch the technical bleeding, with the indicator continuing to post new lows into this week’s report. The highly bearish volume pattern confirms that smart money has been exiting the stock for months, getting out of the way of the new downtrend. The Bottom Line \nCVS is set to break two-year support at $80 on Tuesday, after a poorly received earnings report raised major doubts about growth metrics after a controversial 2017 pharmacy benefit plan triggered a member exodus. As we’ve learned with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG ) and other companies that made bad business decisions, it can be very hard to rebuild loyalty and get back lost customers.

LLC Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CVS Health Third Quarter Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, November 8, 2016. I'd now like to turn the call over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp. Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. We want to leave as much time as possible for questions today. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask a question. We have a lot to cover this morning, and we plan to make only brief remarks about the third quarter, so we can spend the majority of our time talking about our guidance for the remainder of this year, our 2017 preliminary outlook, and our longer term targets. You can find all the usual details of the quarter on the slides we posted on our website just before the call. We also filed our Form 10-Q this morning, and it's available on our website as well. I have one quick reminder, Annual Analyst Day is scheduled for Thursday, December 15 in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who'll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. The meeting will be webcast for those unable to attend in person. In addition, note that during today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year. And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Okay. Thank you Nancy and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short-term, and most important our plans to address these issues, so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. You can find the detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call. So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail/Long Term Care segment. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4. Our results in the third quarter also include another penny related to below the line items. So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range. The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations, mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail/Long Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations. Retail same store sales grew 2.3%, with Pharmacy comps up 3.4%, and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. However, our retail pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target, along with core CVS share growth. In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins, as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash during the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders. Now, let me address what has changed in the marketplace, and the near-term implications for our business. As you know, there have been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM, and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the healthcare industry. None of those are significant factors, in our view, of the current marketplace, or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year, and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this. Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk, beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense, TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS Pharmacies entirely out of those networks. In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis. The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1, and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected, fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider. Now, as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts, and as a result, we will de-lever, as a result of, losing more than 40 million prescriptions. And as we stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short-term. Now, I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for 2017, and our longer-term outlook, and then I'll be back to provide a high level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes, and reaccelerating our growth. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Thank you Larry, and good morning to everyone. I'll start today with our revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We've effectively lowered the midpoint by $0.05 per share compared to our prior range of $5.81 to $5.89 per share. This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including the slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business which is affecting both the Pharmacy as well as the front store. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration costs in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year end. Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call. So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. But let me take a moment to point out a few items. For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14% driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at Retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75%, and adjusted script comps are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM. The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year, so we want to provide you some early clarity on our outlook for 2017 today. In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share, with results contracting a 0.5% to up 2.5%. It will be a tale of two parts. Our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth, while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in Retail EBIT of about 8%. As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season, with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%. Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline. Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year, and our SilverScript's business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year. In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics, and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target. We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there is still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market. In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales, and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now. First, the combination. All the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are causing a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year. Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS Pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed. We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits. And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share, and therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective. As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. To that end, our Board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buy-backs. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases. In addition to providing our preliminary outlook for 2017, I wanted to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. Back in December of 2013, we provided our five-year financial targets which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with the compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016. Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10% while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth should generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average. And again, we will provide more details at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well-positioned in the healthcare marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets. And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, thanks, Dave. Well, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection. We have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan. First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match, so we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the healthcare market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS Pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice. Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs, such as Maintenance Choice, and while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care: new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption. Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies. And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth. So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model, and our ability to drive long-term growth. You know, we've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the healthcare market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients, but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions. Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners, and we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month. So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks very much for the detail, and good morning. Larry, I just want to better understand competitively what's happening on the retail side of the business. So you talked about Walgreens and their new relationship with Prime and Department of Defense, but yet said these 90-day programs not really having much of an impact. Can – one, can I just better understand the make-up of the 40 million prescriptions you're talking about? Is that just Prime and Department of Defense? Or is there some assumption around these 90-day programs? Or any other restrictions around network? And then secondly, can you maybe just give us a better understanding of what the opportunities are in your own Caremark book of business to try to replace some of this volume over time? I know you've talked in the past that especially with health plan business, it takes time to work these programs in. But is that an incremental opportunity over the next couple of years of hey, you know what, they might be taking away some market share from others, but we've got this really big business that we've won over the last few years and we can pull it into our own store? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Lisa. It's Larry. Let me start, and then I'm sure others will jump in here. Lisa, if you go back to the 40 million scripts that we talked about, and if you looked at the make-up of that, it's probably about 40%; 40% of that 40 million is the TRICARE impact, and then the Prime impact, and the balance of that is just the normal churn that takes place in any particular selling season. So it's really a function of the restricting of those networks. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Lisa, this is Dave. Just to be clear, this is not necessarily a 90-day offering; these are restricted networks which takes CVS fully out of the network offerings. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC No. I understand that. I understand that, but I'm just saying that I think you made the comment that that's specific to this, but you're not really seeing any shift in the 90-day. Is there the risk, Dave, that we do start to see some of these 90-day programs pick up, and so it would be more than 40 million scripts that need to come out next year? That's what I was trying to get at. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Lisa, I think we've contemplated that into our outlook for 2017. As you know, when we sell in a 90-day network with co-pay incentives, either into our book or somebody sells it into their book, there is movement of scripts, and that's contemplated in our script forecast for next year. So those are fully contemplated. And then... Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then what about on the other side, though? Like, for your own book of business, do you see an opportunity? I just look at how much business you've won in the last few years. Is there that opportunity to start pulling more of that into your store, maybe not in 2017, but beyond 2017? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Lisa, listen, we think that we compete very effectively on price, and our network strategies are a critical part of that value proposition. We always offer our clients a variety of network options to meet their specific needs of their members, and certainly, the results prove out that CVS Pharmacy drives better outcomes and better overall performance as a result of our integrated model. And we look to aggressively sell that to our clients to help them achieve better outcomes and lower overall costs. And at the end of the day, we have multiple network options, and the choice is up to our clients. We have continued to see steady progress, alluding to the new business that we picked up over the last couple of years, especially last year as we've talked about it, it is a longer tail, if you will, on the health plan side of the business than the employer side, but we've seen steady progress there, and there's certainly more opportunity that remains. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Thanks, Lisa. Our next question is from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC So, guys, if you think about that 10% growth rate long-term, that would sort of suggest I think mid-single digit EBIT growth. Is it fair to think the PBM would grow faster than Retail? And any thought on where you think Retail can grow? I assume you would think after 2017 you would be back to gaining share and leveraging the Retail business. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, John, it's Dave. Obviously, we do expect to return to healthy growth in 2018 and beyond. And yes, I think if you look at our long-term growth rate at approximately 10%, the company generates a significant amount of cash. That cash can be effectively utilized to return value to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases, which if you look at the past practices, we've delivered somewhere between 4% to 5% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth just from the cash that we generate out of the business, which is significant. Obviously, we do believe that the underlying business organically is going to be able to grow healthy. We don't really provide guidance by segment because our businesses are really integrated today, but we do expect to return to that healthy growth outlook in 2018 and beyond. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. And, John, and keep in mind, to Dave's last point, we've got – as you look at our model, some of the dispensing channels that may fall traditionally under the Retail umbrella in other businesses like specialty or mail, that's flowing through the PBM segment in our reporting. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC And when you – do you think when you think about restrictive networks and your approach to them, do you think about that a little bit differently going forward, or pretty much the same as you had? And you talked about sort of going after enterprise-wide cost reduction. Does that tie-in at all to how you think about attacking restrictive networks? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, John, listen, in the environment in which we're all operating, being the most efficient and productive, that continues to be a key guiding principle, if you will. And we've done a number of things over the years. We have historically been a very efficient and productive provider when you look at our cost metrics, and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, leveraging many of the investments that we've made in technology over the last few years, we have another opportunity to do that. And again, as Dave mentioned, we'll outline the details around that at Analyst Day. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Thanks, John. Our next question is from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just – I have to imagine the Retail network rates needed to shift this level of share away from CVS, it'd obviously have to be pretty meaningful. Can you guys give us any sense of the discounts that you've seen offered in the marketplace to exclude CVS Pharmacies? And then I guess as it relates specifically to the Prime example, were you given the opportunity to match the pricing that was offered to create these restrictive networks? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Bob, this is Dave. Maybe I'll start with that. I think what was interesting about these couple of market moves is that typically we see a pretty competitively bid process. These major network changes quite honestly happened without a chance for us to actively engage and really tell our value proposition as these changes were contemplated in both Prime and with TRICARE. So from that perspective, we were kind of caught a little bit off guard. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understood. And then I guess just looking at the math for 2017, it seems like the majority of the kind of below long-term EPS growth is really from this share shift, these 40 million scripts you guys highlighted, but you did then put out the long-term expectation for 10% growth. Given that there does seem to be this price for volume trade-off occurring in the marketplace, how can you get comfortable that we really kind of see the end of this, or more of a stabilization of this as we move beyond 2017? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. I think a little bit around that, if you look at the – some of the competitive pressures that we're seeing right now are not necessarily new. We face reimbursement pressures and network changes on an ongoing basis. And you think about it the way we've offset it really is three ways. One's, we've lowered our cost of goods sold, and our Red Oak joint venture is a great example of that. We've improved the efficiency, and we're continuing to launch a new program this year to further improve the efficiency across our network. And then finally, we've been able to increase the capture of dispensing share into one of our channels. Obviously, in 2017 that lever is not really available to us. But I do think, if you look at how we're positioned in the marketplace, and our ability to plug in and really add a lot of value to the payers, that we serve, I think we're really nicely positioned in a world of which networks begin to narrow and outcomes become more important. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. And, Bob, it's Larry. Just a couple of other additional points. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the point about CVS Pharmacy's ability to provide incremental offerings, leveraging the assets that emanate out of CVS Pharmacy besides simply dispensing, I think that becomes an important component of the story, recognizing the cost savings opportunities that result from MinuteClinic or infusion, as it relates to site of care management, and now long-term care pharmacy. And we believe that we can enhance our value with other PBMs, okay, not just Caremark in making those services available that will be very much aligned with their clients in an effort to provide high quality, and at the same time, lower costs. So we believe we can be a partner of choice as we go forward. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Make sense. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Thanks, Bob. Our next question is from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to look at the PBM side a little bit from this angle. I guess, Larry, can you talk about what you're seeing in the PBM selling season as it relates to pricing, and what I'm wondering is had Walgreens pharmacies PBM competitors, ESI, Optum (33:07) Prime with lower network rates that are going to pressure you on that side of the business as well, and make it harder to retain the PBM business? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, George, it's Larry. I'll start. Others may want to jump in. As we've said for probably the last couple of years now, pricing certainly is competitive, but we've seen it remain rational in the marketplace. We haven't seen anything on the horizon that changes our view of that, and we're beginning the 2018 selling season, as we speak. So obviously we'll be talking more about that as we get into the new year, but it seems to be lining up very consistent with prior years. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up with Dave, I guess, anything you can give us to make us more comfortable with that medium-term earnings growth profile of 10%, given that these issues in retail are likely to persist because these market share gains and these pricings and these multi-year contracts, it's going to be hard to turn in one year or even two years maybe. How do we think about the mix of operating earnings growth versus capital deployment, just how do we get to the 10%? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. We'll talk, I'm sure, a little bit more about that in December, but I will go back to say if you look at our past track record, if you look at our ability to gain share both from a PBM perspective and then turning that share into dispensing channel, share gain in our network, we've been quite productive at doing that, and I think the outlook for that remains strong. Keep in mind we still have a very robust specialty business. It continues to perform well. We have a very large Medicare Part D business that is performing quite well, and we've done two fairly sizable acquisitions in the form of Omnicare and Target, both while are not being as accretive as we once thought, as we cycle into 2017, but as we look long-term have a real opportunity for us to grow and develop that business in a meaningful way. And again, and finally, not to put this – to minimize this, if you look at the cash that our organization throws off, we can get a substantial amount of accretion just from the share buy-back program as you look at deploying that capital in a very effective way, keeping in mind, we might also deploy that capital from a strategic lens to make sure that we bolt on the right businesses to enhance the infrastructure that we have today. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thanks, guys, I appreciate the color. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. You're welcome. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Thanks, George. Our next question is from the line of Eric Percher from Barclays. Please proceed. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Another question related to the profitability of the 40 million scripts, and maybe I'll come at it this way; if you haven't seen the unexpected or kind of non-competitively bid pieces move away, would your earnings growth have been within shouting distance of the 10% guidance that you're providing? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Eric, the – as you think about the answer to that, it brings us back to – going – I guess it would've been 2012/2013 when Walgreens and Express had a dispute, and certainly, many capitalized on that in the marketplace. And if you looked at the profitability associated with those incremental scripts at that point in time, it parallels what we talked about this morning, extracting from that the advertising and labor investments that we made in an effort to gain a disproportionate number of those scripts. So again, factoring that in, we certainly would have been within striking distance of that 10% target that Dave outlined. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Eric, just keep in mind, too, that if you look at the, as we cycle into 2017, there were really three, I guess, topics that I outlined that were headwinds. One is obviously the loss of prescriptions in the marketplace. Two is slightly less accretion in the two acquisitions. And third, I'll say the competitive reimbursement pressures and the mix in our business. All three of those contribute to our slower growth or lack of growth in 2017. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. That's helpful. And on the third one, if we look at the PDP performance, it looks like this quarter it was in line with what you expected. We see fewer preferred relationships next year. Can you speak to the way in which that may be impacting the next year, kind of the outlook on PDP? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, we have, I think, a very nice growth plan for 2017 in SilverScripts. Our PDP business continues to take share and perform well, both this year, and we expect the same next year. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. And, Eric, obviously, we're in the annual enrollment period, so it's open for another month, and from early indications, we've gotten off to a good start. And obviously, we'll provide a recap once the season closes, and we'll probably talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day. Eric, on the Retail side, I'm not sure if your question was really looking at SilverScript or CVS Pharmacy's presence in the Medicare Part D networks. It would be on par with our various relationships this year, absent some of the changes that took place in the Prime sponsored Med D network. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. That's helpful. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Partners. Please proceed. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC Hey. Can you talk about the timing of these retail network contracts? Like, how long do they last for? And are there any other sort of large, I guess, PBM contracts on the retail side that are up that wouldn't (39:16) perhaps enable you to win all or some of that business back over the next year or two? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, David, as you look at the retail contracting cycles, they are probably, I would describe them as more frequent than they once were, acknowledging that the Medicare space is an annual cycle. And some of this gets back to, in our prepared remarks, our plan to respond to these marketplace changes, the opportunity that we see us having with other PBMs, recognizing our goal of providing more bundled services. So we have – today we have contracts with – retail contracts with all the PBMs, and we'll be working with those goals and objectives in mind that we outlined, again, in our prepared remarks, to enhance our offerings with them. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC Okay. That's great. And then in terms of like drug pricing, like, let's say, there's been a deceleration of brand inflation, there's generic deflation. Has that had any impact on your 2017 guidance, or not? And then is there any update to the net new wins for the PBM and also your retention rate? Thanks. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, David, this is Dave. I think from an inflation standpoint, no real material change to our outlook in both branded and generic, and that is not presenting either a headwind or a tailwind as we cycle into 2017. So that's not really a factor in all the prepared remarks that we just talked about. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. And, David, in terms of the update on the selling season, I believe we have a slide in there. It's pretty much on par with what we reported on the second quarter call. The net business is slightly lower, reflecting some of the changes that you've seen in terms of some of our health plan partners exiting the exchange business, and – but it's not really material. And our retention rate remains right around 97%. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC Thank you. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Next question? Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question; hopefully I can articulate it well. But I guess I'm kind of going back to Lisa's question and some of the questions earlier in the call. I'm trying to understand why your vertical model appears to have lost some steam in the marketplace compared to what Walgreens is doing with some of their partnerships, and why those partnerships seem to be having more success on restricted networks, at least right now, and more success on the 90-day retail? It's our understanding Texas is going to have a 90-day retail component in that contract. Is Walgreens and the health care plan attached to a PBM cost advantage to you guys when you look at it with your PBM retail model attached to a health plan? I'm just trying to understand if the model – where the model stands and how you guys are viewing that? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Scott, let me – there's probably a couple questions in there, and let me start, and then I'll ask others to jump in. That first of all, from an integrated model perspective, Scott, I don't believe that we have lost any steam whatsoever, okay? As you heard Dave mentioned in our prepared remarks, Caremark once again had another very successful selling season, despite some of the publicized losses that occurred back in the spring timeframe, with net new business well over $4 billion, compounding prior successful selling seasons. And as we talked, we continue to grow enterprise dispensing share. Obviously, for the reasons that we mentioned earlier, not enough share growth to offset the 40 million script headwind, but we continue to make progress. And back to Lisa's question, we continue to see opportunities beyond that. In your question, Scott, around is Walgreens making some headwind here, listen, we can hypothesize that there may be a perception out there that CVS Pharmacy is not a neutral platform, okay? And by the way, that's reflected in our response to this environment and our efforts to demonstrate that we are the best partner to all PBMs and health plans, given our unique suite of capabilities along with our track record of delivering results. So – and I think we're all very confident that that will make a difference. And obviously, as you've heard us say many times, we believe that we have the right assets in terms of the healthcare environment moving forward. I'm not talking about 2017 now, recognizing this retailization of healthcare and the role that the consumer will play and the migration from a fee-for-service system to one that's more value-based, acknowledging that that migration has been slower than what everyone would like to see, but it is happening. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC All right. That was it for me. Thanks, Larry, for the answer. Operator Our next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Please proceed. Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Dave, just given some of the moving pieces that we have over the short-term, and then given your moderation in terms of EPS growth over the medium-term, how should we think about your balance sheet usage? Leverage target? Ratings target? Was hoping to get your thoughts on that since we didn't hear that in your prepared remarks. Thank you. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Sure. We're very committed to maintaining our high BBB rating. We're still very committed to returning to the 2.7 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. As you heard as our cash flow performance this year has been quite strong, we're going to probably de-lever a bit more this year than we thought we were going to in our original plan, given that strong cash flow performance. As we cycle into 2017, kind of given all the moving parts and I'll say the headwinds that we have, our leverage will probably, year-over-year, our leverage will be essentially constant. We will not deleverage as we cycle into 2017. We will work to get back down to that leverage target in a reasonable amount of time. Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. That's very helpful. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks for the question. Larry, do you see this as more of a response to your verticalization of the industry in terms of the industry becoming more vertical? Or do you see this as the start of a price war from Walgreens trying to take more share and fixing their pharmacy counter? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Peter. Listen. There's certainly been competitive pressures; that's nothing new to the healthcare environment. As you've heard us talk many times, we've experienced them for several years now in both Retail and PBM segments. We have several ways in which we manage against those reimbursement pressures, whether it's lowering our cost of goods. And we've gotten some nice synergies from the Red Oak model, and that team continues to work to bring even more innovation. As we talk, continuing to be the most efficient and productive provider of care and then growing our share. And unfortunately, that third lever of growing share will not happen in 2017. And again, as we've been talking this morning, we have a response plan to the market dynamics and a plan to reaccelerate our growth there. So that's how we see the marketplace. And probably not changing beyond that dynamic anytime soon. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC So just as a follow-up, do you see yourself then responding to this by trying to lower price to re-win some of those customers that went away from you, or get into those networks again? Or do you see them as vertical networks that have been separated away from you? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Peter, again, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, I don't want to be redundant, but we're very confident that in responding to these market dynamics, the ability to enhance the CVS Pharmacy value proposition and include other services that have been proven to drive down costs, we believe will be appealing for PBMs, because it's very much aligned with the goals for their clients. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Please proceed. Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that. Just unclear. Beyond TRICARE and Prime, are you seeing the differentiation of your model, your integrated offering? Is that weighing less on the decision of payers? Or are they just more motivated by price at this point? And do you need to consider lowering your threshold on margins? Or are you sticking with your plan? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Alvin, this is Dave. I think our value proposition continues to resonate in the marketplace, both from the PBM perspective and a Retail perspective. A couple of network changes obviously went the other way on us here. But I do believe that the power of our integrated model and the things that we can offer to payers when we're not the PBM or the things that we can offer to the ultimate payer when we are the PBM, really still quite relevant in the marketplace. It's getting a lot of traction, and we continue to perform well from that perspective. And we think the outlook beyond 2017 as we get into 2018 and the years out, I think is quite strong. Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Great. And just my follow-up, I don't know if you're planning on providing color on sales longer term relative to the 13% target. I know that the losses are probably impacting that, so I'm wondering if you could give any more color on that. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. We'll probably give a little bit more color on Analyst Day, but I expect to walk through the model at a macro level as I've done in prior years and make sure everybody understands our growth algorithm. Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. You're welcome. Our next question is from the line of Mohan Naidu from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Thank you so much for taking my questions. Larry, you talked about you're giving your clients option of various network coverages. Can you talk about what portion of your business has restrictive networks that were CVS exclusive? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. You know what, we have not provided it as a percentage. We've talked about the number of clients and members and Maintenance Choice, and I believe that number is now over 23 million lives, and that is – Maintenance Choice will constitute our most restrictive network. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Okay. Got it. Maybe if I can – one quick follow-up for Dave. So Dave, you're talking about the 40 million scripts for next year, and that includes the TRICARE and Walgreens. How much of that is unknown that you have baked in for further changes as you go into 2017? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. I think as we said here for 2017, we have a pretty good handle on, I'd say, network changes. Keep in mind, most network changes happen kind of in late Q3, early Q4 as you cycle into next year. So we have a pretty good line of sight to our network participation and volume outlook as a network participant as we cycle into 2017. So I think we're pretty good there. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. You're welcome. Our next question is from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please proceed. James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. It's James Auh for Charles. So my question is, so you mentioned that you plan to infuse new PBM product in the future to drive growth. What kind of solutions can we expect? One of your competitors is taking a risk on price with inflation protection. Do you plan to provide a similar solution? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Jim, we have that today in our offerings where we have price protection for our clients. In our prepared remarks, we talked about the four areas of new product innovation around clinical solutions, new value-based contracting approaches, both in specialty and traditional pharmacy, and then a new retail network strategies that would include performance-based networks. We have that a little bit today in Medicare Part D, but we see an opportunity to go further with that to be very much aligned with value-based reimbursement and outcomes management. And then a new generation of Maintenance Choice, so again we'll provide a lot more details next month at Analyst Day but that's how we're thinking about it. And by the way, there are elements of risk that we take today, whether it's in Medicare or some aspects of what we do with NovoLogix in terms of managing that portion of pharmacy flowing through the medical benefit. James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC Also, how much capital deployment is assumed in the preliminary 2017 guidance? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. We have $5 billion in share repurchase is within that guidance range, and we'll talk more about the dividend on Analyst Day. But we do expect over time that we will be deploying – raising our dividend up to our 35% payout ratio by 2018. That expectation is still consistent with our thoughts. James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC All right. Great. Thank you. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. You're welcome. Our next question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Good morning. Two questions here. First one, obviously it seems that growth on the PBM side is going to be key to achieving the 10% long-term earnings growth. So can you just give us some context in how much business you have up for renewal, how much PBM business you have up for renewal for next year, i.e., for the 2017/2018 selling season? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Ricky, it's Larry. We've got $22 billion to $24 billion up for renewal. Keep in mind that that's off a much higher denominator. So as a percentage, it would be pretty much on par with prior years. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And... David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Ricky, I would also – I would just add that I think it was probably important to step back, and you talked about the PBM being the growth engine, and while it is, we need to really think about the enterprise. Our business is so integrated now that you need to really look at it in totality from that perspective. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And then, Larry, in response to one of the questions, you really talked about the fact that you think that you have all the assets that you need in your portfolio to succeed longer-term. In all honesty (55:44) health plans are key to longer-term success as we see the Optum-United model developing further. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about that managed care model partnership versus ownership, and obviously, Anthem talked last week about putting an RFP out early next year. So how important do you feel an Anthem-like contract for your long-term strategy? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Ricky, it's Larry. As you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs. And as you think about the healthcare business broadly or health plan business broadly, today we have over 70 health plan relationships with the PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business, and there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list as we've done the last couple of years. I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of, does the health plan in-source their pharmacy PBM functionality, or do they outsource it? And we continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season, where I think everyone was trying to figure out that, well, wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is that the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business. Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have, recognizing the assets that we have assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans, whether we're the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration. But there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And lastly, one last question. You talked about Target and Omnicare and the integration there. Can you maybe give us some more specific color on what's holding back Target and Omnicare from meeting your near-term accretion expectations? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Ricky, maybe I'll take Omnicare and ask Helena to comment on Target. With Omnicare, Ricky, it's certainly not a question of if, it's more a question of when. And one of the things that we learned this past year through our pilots in the assisted living space is that we found that we had to target both the needs of the residents in those facilities along with the facility operator needs. And in doing that, we need to make some additional and incremental technology investments. Those investments are underway, and they really need to be completed for us to broadly sell the value proposition that we can bring to the assisted living space. So we'll be getting that work done in 2017 and I'm confident that we'll capitalize on the synergies once that work's complete. Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, and I would say we're actually very happy with Target. As we discussed earlier in the year, the integration certainly led to some disruption which we expected. We've been through a lot of integration and we're on track to achieve the performance we were looking for this year. The most exciting thing I would say is that the Target team has responded in a tremendous way to the new systems and programs that we've delivered to them. So the service levels in those pharmacies are quite strong. We're seeing them come out of the integrations and the system changes at a very strong pace. And what we're starting to do now is turn on our patient care programs which CVS historically had and Target did not. And given their ability to execute and how well they've done all year, we're actually feeling quite confident that they'll be able to do that well into 2017. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Okay. Thanks, Ricky. Our next question is from the line of Michael Cherny from UBS. Please proceed. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details. So I want to dive in a little bit on, the question came up about the assets that you have in place. You obviously spent a lot of time about focusing on the enterprise approach and drive incremental services in the business. As you think more broadly about those services, and this can be obviously a thought process on organic versus inorganic. And maybe using, for example, MinuteClinic and acute care as an option. What's the most sense to bundle in, outside of specialty, or are you doing relative to the acute care base that you are ready touch? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Mike, I don't think there's one answer to that question. And I think that the benefit that we have is that, we have a series of assets that we can bundle in a whole variety of ways that would meet the needs of that particular client and their members. And so I actually think that will be an advantage to us. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC Okay. That's all I have for now. Thank you. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Good morning. I guess just with TRICARE obviously as a government contract, and then Prime Therapeutics as sort of a different type of entity tied to Blue's plans. Just curious if you see differences in appetite for restricted pharmacy networks among different customer types in the market. And I guess, just when thinking about government, versus commercial employers, versus health plan customers. Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Steven, this is Jon Roberts. With the employer clients, we clearly have seen a big appetite to restrict networks, narrow networks, so Maintenance Choice with 23 million members has been very successful. When you move over to health plans, you've seen a big appetite in Medicare with preferred networks, most preferred networks. Most Part D plans have preferred networks. In Managed Medicaid we see many of those plans willing to restrict networks. I think where there has been a reluctance historically has been in the fully-insured market, and I think with Prime making a move to narrow their network in fully-insured that may be a catalyst for the rest of the market. So we view that as an opportunity. And I think with the government programs it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We see some willing to move into either restricted or Maintenance Choice networks and others like full access. So different parts of our client base really do have different priorities and willingness to narrow or restrict networks. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. So there are some changes in the market, maybe some growing appetite. But maybe just to confirm again, (1:04:13) a bunch of different ways, but do you characterize these most recent changes as rational competition? Just to try to confirm that. Just given how some of these stocks are reacting today. I think people are worried about irrational pricing. But just would you characterize these (1:04:28) changes as rational competition? Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Well, Steve, I would say as we've talked many times, whether it's on the PBM or Retail side, we've continued to see margin compression. And I would say that we have not seen anything that we would put under the heading of irrational. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. And I guess I would – this is Dave. I guess I would just look at the Prime decision. And it appears to us (1:05:04) a little bit of an observer here is that Walgreens acquired their specialty pharmacy and their mail order pharmacy or at least partnered with them from that perspective. And I'm assuming that as part of the arrangement, there was some network participation agreement that was confirmed through Prime. So I think that might be a little bit of a unique animal compared to other network changes in the marketplace. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. And, Steve, again I think Dave mentioned this in response to one of the earlier questions that in the two cases that we've talked a fair amount this morning, we became aware of the network changes after the fact and were not given the opportunity to respond. So in an irrational pricing environment, you would not – you would expect a different type of process associated with that. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Okay. We'll take two more questions, please. Operator Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Thanks. In terms of the updated long-term growth target, Dave, I understood some of the measures that you outlined, the size of the company. But curious if there's anything that you could help us with today in terms of different assumptions; if this is a different rate of you gaining share. If this is a different rate of underlying market growth, or an assumption that's different about profitability opportunities. Just curious if you could give us a little bit more color behind what's different with the long-term growth rate going forward. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yeah, Eric, obviously as I said, we're jumping off a lot bigger base at this point in time given where we were in 2013 as we've grown the company substantially. This is probably a deeper conversation that we probably have time for on the call today, but it was something that we'll talk about more at Analyst Day. I will say though that if you just look broadly, I don't believe the fundamentals of our growth algorithm has substantially changed. Obviously, the marketplace has moved a bit and there's been different offerings in the marketplace. But I think our ability to compete in the market hasn't changed in a substantial fashion. And we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown, and they continue to be a growth area. Whereas the employer book has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time. And again, I think we're nicely positioned with all of our assets to compete successfully and gaining share in that marketplace. So that's probably the biggest I'll say underlying change is to – as we pivot to make sure we service that need of the segment of the market. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. You're welcome. Operator And our final question is from the line of Todd Duvick from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for the question. Dave, I had a follow-up for you with respect to your guidance about free cash flow. Given that free cash flow is a little stronger this year and you talked about de-levering in 2016 and probably flat in 2017. You have a debt maturing in December, a $750 million note. Should we assume that you're going to pay that note off as opposed to refinance it? And then with respect to share buybacks in 2017, should we assume that those are going to be fully funded from free cash flow as opposed to partially debt-financed? David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp. Yes. They will not be debt-financed, other than we might need to do a little short-term borrowing to just accommodate the timing of that. But we will not be issuing debt to support a share repurchase program into 2017. I can't really comment about our debt maturities. I do think at the end of the day, we will be expected to be de-levering over time as we grow our way out of our current capital structure. Just a little bit over 3 times, so probably 2.9 times at the end of the year down to 2.7 times in a reasonable amount of time. Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp. Okay. Well, let me just thank everyone for your time this morning. And just wrapping up, obviously we're not happy with our outlook for 2017. At the same time, we outlined our actions in response to some of the marketplace dynamics that are taking place. And we're confident that our response and our actions will allow us to reaccelerate our growth going forward, and we look forward to seeing all of you next month at Analyst Day where we'll provide additional details on many of the things we talked about this morning. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you.

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Shares of CVS Health ( CVS ) are free falling today, down more than 12% after the company cut its full-year guidance , and that’s dragging some retail-focused ETFs along for the ride.\nThat’s right! — Retail, not healthcare. You won’t find CVS in the holdings of any of the three largest health-care ETFs – the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLV ), the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF ( IYH ) and the Vanguard Healthcare ETF ( VHT ).\nBut the shares are among the top 10 holdings of both the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF ( RTH ) and PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust Dynamic Retail Portfolio ( PMR ), which have fallen 0.9% and 0.7% respectively.\nCVS Health, which operates both a retail pharmacy chain and a pharmacy benefit manager that helps health plans manage drugs benefits, warned that its pharmacy business stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as customers like the Department of Defense take their business elsewhere.\nIt seems that all that effort by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ) pursuing deals that make its stores part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount could shut out rival CVS stores.\nIn short, CVS is losing a ton of business. And Wall Street got caught off guard, as Barclays analyst Eric Percher and his team reports:\nWhile we fully expected that changes in the TRICARE network and increased alignment between WBA and OptumRx/ESRX/Prime would depress retail pharmacy script growth and profits in FY17, we appear to have underestimated the total impact (put at 40mn Rx by CVS) and even more so the potential all-in retail profitability associated with these scripts. CVS also noted a slowdown in prescription growth in the overall market and soft seasonal business, all of which led to preliminary FY17 guidance of $5.77-$5.93, flat relative to FY16 and below our expectation for 11% y/y growth.\nCVS isn’t suffering alone. Walgreen’s share price has fallen more than 2% in recent market action.",

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Updated 0 Matt Rourke \nThis Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, photo shows a CVS drugstore and pharmacy location in Philadelphia. CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock selloff. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.36, or 11.3 percent, to $74 in midday trading, with shares six times normal volume already changing hands. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. \nFor the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. \nThe company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. \nMeanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. \nThe company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. \nCVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \n\"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. \nThe company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors.",

      "text": "CVS Health Corp. may be paying for its restricted Maintenence Choice prescription network with more than 40 million prescription losses.\nThat’s after rival Walgreens Boots Alliance copied CVS in making agreements with pharmacy-benefits managers, middlemen in the drug distribution business, that have locked out CVS pharmacies.\n“We believe that Prime and Express Scripts are likely happy to join forces with Walgreens in order to offset and counter the success that Maintenance Choice has been having over the past few years,” Leerink analysts wrote in a Tuesday note.\nCVS shares tumbled 12% in afternoon trade.\nCVS owns Caremark, a pharmacy-benefit manager it has used to drive business to its Maintenance Choice program, which can fill 90-day prescriptions through the mail-order business or at one of CVS’s locations. The company used that model to bring nearly 9,700 pharmacies and drug insurance together, as The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nBut rival Walgreens has been quick to pick up on the idea, establishing a number of network relationships with PBMs over the past few months, including 90-day offerings with Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, -0.50% and OptumRx, said Larry Merlo, CVS chief executive, on the Tuesday call, according to the FactSet transcript.\nSee also: Valeant slashes outlook as revenue falls short\nOpinion Journal: Polls and More Polls (16:27) Opinion Journal’s Mary Kissel and pollster Doug Rivers on which presidential polls to watch, and why. Plus: a guide to Hillary Clinton’s email releases, the coming drug price wars, and this year’s best election humor.\nNetwork changes at the beginning of the current quarter, including a restricted network relationship between Walgreens and the Department of Defense TRICARE program, completely exclude CVS. And while CVS will continue to work with Prime Therapeutics’ Medicare Part D plan, Merlo says it will be as a “non-preferred provider.”\n“Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years,” said Finance Head David Denton on the call. “Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share, and therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective.”\nCVS earlier reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.64, beating the $1.57 FactSet consensus. But sales of $44.6 billion missed the $45.3 billion FactSet consensus. Same-store sales increased 2.3%. Pharmacy same-store sales, which rose 3.4%, were negatively impacted by about 340 basis points by generic drug introductions, the company said.\nThe company now expects 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.77 to $5.83, down from an earlier range of $5.81 to $5.89 and below the $5.85 FactSet estimate. Its preliminary 2017 outlook is for adjusted EPS of $5.77, well below the FactSet consensus of $6.48.\nAnalysts at Mizuho Securities said they were surprised by the profitability impact of the lost prescriptions.\n“Given that most of the lost scripts are government, we had assumed a lower gross profit than the company average,” analysts said in a note published Tuesday. “The second surprise is that CVS stated they are seeing an overall weakness in prescription growth and a soft seasonal business.”\nSee also: Generic drug stocks bounce, but analysts warn not to jump in\nStill, analysts believe the company has a “top-notch management team, with a solid balance sheet and cash flow.”\nMizuho rates CVS shares buy with a $111 price target.\nSee also: Drug companies spend $109 million to block vote to lower drug prices\nCVS shares are down nearly 24% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.24% is up 5% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch Here’s how much Apple may profit from Samsung’s exploding phone disaster Trump 'Regrets' Crude Words He Spoke About Women in 2005 Google Pixel, Home: A Guide to Google's Gear",

      "text": "Follow 5 Stocks To Watch \nCVS Caremark (NYSE: CVS ): The healthcare industry has been hit hardest ahead of the election with both nominees having taken a hardened stance on the sector. Shares of CVS are trading 15% lower this year despite a string of robust year over year comparisons. Analysts are expecting the retail drug chain to maintain its robust growth of the past few quarters and deliver a 22% increase on the bottom line and 17% on the top. The recently completed acquisitions of Omnicare and Target Pharmacy, while still in the integration process, are expected to provide new support to top line growth. Profitability and same store sales should continue to be adversely impacted by the introduction of generic drugs. In the second quarter genericization dragged down pharmacy same store sales by 355 basis points. The potential merger of Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD ) and Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) coupled with the off chance that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) opens up convenience stores could severely impact CVS’ long term outlook. In the meantime, analysts are optimistic that CVS can maintain its robust growth of the past few quarters. \nValeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: VRX ): Valeant was one of the best performing stocks on Wall Street in the first half of 2015, but over the past 12 months and a price gouging scandal, shares have bottomed out. After reaching highs of over $250 per share, the stock has plummeted over 90%, to all time lows, where it is today. The ongoing freefall forced management to oust now former CEO Michael Pearson, who led the company through the thick of its price hikes. With several new board members, one being infamous hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, and a new CEO, Valeant is still fumbling. Its most recent report delivered a nearly 50% decline on the bottom-line and 10% on the top. With no signs of improving anytime soon, the upcoming quarter is shaping up to be another disaster. \nSeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE: SEAS ): SeaWorld 's financial performance and share prices have trended lower in recent quarters driven by lower traffic trends and a growing list of negative publicity surrounding animal cruelty. In the second quarter both earnings and revenue delivered 5% declines from a year earlier blamed on a decline on Latin American attendance, softness in the Orlando market, and an unfavorable storm season. Ongoing efforts to ease these concerns through promotional campaigns and jump start traffic trends haven’t gained traction and will likely take their toll on the bottom line. Additional investments into new rides and extending hours of operation haven’t swayed analysts expectations which are calling for a 7% decline in earnings and 3% in sales. \nWayfair (NYSE: W ) : Wayfair is falling victim to a theme plaguing many recent IPOs: mounting losses and decelerating revenue growth. In the second quarter the ecommerce platform posted a 187% decline on the bottom line and has yet to deliver a profitable quarter since going public in late 2014. Over this time revenue growth has dropped significantly with expectations of delivered a 42% increase in the third quarter. During the quarter, Wayfair introduced a number of new partnerships and initiatives to help re-energize margins and traffic trends. Some of these include deals with HGTV and A&E Networks along with a new augmented reality app will have enhance the consumer’s experience. \nCarrols Restaurants Group (NASDAQ: TAST ): Strong results from McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD ) this earnings season sets a favorable tone for the remaining fast food chains which include Carrols and Wendy’s (NASDAQ: WEN ) this week. Carrols Restaurant Group is best known for owning and operating over 725 Burger King stores in the United States. The company continues to be in the process of acquiring more Burger King locations. During the third quarter Carrols acquired 10 additional stores that are expected to support the top line. Burger King’s strong brand, frequent menu innovation and ongoing promotional initiatives have proved resilient despite challenges in the quick service industry. Analysts at Estimize are expecting the continued addition of new stores to carry financial performance to a 25% increase on the bottom line and 12% on the top. 5 Stocks To Watch Before The Market Opens On Election Day ",

      "text": "By Paul R. La Monica CVS isn't healthy -- stock plunges nearly 15% Drugstore chain facing increased competition UPDATED 12:28 PM EST Nov 08, 2016 \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager giant reported sales for the third quarter that missed forecasts. CVS also warned that earnings for the fourth quarter and all of 2017 would be worse than expected. \nShares plunged nearly 15% on the news. \nThe biggest problem for CVS appears to be increased competition from rival Walgreens, which now owns European pharmacy giant Boots and is also in the process of buying Rite Aid. \nCVS said that it expects to lose more than 40 million prescriptions . \nCEO Larry Merlo said that some prescriptions have begun \"migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter\" and that the company is \"currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market.\" \nCVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark a few years ago, a deal that may be backfiring on the company. CVS may be alienating some companies who are worried about how much power it holds in the prescription drug business. \nWalgreens has sought to take advantage of those fears. It has partnered with Caremark rival Optum Rx, which is owned by insurance giant UnitedHealth. \nWalgreens also has a strategic alliance with Prime Therapeutics, the mail order unit of more than a dozen Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \nAnother pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts, announced at the end of September that Walgreens will replace CVS as the drug store of choice for Tricare, a prescription plan that Express Scripts runs for members of the U.S. military. \nCVS is trying to diversify its business to deal with these competitive threats. The company has also bought Omnicare, a company that runs pharmacies for nursing homes. CVS also now runs in-store pharmacies at Target. \nBut many analysts believe that CVS has paid too much attention to its pharmacy benefits and mail order businesses -- at the expense of improving its own stores. \nCVS said same-store sales at the front end of its pharmacies fell 1% in the quarter. The company blamed weak traffic. \nMeanwhile, Walgreens has won raves for investing more in the front end of the store, i.e. beauty care items, food, toys and other items. \n\"CVS is missing out on growth that could be easily attained by a slightly more imaginative approach to its front of store business,\" said Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, in a report. \n\"We continue to be disappointed that the group cannot see the front of house opportunity,\" he added. \nIt's a problem that CVS needs to quickly address before the problem gets worse. Customers aren't the only ones that are unhappy. Investors are annoyed too. The stock is now down more than 25% this year.",

      "text": "CVS stands to lose 40M prescriptions next year Daily Report Staff November 8, 2016 \nCVS warns that it stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as deals signed by rival Walgreens with other participants in the drug supply chain shut out CVS pharmacies, The Wall Street Journal reports. \nChief Executive Larry Merlo says two recent partnerships that Walgreens struck with health plans excluded CVS drugstores from their networks. The partnerships are the main reason for CVS’ expected decline in prescriptions, Merlo says. \nCVS filled 1.03 billion prescriptions in 2015, the last full year available, up from 722 million five years earlier. \nBut Walgreens, which filled 929 million prescriptions in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, has been aggressively pursuing deals that make its pharmacies part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount. \nWalgreens has become the preferred pharmacy for UnitedHealthcare’s OptumRx and for Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \nLast month, Walgreens signed a deal to become the preferred network for Tricare, the Defense Department’s health care network, supplanting CVS Health. It has also struck a deal to acquire Rite Aid, though the transaction awaits regulatory approval.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nCVS Health Corporation ( CVS - Free Report ) reported third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.64, up 28.1% year over year. The adjustment considers certain asset amortization, acquisition-related integration costs and the loss incurred on early extinguishment of debt. \nThe quarter‘s adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 by 4.5% and exceeded the company’s guided range of $1.55−$1.58. \nWithout the one-time adjustments, reported EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter increased 30% year over year to $1.43. \nCVS HEALTH CORP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise \nCVS HEALTH CORP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS HEALTH CORP Quote \nQuarter in Details \nNet revenue in the third quarter increased 15.5% year over year to $44.6 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.3 billion. The upside was driven by balanced growth in the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments. \nPharmacy Services revenues increased 19.2% to $30.4 billion in the reported quarter on growth in the specialty pharmacy business and higher pharmacy network claims. \nPharmacy network claims processed during the quarter went up 23.3% to 282.6 million, backed by net new business growth. Moreover, the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings reached the Mail Choice processed claim count to 22.4 million, up 2.5%. \nRevenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC improved 12.5% year over year to $20.1 billion, primarily driven by the addition of long-term care (LTC) operations from the Omnicare acquisition, the inclusion of pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation which was taken over in Dec 2015 and pharmacy same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved 2.3%, while front-end same-store sales were down 1% year over year. \nFront-end same-store sales were impacted by soft customer traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in basket size. \nPharmacy same-store sales increased 3.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. Moreover, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes rose 3% on a 30-day equivalent basis. \nThe generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) soared 160 bps to 85.4% at the Pharmacy Services segment and 100 bps to 85.8% at the Retail/LTC segment. \nAlthough gross profit rose 12.4% to $7.4 billion, gross margin contracted 44 bps to 16.7%. Total operating margin during the quarter expanded 28 bps to 6.3% despite a 7.9% increase in operating costs. \nCVS Health exited the third quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.26 billion, compared with $1.21 billion at the end of the second quarter. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.94 billion, up 64.1% from the year-ago period. \nDuring the third quarter, CVS Health opened 48 new retail stores and closed 10. Further, the company relocated 11 retail stores. As of Sep 30, 2016, CVS operated 9,694 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil. \n2016 Guidance Updated \nCVS Health has lowered its full-year 2016 earnings expectations. The company currently expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.77–$5.83 (earlier expectation $5.81–$5.89). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $5.86 for 2016, above the projected range. \nThe company however raised its cash flow guidance for 2016. It currently expects to free cash flow of $6.8–$7.0 billion ($6.3–$6.6 billion) and cash flow from operations of $9.3–$9.5 billion ($8.8–$9.1 billion) for 2016. \nCVS Health has also issued its fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted EPS projection. The company forecasts adjusted EPS in the range of $1.64−$1.70. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 is above the guided range. \nPreliminary 2017 Outlook \nThe company has issued its full-year 2017 preliminary outlook. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of $5.77–$5.93. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.53 is above the guided range. \nOur Take \nCVS Health posted mixed third-quarter results with adjusted EPS beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missed the mark. It is also disappointing to see the narrowed guidance which indicates the absence of any near-term catalyst. Nonetheless, year-over-year growth remained impressive with the Pharmacy Services segment benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy and the Retail Pharmacy segments. \nWe take note of the recently completed Omnicare and Target Pharmacy acquisitions, which are currently undergoing the integration process. According to the company, both the acquisitions are strategic fits. CVS Health expects to benefit with multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare and Target in both the near and long term. \nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nCVS Health currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked medical stocks are GW Pharmaceuticals plc ( GWPH - Free Report ) , Baxter International Inc. ( BAX - Free Report ) and Bovie Medical Corp. ( BVX - Free Report ) . GW Pharmaceuticals and Baxter sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Bovie Medical carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \nGW Pharmaceuticals surged 71.6% year to date compared to the S&P 500’s 4.3% over the same period. The company has a four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 41.6%. \nBaxter International rallied 26.5% in the past one year, comparing favorably with the S&P 500’s 2.6%. It has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 27%. \nBovie Medical recorded a 153.5% gain in the past one year, way better than the S&P 500’s 2.6%. The company has a trailing four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 28.7%. \nConfidential from Zacks \nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "Health Care Up Slightly as CVS, Valeant Weigh -- Health-Care Roundup  22:  \nShares of health-care companies rose, but not by much, after more worrying trends for the sector emerged in earnings season. Fallen giant Valeant Pharmaceuticals International posted a $1.22 billion third-quarter loss and wrote down the value of the Salix stomach-drugs business it is reportedly trying to sell. It also said health regulators delayed a decision on approving an experimental psoriasis drug and issued a warning letter for the company's Rochester, N.Y., site, compounding its woes as it tries to move past a scandal about its links to pharmacies. Drug-store and pharmacy- benefit manager CVS Health slid after the company warned that exclusivity deals struck by rival Boots Walgreen would eat into its profits. Chief Executive Larry Merlo said two recent partnerships that Walgreens struck with health plans that entirely excluded CVS drugstores from their networks were the main reason for the expected decline in prescriptions. Ironically, CVS had pioneered the business model whereby drug stores brought wholesaling and insurance functions in- house, giving them more power to engage in such negotiations. \n-Rob Curran, rob.curran@dowjones.com This article appears in: Market News Headlines More from Dow Jones Business News",

CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the ... more Photo: Matt Rourke, AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock selloff. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. Its shares fell $9.36, or 11.3 percent, to $74 in midday trading, with shares six times normal volume already changing hands. The operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. Quarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. The bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. The retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. For the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. The company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. Meanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41-billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. The company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. CVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. The company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors. AP Business Writer Damian Troise in New York contributed to this report. ",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Megan Woolhouse Globe Staff November 08, 2016\nCVS Health Inc. pared back its earnings outlook Tuesday after announcing it expected to lose 40 million retail prescriptions to its rival, Walgreens Boots Alliance.\nThe company attributed the anticipated loss to new partnerships formed by Walgreens that exclude CVS drugstores from their networks, effectively restricting people from filling their prescriptions there.\nAdvertisement\nCVS shares closed at $73.53, the lowest point since April 2014. The company said it expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5.\nWhile many view CVS as primarily a drugstore chain, a cornerstone of its operations is its business managing pharmacy benefits through CVS/Caremark, the second largest such business in the United States.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Insurance companies and employers hire pharmacy benefits managers like CVS/Caremark to act as middlemen between insurance companies and corporations, negotiating prices and handling drug costs on their behalf.\nWalgreens began negotiating its own deals with pharmacy benefit management company Prime Therapeutics, a Minnesota company owned by 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans, announcing a deal that eliminated CVS from its pharmacy network in August.\nLast month, Walgreens also signed a deal to be the preferred network for Tricare, a U.S. Defense Department health care network that services millions, leaving CVS out of the loop.\nAdvertisement\nChief executive Larry J. Merlo said Tuesday in an earnings call with investors that the changes “are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk beginning in the current quarter.\n“We have always said that our last script is our most profitable one give our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume,” he said. “And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts.”\nOne analyst said CVS could be more aggressive in its efforts to cut similar deals with CVS/Caremark clients, although that may be difficult amid increased competition.\n“Walgreens has been aggressive in being a strict pharmacy network, and CVS has not been willing or able to do that,” said Vishnu Lekraj, a senior health care analyst at Morningstar Inc., a Chicago financial research firm. “That’s a major pressure point or pain point for them.”\nRobert S. Huckman, a management professor at Harvard Business School, said the fact that Walgreens is creating its own relationships with benefit managers and building narrower networks may help it bring costs down. But Huckman said those smaller networks could become problematic if they become inconvenient for patients.\n“Very often consumers need to access pharmaceutical products at a time when convenience is one of several factors that matter,” he said.\nCVS Health’s two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market are Walgreens and Rite Aid, which have proposed a $9.41-billion deal to merge. That plan is still being reviewed by federal regulators. A successful merger could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 locations. CVS currently operates more than 9,700 stores.\nThe loss of millions of prescriptions could also have implications for CVS’s “front of store” retail sales, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of Conlumino, a retail analysis firm in New York. He said some CVS shoppers buying milk, tissues, or potato chips come in primarily to pick up a prescription.\n“If people aren’t coming in to get prescriptions filled they may not be buying other things at CVS,” he said.\nMegan Woolhouse can be reached at megan.woolhouse@globe.com .
