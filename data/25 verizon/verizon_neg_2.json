      "text": "10:42AM From what I know, Verizon in most places has replaced their traditional \"land lines\", the old twisted pair copper phone lines we remember, the ones that could work when the power went out, etc. These days, they are replacing that basically with the same phone service you get if you formally get FIOS. My \"landline\" now uses the FIOS router hardware. Likely your 'landline' by now is running off the FIOS box, not the old copper landline, if not, it soon will be (that copper they are ripping out is worth a fortune). Basically, all modern phone services, whether it be on FIOS or a Cable phone service, use what is called voice over IP (or voice). Instead of being an analag voice connection over wire, your call is routed over the internet now different than when you IM or access web sites, your call is broken up into IP packets, sent on the net, routed via the net. If the user on the other end is on VOIP, it will get to them over the internet;. if they are on a cell phone or a true landline, the phone company on the other end will get the call from the net, and then put it onto their cell network or to the landline user. Ooma, Vonage, etc basically hook your phone up to the internet connection you have (broadband), but they basically do the same thing, it is VOIP. @chuckdoodle , do you get a seperate bill from Verizon for your 'landline', or is it part of your FIOS bill? I don't have fios but through laziness and procrastination, I still have my 'landline' and it is expensive, if you are doing that you may want to see if you can include it in your FIOS bundle, it will be cheaper, and basically would be an accounting difference if your landline already uses fios (and given that you have FIOS in your house, I am about 99% certain they yanked the copper when they put that in).",

      "text": "by Valerie Richardson November 10, 2016, 12:05 pm \nVerizon’s # Ellipsis7 tablet can now be bought via eBay for just $49.99 . The tablet comes with a pretty attractive hardware specs sheet underneath, thus justifying the price tag. This is a couple of years old, though, so it probably won’t break any benchmark records out there. But if you’re looking for a tablet to just cover the basic needs, make sure you give this deal a closer look. \nThe Ellipsis 7 comes with a 7-inch 1280 x 800 display, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of expandable storage, a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor, a 3.2-megapixel rear camera, a VGA front camera, Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, and a 4,000 mAh battery under the hood. The retailer mentions that the tablet is available off-contract, so it seems like you don’t have to sign a new agreement after getting it. \nThe seller is only offering the Ellipsis 7 in Black at the moment, so there aren’t a lot of color options to choose from.",

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nVerizon has been pushing its budget-oriented Ellipsis tablets on the market for a couple years, and they've mostly been throwaway hardware. The latest Ellipsis HD is probably the nicest one, but that doesn't mean it's an amazing tablet. It just appears to be less bad. \nThe Ellipsis 8 HD has an 8-inch 1920x1200 LCD, 3GB of RAM, a 5100mAh battery, 16GB of storage with a microSD card slot, and an octa-core Snapdragon 617. Past Ellipsis tablets have used unnamed quad-core chips (probably MediaTek), but at least this time it's a more capable mid-range Snapdragon part. Verizon insists this is a \"high-end\" chip, but c'mon. Let's not get carried away. \nAs for the design, it's definitely a black rectangle (produced by ODM Quanta). There's nothing flashy or interesting about it, but that's not why you buy a $250 LTE tablet from Verizon. It's cheap and seems to have alright specs. It runs Android 6.0.1 right now, but don't hold your breath for a Nougat update any time soon. The Ellipsis 8 HD can also be had for $10.41 per month or $99.99 on a 2-year contract. Source:",

The smartphone is nearly three years old in the market, but a pretty exciting device nonetheless. Since this is a Note flagship, it’s not your conventional flagship offering. Its hardware might not be relevant anymore, but for the price that it’s selling for, we suggest you give it a closer look. \nThe Galaxy Note 3 comes with a 5.7-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display, a 13-  2-  the   800 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GB   Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (upgradable to Android 5.0), and a 3,200 mAh battery. The device also comes with the company’s proprietary S Pen stylus on board, which allows you to get the best of Samsung’s productivity features at your fingertips. \nThe only caveat here is that the handset is locked to work with Verizon. So the deal only applies to Verizon customers. If you meet the criterion, make sure you hit the link below for more details on the product.",

      "text": "by Valerie Richardson November 10, 2016, 1:20 pm \nThe # HTC # OneM9 from # Verizon is now selling via eBay for $199.95 . The smartphone is locked to work with VZW, so if you happen to be a Sprint or a GSM subscriber, you’re exempt from this deal. But barring that, the handset is pretty much a steal at this price point, even if we consider the fact that this is a 2015 flagship device. \nThe HTC One M9 is equipped with a 5-inch 1080p display, the octa-core Snapdragon 810 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 20-megapixel rear camera, a 4-megapixel front camera, Android 5.0 Lollipop (upgradable to Marshmallow and Nougat), and a 2,840 mAh battery. The device also comes with HTC’s iconic BoomSound front-facing speakers, which promises to give you the best performance. \nIf that’s not enough to convince you, we’re pretty sure the premium metal unibody design will. Have a look at the smartphone from the link below.",

      "title": "Fitch to Rate Verizon Owner Trust 2016-2; Issues Presale",
      "text": "[November 10, 2016] Fitch to Rate Verizon Owner Trust 2016-2; Issues Presale \nFitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Verizon ( News - Alert ) Owner Trust 2016-2 (VZOT 2016-2): \n--$1,200,000,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; \n--$100,000,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; \n--$100,000,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable. \nKEY RATING DRIVERS \nReceivable Quality: The VZOT 2016-2 trust pool consists of 100% DPPs with 24-month original terms that are originated and serviced by subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc. The statistical pool exhibits a weighted average FICO score of 709 and a weighted average remaining term of 24 months. Of the statistical pool, Fitch considers 31% to be subprime and, as part of the worst case pool, this can grow to more than 40%. New receivables meeting the eligibility requirements will be purchased into the trust for two years or until an amortization event occurs. \nFitch assigned a base case default rate of 4.0% for the statistical pool and 4.5% and 5.0% for the two worst case portfolios it analyzed. We applied a stress multiple of 6.0x at the 'AAAsf' stress level, reflecting mainly the two-year revolving period; the use of proxy data as limited data history was available for the DPPs; and the view that customer payment behavior on the DPPs could be negatively affected by a Verizon insolvency. \nVerizon Rating Dependency: While not directly linked, the ratings of the notes face greater exposure than other consumer loan transactions to the credit profile and market position of Verizon Communications Inc. (currently rated 'A-/F2'/Outlook Stable), whose subsidiaries act as originators, the servicer and network operator. In Fitch's view, this can take the form of (1) indirect exposure through customers changing their payment behavior in the event of a Verizon insolvency and (2) directly through the risk of device payment upgrade contract remittances not being made to the trust following Verizon's insolvency. \nFor these reasons, a downgrade of Verizon Communications Inc. could affect Fitch's credit ratings of the notes. While a limited downgrade of Verizon is unlikely to result in a downgrade of the senior notes, a multi-notch downgrade - particularly to speculative grade - will increase the likelihood of a downgrade of the senior notes below 'AAAsf'. However, there is no automatic credit linkage, as other factors such as (1) the strengths of Verizon's network, (2) a reduced revolving period, (3) lower than assumed direct exposure through the upgrade program (also considering the additional credit enhancement [CE] to cover any such risk, which is 6% at closing) and (4) the available CE if already increased during the amortization phase could lessen the rating impact in the future. \nStrong Servicing Capabilities: Cellco Partnership, as servicer of the VZOT 2016-2 pool receivables, has a long track record of servicing consumer cell phone contracts. Due to this factor and Verizon's position as the largest wireless service provider in the U.S., Fitch considers Verizon's servicing operations of cell phone contracts to be a strength compared to its peers. \nCRITERIA VARIATIONS \nDue to the importance of the delinquency trigger in the transaction's structure, Fitch distinctively modelled 61+ day delinquencies, rather than solely the assets that ultimately default. Use of such criteria variation impacts the ratings by at most one notch, and only in certain modelling scenarios. \nRATING SENSITIVITIES \nUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or charge-offs on customer accounts could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining loss coverage levels available to the investments. Decreased CE may make certain ratings on the investments susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. \nFitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base case charge-off assumption by an additional 25% and additional 50%, and examining the rating implications. The increases of the base case charge-offs are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected deterioration of a transaction's performance. \nDuring the sensitivity analysis, Fitch examines the magnitude of the multiplier compression by projecting the expected cash flows and loss coverage levels over the life of investments under higher than the initial base case charge-off assumptions. Fitch models cash flows with the revised charge-off estimates while holding constant all other modelling assumptions. \nUnder the 25% stress, the senior notes would likely be downgraded, while remaining high investment grade. The ratings on the class B would fall to 'Asf' and the C notes would migrate to 'A-sf'. Under the 50% stress, the class A would be downgraded to 'Asf', while the subordinate notes would both fall to 'A-sf.' \nUSE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC ( News - Alert ) RULE 17G-10 \nFitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing certain information with respect to 1,100 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. \nThe information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

      "text": "  2:25 pm \nThe # Verizon branded # LGV10 is now selling on eBay for just $254.99 . The device is compatible with both Verizon and GSM carriers. The smartphone comes with a very exciting hardware specs sheet even though it’s a late 2015 flagship. This was considered to be one of the best LG handsets available in the market until last year, and some would still be of that opinion given the hardware it’s packing underneath. \nThe LG V10 is equipped with a 5.7-inch Quad HD display, a 16-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel dual cameras on the front, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, the hexa-core Snapdragon 808 chipset, Android 5.1 Lollipop (upgradable to Marshmallow), and a 3,000 mAh battery. The phone also comes with a rugged exterior, making it an appealing device overall. \nThe V10 is available in Black or White combinations, so you have multiple variants to choose from.

Just like on the Verizon site, these both are listed as \"Coming Soon.\" \nVerizon has decided, whether on purpose or accident, to show two as-yet-unannounced Live Cases for the Pixels. These are not ones you would find on the Google Store . The blue option for the Earth case looks a lot like one of the wallpapers from last year's Nexus phones, which makes me feel a bit nostalgic. \nPersonal opinions aside, these are only listed as \"Coming Soon\" in the Verizon store. I think that it would be a safe bet to assume these Live Cases will be similarly priced to their brethren in the Google Store at $40. Perhaps they will be Big Red exclusives, but we will have to see. As for when they will become available, that's anyone's guess. \nBoth the Trends and Earth cases are now showing in the Google Store, too.

      "text": "Reddit \nFollowing a recent leak, Verizon has officially launched the new Ellipsis 8 HD. The tablet boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 octa-core processor and Android Marshmallow 6.0.1, as well as a relatively inexpensive price tag of $249.99 USD alongside a couple payment options. This is an update to the carrier’s previously launched Ellipsis 8, a budget-tier tablet that, unfortunately, has earned modest-to-low reviews in the couple years since launching. \nThe new Ellipsis 8 HD has an updated design with both gray and dark blue color options. In addition to the Snapdragon 617, the tablet has 16GB of internal storage and support for up to 128GB microSD cards. The battery has a respectable 5100mAh capacity but is, sadly, non-removable. Overall, the tablet weighs just under 12 ounces. \nAs the name suggests, the Ellipsis 8 HD has an 8-inch display with a 1920 x 1200 resolution (282ppi). There’s a 5-megapixel front-facing camera and an 8-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.0 lens and the promise of “zero shutter lag.” Verizon says the rear camera can take quality photos in low-light conditions, while the front camera offers a ‘selfie flash.’ \nOther features include a pair of front-facing speakers and ‘smart amp technology’ for ‘full sound,’ as well as a 14.5 hour run time per charge and up to 14 days of standby time. While the retail price is $249.99, Verizon is also offering the tablet for $99 with a two-year contract or for $10.41/month for 24 months.",

      "text": "That didn’t take long. \nHours after Verizon’s Ellipsis 8 HD tablet leaked out , the new Android device has been made official. You can now buy the Ellipsis 8 HD from Verizon’s website or in its stores for $0 down and 24 payments of $10.41 each. You can also pay $99.99 with a two-year contract or $249.99 with no commitment. \nThe Ellipsis 8 HD runs Android 6.0.1 on an 8-inch 1920x1200 display. It’s powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 617 processor and includes 3GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a microSD slot for adding more storage, and a 5,100mAh battery. There’s also an 8-megapixel camera on the Ellipsis 8 HD’s rear and a 5-megapixel camera on its front. \nVerizon’s new Ellipsis 8 HD isn’t the most high-end tablet around, but it’s got a decent set of specs and an affordable price tag for a tablet with built-in 4G LTE connectivity.

      "text": "Verizon \nBecause not everyone needs an expensive powerhouse of a tablet from a brand like Apple or Samsung, Verizon creates its own devices with simplicity and affordability being at the core. \nVerizon’s next tablet, as Evan Blass revealed yesterday, is the Ellipsis 8 HD which is available nationwide starting today. There’s a difference with this tablet, though, as it’s not as watered-down as its predecessors. \nSince Verizon is targeting customers who want an approachable device, the Ellipsis 8 HD comes with two years of free and instant access to the carrier’s Tech Coach service. What’s Tech Coach? It’s a platform that allows people to communicate by message or voice chat with a real U.S.-based representative whenever help is needed. The representatives, who Verizon refers to as “Tech Coaches,” will provide tips and tricks on everything there is to do on the Ellipsis 8 HD. \nKey specifications 8-inch Full HD (1920×1200) display Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 16GB (w/ microSD card slot) 8MP / 5MP cameras 5100mAh battery Android 6.0.1 \nAs you can see, it’s not a low-end tablet in any way. The Ellipsis 8 HD actually falls into the upper part of the mid-range segment. Maybe the only thing to be concerned with is software as it’s not likely for Android 7.0 Nougat to be ushered in at any point in the future. \nThe Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD in Midnight Blue and Arctic Grey is live on Verizon’s site right now, but you can also walk into retail stores and pick up one in-person. Verizon’s price on the tablet is $10.41 per month (for twenty-four months), $99 on a two-year contract, or $249 without any commitment necessary. Regardless of the payment option, you’ll have to add a one-time $20 activation fee to the total.

      "text": "Courtesy of Complex Networks November 10, 2016 | 12:40PM PT \nVerizon keeps spending on premium content for Go90 : Next week the mobile-oriented video service will bow “Thanksgiving,” an original half-hour scripted comedy from director and co-creator Daniel Powell , who co-created “Inside Amy Schumer.” \n“Thanksgiving” stars Bridey Elliott alongside her real-life father Chris Elliott (“Eagleheart,”“Schitt’s Creek”) and Amy Sedaris (“Strangers with Candy”). The eight-episode series, which unfolds in real time, will stream from Nov. 16-23 with a new episode released daily exclusively on Go90.com and the Go90 app, leading up to Thanksgiving this year. \nThe show, from Complex Networks ’ Seriously.TV digital comedy network, follows the Morgan family over the course of a four-hour span during Thanksgiving Day and the dysfunctional situations that arise during the annual American ritual. Verizon and Hearst formed Complex Networks under their digital-video joint venture earlier this year, combining Complex Media with Seriously.TV and RatedRed.com, a lifestyle brand aimed at millennials in conservative-leaning states. \nBethany Hall and Daniel Powell created the series, loosely inspired by Hall’s own family. Both write and executive produce, while Powell directs each episode. Elizabeth Rohrbaugh will executive produce along with Complex Networks head of programming and development Justin Killion and development exec Cory Stern. Alex Bach will serve as producer. \n“Every year during Thanksgiving, millions of Americans search for a distraction from their families,” said Powell. “Bethany and I are proud to present a series that provides just that.” Added Hall, ““Have you ever brought your boyfriend home for Thanksgiving and realized that your family is a weird piece of performance art? So have I.” \nCast of “Thanksgiving” includes John Reynolds (“Stranger Things”), Griffin Newman (“The Tick”), Veronica Osorio (“Hail, Caesar!”), Josh Ruben (CollegeHumor originals), Josh Sharp (Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre), Moujan Zolfaghari (“The Brothel”), James III (“Late Night with Seth Meyers”) and two time Tony Award-winner John Cullum. Guest appearances include Chris Gethard, Todd Barry, and Miriam Tolan. \nSeriously.TV is distributed across Go90, AOL and third-party networks. \nWatch the trailer for “Thanksgiving”: Filed Under: ",

Big Red is offering 50% off a second smartphone when you get select premium handset on a device payment plan. The list of devices included in the promotion includes flagship phones such as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL , the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge , and the LG V20 . Get any of these phones on monthly payments with Verizon and the carrier will offer a second phone of equal or lesser value at 50% off the full retail price. That can amount to a very good discount overall. iPhone fans might be disappointed that there are no iOS handsets included in Verizon's promotion, but with Black Friday around the corner, chances are good for an attractive deal to rear its head in the upcoming weeks. On the other hand, if you can't decide on which phone to get, check out the following links:",

I would like to port out the first line and leave the second line at Verizon. Can I do this without issue? Mainly I'm asking because when I was searching for an answer there were old threads on other forums suggesting it could be an issue when porting out the main line in the middle of a month. Does anyone know if there are currently any possible complications with this scenario? EDIT: It looks like the first line is setup as the Account Owner, so maybe I should call to get that switched to the second line? Last edited by alluringreality; Today at 01:31 PM .",

      "text": "'Thanksgiving' Comedy Starring Amy Sedaris, Chris Elliott to Hit Verizon's Go90 Updated: November 10, 2016 — 3:55 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Todd Spangler \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Verizon keeps spending on premium content for Go90: Next week the mobile-oriented video service will bow \"Thanksgiving,\" an original half-hour scripted comedy from director and co-creator Daniel Powell, who co-created \"Inside Amy Schumer.\" \n\"Thanksgiving\" stars Bridey Elliott alongside her real-life father Chris Elliott (\"Eagleheart,\" \"Schitt's Creek,\" \"Cabin Boy\") and Amy Sedaris (\"Strangers with Candy,\" \"BoJack Horseman\"). The eight-episode series, which unfolds in real time, will stream from Nov. 16-23 with a new episode released daily exclusively on Go90.com and the Go90 app, leading up to Thanksgiving this year. \nThe show, from Complex Networks' Seriously.TV digital comedy channel, follows the Morgan family over the course of a four-hour span during Thanksgiving Day and the dysfunctional situations that arise during the annual American ritual. Verizon and Hearst formed Complex Networks under their digital-video joint venture earlier this year, combining Complex Media (which they acquired in April) with Seriously.TV and RatedRed.com, aimed at millennials in conservative-leaning states. \nRelated Megyn Kelly to Produce Comedy Series Set on Presidential Campaign Trail \nBethany Hall and Daniel Powell created the series, loosely inspired by Hall's own family. Both write and executive produce, while Powell directs each episode. Elizabeth Rohrbaugh will executive produce along with Complex Networks head of programming and development Justin Killion and development exec Cory Stern. Alex Bach will serve as producer. \n\"Every year during Thanksgiving, millions of Americans search for a distraction from their families,\" said Powell. \"Bethany and I are proud to present a series that provides just that.\" Added Hall, \"\"Have you ever brought your boyfriend home for Thanksgiving and realized that your family is a weird piece of performance art? So have I.\" \nCast of \"Thanksgiving\" includes John Reynolds (\"Stranger Things\"), Griffin Newman (\"The Tick\"), Veronica Osorio (\"Hail, Caesar!\"), Josh Ruben (CollegeHumor originals), Josh Sharp (Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre), Moujan Zolfaghari (\"The Brothel\"), James III (\"Late Night with Seth Meyers\") and two time Tony Award-winner John Cullum. Guest appearances include Chris Gethard, Todd Barry, and Miriam Tolan. \nSeriously.TV is distributed across Go90, AOL and third-party networks. The channel also will be home to \"Embeds,\" a six-episode half-hour political comedy from a producing team that includes Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" producer Michael De Luca. Peter Hamby, a former CNN correspondent who is now head of Snapchat's news division, and Scott Conroy, co-author of Sarah Palin biography \"Sarah From Alaska,\" co-created the show and wrote the pilot. \nWatch the trailer for \"Thanksgiving\": Published: November 10, 2016 — 3:40 PM EST | Updated: November 10, 2016 — 3:55 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Share this Story Verizon Currently Running BOGO 50% Off Promo, Includes Pixel Phones \nLooking for a good deal on a multi-phone purchase? Verizon is currently running a “buy one, get one 50% off” promo for its top Android phones. The list of devices includes Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL, Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, and the LG V20. \nTo get the deal, the fine print says you need to buy the first phone on a device payment plan, which then gets you “50% instant discount on full retail price of 2nd device of equal or lesser value.” The deal is only valid for a “limited time.” \nU H! Why can’t the Black Friday deal include the Pixel XL? Lee King Snatch \nhow about 50% off the price of one? thanks trevorsalienarms \nStrong username. Would you like to learn how to say “most honorable Kathy in Japanese?” \nlol bulldoggolfer74 \nIf you really want to take advantage of it, open a second line, pay the $35 connection fee with Device Payment, pay off right away, cancel the line and sell the phone, you’ll still come out well ahead. I have 2 lines currently on device payment, and I am considering upgrading both, paying off the 50% off phone right away and selling it. I confirmed with CS that this works on the XL, and with existing upgrades, however you have to upgrade 2 lines or add a line to benefit from the promotion. RazorSky \nCan I just have the 300 off of my full price phone rather than the edge BS. vinnie \nMy fiancé wants the S7 Edge, and I bought the XL day 1. Anyone need a Pixel at a discounted price? if I collect a $100 helpers fee (on top of the 50% retail +Tax) I would be willing to go through the trouble of obtaining it and save someone some cash. Jake Montague \nHigh Fives all around! Get your $5 reward! New to #SamsungPay? http://smsng.us/payreferral Enter my code 2D3C62 before your 1st purchase to get $5 in rewards. JRomeo \nMy Pixel XL in Very Silver finally arrived in the mail today, if y’all have any questions for me about the phone, I will be more than happy to answer them. T4rd \nHow good does it feel inside your body? \nKellen always seems to skim over this in his reviews.. booked \nStill waiting for mine. Ordered in mid october. Alex S \nI just called, this is only for new lines of service. Doesn’t say so anywhere on the website but the CS rep said she couldn’t honor the deal without a new line of service. Not sure if this helps anyone. Kyle \nNot true, rep I spoke with said opposite and I just went in to a store and took advantage of the offer. Kyle \nPlus I bought phone a week ago, they let me return it and redo transaction so I could get second phone, kept the same phone, didn’t have to pay 35 for restocking return few or activation fee for the returned fee. Did pay 20 for activation of second phone. Both lines were existing. rebretz000 \nI’ll wait for the $10 Black Friday deal. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nBetter idea if you plan on keeping the phone for 24 months. Which I’m assuming most average people do. rebretz000 \nI am now. No reason to upgrade every year anymore. The Pixel will get me through 2 years. No more rooting for me. Not as much fun anymore, not enough time. Jaymus Lonestar \nIf only that included the XL version also. \n🙁 \nDo single line customers always have to get fucked over. sc0rch3d \nAfter my wife and I combined accounts (AT&T here), the discounts and perks started going through the roof. We’ve had the same payment for 5+ years including insurance but more increases in data caps / discounts and have even added a 3rd line for the kiddo. This is even with all 3 owning our phones outright (F.U. Next plan). Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nWoooow. Verizon giving us a deal on the full price? Cool. \nThese deals never apply to me since I’m an individual user. mcdonsco \nNot sure I see the point of continuing to report on BOGO deals since they ALL lock you into new service for years. So of course carriers are willing to do these small subsidies in exchange for large monthly service fees. vinnie \nI don’t think this one does. the second phone at 50% off doesn’t show you need to activate a line or be there for 2 years when I click on the details about it testsetsetsetsetsetset \nits shows in DLs image and above the phones if you click the question mark both phones need device payment. Grand Rapids \nI hate BOGO. Just make the phone 25% off instead of making us buy one get one for 50%. So wasteful. アルベイン クレス \nThat’s not going to make them sell more phones and lines of service though.. Eric R. \nThat doesn’t make them more money Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nAgain, this deal is useless unless you’re doing a payment plan. None of these deals are “deals”, they’re just traps that apply to a select few. jim \nso now you know just how much profit they are making on each phone, cause no one will ever sell anything with out making a profit Orlando aka Pixel XL \nWell, of course and as the consumer you’re given many choices… T4rd \nYup, including creating your own carrier so you can buy phones wholesale. =p Roy Aguilera \nSo not on a contract but on a contract. Francisco Peña \nnot on a 2yr contract, but a MONTHLY 2 yr contract. \nSee, there is aBIG difference! Hiran \nWhats the difference between monthly 2 year contract and a 2 year contract? I don’t understand. How do I know if I am monthly or NOT. C-Law \nI preordered a pixel xl for my mom. Do you think I could still get in on the deal? Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nCall them Clay Johnston \nFrom what I was just told you can. I picked up 2 xl on Sunday and they are going to price adjust for it. Also got $600 in phone trade in… So basically getting a real bogo and an extra $100 or so. Tyler Derpden \nYeah good luck getting a freaking pixel xl before the end of the year. I placed my order on the 19th of October and it’s not expected to ship until 12-9 google dropped the ball on this one big time. Way worse than any nexus release Orlando aka Pixel XL \nI got mine two weeks earlier, projected the 25 of this month and got it today, be patient Ant \nDid you select troll shipping or standard shipping at checkout? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nIt takes longer to deliver to residences located under bridges. Maui \nor I can wait until Black Friday and pick up a pixel for $240. T4rd \nOr that won’t happen and you won’t (most likely). Ivo Shandor \nhe didn’t say what year. 😉 (2017 maybe?)

      "text": "by Karl Bode Thursday Nov 10 2016 16:10 EST \nVerizon's proposed $4.8 billion acquisition of Yahoo just got slightly more complicated. In an SEC form filed this week , Yahoo revealed \"the Company had identified that a state-sponsored actor had access to the Company’s network in late 2014.\" That's a problem for Yahoo executives, in that Yahoo only revealed the hack this year, and didn't bother to tell Verizon about it during deal negotiations. Verizon has been spearheading an investigation to find out when exactly Yahoo first knew of the hack, and whether it hid this information from Verizon. Yahoo sources are anonymously claiming to the Financial Times (warning: paywall) that this early knowledge was incomplete: quote: One person familiar with the investigation said Yahoo originally did not have a “full picture” of what happened because of the “sophisticated nature of state-sponsored attacks”. When it brought in outside experts to investigate the claim of a separate breach, which turned out to be false, it developed a more complete picture, the person said. Reports have suggested that Verizon is looking for a $1 billion reduction in its asking price, as well as a $1 billion to be set aside to handle the inevitable consumer lawsuits over the breach. AOL is attempting to transform itself into a media empire akin to Facebook because subscriber growth in both wireless and wired broadband services have slowed. Between the problems plaguing Yahoo and the failure of Verizon's new Go90 streaming service, that transformation isn't going particularly smoothly.",

      "text": "How Verizon is Solving Big Data Problems with Interactive BI by Lisa Sensmeier \nEnterprises are outgrowing their traditional business intelligent solutions and struggling to use the data they have collected to gain real insights. What happens is that data engineers will scramble to shift data sets between repositories so that data can be analyzed using older methods. As data volumes and data sources grow this problem is only getting worse. \nNext week we have the pleasure of hearing from Verizon’s Ibrahim Itani, Executive Leader of Big Data Architecture and Technology. Ibrahim will talk about Verizon’s big data journey and how they use new technologies to solve problems with data at scale without data movement. Ibrahim will be joined by Ajay Anand, VP of Product Management at Kyvos Insights, and Sanjay Kumar, General Manager of Telecom at Hortonworks, who will share additional use cases that leverage big data architectures and interactive BI to reach their business goals. The talk will cover: How to deal with the complexity of big data at rest and in motion The differences between traditional OLAP and the more modern OLAP on Hadoop How to put together a Hadoop architecture for self-service interactive BI Speakers \nIbrahim Itani serves as the Executive Leader of Big Data Architecture and Technology at Verizon Communications. Ibrahim has a rich background in IT leadership and systems management and is instrumental in the development and success of the award winning Verizon’s Big Answers Platform that served to revolutionize the way customer data is managed, interacted with and viewed. \n\n\nSanjay Kumar is the General Manager, Telecom at Hortonworks. He currently leads the global telecom practice at Hortonworks, helping service providers leverage Hadoop to transform their data into a force of business growth and competitive differentiation. \n\n\nAjay Anand is the Vice President of Product Management at Kyvos Insights, delivering a patent-pending, multi-dimensional OLAP solution that runs natively on Hadoop. Previously he was Co-founder and Vice President of Products at Datameer, and the Director of Product Management for Hadoop at Yahoo!. \nWe look forward to learning more about this Verizon use case. Join us!",

      "text": "Nov 10, 2016 10:39am John Stratton, Verizon's executive vice president and president of operations \nVerizon will add phone subscribers this quarter after losing 36,000 postpaid phone customers in the third quarter, Executive Vice President John Stratton predicted this morning. \n“My expectation is that as you typically see seasonal increases from Q3 to Q4, I think we’ll see the same here,” Stratton told attendees at an investor conference. “I do expect positive phone net adds and continued strength of our overall performance.” \nThe nation’s largest wireless carrier posted its first-ever loss in postpaid phone customers last quarter as competition in the U.S. market quietly ratcheted up. T-Mobile and Sprint turned up the heat on their bigger rivals by launching unlimited data plans , and operators launched “unprecedented” promotions to leverage the release of Apple’s iPhone 7. \nBut an older iPhone also played an important role in the market during the third quarter, Stratton said. \n“The launch of the iPhone 7 is very noteworthy – it’s a great device and on its own merits that’s a very meaningful launch to the market,” Stratton observed. “But what’s also important to remember is the second anniversary of the launch of the original iPhone 6, which was such a big hit for Apple that cyclically you have many tens of millions of customers who were essentially up for renewal. So it got pretty intense there. In the month of September, the combination of unlimited and free iPhone (promotions) and the like kind of stimulated some activity.” \nVerizon is betting it will continue to attract users to the price plans it introduced in July that hiked prices but also increased customers’ monthly data allotments. Those plans, which enable users to roll over unused data for one month and to avoid data overage charges by having download speeds throttled to 128 Kbps, proved compelling out of the gate, Stratton said. \n“It was by far -- from an existing customer migration and adoption (standpoint) – by orders of magnitude, the fastest migration we’ve seen to new plans,” he said. “We had literally tens of millions of subscriber lines shift onto these plans in just the first couple of months.” \nOf course, whether Verizon can continue that momentum in an increasingly competitive fourth quarter has yet to be determined.

      "text": "As Yahoo reels from a massive hack that threatens its $4.8 billion acquisition by Verizon, it’s now investigating another possible security breach.\nLaw enforcement authorities this week began sharing data with the company that they said is from a hacker who claims to have Yahoo user data.\n“Yahoo will, with the assistance of its forensic experts, analyze and investigate the hacker’s claim that the data is Yahoo user account data,” the Sunnyvale company said in a filing Wednesday.\nWhen asked when Yahoo users might be notified whether they’re affected, a spokesman said Thursday it depends on what the company finds in its assessment of the data from law enforcement.\nYahoo said it is facing numerous state, federal and foreign investigations over the 2014 hack it revealed in September, which affects at least 500 million user accounts. It is also dealing with 23 class-action lawsuits related to what it calls the “Security Incident.”\nBecause of all of this, the company warned that the deal with Verizon may fall through.\n“There is no assurance that the Sale transaction will be consummated in a timely manner or at all,” Yahoo said in its filing. “In addition, the anticipated benefits of the Sale transaction may not be realized.”\nIn the past month, including during the company’s earnings call, Verizon executives have said that they are exploring what the Yahoo hack means for the planned acquisition. The companies’ lawyers started talking in late October about the material impact of the breach.\nThe new filing hints that at least some in the company may have known about the hack far earlier than previously acknowledged. “An Independent Committee of the Board, advised by independent counsel and a forensic expert, is investigating, among other things, the scope of knowledge within the Company in 2014 and thereafter regarding this access,” Yahoo said in its filing. The company previously said it wasn’t aware of the hack until summer 2016.",

      "title": "Verizon’s improved Ellipsis 8 HD tablet actually isn’t all that bad",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe Verizon Ellipsis tablets have been around for a while, but they generally get lost in the mix considering their largely boring hardware. A new device in the Ellipsis lineup has been released touting somewhat improved specs and showing that you shouldn’t totally discount Verizon when looking for a new tablet — you should just mostly discount it. \nThe new tablet is called the Ellipsis 8 HD, and it boasts a 1,920 x 1,200 LCD display along with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which can be expanded on with a MicroSD card. \nMore: Verizon gives prepaid customers 5GB and 10GB options as demand continues to grow \nWhen it comes to the device’s processor, it features an octa-core Snapdragon 617 chip, which is a serious step up for the series. Previous Verizon tablets didn’t even have named processor models, although they were probably built by MediaTek, so it’s nice to see Verizon switching to a chip that it’s actually proud enough to name. Still, while Verizon touts the processor as being “high-end,” it’s clearly not — it’s much more of a midrange processor. There’s nothing wrong with that, to be sure, but let’s keep things honest. \nThe design of the tablet isn’t anything special — the manufacturing is handled by ODM Quanta — but as far as $250 tablets go its not that bad. \nIn general, the Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD doesn’t seem all that bad. Sure, it’s not a flagship model by any means, but it also doesn’t have a flagship model’s price. If you’re in the market for a midrange tablet that can do basic things like browse the web, go on social media, reply to emails, and watch YouTube videos, this might be the device for you. As far as software goes, the device runs Android 6.0.1. \nYou can get the Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD from Verizon now for $10.41 per month, or $100 on a 2-year contract. Alternatively, you can just spend the $250 and get it outright.",

      "text": "Verizon Nabs Exclusive Rogue One Star Wars Gear VR Content   Justin Diaz \nVerizon seems to be on a roll when it comes to scoring exclusivity on products lately with being the only U.S. carrier to officially sell the Pixel and Pixel XL(although it’s capable of being used on all carriers as it is unlocked), and now with nabbing exclusive access to provide exciting VR content based on the upcoming Star Wars film called Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The content will be called Rogue One: A Star Wars 360 Experience, as it will be an immersive 360-degree affair, and it’ll be available to view through Samsung’s Gear VR headsets in the very near future. \nAccording to Verizon, the content will be available to view on their Facebook page come November 14th, so, technically anyone should be able to go to Verizon’s Facebook page and check out this new 360-degree experience regardless of what carrier they have. Beginning from today, though, and heading through till November 13th, the Rogue One: A star Wars 360 Experience will be available to view with Samsung’s Gear VR headsets exclusively in Verizon retail stores, so anyone who is a Verizon customer or visits a Verizon store should be able to view the content early before it hits the web. \nThe Rogue One: A Star Wars 360 Experience was created by ILMxLAB which is owned by LucasFilm. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because the same team partnered up with HTC back in March for the Trials On Tatooine Star Wars VR experience which was exclusively available via the HTC Vive VR headset. Verizon hasn’t given much detail on what this Rogue One experience offers, but they have stated that users who give the experience a try will be immersed in the vastness of space as the pilot of an X-wing ship, and that they’ll have a wingman and an R2 Droid by their side. Those who want to know more now before it hits the Verizon Facebook page will need to travel to a Verizon retail store to experience it first hand, and Verizon states that it will be available in 1,400 stores in the U.S., so there is a pretty good chance that there is one locally for most people.

      "text": "Verizon: Buy One & Get One Half Price, Including Pixel & XL   John Anon \nIf you happen to be in the market for a new smartphone and especially at the flagship side of things, then it might be worth checking out a promotion that Verizon is currently running. Unlike a recent promotion from Verizon which looked to offer 20-percent off a smartphone purchase, this one is offering savings when buying more than one smartphone. \nThe deal is simple and one which could provide you with some good savings. To sum up, if you do buy a new smartphone from Verizon, then Verizon will let you buy a second smartphone at half price. That’s one at full price and the other at 50-percent off. While that is still a lot of money to outlay and especially as we are talking about flagship devices here, the list of those devices included is pretty impressive and does include most, if not all, of the big name options. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge are both included, as is the LG V20. Likewise, so is the two new Pixel phones , the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL. \nSo while it is a lot to spend right now, the cost of buying the two together with the discount does significantly offset the cost of both devices. As the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL have been the subject of much debate over their pricing, if you are in the position to get two new smartphones, then this will be a good way to do so, while saving a few extra dollars. There are some caveats of course, as Verizon notes that a device payment plan for each device is required and the discount will only apply to the cheaper of the two handsets. So to maximize savings, you likely will want to make sure the two devices are relatively the same price. Other than through, the saving is there to be had and Verizon states the discount will show up as an instant discount when selecting the second smartphone. You can find out more about this promotion or take advantage of the savings by heading through the link below. Although, you might want to do so sooner rather than later, as this is listed as a ‘limited time’ sale with no firm details on when the deal expires.",

      "text": "Verizon Expects “Positive Phone Net Adds” in Q4 2016   Alexander Maxham \nVerizon , the number one carrier in the country, actually lost 36,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the third quarter, is now saying that they expect to see positive phone net adds for the fourth quarter. Verizon’s executive vice president, John Stratton, was speaking at an investor conference this week and mentioned that his “expectation is that as you typically see seasonal increases from Q3 to Q4, I think we’ll see the same here.” Typically the fourth quarter is the biggest quarter for carriers, and this is largely due to the fact that it’s the holiday shopping season. A lot of people are adding lines to their account, or they are upgrading lines, and in some cases they are switching carriers. Verizon won’t be the only one seeing an increase in the number of postpaid phone net adds they post when talking about Q4. \nIn the past, Verizon has been confident that they did not need to compete in the price war that smaller carriers Sprint and T-Mobile have started. But after posting their first-ever loss in postpaid phone customers in the third quarter, that rhetoric may change. But at this point, Verizon is still adamant that they don’t need to offer unlimited data, like Sprint and T-Mobile are doing. \nVerizon has also been outspending their competitors in marketing, at least on TV. As they are looking to keep their customers and bring new ones in, amid the heavy competition that’s happening in the wireless industry right now. The company did launch some new plans back in July – or rather they upped the data limit and the pricing on their existing plans – which were met with a bit of skepticism by customers and analysts. Verizon will definitely be throwing out some intense promotions for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the rest of the holiday shopping season. But they are still the only carrier that is not offering unlimited data. Verizon is also the only carrier that is selling the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones – although T-Mobile’s promotion allows you to bring over the Pixel or Pixel XL to them and you get half of that cost back in bill credits over 24 months.

      "text": "\nIf you have been waiting patiently to get more than one of the new Google Pixel or Pixel XL smartphones, Verizon Wireless has a new promotion that might be able to help you out. For a limited time, those two phones, plus a few others, are under a “Buy one, get one 50 percent off” sale from the US carrier.\nSee also: Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 1 day ago Along with the Pixel phones, the promotion is also available for buyers of the Samsung Galaxy S7 , the Galaxy S7 edge and the recently released LG V20 . The promotion says that buying one of those phones with a device payment plan will give you the chance to get a“50% instant discount on full retail price of 2nd device of equal or lesser value.”\nObviously, this deal doesn’t mean you have to get a second Pixel phone if you buy the first one, but 50 percent off of anything is still a nice discount, especially for Google’s new phones and the LG V20, which have only been available for a few weeks. Verizon’s deal page says this promotion will only last for a “limited time” but there’s no word on when it will actually end.\nGet it at Verizon See also: Best Verizon Android phones 3 weeks ago ",

      "text": "Verizon's Stratton says carrier will return to growth in postpaid phone subscribers during Q4 Verizon's Stratton says carrier will return to growth in postpaid phone subscribers during Q4 Posted: Tags : Verizon - Verizon + Wireless service - Wireless service + Last quarter, Verizon announced that it lost 36,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the third quarter . Why is that a big deal? Postpaid phone subscribers are the most important metric that a carrier reveals each quarter. Not only is it the bread and butter of the major carriers, this part of the business carries high margins and high average monthly bills (but we didn't have to remind you of that ). The third quarter was the first in Verizon's history to show a decline in postpaid phone subscribers. This captured the attention of T-Mobile CEO John Legere, who reminded everyone that T-Mobile scored an 851,000 gain in postpaid phone subscribers during the same period . Sprint and T-Mobile started unlimited data plans in the quarter, which hurt Verizon. Also impacting Big Red was the incredibly competitive promotions among carriers for the Apple iPhone 7 and Apple iPhone 7 Plus .Verizon EVP John Stratton says that he expects the carrier to return to growth in the current quarter, which ends in December. He says that consumers will continue to respond favorably to the new pricing it announced this past summer. While prices rose, the amount of data that comes with each plan also rose. It added a one-month rollover on unused data, and replaced overage charges by throttling the data speeds of those who go over their data cap to 128 Kbps. The executive said that the new plans brought the fastest migration to any new plans offered in Verizon history. \"We had literally tens of millions of subscriber lines shift onto these plans in just the first couple of months,\" Stratton said. \"My expectation is that as you typically see seasonal increases from Q3 to Q4, I think weâll see the same here. I do expect positive phone net adds and continued strength of our overall performance.\"-John Stratton, EVP, Verizon Will Verizon rebound from its first decline ever in postpaid phone subscribers? We will know on January 24th, 2017. That is the date when the carrier is expected to release its results for the fourth quarter.",

      "title": "Verizon BOGO Deals: Get 50 Percent Off Google Pixel, Pixel XL, LG V20, Galaxy S7 And Galaxy S7 Edge",
      "text": "Samsung - Fascinating Facts About The Korean Electronics Giant Now Playing Verizon launched a BOGO 50 percent off deal on a number of premium Android smartphones, including the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and the LG V20. This is a limited-time deal. ( Verizon Wireless ) Advertisement \nVerizon kicked off a sweet BOGO 50 percent off deal on some of the hottest smartphones of the year, including the new Google Pixels, the LG V20 and the Galaxy S7 line. \nThis buy one, get one at 50 percent off deal allows interested customers to make significant savings when purchasing the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge and LG V20, getting a second handset at half price. How It Works \nThe 50 percent off a second smartphone applies when you purchase one of the premium handsets mentioned above and get it on a device payment plan. When purchasing any of these premium flagships, Verizon will offer a second phone of equal value or cheaper at half off its normal price. Considering the hefty investment these flagship smartphones require, this deal can translate to a massive discount overall. \nThe deal only covers Verizon's top Android smartphones, however, with no equivalent or similar offer for iPhone fans. Alas, various Black Friday deals are already shaping up to be quite exciting and consumers will likely get plenty of attractive options to choose from. \nVerizon doesn't mention when this new Android smartphone BOGO deal will expire, but such promotions usually don't run for very long. \nAll smartphones included in this promotion are top-of-the-line, widely considered the best Android flagship smartphones currently available on the market. Prices \nVerizon is offering the Samsung Galaxy S7 at $28 per month for 24 months, amounting to $672 in total, the Galaxy S7 edge costs $33 per month for 24 months, adding up to a total of $792, the Google Pixel costs $27.08 per month for 24 months, that is $649.99 in total, the Pixel XL costs $32.08 per month for 24 months, amounting to $769.99, while the LG V20 costs $28 per month for 24 months, or $672 in total. \nThis means that customers interested in a multi-phone purchase can save more than $300 when purchasing a premium Android smartphone included in this Verizon BOGO deal. \nVerizon notes that this is a limited-time offer, so interested customers might want to take advantage of it while it still lasts. For more information or to make your purchase, head over to Verizon's website . \nAlternately, you might also want to check out some neat Black Friday 2016 Deals from HTC, including the HTC 10 for $500 and the HTC One M9 for $300. Apple fans, meanwhile, can make some savings by getting a refurbished iPhone straight from Apple, which should guarantee it's in great condition even if it's not brand new.  ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is hacking out more wiggle room for Verizon. The beleaguered internet firm waited until the day after the U.S. election to reveal a hacker's July claim to have certain user data. That's when it inked a $4.8 billion sale to the telecommunications giant. The latest hit to Yahoo's reputation gives Verizon extra firepower to snag a better deal.\nThe company led by Marissa Mayer said in a regulatory filing late Wednesday that it investigated the data thief's allegations and found it could not substantiate them. The time frame, though, only begs more questions.\nYahoo agreed to sell its advertising and search units to Verizon on July 25. At the time, the company noted there were no material adverse effects on its businesses, although certain language in the merger agreement addresses security breaches and unauthorized access that gives Verizon a degree of protection.\nThen in September Yahoo dropped a cyber bombshell by admitting that certain information was stolen from at least 500 million user accounts in 2014. That prompted Marni Walden, Verizon's president of innovation and new business, to stress that the company would \"protect our shareholders and our investors, so we're not going to jump off a cliff blindly.\" Now it turns out that Yahoo discovered the huge breach after it started an investigation to delve into the previously undisclosed July allegation.\nYahoo stands by its statement that the breach of 500 million accounts has not had a material effect on its business. That said, the company has \"subsequently incurred expenses\" related to the hack and it expects to incur \"investigatory, legal, and other expenses\" associated with it in the foreseeable future, the filing points out without providing a figure.\nBoth sides are already in talks to try and determine how much this has hurt Yahoo's value, never mind its ever-dwindling reputation. Wednesday's revelation should give Verizon an additional cudgel at the negotiating table.\nAbout the Author Editing by Antony Currie and Kate Duguid The views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.",

      "text": "Verizon has launched a new tablet in its Ellipsis lineup, featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor, 3GB of RAM, and a HD display. Those specs are a serious step up from previous devices in the Ellipsis lineup. More The Verizon Ellipsis tablets have been around for a while, but they generally get lost in the mix considering their largely boring hardware. A new device in the Ellipsis lineup has been released touting somewhat improved specs and showing that you shouldn’t totally discount Verizon when looking for a new tablet — you should just mostly discount it.\nThe new tablet is called the Ellipsis 8 HD, and it boasts a 1,920 x 1,200 LCD display along with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which can be expanded on with a MicroSD card.\nMore: Verizon gives prepaid customers 5GB and 10GB options as demand continues to grow\nWhen it comes to the device’s processor, it features an octa-core Snapdragon 617 chip, which is a serious step up for the series. Previous Verizon tablets didn’t even have named processor models, although they were probably built by MediaTek, so it’s nice to see Verizon switching to a chip that it’s actually proud enough to name. Still, while Verizon touts the processor as being “high-end,” it’s clearly not — it’s much more of a midrange processor. There’s nothing wrong with that, to be sure, but let’s keep things honest.\nThe design of the tablet isn’t anything special — the manufacturing is handled by ODM Quanta — but as far as $250 tablets go its not that bad.\nIn general, the Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD doesn’t seem all that bad. Sure, it’s not a flagship model by any means, but it also doesn’t have a flagship model’s price. If you’re in the market for a midrange tablet that can do basic things like browse the web, go on social media, reply to emails, and watch YouTube videos, this might be the device for you. As far as software goes, the device runs Android 6.0.1.\nYou can get the Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD from Verizon now for $10.41 per month, or $100 on a 2-year contract. Alternatively, you can just spend the $250 and get it outright.\nWhat’s the best MacBook for your money? The Moto Z family just got bigger with the Moto Z Play Sprint’s new plan offers all-you-can-stream HD video for $20 per month extra",

      "text": "With a name somewhat reminiscent of Verizon’s 2012-discontinued first 4G LTE smartphone, bizarre Sprint exclusivity , at least stateside , no headphone jack in tow , and a controversial Snapdragon 810 processor making an unlikely comeback to replace the safe SD820 bet, you were probably not overly excited about the HTC Bolt.\nBut the oversized HTC 10 lookalike available today on America’s Now Network isn’t that bad all in all. It very closely resembles the company’s global 5.2-inch flagship , same all-metal unibody, chamfered contour and front-firing fingerprint reader, adding 0.3 Quad HD-capable inches of screen real estate.\nThe elegant and robust 5.5-incher is also HTC’s very first water-resistant aluminum-made hero, with a solid IP57 rating for partial dust protection and liquid immersion up to 1 m depth and 30 minutes.\nAt $600 outright, $200 with two-year contracts, or $25 a month for 24 months, the HTC Bolt provides plenty of raw power, thanks to 3GB RAM and a respectably spacious 3,200 mAh battery. Pre-installed Android 7.0 Nougat is obviously a first for the slowly-recovering Taiwanese OEM too, although Sprint elects to focus its initial marketing efforts on LTE Plus connectivity.\nSince it’s capable of technically unlocking the next-gen cellular network, the Bolt is fittingly billed as Sprint’s “fastest smartphone ever.” Unfortunately, new 4G speeds are only available in a few places nationwide.\nIf it’s any consolation, HTC tries to make up for the 3.5 mm audio port absence with the world’s first “adaptive earphones that fine-tune the listening experience for how you hear individually.” You of course get USB Type-C support, as well as 32GB expandable storage, 16 and 8MP cameras. Not easy to tell if this is an HTC 10 upgrade or downgrade at the end of the day.\nThe post HTC Bolt lights up Sprint’s LTE Plus network, 5.5-inch Quad HD screen and Nougat included appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

Verizon has announced this week it will be offering access to VR content based on the upcoming Star Wars episode called Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. \nYou’ll need to have a Samsung Gear VR headset in order to immerse yourself in the 360-degree Rogue One: Star Wars 360 Experience and luckily you can purchase one right off Big Red. \nThe carrier says the content will become available on its Facebook page beginning November 14, so in theory everyone who accesses Verizon ’s social media account should be able to take a sneak peek at the Rogue One: Star Wars 360 Experience. \nBig Red has another surprise in-store. Starting November 10 and all the way through November 13, the Rogue One: Star Wars 360 Experience will be waiting for you on Samsung Gear VR headsets in Verizon brick and mortar stores from around the country. So those of you visiting a Verizon store will be able to check out the new content before it becomes official online. \nThe short immersive 360 experience has been created by LucasFilm’s entertainment group ILMxLAB and has the user flying as an X-wing pilot for the Rebellion. Expect to be immersed in the vastness of space accompanied by a R2 Droid sidekick. \nVerizon doesn’t share more details on the new content piece, so curious Star Wars fan can just go ahead and drive out to a Verizon store and check it out for themselves.",

      "text": "Share \nYahoo’s deal to sell its core assets to Verizon may have been dealt a new blow when the internet company disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it discovered the hack that led to the compromise of a half-a-million user accounts two years before it went public with it. \nIn an SEC filing, Yahoo said it discovered the attacks, which the company continues to contend happened by a “state-sponsored actor,” shortly after it happened at the end of 2014. The company didn’t realize the extent of the compromise until a hacker claimed this past July he or she had vast amounts of Yahoo user data. Yahoo also said in the SEC filing it has been working with forensic security experts and that the investigation cost it $1 million in the third quarter. \nIn the filing , Yahoo also provided more information about the massive hack in 2014. Yahoo said the “state-sponsored actor” may have created cookies that could enable them to bypass the need for a password. They then had access to users’ accounts and account information. An independent committee is looking into who inside Yahoo knew about the hack and when. In that same filing, Yahoo disclosed another more recent hack. Yahoo said on Monday (Nov. 7) law enforcement authorities began sharing data they said was provided by a hacker. The hacker claimed the information came from a Yahoo user account. Yahoo said it’s working with forensic experts to analyze and investigate the claim. \nThe disclosures come as Yahoo is trying to close on its deal to sell its core assets to Verizon. It’s not clear if the disclosure in the filing and the previously announced hack will result in Verizon paying less for Yahoo’s core assets or walking away completely.",

      "text": "up vote -1 down vote \nNo. Trump is an individual not a cell phone tower and cannot be used to place cell phone calls. He does not have coverage in the manner you use the term. For example, if you removed your Verizon SIMM card and placed in a \"Trump\" SIMM card you would not be able to make calls in any of these areas. You are comparing apples and err copper. \nSecondly. He won about 50% of the vote so most of these areas his \"coverage\" would only 50, 60, 70 percent and be far less than the map shows. If Verizon covers 51% of a county its coverage map does not show 100% coverage like the Trump map. The comparison suffers from spatial resolution issues.",

      "text": "Verizon Wireless rolls out new Ellipsis 8 HD tablet By 0 \nIt was two years ago when Verizon announced the Ellipsis 8 to add to consumer options. This time, it’s introducing an upgraded version–the Ellipsis 8 HD. Okay, so there’s the addition of HD but we’re expecting it to perform faster and better than the old model. Adding an HD display makes a big difference especially in this time and age when most content are going hi-def. What’s the point of fast HD streaming if you don’t have a nice display to enjoy it with. \nThe Ellipsis 8 HD comes equipped with an 8-inch Full HD screen that offers smoother graphics and more vivid colors. You can only get it from Verizon just like the other Ellipsis tablets. It already connects to Verizon’s 4G LTE network so you are free to browse and stream in without any interruption. \nReadily available in retail and online Verizon stores, the new Ellipsis 8 HD includes access to Verizon’s Tech Coach for two years. That’s free and unlimited so users always have access to Verizon’s tech support, tips, and content. It’s available with a valid Verizon service plan. \nOther specs include an octa-core processor, 3GB RAM, 8MP rear camera with f/2.0 lens, selfie cam with flash selfie widget, dual front firing stereo speakers, and smart amp sound technology. Device is available in two color options: Arctic Grey and Midnight Blue. \nPrice tag reads $249.99 (FRP) but you can get it on instalment, zero interest for two years with a $10.41 monthly fee. Buy a Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD on Verizon Wireless with an active tablet data plan.",

      "text": "Unlike T-Mobile, which made a pretty big fuss over its next promotional BOGO arrangement , valid this weekend only, America’s number one wireless service provider didn’t even issue a press release previewing its own BOGO package for new Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, Google Pixel, Pixel XL or LG V20 adopters.\nGranted, Verizon merely takes 50 percent off the full retail price of your second device of equal or lesser value compared to the first, also conditioning the whole thing on your willingness to go for a monthly payment plan.\nStill, for a “limited time” (no word on exactly how long), you can save between $325 on a “diminutive” Pixel and $396 if for some reason you want to purchase two of Big Red’s Note 7-replacing S7 Edge units. Or $336 on a Galaxy S7 and LG V20 , or $375 for a combination of two Pixel XL s.\nThere might be other strings attached Verizon “neglects” to list on its official website, and any gadget acquisition so close to Black Friday and Cyber Monday has a high risk of ensuing remorse. Bottom line, take your time, perhaps seek customer support to read you all the fine print, and only do the BOGO dance when you fully understand what it entails.\nThe post Verizon quietly kicks off buy-one-get-one-half-off Galaxy S7, Pixel and LG V20 deal appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 11th, 2016 \nVerizon is hosting a big sale to get their holiday shopping season started. The offer is buy one, get one half off some of their best phones, including the Google Pixel and Pixel XL , LG V20 , Moto Z Force Droid, Moto Z Droid, Samsung Galaxy S7 , and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge . You can even throw an iPhone in there if the other person you’re buying for isn’t into robots. \nAs usual, the devices you buy can be mixed and matched, so you don’t have to buy identicals if you have different preferences. The discount will be applied to the full retail cost of the second phone you buy, and the monthly or down payment cost after that discount will be due at checkout. \nUnfortunately, Verizon didn’t provide much more details in the fine print than that, but we’ll be combing to see if there are any gotchas waiting. In our experience, they are typically straight forward with the details of their deals, so if you think this is the perfect time to plunge for that new smartphone then go right ahead. (But with Black Friday so close, we wouldn’t blame you for holding off).",

      "text": "by Sean Buckley | Nov 11, 2016 7:38am \nVerizon says that when it completes its purchase of XO Communications , the service provider will not only have a larger swath of wireless spectrum, but also a fiber network that can satisfy its wireline and wireless needs. \nRELATED: Verizon FiOS rebounds in Q3, adds 90K subs following labor strike \nJohn Stratton, EVP and president of operations for Verizon, told investors during the Wells Fargo Securities Technology, Media and Telecom event that its fiber assets remain important to both its wireless and wireline businesses particularly in cities like Boston. \n“The fact is both the spectrum and the fiber assets are very interesting, and the fact is we love what the spectrum will allow us to do in the context of 5G,” Stratton said. “If you think about Verizon and what we used to call Verizon Business and the metro and long haul assets we have, it’s a nice complement.” \nBy including the pending acquisition of XO Communications into its fiber fold, Verizon will have a fiber footprint in 45 of the top 50 U.S. cities. \nVerizon said it chose to expand in Boston because of the opportunity to leverage its fiber footprint to support its wireless densification efforts. \n“As we think about the marriage of wireless densification and the fiber that supports it, it’s a big deal,” Stratton said. “We’re doing some things now in a very concentrated way to really lever up those assets meaningfully.” \nIn April, Verizon broke its moratorium on new FiOS builds by establishing an agreement with Boston via a $300 million, six-year investment plan that will replace the city's aging copper network infrastructure with fiber. \nAs part of its build-out strategy, Verizon will install the fiber throughout the city on a neighborhood basis. \nUnder this plan, Verizon will start replacing copper with fiber in Dorchester, West Roxbury and the Dudley Square neighborhood. Later deployments will take place Hyde Park, Mattapan, and other areas of Roxbury and Jamaica Plain. \nThrough the partnership with Boston and the resulting fiber build to attach small cells on city street lights and utility poles, Verizon will improve its 4G LTE wireless service. \n“With our work in Boston, one of the obvious things we have an opportunity to do now is leverage that as a common asset across all lines of the business,” Stratton said. “It’s funny when we talk about this, we go and do the design work and say what would the infrastructure need to be if I was supporting with a common fiber plant my wireless needs for densification, the FiOS business, and supporting enterprise customers.” \nStopping short of naming another city where it would have a mixed case use for its fiber to satisfy FiOS and wireless networks, Stratton said that the one fiber strategy does have merit. \n“We never built FiOS in Boston because when we looked at it we said it’s alright, but from a standpoint of a return profile it was a bit marginal. But when I layer in the capital leverage that we achieve by blending the uses of that common plant it changes the outlook,” Stratton said. “As I think about where I am deploying that wireless network, what else I can do with that fiber is a big deal.” \nBut even as Verizon moves forward with its FiOS and 5G plans in Boston, a growing base of communities continue to ask for the service and it’s unclear if the telco will ever respond. \nPreviously, 13 city mayors on the East Coast called on Verizon to expand its FiOS FTTH network into more areas that have limited access to high-speed services.

      "title": "Verizon, AT&T at the Cusp of Complete Wireless Market Penetration",
      "text": "  Verizon, AT&T at the Cusp of Complete Wireless Market Penetration The wireless subscriber base is already at over 100% market penetration. What is next? November 11, 2016 | About: VZ +0% T +0% TMUS +0% S +0% \nThe U.S. telecommunications industry is going through a huge transformation, which was triggered by the overcrowded, near-saturation stage of the market place. AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Verizon ( NYSE:VZ ) are the leading players with over half of the country's subscribers, followed distantly by T-Mobile ( NASDAQ:TMUS ) and Sprint ( NYSE:S ). \nFor a long time, subscriber additions have been the bread and butter for bringing in the extra revenue each year. At the end of the second quarter of 2016, Verizon had 142 million subscribers, followed by AT&T with 131 million. T-Mobile and Sprint reported 67 million and 58 million subscribers. As you may have noticed, the total subscriber base of the top four companies adds up to nearly 400 million, way more than the total population of the U.S., which stands around 320 to 330 million. Peter Lynch Chart of VZ \nEven if you factor out the children and senior citizens who are not in a position to take a subscription, it is clear that the penetration level has shot up over 100%. The reason why the penetration level has surpassed 100% and these companies were able to add more subscribers is because of users taking multiple connections. \nAs homes get used to multiple devices, there is still room for the subscription base to grow, but that growth definitely has an end number to it. According to Strategy Analytics, a research and consulting firm, U.S. wireless subscriptions will increase by 15 to 16 million each year through 2022. \n“ While growth has slowed in the maturing US wireless market, Strategy Analytics forecasts show the outlook is not bleak: US wireless subscriptions will add 15 to 16 million net adds per year through 2022, while gross adds will grow each year, from 113 million in 2016 to 139 million in 2022—providing plenty of room for competition.” - Strategy Analytics \nThough that forecast looks like it provides a bit of a breathing room for wireless carriers, the companies know that their days of solid stable growth are over. While the subscriber base can be grown in the short term, it definitely cannot be grown in the long term. As the largest players in the industry, Verizon and AT&T will find it extremely hard to improve their top line numbers. If the past few quarters are anything to go by, both companies are already facing a slowdown at the top. \nVerizon and AT&T have taken divergent paths to address the issue, with the former choosing to create a content empire by buying media properties such as AOL and Yahoo in an effort to build a stream of advertising revenues, while AT&T chose to go the entertainment and telecast route by buying Time Warner and DirecTV. \nBoth companies have decided to stay put in their home market and vertically integrate segments related to their core business as they continue to search for future revenue drivers. Things will be a bit more difficult for smaller companies, especially Sprint and T-Mobile, as they will have to depend on stealing customers away from the top two players. Margins will be tight and growth will be erratic at best. If they do not have diversified revenue streams, it will only make the fight for survival even harder. \nAs such, the time has come for industry-wide consolidation. But at the higher levels, the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission will not allow it. They already blocked AT&T's offer to buy T-Mobile for $39 billion a few years ago, and prevalent antitrust laws just will not allow for any major mergers at the top of the pile. \nThat is possibly what prompted these companies to look at various other options - in Verizon’s case, content and in AT&T’s case, television broadcasting. But this is not the end of the trail for these companies. As they explore new revenue streams ahead of super market penetration in the U.S., they will be looking at even more opportunities to diversify into related areas. It is inevitable. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

Literally less than a week ago, I used the Best Buy on Apple.com method on one of my lines to upgrade it. I'm trying to upgrade another line, and there is literally no option or mention of any 2 year contract pricing. Bestbuy.com still has 2 year contract options, and I've placed an order, but having another option is good. I haven't seen any mention of this on HF so I wanted some input.",

      "text": "It was two years ago when Verizon announced the Ellipsis 8 to add to consumer options. This time, it’s introducing an upgraded version–the Ellipsis 8 HD. Okay, so there’s the addition of HD but we’re expecting it to perform faster and better than the old model. Adding an HD display makes a big difference especially in this time and age when most content are going hi-def. What’s the point of fast HD streaming if you don’t have a nice display to enjoy it with.\nThe Ellipsis 8 HD comes equipped with an 8-inch Full HD screen that offers smoother graphics and more vivid colors. You can only get it from Verizon just like the other Ellipsis tablets. It already connects to Verizon’s 4G LTE network so you are free to browse and stream in without any interruption.\nReadily available in retail and online Verizon stores, the new Ellipsis 8 HD includes access to Verizon’s Tech Coach for two years. That’s free and unlimited so users always have access to Verizon’s tech support, tips, and content. It’s available with a valid Verizon service plan.\nOther specs include an octa-core processor, 3GB RAM, 8MP rear camera with f/2.0 lens, selfie cam with flash selfie widget, dual front firing stereo speakers, and smart amp sound technology. Device is available in two color options: Arctic Grey and Midnight Blue.\nPrice tag reads $249.99 (FRP) but you can get it on instalment, zero interest for two years with a $10.41 monthly fee. Buy a Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD on Verizon Wireless with an active tablet data plan.\nSOURCE: Verizon\nStory Timeline Verizon outs new Ellipsis 8 tablet to add to consumer options Logitech Type V designed for Ellipsis 8 Tablet",

      "text": "XO Fiber Assets To Boost Verizon’s Wired & Wireless Business November 11, 2016 - Written By Daniel Fuller \nAs their FiOS offerings nationwide began to dry up, Verizon made the decision to buy up XO Communications . The very clear-cut bid to save Verizon’s FiOS division seems to have all of the trappings of a decent working strategy thus far, with XO enabling Verizon to have a presence in the fiber optic frameworks of 45 out of the 50 top cities in the United States. According to Big Red’s Executive Vice President and President of Operations, John Stratton, the move will not only allow Verizon to gain ground in a lot of key markets and help to bolster their flagging FiOS efforts, but will allow them to strategically position network resources so that they can use their fiber to support their wireless network, in some places. \nAs an example of such a place, Stratton cites Boston. The geographic and demographic makeup of the city, with fiber deployment happening on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis, will allow Verizon to string up a number of small cell stations along the run of their fiber network. The small cells will provide a big boost to their 4G LTE offerings for now, but can be used to boost up their 5G network when it begins rolling out. Small cells are an important part of the 5G landscape for a number of carriers, so a move of this nature from the nation’s biggest wireless carrier is not exactly surprising. \nThe way things are right now, a huge number of communities nationwide are clamoring for Verizon’s FiOS, in sharp contrast to the sheer density and coverage of their wireless network. The amount of valuable mmWave spectrum afforded to Verizon in their XO purchase, as well as the extra fiber optic footprint, will be a big help in Big Red’s FiOS recovery, but the focus for the future is likely to be on 5G. With Google Fiber having essentially stopped in their tracks, Verizon is no longer racing against the clock to get their own fiber optic networking solution out there, and the XO acquisition looks like it will make it that much easier for Verizon to sweep up markets that they had previously underserved or neglected entirely while bolstering their 5G chops.

Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC IMSA entry 3GT Racing completes full-time driver lineup with Jack Hawksworth, Robert Alon Lexus team to debut in IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in 2017 \nNovember 11, 2016 Pinterest Email 3GT Racing has signed drivers Jack Hawksworth and Robert Alon to drive the team's No. 15 Lexus RC F GT3 in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship series in 2017. The signing of Hawksworth, a native of England, and Californian Alon completes 3GT Racing’s 2017 full-time lineup. Earlier, the team announced that Sage Karam and Scott Pruett would drive the team's No. 14 car. Hawksworth, 25, raced the past three seasons -- 49 starts -- in the Verizon IndyCar Series. The past two seasons, he drove in the series for A.J. Foyt Racing and posted a best finish of 11th place at both Elkhart Lake and St. Petersburg in 2016. Hawksworth has seven starts in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Series and was part of a winning entry in the PC class with RSR Racing at Indianapolis in 2014. Alon, 26, had three PC class wins and four poles in the IMSA WeatherTech series for PR1/Mathiasen Motorsports in 2016. Team principal Paul Gentilozzi said that Hawksworth and Alon were hired after a 10-driver tryout in Michigan in September. \"We have been very fortunate to have an opportunity to test many prospective drivers for our program,\" Gentilozzi said. \"Choosing Robert and Jack was the result of our team's analysis of both their on-track driving, social skills, fit in our structure and competitive maturity. \"That maturity does not always mean just the number of years they have raced, it reflects on their ability to bring our Lexus to the finish every race.\" Robert Alon celebrates a pole-winning effort at Circuit of the America earlier this year.

      "text": "Verizon delays shipment of 128GB Google Pixel XL by more than two weeks Verizon delays shipment of 128GB Google Pixel XL by more than two weeks Posted: Tags : Verizon - Verizon + Android - Android + Google - Google + The Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL are the first handsets to be designed by Google. They are both manufactured by HTC, and in the U.S. the only carrier selling the phones is Verizon (more on this 'exclusive' later). One of our loyal PhoneArena readers happened to order the 128GB version of the Pixel XL. According to an email he sent to us today, his phone was supposed to have been shipped today. Instead, he received some bad news.Verizon sent our reader an emailed notification on Friday that probably took the air out of his balloon. Instead of getting word that his 128GB Pixel XL had shipped as expected, he received notification that his order has been delayed. According to Verizon, the phone will now ship on November 26th. \"Looks like you have great taste,\" screamed the top of Big Red's missive. Verizon added that the 128GB Pixel XL is so popular, that the carrier doesn't have enough inventory in stock to ship the order on time. Has anyone else received a similar notification from Verizon pertaining to a delay in the shipping of their 128GB Pixel XL order?We also wanted to point out that even though the phone is supposed to be a Verizon exclusive, it will work with other carriers. You might recall that T-Mobile is running a promotion that will return half the cost of a 32GB Google Pixel ($325) to anyone who has his Pixel activated on T-Mobile. The carrier's CEO John Legere says that the handset has been tested on T-Mobile's LTE pipeline. \nVerizon delays shipment of 128GB Google Pixel XL by 15-days Thanks for the tip!",

      "text": "Verizon Delays Shipment Of 128GB Pixel XL Smartphones By 2 Weeks   23:11 PST \nIf you’re trying to get your hands on Google ’s Pixel smartphones but you’re having a tough time, Google knows this. Last month the company stated that they were working on getting more inventory as demand for the new phones was more than the company had expected , which we guess is a pretty good problem to have. \nHowever it seems that this has also extended to Verizon because if you’re looking to purchase the 128GB Pixel XL phone, you could be in for a wait. According to user reports , it seems that the Pixel XL smartphones are being delayed by as much as 2 weeks, although this seems to apply more towards the larger 128GB Pixel XL smartphone. \nIf anything this seems to suggest that customers are leaning more towards phones with more storage, which then again given that the Pixel smartphones have fixed storage with no memory expansion slot, shouldn’t be a surprise. We’re not sure how widespread this delay is and if every 128GB Pixel XL order has been affected, or only those who might have ordered it at a certain point in time. \nIn any case if you did place an order and haven’t received it yet, do check your Verizon account page to see if you have been notified of any potential delays. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "text": "11/12/16 AT 4:52 AM Close \nThe Google Pixel series has faced high demand ever since the device was launched in October. The 128GB Pixel XL device was supposed to ship Saturday, but the company has sent out emails notifying users that it will now ship the device on Nov. 26, Phone Arena reported late Friday. \nThe company email, however, doesn't contain further details except telling the users that they have “great taste” and that the product has run out of stock. Verizon is currently the only company retailing the phones. Related Stories After A Spring Of Strikes, Verizon Closes Five Service Centers \nPromotions for Google Pixel series have already begun rolling out. For instance, T-Mobile is offering half the value of the 32GB device, which is $325, to consumers who activate the device on T-Mobile. Google Pixel is currently the only device that has been tested on T-Mobile LTE pipeline. \nThe Pixel devices are the replacement for Google's flagship Nexus range of devices. They have been manufactured by HTC and designed by Google itself and offer new Google features such as Allo and Duo.

      "text": "\nNice one Verizon : fans of the Google Pixel phone are reporting multiple shipping delays, with some folks apparently not due to receive their devices before mid-December. One reader submitted an email from Verizon to Phone Arena , sent on the day he was expecting to receive his 128 GB Pixel, only to find out that shipping has been delayed by another two weeks.\nSee also: Google Pixel successfully hacked, exploit to be patched 17 hours ago We already knew that Google is experiencing higher than expected demand for the first Google-branded phone . There have also been various Reddit threads tracking delivery status and wait times for various Pixel models. But the comments section on the post by Phone Arena already has more than a few tales of delayed Verizon-exclusive Pixels.\nPhone Arena \nOne reader reports an order date of November 1st with an expected shipping date of December 15. Another commenter ordered a pixel on October 22 and has been told not to expect it to be shipped “until November 28 or later”. Another reader pre-ordered the Pixel in mid-October and won’t receive his until December 2.\nHas your Pixel order been delayed? Share your experience in the comments below.",

      "title": "The best iPhone 7 deals for November",
      "text": "From AT&T to Verizon, we've rounded up the best deals we could find on Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Also, take a sneak peek at a leaked Sam's Club promotion, which bundles a $250 gift card with the purchase of any new iPhone. More Since their launch, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have sold better than expected . As we approach the holidays, demand for Apple’s latest smartphone is expected to increase. Fortunately, retailers are offering various deals and trade-in offers to help offset the cost of the new iPhone.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best iPhone 7 deals you can get today. You’ll notice there are no T-Mobile deals at the moment, but fear not. There’s a reason they call themselves the “Uncarrier” network and it’s likely they’ll have something to offer as we inch closer to Black Friday. In the meantime, here are the deals you can act on now.\nVerizon Wireless Verizon’s iPhone 7 deal is pretty straightforward: Buy a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with monthly device payments, trade in your old iPhone, and received up to a $300 credit you can apply to your new phone. The iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5S will snag you a $100 credit, whereas the iPhone SE will land you a $200 credit. Meanwhile, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will get you a $300 credit. The phones must be in good working and cosmetic condition to qualify and the trade-in credit will be applied to your monthly bill over 24 months. Earlier in the year Verizon offered a slightly stronger deal with a $650 credit. Nevertheless, its current offer is still a great way to lower the cost of admission for a new iPhone.\nUp to $300 credit at Verizon Wireless\nAT&T AT&T is currently offering one of the best iPhone deals you’ll find. It requires that you purchase your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus via AT&T’s Next plan, but otherwise you’ll get a generous $650 credit when you trade-in your older iPhone. This is the same promo AT&T offered earlier in the season and essentially guarantees you a new iPhone 7 on the house.\n$650 credit at AT&T\nTarget Sprint users who want to save on Apple’s latest iPhone will want to make sure they shop at Target. The retailer is taking $100 off the cost of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus when you purchase from them and activate your phone on Sprint. (The savings also apply to Verizon and AT&T, but their trade-in promos above offer a better incentive). Just make sure to act fast because this sale ends Saturday, November 5.\n$100 off at Target\nBest Buy Best Buy is offering its customers a free $100 egift card with the purchase and activation of any Verizon smartphone, including the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While that’s not as strong as the Verizon offer previously mentioned, it’s a respectable alternative, especially if you don’t have an iPhone you can currently trade in.\n$100 gift card at Best Buy\nSam’s Club Leaked copies of Samsung’s Black Friday ad indicate that the retailer will offer its members a $250 Sam’s Club Gift Card and a waived activation fee with the purchase of any iPhone. Keep in mind this is a gift card and not a credit, so you’re still responsible for the full price of your iPhone. Also, Sam’s Club memberships start at $45 per year.\n$250 gift card at Sam’s Club\nHow to order the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Nike+ Apple Watch Hot potato! How to ditch your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 before it explodes The best iPhone 7 deals for every carrier",

      "text": "John Malone says sports is like 'a little bit of cocaine' \nVerizon doesn’t own Yahoo yet, but it has given every indication the deal is moving forward despite all the fallout from the Yahoo e-mail hack. \nOne surprising turn is that Tim Armstrong, who runs Verizon’s AOL unit, has been chatting with Quicken Loans chief Dan Gilbert about ways they can jointly fortify Yahoo Finance, one of Yahoo’s rare success stories. \nGilbert, of course, fielded a $5 billion offer for Yahoo, but ultimately lost out to Verizon’s bid, which was $4.8 billion, but didn’t include Yahoo’s patents. We hear that two execs connected recently in Gilbert’s hometown of Detroit. \nMeanwhile, Verizon may not be done acquiring content. Our sources say the phone company has Vice on its hit list to fulfil its strategy of capturing millennials with a mobile-delivered flytrap. Vice already creates content for Verizon, but Verizon may also be interested in owning a piece of the mini-media empire alongside Disney. Share this: ",

I bought it a little over a year ago but have moved to a different phone. This phone lived with a hard plastic case and a screen protector all its life. It has absolutely no scratches on the screen or shell anywhere. It looks as if you just bought it new. I still have the original box, paperwork and charger to go with. I'll include the case as well and leave the screen protector for you to take off if you want. I ordered this off MotoMaker so it's the black edition with blue accents on the front and back. IMEI is clean and I would be willing to meet at a Verizon store to prove if necessary. It does not include a SIM card or MicroSD card. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5874616844",
