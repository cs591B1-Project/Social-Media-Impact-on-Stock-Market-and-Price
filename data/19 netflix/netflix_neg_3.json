      "text": "2 mins ago Courtesy of Netflix \n“Even after the election craziness, I find myself still thinking about this series,” says forum poster FrozenBarbie in reaction to the Netflix series “ The Crown .” That’s high praise indeed after possibly the most controversial election result in modern American history, but the rest of the reactions in our message boards echo that praise for the series, which follows the early reign of England’s Queen Elizabeth II ( Claire Foy ). Photo Gallery: ‘The Crown’ cast – Here’s your cheat sheet guide for the characters of Season 1 \n“The Crown” debuted its entire 10-episode first season on November 4, and it’s reportedly one of the most expensive productions Netflix has produced. But the reviews were largely glowing, and if the responses in our message board are any indication it could pay off with awards for lead actress Foy as well as her co-stars Matt Smith (as Prince Philip), John Lithgow (as Winston Churchill) and Jared Harris (as King George VI), and director Stephen Daldry . \nRead some of their spoiler-free comments below, and join the discussion in our forums . \nFrozenBarbie : Even after the election craziness, I find myself still thinking about this series … As amazing as Harris and Lithgow were, I think I continued to watch merely because Foy was just so captivating and mesmerizing. She really was perfect. Well done, you. She would have my vote for the Emmy, so far. ‘The Crown’ reviews: Expensive Netflix gamble pays off with raves for Claire Foy & Matt Smith \nAtypical : Sensational pilot! Daldry is coming for his directing Emmy, and from the looks of this episode everyone should place this into the Drama Series frontrunner position now … Claire Foy is radiant. Best Drama Actress just locked up a slot. \nforwardswill : Up to episode three. Claire Foy truly is stunning in this role. I’d love to see her win the Emmy. \nAMG : I am also loving Matt Smith as the enigmatic Duke of Edinburgh. The fact that the real man is so brilliant may help with this in some way. John Lithgow is also compelling to watch. His Churchill is so complexly layered, it allows Lithgow to play with the material to high impact. Predict the Golden Globe nominations now; change them till December 12 \nDo you think “The Crown” will be a big Golden Globe hit? Be sure to make your Golden Globe predictions so that Hollywood insiders can see how this series is faring in our Golden Globe odds . You can keep changing your predictions right up until just before   December 12 at 5:00 am PT/8:00 am ET.   .

      "text": "Netflix is Adding These War Movies a Week After Veterans Day Netflix knows things has changed a lot over the years. Netflix November 10, 2016 \nN etflix chose to honor veterans in November 2016 by adding nine historical war films to its catalog. The majority of these films that Netflix has added were produced in the 1940s, and are stark reminders of the difference between the experience of service members then and now. There’s a new movie about the American Civil War, a John Ford World War II documentary, Frank Capra’s propaganda films, and more. The sum is a sometimes moving historical lesson about American war. \nWhereas war today is increasingly about artificial intelligence, the use of drones , cyber attacks , and trucks that utilize bullet-resistant armor and hydrogen fuel cells , that was certainly not the experience of the men and women serving during the World Wars or even Vietnam. The past was about tanks, trenches, and dying far too easily from an infected bullet wound to the leg. \nBelow, find a list of the war films going up on Netflix in November, so you can honor — and remember — those who served in your own way. Unfortunately, some are not available until a week after Veterans Day, and are noted as such in italics. Consider this your preview. Men Go to Battle (2015) \nIn 1861, a farmer from Kentucky tries to maintain his family’s crumbling estate. He soon finds out that his missing brother is fighting for the Union army rather than helping hold their lives together. November 15 . The Battle of Midway (1942) \nAn American documentary film short directed by John Ford. If you’re looking for in-color war footage of a real battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II, this is the one for you. November 18 . Prelude to War (1942) \nThis was the first film in Frank Capra’s famous Why We Fight series of war propaganda films. Its soul purpose at the time was convince American troops of the importance of taking on Nazi Germany and the Axis Powers during World War II, but now it’s just equal parts sobering and entertaining. November 18 . San Pietro (1945) \nSan Pietro is a documentary film shot by Jules Buck and directed by John Huston. It focuses on the Battle of San Pietro Infine, which was sixty miles from Naples during World War II. It was released to the public in 1945 but shown to troops before that. November 18 . 'Thunderbolt' Thunderbolt (1947) \nIf you’re looking for high-flying WWII firefights, then this is the documentary you need to check out. It follows the events of “Operation Strangle,” and was shot in 16mm by members of the Army Air Forces with cameras mounted on some P-47s and a B-25 bomber. November 18 . Tunisian Victory (1944) \nA propaganda film for the North Africa Campaign of WWII. Like any good propaganda film, it focuses on the victories. Ultimately, we get to see some of the liberation of Tunis and a rockin’ collaboration between the American and British forces. November 18 . 'How to Operate Behind Enemy Lines' Undercover: How to Operate Behind Enemy Lines (1943) \nSpies, spies, and more spies. The title tells it all, really. This is a training film for OSS agents who get dropped behind enemy lines. Learn cover and concealment techniques, as well as the proper way to ambush the enemy. November 18 . Why We Fight: The Battle of Russia (1943) \nAnother film in Frank Capra’s line of Why We Fight propaganda films. This one’s the longest film in the series, coming in at 83 minutes. Also, here’s a reminder that we can’t account for the accuracy of any of these propaganda films. There’s a reason why these things worked, after all. November 18 . WWII: Report from the Aleutians (1943) \nCreated by the U.S. Army Signal Corp, this final film is a documentary about the Aleutian Islands Campaign during World War II, directed and narrated by John Huston. November 18 . Caitlin Busch @C_BuschM \nCaitlin is a Culture intern and does most of her work in the Brave New Worlds channel. She recently made the move from Kansas City to Brooklyn, where she thinks there are some really awesome dogs to be seen and some really good coffee shops to be explored.",

      "text": "With the public appetite for true-crime realism at an all-time high following the groundbreaking success of 2015’s Making A Murderer , it was only a matter of time before Netflix greenlit a new spate of docudramas.\nCaptive is the first of the next wave to emerge and deals with the grim world of hostage-taking. Split into eight parts, each episode explores hostage situations from not only the perspective of the captive, but everyone else involved, including the hostage-takers, families, negotiators, and government officials. The series has been produced by Lightbox, with The Bourne Identity director Doug Liman also contributing heavily.\n“Hostage taking is an issue that people are familiar with, but apart from those directly involved, nobody really knows much about,” said Lightbox’s Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn in an interview with Variety back in May. “Each episode of ‘Captive’ will reflect the tension that arises from the life and death stakes involved but also truly reveal the complexity inherent in every hostage crisis.”\nWatch the first trailer for the upcoming series above, and then read why fellow Netflix series Black Mirror is currently unmissable.\n",

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services.

      "text": "Share this article Black Mirror \nThis modern Twilight Zone-esque show is the newest Netflix hit. A British TV network produced the first two seasons but for season 3 Netflix has picked up the series. Each episode features a completely different cast and completely unrelated story each more chilling and suspenseful than the last. It’s not quite a horror show but more of an on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller. Shameless \nNot a Netflix original, but one of my current on-Netflix obsessions. This Showtime series follows the adventures of a single alcoholic father and his 6 children. Father, Frank, spends most of his time at the bar. The Gallagher children, led by 21-year-old Fiona, manage to raise themselves in spite of Frank's lack of parenting. Seasons 1-6 are available on Netflix right now. Jessica Jones \nThis badass superhero is a flawless mixture of Veronica Mars and Black Widow. Krysten Ritter stars as Jessica Jones, a former superhero who runs her own private investigation agency. All episodes of the first season premiered on November 20, 2015. The series has a film noir atmosphere and tackles serious issues like sexual assault and PTSD. Netflix renewed Jessica Jones for a second season in January 2016, but it doesn’t look like it’s coming anytime before early 2018. Luke Cage \nAlso from Marvel is the Jessica Jones spin-off, Luke Cage. Mike Colter stars as Luke Cage, crime-fighter with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin. The series comments on race, politics, and the Black Lives Matter movement. The third Marvel Cinematic Universe show to come out on Netflix, there are many tie-ins to the other shows and the Universe as a whole Degrassi: Next Class \nEveryone’s favorite pre-teen melodrama (or at least mine???) is not over and it never went away. After a successful 3 previous series in the 80s, Degrassi: The Next Generation ran on a combination of MTV, CTV, and TeenNick for 14 seasons. After being canceled by TeenNick, Netflix picked up the story, actors, and good old Degrassi Community School with Degrassi: Next Class. This 2-season continuation deals with modern issues like sexting, rape culture, and discrimination with the same somewhat awkward mood of the early teen years that the older seasons had. Also a bonus: there’s a high school reunion episode with all of the best of Degrassi: The Next Generation! Master of None \n​ \nAziz Ansari. Enough said. He is hilarious. Starring Ansari, the series is about Dev, a 30-year-old actor trying to make it in NYC and it is a fantastic comedy. The episodes are pretty short so I watched the entire series in two days.

      "text": "Courtesy of Amazon November 10, 2016 | 08:38AM PT \nShares of Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Netflix and Google fell in morning trading Thursday, as tech investors evidently have grown more concerned that President-elect Donald Trump will adopt unfavorable policies toward Silicon Valley. \nIn mid-morning trading, shares of Netflix, Facebook and Amazon fell more than 4%. Apple’s stock was down 2.9%, while Google declined 3.4%. That’s below broader market indices, with the S&P 500 down 0.2% and the Nasdaq off 1.16%. \nAs a candidate, Trump had called for a boycott of Apple products over its refusal to cooperate with federal agents investigating the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, and has urged the company to bring its manufacturing operations to the U.S. \nTrump also has charged that Amazon is a monopoly that has avoided paying billions in taxes — and has accused CEO Jeff Bezos of buying the Washington Post, which has been a frequently critic of Trump, as a tax dodge. Meanwhile, the mogul/reality TV star turned U.S. president has indicated that he opposes the FCC’s network neutrality regulations — leading to speculation he will try to repeal the rules, which would be a setback for companies like Google, Netflix, Facebook and Amazon. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos posted a congratulatory tweet to Trump on Thursday, apparently seeking to build a bridge to the new administration after Trump’s harsh criticism of his company: Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 Filed Under:",

      "text": "COMMENTS Courtesy of Netflix \"Everyone in my office is like, 'You have a responsibility, you have a voice and you need to use it, and you have to be here.'\" \nChelsea Handler hosted an emotional post-election episode of her Netflix show on Wednesday. \n\"Obviously the result is not what I was hoping for,\" said Handler. \"Like a lot of people in this country I'm sad, I'm disappointed and I'm confused, but if Hillary [Clinton] can make it through a concession speech then I can make it through a stupid television show.\" \nHandler interviewed Senator Barbara Boxer, who got choked up when talking about how she hasn't spoken to Clinton yet about her loss. Handler got emotional in response, saying, \"I know for a woman, as a woman it feels so sexist.\" \nShe started crying and said, \"I guess the message that I want to spread out to other women is exactly what you're saying, is not to give up. Sorry, I hate f---ing crying on camera.\" \nHandler continued, \"It's so easy to say throw in the towel and that we're going to leave or I'm going to move to Spain, because I want to move to Spain. I really, really want to move to Spain right now.\" \nBefore Trump won, Handler had repeatedly talked about moving to her house in Spain should he become president. \"I did buy a house in another country just in case, so all of these people that threaten to leave the country and then don't — I will leave the country,\" she said this past May. \nHandler said that her co-workers have spoken to her about staying and using her platform instead. \"Everyone in my office is like 'You have a responsibility, you have a voice and you need to use it, and you have to be here,'\" she said. \nThrough their disappointment, Handler and Boxer shared a message of hope and resilience. \"My heart is on the floor,\" admitted Boxer, but she said it's important to focus that a person is not defined by how they act when they are in despair. \n\"It's not where you are when you're high and doing great, it's when you fall down,\" said Boxer, adding \"A lot of us are on the ground right now. \nBoxer pointed out that Clinton won the popular vote and spoke about the complexity of the electoral college and what it would take to change it. She also quoted Martin Luther King's words about the arc of history bending towards justice and the Preamble to the Constitution discussing finding a more perfect union. \n\"When you say, 'I want to leave, I want to go,' of course — it's the flight syndrome,\" Boxer told Handler, \"That's just what the people who gave this hateful message want us to do and we're not going to do it.\"",

      "text": "Print Save Photo: Courtesy of Duff Goldman \nThose who like to Netflix and chill with old episodes of Food Network shows like Alton Brown’s Good Eats , Ace of Cakes , Iron Chef America and Giada at Home have just a month and a half left to get their fix. \nCome the end of the year, all of the Food Network shows on Netflix will disappear , along with the shows from other members of the Scripps Networks family, meaning the Cooking Channel and the Travel Channel as well. RELATED Alton Brown's ‘Good Eats' Will Make a Triumphant Return » \nAccording to Fox , Ken Lowe, the COO of the company, explains, “If you look at where the industry is going . . . we just see a lot of opportunities . . . .” So perhaps those shows will pop up on other streaming services down the line. \nIn the meantime, Netflix is still working on another season of its hit docuseries, Chef’s Table , which will release in 2017, and Brown’s launching a sequel to Good Eats as a web series. So there will be plenty of delicious things to hunker down and watch this winter.

      "text": "print \nClaire Foy and Matt Smith as Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, on \"The Crown.\" Robert Viglasky/Netflix \nNetflix says it will produce a whopping 1,000 hours of original TV shows and movies in 2017, and that's a good thing since people keep watching more and more Netflix. \nThe number of hours of Netflix the average subscriber watches has gone up steadily since 2011, at an average of 16.4% per year. In 2011, using Netflix data, we can estimate that each subscriber watched about 51 minutes of Netflix per day (310 hours per year). And while official Netflix data hasn't come out yet for this year, CordCutting.com estimated that for 2016, users are on track to stream 600 hours of content each, on average. \nIf that's true, it means that the average Netflix subscriber watches about 12 DAYS more Netflix in a year than they did in 2011! \nHere's a chart from CordCutting.com that shows the progression (these numbers only reflect the official data from Netflix, which we only have through 2015): \nNetflix \nThe steadiness of this rise suggests Netflix hasn't hampered its appeal by leaning heavily into original TV shows and movies, which it began producing in 2013. \nParticularly heartening for Netflix should be its popularity among younger viewers. In a Piper Jaffray survey of 10,000 US teens released last month , 37% of teens said they watched Netflix every day. Every day! \nNetflix's big competitors, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, came in way below Netflix at just 3% each. That means Netflix is over 12 times as popular in terms of daily use. \nHere is the full chart from Piper Jaffray: \nPiper Jaffray",

Thursday was was not a good day for technology stocks.\nIn late-morning trade, shares of tech giant Apple dropped more than 2.9 percent, while the so-called FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet ) all dropped at least 3.5 percent. Apple, Facebook , Amazon and Netflix also fell into correction territory, or down at least 10 percent from their 52-week high.\nThe drop in these stocks led to a momentary 2 percent dip in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\nPeter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said the prospect of higher interest rates is pressuring tech stocks, particularly the FANGs. These stocks \"don't like higher interest rates because higher interest rates exposes things that are overvalued,\" he said.\nThe Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet next month and is largely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\nRegarding Apple, analysts at Baird said in a note Wednesday that \"meaningful changes in global trade policies could have a negative impact\" following Republican Donald Trump 's surprising victory over Hillary Clinton . Baird also said that \"with $238 billion of cash and equivalents, and 91% of that overseas, Apple could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a potential cash repatriation tax holiday or change in corporate tax rates.\"\nApple 12-month chart Source: FactSet\nDisclaimer",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix November 10, 2016 | 10:00AM PT \nAs one of the wildest, most unpredictable, and most distressing election seasons in American history finally draws to a close this week, journalists and commentators can be forgiven for barely dragging themselves past the finish line. The endless contretemps between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump developed so quickly, with so many bizarre sudden scandals and shifts of momentum, that it was all but impossible to keep up: When it came to the election, late-night sketches, magazine covers, podcasts, and even TV news segments frequently risked becoming woefully out of date before they could even reach an audience. This story first appeared in the November 08, 2016 issue of Variety. Subscribe today. See more. \nFilm, for obvious reasons, tends to have a far longer lag time when it comes to dealing with political issues. Yet this year’s crop of documentary contenders, for reasons both intentional and seemingly accidental, have provided more than adequate supplementary viewing for this historic election. \nAva DuVernay ’s “13th,” released last month on Netflix after bowing at the New York Film Festival, is perhaps one of the most striking. DuVernay’s film traces the roots of everything from prison labor to myths of black criminality, police brutality, and Black Lives Matter, all the way back to an oddly worded clause in the titular Constitutional amendment. With interviewees ranging from former prison inmates to such academics as Jelani Cobb to conservative figures Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist, the film has little trouble elucidating current ramifications of hundred-plus-year-old history. \nA shocking late-film montage combines Donald Trump’s belligerent rhetoric toward protesters with clips of brutality from the civil-rights demonstrations. The juxtapositions were so effective that a DNC staffer tweeted out a clip from the film, unattributed. DuVernay shot back on Twitter that her filmmaking was not intended “as political propaganda.” Indeed, the film trains its sights just as ruthlessly on Bill Clinton as on his GOP counterparts, and includes Hillary Clinton’s now infamous “superpredators” comments. “13th” is certainly not political propaganda; what it ultimately offers, to borrow Woodrow Wilson’s famous description of “Birth of a Nation,” which receives appropriately jaundiced discussion in the film, is current events written with lightning. \nMuch more unintentionally relevant to recent events is Elyse Steinberg and Josh Kriegman’s “ Weiner .” Following the disgraced New York congressman Anthony Weiner as he attempts to rebuild a political career derailed by his sexting misadventures, the directors were there to capture the inspiring flickers of a comeback story, only to then become witnesses to yet another collapse, as Weiner’s campaign was wracked by new revelations of impropriety. \nIf the film presented a first-hand view of farce turning to tragedy at its Sundance debut, the continuing rollout saw the story take an even more absurdist twist, as Weiner was accused of yet more texting impropriety, this time with a minor. The subsequent investigation led to a major election story in itself, when FBI director James Comey announced that new emails relating to its investigation of Clinton’s servers had surfaced. They arose due to the investigation into the latest affaire Weiner. \nWhile the filmmakers couldn’t have possibly imagined how bizarrely intertwined Weiner’s story would become with the general election, the film makes for equally astounding and confounding viewing today. At times it does arouse a bemused sympathy for Weiner, who had the misfortune of having his most humiliating peccadillos exposed at the moment when the media were most primed to make the most of them. But the ultimate exasperation one feels with his misdeeds has only expanded into anger and disbelief at just how much damage one man’s personal failings can cause to ever-widening circles of innocent bystanders. \nDamage to innocent bystanders, of a much more tragic nature, was also a theme with such documentaries as Kim A. Snyder’s “ Newtown ” and Keith Maitland’s “Tower.” The former tackles one of the most horrifying mass shootings in recent memory, that of Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre; the latter tackles one of the first mass shootings of the modern age, Charles Whitman’s 1966 clock tower shooting spree at the University of Texas. And both tackle their subjects in a manner that couldn’t be more removed from the stats heavy agitprop of “Bowling for Columbine” or its descendants. Snyder’s film adopts an almost fugue-like tone, interviewing and gently probing parents of Sandy Hook victims. Many of her subjects are in fact gun-control activists, but “Newtown” isn’t a film about policy, it’s a film about grief. \nWhereas Snyder’s film sensitively sidesteps some of the more upsetting details of the shootings, Maitland’s film looks to make them feel newly visceral. Presenting survivor testimonies alongside re-creations of the fateful day crafted through Rotoscoped, mostly black-and-white animation, “Tower” brings every second of the attack into disquieting life. Aside from the harrowing details, the film also gives pause in the way it details how people reacted to the incident before mass shootings were such common occurrences — back when the phrases “active shooter” and “lockdown” were not part of the common parlance. \nBoth “Newtown” and “Tower” felt uneasily relevant after the Pulse nightclub shootings in Orlando, and “Tower’s” festival bow was especially fraught with meaning — it premiered at the SXSW Film Festival, within miles of the UT clock tower, several months before a new law went into effect that made concealed handguns legal on that very campus. \nFor all the instances of ISIS being used as a bloody punchline this year by candidates promising blunt military solutions to the war in Syria, two standout documentaries offered valuable context. Gianfranco Rosi’s “Fire at Sea,” which is Italy’s first documentary to be entered as the country’s foreign-language Oscar contender, uses the tiny Sicilian island of Lampedusa as a microcosm of the refugee crisis. Rather than tackle the entire geopolitical matter, Rosi zeroes in on regular people — such as the island’s only doctor, or a fisherman’s son who becomes the film’s moral guide — as entry points into an overwhelming subject. Much closer to the conflict, Brian Oakes’ “Jim: The James Foley Story” introduces us to the journalist who became ISIS’ first American victim. After a year in which journalists were categorically derided to an alarming degree, it was instructive to be reminded of how much conflict-zone reporters risk to bring necessary stories to light, and sobering to see the scale of empathy expressed by a man who would have been the first to be forgiven for lacking it. \nThough not explicitly political, it was difficult not to be reminded of election year narratives when watching docs including Alex Gibney’s “Zero Hour,” which rings alarm bells for the looming threat of cyberwar, and Robert Kenner’s “Command and Control,” about a harrowing near-nuclear catastrophe in Damascus, Ark., in 1980. A pair of abortion docs added needed context to an issue that was only discussed in its most cartoonish form during the presidential debates — Dawn Porter’s “Trapped” was an incisive look at the laws and governmental red-tape used to limit abortion access in certain states, while Tracy Droz Tragos’ “Abortion: Stories Women Tell” compiled more human-level accounts. \nWhile a number of 2016 documentarians were shooting for posterity, Fisher Stevens’ comprehensive global warming documentary, “Before the Flood,” was strategically designed to be an election day companion. Following Leonardo DiCaprio on a tour of climate hot-spots, the film presents as visually engaging an account of the precarious state of the planet as one could hope for. The filmmakers released the film free just last week, hoping it would help to sway voters on the eve of balloting. Ironically, with all of the ridiculous and lurid controversies that have dominated election coverage, discussion of Planet Earth’s tenuous future inhabitability has barely made a ripple.

      "text": "Nov 10, 2016 9:47 AM Screenshot: Assassin's Creed Syndicate/Ubisoft Share Tweet \nWe’re a little more than a month away from finding out if Michael Fassbender’s Assassin’s Creed movie will finally be the first halfway decent video game-to-film adaptation. But before we see whether it was capable of clearing that impossibly low bar, Ubisoft, the company behind the film and games, has reportedly marked its next cross-media target: a Netflix original series. According to Reuters , Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told reporters the company is in talks with Netflix to produce a show, but he did not mention which of the publisher’s many games were on the table. \nThis is the latest in a relatively long list of attempts to branch into TV and film for the company. In addition to Assassin’s Creed , Ubisoft is also looking to get started on a film adaptation of The Division , its game about shooting bad guys and collecting hoodies in a plague-ridden New York City. And before all that, there was the aggressively mediocre Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Ubisoft has some TV experience, as well, having produced three seasons of Nickelodeon’s Rabbids Invasion cartoon, based on the dimwitted mutant bunnies of the Raving Rabbid s games. Unless Netflix wants to get into big-budget shows starring guys who love sneaking and murder, the animated route seems like a sensible one. Come to think of it, a Grow Home adaptation about the cosmic adventures of a cute uncoordinated robot sounds pretty good right about now.",

      "text": "As if the world weren't dark enough already, here's an extra bit of bad news: All the Food Network shows are leaving Netflix, along with HGTV, DIY Network and the Discovery Channel's series.\nThe reason, as reported by / Film , is that Scripps , the company that owns and operates these networks, is letting its deal with Netflix from 2014 lapse. Since Netflix shows all of its programs without advertising, thus depriving Scripps of any potential ad revenue, Scripps CEO Kenneth Lowe reportedly said on an earnings call that the company was losing money.\nThe deal is over at the end of 2016, so there are a few precious weeks left to cram in as much Chopped , Guy's Grocery Games and Cutthroat Kitchen as one person can.\nSource: Food Network/YouTube Though the shows leaving Netflix are hardly your grandmother's cooking shows — no Sandra Lee or Ina Garten here — it's still a shame that their departure coincides with one of the most uncertain periods in American history. Cooking shows can serve as a kind of comfort food for the soul; a light lift in a crowd of heavy dramas and increasingly dark comedies.\nIn other words, after a hard day, sometimes one just wants to come home and watch chefs have to make desserts out of fruit leather and pistachios on Chopped . Unfortunately, for the cable-less out there, starting in 2017 it'll be just a little bit harder to find that comfort.",

      "text": "12:05pm Share this article \nEver since Netflix announced the making of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, all of us coffee-loving, fast-talking girls have been waiting at the edge of our seats for Nov. 25. This is everything that we have been hoping for since the show ended in 2007 and I can hardly stand the anticipation. Now that we’re getting closer and closer it’s only right that we start to prepare in the most Gilmore ways possible. Here are a few things that you’ll need to do if you want to get the full experience. \nOrder take-out food \nPizza, Chinese, tacos, and burgers with fries are the go-to take-out foods that Rory and Lorelai would go crazy for when they would have movie marathons. Those not familiar with Gilmore traditions would think that you would choose just one food to order, but not us true fans. We know that in order to do it right, you have to order all of it. Who doesn’t love leftovers? \nWatch the classics \nPop culture references are a major part of the show and the ‘Gilmore Girls’ has seen just about everything. Casablanca, Pippy Longstocking, the Godfather, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the Wizard of Oz are just a few of the favorite movies mentioned throughout the show. \nGet snacks \nThe eating habits of Lorelai and Rory were constantly questioned all throughout the show. How can two girls eat so much junk food and maintain perfect skin and small figures? In order to watch the revival in true Gilmore fashion, you will need Red Vines, Mallomars, donuts, pop-tarts, and tater-tots. Better start preparing your stomach. \nCoffee, coffee, coffee \nCoffee is the drink of choice for the two girls in every episode of the show. They cannot function without it and will drink it at any time of the day. As Lorelai says, “If I stop drinking coffee, I stop doing the standing and walking and the words-putting-into-sentence doing.\" We all feel you on that. \nGrab your mom \nLorelai and Rory are the ultimate mother-daughter duo. They’re best friends and always have each other’s backs. Gilmore Girls reminds us about how awesome our own moms are and it only makes sense that you watch the revival with the lady who has been there since day one. I know I can’t wait to get home and watch it with my mom! \nNow we must impatiently wait with our Red Vines in hand for Netflix to release this fantastic four-part event. College is hard. We make it easier! Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of HC delivered to your inbox.",

      "text": "Robert Viglasky/Netflix \nNetflix says it will produce a whopping 1,000 hours of original TV shows and movies in 2017, and that's a good thing since people keep watching more and more Netflix.\nThe number of hours of Netflix the average subscriber watches has gone up steadily since 2011, at an average of 16.4% per year. In 2011, using Netflix data, we can estimate that each subscriber watched about 51 minutes of Netflix per day (310 hours per year). And while official Netflix data hasn't come out yet for this year, CordCutting.com estimated that for 2016, users are on track to stream 600 hours of content each, on average.\nIf that's true, it means that the average Netflix subscriber watches about 12 DAYS more Netflix in a year than they did in 2011!\nHere's a chart from CordCutting.com that shows the progression (these numbers only reflect the official data from Netflix, which we only have through 2015):\nRobert Viglasky/Netflix \nThe steadiness of this rise suggests Netflix hasn't hampered its appeal by leaning heavily into original TV shows and movies, which it began producing in 2013.\nParticularly heartening for Netflix should be its popularity among younger viewers. In a Piper Jaffray survey of 10,000 US teens released last month , 37% of teens said they watched Netflix every day. Every day! \nNetflix's big competitors, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, came in way below Netflix at just 3% each. That means Netflix is over 12 times as popular in terms of daily use. \nHere is the full chart from Piper Jaffray: \nRobert Viglasky/Netflix \nNOW WATCH: Snapchat will sell its new camera glasses through pop-up vending machines \n",

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services.

      "text": "Share Save \nIt seems like almost daily, a story comes out about how bad Netflix's movie library has become. It's shrinking. The quality is suffering. And Netflix's original content is to blame. However, a new study by Streaming Observer News seems to indicate otherwise. The study compares Netflix's current US movie library to that of rival streaming services Amazon Prime and HBO Now. The results would indicate that Netflix's movie lineup is better than all the sky-is-falling articles would indicate. Here are the key data points: Netflix has 357 Certified Fresh movies (15%). Amazon Prime has 236 Certified Fresh movies, more than 100 fewer than Netflix. HBO Now only has 52 Certified Fresh movies, putting it in a distant last place. It's worth noting that 73% of Certified Fresh movies are on none of the aforementioned services. Also, looking at the numbers, it would appear that there is little overlap of movies. So movie lovers would likely benefit from subscribing to both Netflix and Amazon Prime, for example, as it would allow you access to about 25% of Certified Fresh movies. Of course, some would argue that using Rotten Tomatoes review scores as a benchmark isn't exactly reliable. And maybe they're right. However, enough people use Rotten Tomatoes as a source that it seems as good a benchmark as any. If you'd like to know exactly which movies from the list are on each service, you can find that here at Rotten Tomatoes . 2 Shares ",

Set in the late 1970s, when New York was at the brink of bankruptcy and disco was dying out, the rise of hip-hop is told through the lives, art, music and dance of a group of young people in the South Bronx.",

      "text": "Here's a trailer for Captive, a new Netflix documentary produced by Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, The Bourne Identity). Not to be confused with Ryan Reynolds' The Captive, this movie is all about kidnapping and hostage negotiations and it features interviews with real people who have been on all sides of those kinds of situations (yes, even including some kidnappers themselves). It's a topic I haven't really considered very much in my life, but one that I'm interested to learn more about. What do you all think? Captive arrives on Netflix on December 9, 2016. CAPTIVE delves into the terse, dangerous world of hostage negotiation. Victims, negotiators, and kidnappers give an unprecedented look at what it means to be captive.",

      "text": "Entertainment Kathleen Madigan all about the laughs in Netflix special, Royal Oak shows Kathleen Madigan has a new Netflix special and will perform Nov. 17-19 at Mark Ridleys Comedy Castle in Royal Oak. Courtesy Kathleen Madigan By Eric Steingold, For Digital First Media Posted: # Comments \nMost of her time on tour, comedian Kathleen Madigan plays one-night-only theater gigs. She admits, though, that Michigan is one of the only places she likes so much that she stays for a week. \nMadigan will just about do that when she performs Nov. 17-19 at Mark Ridleys Comedy Castle in Royal Oak. \nUnlike many of the people in New York and LA, who are a part of the entertainment industry, Madigan says that in Michigan, people just want to have a good time. \nA true Midwesterner who holds on dearly to her Missouri charm, Madigan came to prominence appearing at St. Louis-area open mic nights whenever she could find them, while working as a print journalist in the early 90s. And that workman ethic shines through mightily, since Madigan is on the road nearly 300 nights per year. Advertisement \nI have a couple shirts and a pair of jeans, and thats really it, because I just want a carry-on, she says. \nThat casual attitude masks a true love for her craft. She finds a purity in stand-up that draws Madigan toward the stage and not a sitcom, a path has proven smart. \nI like the instant gratification of stand-up comedy, she says. I write my jokes, get up onstage and immediately know if a joke works or not. \nA regular on the late-night circuit, she has made two HBO hours and three Comedy Central specials. Her latest TV offering is a Netflix special, Bothering Jesus, which began streaming on Thursday, Nov. 10. \nHer comedy is a sharp slice of everyday-topical absurdity, which connects to her audience on a personal level. She agrees with how her close friend and fellow comic Lewis Black describes her shtick: the fun lady at the end of the bar with a lot of opinions and only half the information. \nI speak about whatever Im feeling at the time, the comic says, trading scientific precision in her act for a freewheeling, off-the-cuff mentality. This year has been really tough, because stuff was happening so fast  meaning the presidential election. But really, Madigan is in the business for the laughs. \nMy favorite movies are Arthur and Best in Show. Sometimes its good to just turn your brain off for a little while. \nAnd thats the mindset she takes to her upcoming shows at the Comedy Castle as well as her newly released Bothering Jesus  also the moniker of her current tour. Its about kicking back, drinking a beer and cracking wise about modern life. \nSurely, there will be plenty of cracking wise in the coming days, as Madigan takes up residency in the Mitten State. \nI used to be a tourist in Michigan, but now Im just looking forward to seeing my friends and performing, she says, I cant wait.",

      "text": "Netflix subscribers watch a whopping 12 days more Netflix per year than they did in 2011 Netflix says it will produce a whopping 1,000 hours of original TV shows and movies in 2017, and that's a good thing since people keep watching more and more Netflix.\nThe number of hours of Netflix the average subscriber watches has gone up steadily since 2011, at an average of 16.4% per year. In 2011, using Netflix data, we can estimate that each subscriber watched about 51 minutes of Netflix per day (310 hours per year). And while official Netflix data hasn't come out yet for this year, CordCutting.com estimated that for 2016, users are on track to stream 600 hours of content each, on average.\nIf that's true, it means that the average Netflix subscriber watches about 12 DAYS more Netflix in a year than they did in 2011!\nHere's a chart from CordCutting.com that shows the progression (these numbers only reflect the official data from Netflix, which we only have through 2015):\nRobert Viglasky/Netflix \nThe steadiness of this rise suggests Netflix hasn't hampered its appeal by leaning heavily into original TV shows and movies, which it began producing in 2013.\nParticularly heartening for Netflix should be its popularity among younger viewers. In a Piper Jaffray survey of 10,000 US teens released last month , 37% of teens said they watched Netflix every day. Every day! \nSee the history of Netflix in photos: \n\nNetflix's big competitors, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, came in way below Netflix at just 3% each. That means Netflix is over 12 times as popular in terms of daily use. \nHere is the full chart from Piper Jaffray: \nRobert Viglasky/Netflix \nNOW WATCH: Snapchat will sell its new camera glasses through pop-up vending machines \nSee Also: \nHere's how much the highest-paid actors make from the shows by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu The 'best' movies based on video games Netflix is coming to millions of cable boxes in the next few days SEE ALSO: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos changes tone and wishes Donald Trump 'great success' — as Amazon stock tanks ",

      "title": "Chelsea Handler Breaks Down While Discussing Donald Trump Victory",
      "text": "Tumblr  43PM PT \nChelsea Handler fought back tears several times during her Netflix talk show while discussing the outcome of Tuesday’s presidential election. \nThe host was emotional right from the top of her show. \n“Like a lot of people in this country, I’m sad. I’m disappointed, and I’m confused. But if Hillary [Clinton] can make it through a concession speech , then I can make it through a stupid television show,” Handler said. \nShe was later joined by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) who also expressed her disappointment over Donald Trump’s victory . “My heart’s on the floor,” Boxer said. “I have learned how painful politics can be. But that doesn’t mean you run away. It means you pick yourself up, as the president said, and you fight even harder for your country, because it’s ours. It’s ours.” \nWhen asked if she had spoken to Clinton since the results, Boxer said she hadn’t. “No, I did not want to speak to her at this point,” Boxer said. “I like to write,” she explained emotionally. “I have too much to say. I want to think about it.” Related Hillary Clinton ‘Delete Your Account’ Dis to Donald Trump Is Most-Retweeted Post of 2016 Election (So Far) \n“I know as a woman, it feels so sexist,” Handler responded, beginning to cry. “I guess the message that I want to spread out to other women is to not give up — sorry, I hate f–king crying on camera — because this is so important. It’s easy to throw in the towel and say that we’re gonna leave, or I’m gonna move to Spain. Because I want to move to Spain, I really, really want to move to Spain right now. And everyone in my office is like ‘you have a responsibility. You have a voice and you have to use it and you have to be here.'” \nHandler continued, “If you’re caught lying on camera three times in a row, if you’re referring to a woman’s genitalia. Those are non-presidential things …unpresidential things.” \nThe segment ended on a hopeful note, with Boxer praising the women who won Senate seats, including Kamala Harris, who is replacing her. \nHandler later reiterated her stance, posting another video on Instagram Thursday morning. Nov 10, 2016 at 7:35am PST \n\n“I’m not leaving the country, Handler said defiantly. “This is my announcement. I’m going to keep fighting. For Hillary Clinton. In honor of Hillary Clinton.” Filed Under:",

      "title": "Charlie Cox Wants Bullseye For Daredevil Season 3, But His Co-Stars Don’t",
      "text": "\nWe’ve now had two seasons of Netflix’s Daredevil tv series which has introduced a lot of classic antagonists: The Kingpin, Elektra, The Hand and Punisher . But the biggest omission so far has to be Bullseye, a merciless assassin that never misses his mark, able to turn anything into a lethal weapon. Daredevil star Charlie Cox is fighting to bring in Bullseye for Daredevil Season 3, but some of his co-stars don’t want it to happen.\n\nDaredevil star Charlie Cox said the following about Bullseye at Wizard World Pittsburgh:\n“It’s no secret, I’ve said it before and I get in trouble every time I say it, I’d like to see Bullseye make an appearance at some point. I think it’s a really interesting opportunity. Deborah Ann Woll obviously does not want Bullseye to show up for obvious reasons. Elodie Yung, who plays Elektra, doesn’t want Bullseye to show up either.”\nIn the comic books, (spoilers for the comic books coming up…) Bullseye infamously killed both Karen Page and Elektra, the two loves of Murdock’s life. So it’s understandable that Elodie Yung and Deborah Ann Woll (who played Karen Page) may not want to the see the character show up in the series.\nColin Farrell played the role in Mark Steven Johnson’s 2003 film starring Ben Affleck, one of the better parts of that almost universally mocked superhero adaptation. The comic book character dresses in a very comic book-y outfit, and that movie was able to adapt the character into a somewhat believable real-world baddie. The fact that Bullseye was in the universally disliked film may be why Marvel has been so hesitant to include the character in the first seasons of the television adaptation. Also, for a guy like Bullseye to do some dramatic damage, relationships need to be established to give weight to any potential loss.\nCox’s co-star Elden Henson revealed that he has heard that someone is looking for the part:\n“I actually heard they’re going to cast Zach Galifianakis as Bullseye.”\nThankfully, that’s just a joke. Or so we hope.\nPunisher was one of the best things to happen to the Daredevil television series, and I think most comic book fans will tell you that Bullseye has the potential to elevate the show just as much as Jon Bernthal ‘s character did for season two of the show.\nDaredevil will return in The Defenders, which is set to hit Netflix in 2017.\nThe post Charlie Cox Wants Bullseye For Daredevil Season 3, But His Co-Stars Don’t appeared first on /Film .\n",

Everyone in my office is like, ''you have a responsibility, you have a voice and you need to use it and you have to be here.'\"\nHandler had invited Senator Barbara Boxer to discuss the results.\nShe had promised to follow Hillary Clinton's example and not cry - but she could not hold the tears back.\n\"Sorry, I hate f—ing crying on camera,\" a sobbing Handler said.\nHowever, despite her temptation to leave the country, Handler says she will stay.\n\"I know as a woman, it feels so sexist (that Trump won),\" she said. \"I guess the message I went to get out is not to give up. Because this is so important. It's easy to throw in the towel.\"\nYet many responded to her comments with anger.\n\"Bye...if you feel like you need to leave a country because you didn't get your way, you're a. Not an adult and b. Are not mentally stable,\" wrote one man on the Daily Mail's Facebook page.\nSome, however, empathized with Handler. \"I do feel for you though,\" another user who doesn't live in the US said. \"I'd hate for him to be in charge over here. Racist pig who treats women like sex objects. The fact that Hilary got more votes than him counts for nothing.\"\nHandler is just one of many celebrities expressing their deep anguish over Trump's victory. Seth Meyers recalled on TV how miserable his mother, Hillary, was when they heard the news Clinton would not be the first female president. \"She was really excited yesterday and I was really sad for her,\" he said, before adding his own remarks about his own pain.   \"I do really feel for the parents who had to explain this to their kids this morning,\" said Seth Meyers, who has recently become a father. \"Especially parents with daughters because a lot of them like me probably thought Hillary would be our first woman president.\" ",

      "text": "By Kristen Russell \nAs if this month’s revival (dropping Nov. 25 on Netflix) weren’t enough, now Gilmore Girls fans can order up a sweet to binge-eat, Gilmore Girls ice cream. The new flavor was crowd-sourced from fans of a NY-based Ample Hills Creamery . The winning combo, called “They Scoop Gilmores, Don’t They?” is coffee and chocolate-pudding ice cream with snickerdoodles, topped with pink Pop Tart sprinkles. Behold, the awesome excess: Photo by Ample Hills Creamery \nThe ice cream is available by mail – by the pint, or as part of the “Where You Lead, I will Marshmallow” 4-pack –“64 ounces of ice cream for your movie night, Friday night dinner, or wallowing needs.” BTW if you’re hoping to get some in time for the Revival, better hurry up and order – it’s currently sold out. Photo by Ample Hills Creamery \nThe winning flavor was chosen from more than 2,500 entries. The coffee and Pop Tart flavors are a must; if you’re wondering about the rest: “‘They Scoop Gilmores, Don’t They?’ is an amalgamation of three amazing suggestions: @pauline__beal’s allusion to Emily’s attempt at chocolate pudding, @ryebecca’s ingenious “oy with the snickerdoodles already” and @jjjmmd’s name– a reference to a reference to a reference.” ",

      "text": "Ubisoft Planning A Netflix TV Series? \nAccording to the rumor mill, Ubisoft is planning a Netflix series . While that seems totally possible, what franchises are left that would make a good series? All Ubisoft's current properties are being made into movies. \nYet there may be something else in the works with a Reuters article indicating today that the French game publisher is \"in talks with Netflix over a series\". No further details are available. A Netflix deal would be something different and of course the big question is – what property would it be? Other notable Ubisoft titles include the \"Prince of Persia,\" \"Call of Juarez,\" \"Rainbow Six,\" \"Rayman,\" \"Just Dance\" and \"Trials\" franchises.",

      "title": "Netflix is losing these networks' shows at the end of this year",
      "text": "Trent Moore @trentlmoore 2 hours ago \nNetflix has spent the past few years building a diverse lineup to offer pretty much whatever you want to see at any given time. But as a 2014 deal draws to an end, the streaming service might be losing a few of your favorite shows. From Property Brothers to Cupcake Wars , there's a whole lot of reality TV-esque entertainment about to vanish from your Netflix queue. \nNetflix cut a deal with Scripps Networks Interactive in the fall of 2014 (via /Film ) to offer up programming from the company's various networks, which include HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel and DIY Networks. That deal expires at the end of 2016, and it seems the companies have reached an impasse in negotiations that means it won't be renewed. For viewers who like to watch other people househunt, or learn how to cook the perfect meatloaf, that'll be a problem. \nThose networks control several popular shows, and here's a breakdown of some of the most popular that will be affected: HGTV's Fixer Upper, Property Brothers, House Hunters, Flip or Flop , and Love It or List It will all be gone; Food Network's Cupcake Wars, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, Chopped, Food Network Star and Cutthroat Kitchen ; and Travel Channel's Man v. Food and Expedition Unknown as well as DIY Network's Kitchen Crashers will also be dropping off. \nSo why will all these shows be leaving Netflix's lineup? Long story short, it all comes down to money. In a recent earnings call, Scripps COO Burton Jablin said the company believes its agreement with Netflix \"really is not the kind of dual-revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term,\" meaning they want to find a way to levearage that content in a way that also allows them to sell advertisements around it (Netflix is, of course, famously ad-free). \nThere's no word yet on where these shows might resurface for fans looking to binge-watch them without actually dropping the cash on a full-fledged cable package, but you have to think Scripps will find a new streaming partner eventually. If the company wants to find a way to combine ads with their programming, you'd think Hulu could be one option, or perhaps even creating TV and streaming apps for their networks and selling ads themselves. \nThere's proven to be a huge audience for these franchises and types of shows, and the short, self-contained episodes are perfect for streaming audiences looking to throw something on to watch in a short amount of time without a major commitment. It's also indicative of the streaming business as a whole, and how increased competition (i.e. Amazon Prime, Hulu, CBS All Access, etc.) is creating a more fragmented—and expensive—landscape for viewers. \nWhat do you think of the deal? Will you miss being able to watch Fixer Upper and Man v Food on Netflix? Recommended",

      "text": "  8 To the Creators of 'Stranger Things,' From a Netflix Fan With Seizures 8 \nI’m a lover of most of the TV shows you’ve made, Netflix. I’m a huge fan of “Between” and I totally wanted to watch your show that you put out this summer called “Stranger Things.” My family watched it, my friends watched it, everyone told me great things about it. It sounded so amazing… but there’s something I really need to tell you. \nI have seizures that can be easily triggered by flashing lights, and your show “Stranger Things” had so many flashing lights I was unable to watch your show. But what’s worst is that I felt left out. Like I wasn’t in on something. I miss out on weird things as someone who is living with a progressive terminal rare disease and I would love to watch “Stranger Things.” \nBut I can’t risk a seizure for a TV show. In my world, the person I’m watching TV with will almost always say something to me when flashing lights come on a show so I can cover my eyes or turn away. \nNetflix, it’s not just you who doesn’t even know they are overlooking people like me who want to watch your shows. It is so many other people. It’s in TV shows, music videos, movies and random events. It’s so hard to know that I cannot do something like others because I could have a seizure. And if that seizure happened to send me into status epilepticus which I’ve been in about nine times, three of those put me in a medical -induced coma on life support. And for one I was intubated after my airway collapsed in on itself. \nWhat I want is simple… a warning. I want to be able to look at something and see, “There is about to be flashing lights,” or “This show could trigger seizures or migraines.” And most of all I want you to somehow say, “I’m sorry for the inconvenience.” \nAnd a warning to you, Netflix, is that seizures triggered by flashing lights isn’t that rare. There are others like me. We don’t get to watch the show. We feel left out by the over-looked world we have to live in. \nI’m not mad at you. I love you, Netflix. I’m always up for Netflix! You do so much good and made hospital stays wonderfully easier and make me able to watch shows over and over again. But please don’t overlook the triggers of seizures or migraines or anything else. It’s hard enough. \nI’m going to go watch “Gilmore Girls” on Netflix. We want to hear your story. Become a Mighty contributor here .",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nPremiering this weekend on Netflix is director Jeff Wadlow’s The Memoirs of an International Assassin . The action comedy stars Kevin James as Sam Larson, a mild-mannered would-be author who gets mistaken for a killer-for-hire when his fictional novel about an international assassin is published as a true story. When the book is a huge success, he is suddenly kidnapped, taken out of the country, and forced into an assassination plot. The film also stars Zulay Henao , Ron Rifkin , Andy Garcia , Maurice Compte , Rob Riggle , Kelen Coleman and Kim Coates . \nLast week I landed an exclusive interview with Kevin James and Zulay Henao. They talked about their experiences working for Netflix, doing the action scenes, what filming on location added to the film, how much they improvised on set, who ruined the most takes, the way they like to work on set, and more. \nCheck out what they had to say below the trailer. \nHow did you guys pull this movie off in 41 days? \nKEVIN JAMES: That’s a really good question. It was a very tough schedule, it was tight and we shot in Atlanta and the Dominican Republic. We had a lot of intense fight scenes and a lot of work going back and forth. But I gotta say the one thing is when you have a great cast and crew it had to happen that way that the crew knew what they were doing, they were on top of it and we just it got it done. It was grueling, you know that one I gotta say was grueling but it was so worth it when we saw the final product. \nZULAY HENAO: I just have to take a minute to Jeff Wadlow’s professionalism he was really the one that.. \nJAMES: He was intent on making it you know right. \nHENAO: Shots everyday. \nWell for each of you what was it about the story that you really liked? \nJAMES: Well for me I get to play dual characters you know, I get to play this alter ego. I get to play an author. I get to play this assasin. I get to play all this rolled up in one and then having them kind of switch roles and having to draw from the other one, you know from each other actually, and learn from each other. It was just kind of unique for me in that way in that I had never done a movie like this before, so really that was exciting for me. \nHENAO: And for me I have to say you know obviously the physicality of it all was pretty insane and amazing and challenging but I loved all of the specific character she had so much to prove. She worked so hard cause of all the sacrifices that she made so for me it was playing a character that had so much [inaudible 2:03] to a character and just to be a professional while doing all of that was a great combination, Image via Netflix \nI think one of the reasons the film played well for me is that it wasn’t just shot in Atlanta or New Orleans. You guys went out of the country for some of the location work. So can talk about filming on location and what that added to the film? \nJAMES: Well it’s funny you said that because you’ve gotta give credit to Jeff Wadlow because when he said we’re gonna go to the jungles of the Dominican Republic and we gotta shoot this because there’s no other place that will look like there. And I’m like, “Can’t we find it in Atlanta?” I was like, “Can’t you just find some woods that we got to?” He was like, “It will not look the same, you’ll never get the same feel.” And just because I hate traveling, it’s just the flying that I didn’t like. You know being there thinking I was gonna be away from my family for a little but and then they were gonna come down. You know it was a grind but to make it happen I realize now that you needed all that and it really did make the film. \nWell one of the things I keep on hearing from everyone how awesome Netflix is to work with and how they’re always there for you and they give good notes, so are you guys gonna espouse the same stuff I keep hearing? \nJAMES: I am only cause it’s true. Honestly, if it was a bad experience I wouldn’t do it again I don’t need the ya know.. it’s one of those things that you say, “Man it just didn’t work and I wanna do my own thing” or this or that. They were just incredible partners in that you do get to do that. They see your vision, they never say, “Oh you can’t do this or you can’t do that.” They were like do your thing and they really had great creative notes, which kind of threw me. I was like, “Whoa alright.” Honestly it was just seamless working with them and I think we all felt that. I don’t know what to say it was a great experience. Image via Netflix \nFor both of you talk a little bit about improv versus sticking to the script. \nJAMES: Yeah, I mean we always like to encourage improv once you get what you need in a scene, you know once you get what’s written on the page in most cases the written word Jeff Wadlow did a great job with it so we stuck to that. But once we had it and again making our days was always tough so we didn’t have that much time, but there would be time to play once we got it they just would have fun with this take and do something different and just try different stuff. There’s stuff that Kim Coates does in this movie that I couldn’t stop laughing at this guy. \nHENAO: There wasn’t a lot of improv involved for me. I pretty much stuck to the script, there’s too much going on to the fight scenes, there’s too much going on really for, as Kevin said, we really had to make our days. So I really stuck to the script and Jess was pretty adamant about that just for purpose of the story too I think. For the story to really be told the way he wanted it to be told I think it was important especially for my character to stay on script. \nFor both of you who ruined the most takes and why? \nJAMES: Zulay did, we all know Zulay did we’re not even gonna try to fake that part. Image via Netflix \nHENAO: I ruined the most takes partly because I was laughing so much. You know Jeff would say, “Can you settle, settle.” So that was part of it and also just the choreographed fight scenes were pretty intense so we did go over those a lot. I think I’m very happy with the end product and I think everybody is too and Jeff said he’d work with me again so that’s good. But I just got myself a job on Kevin James show so that’s good. \nI spoken to a lot of actors and some love the Clint Eastwood method of shooting the rehearsal, doing a take or too and moving on and some really enjoy the Fincher method of fifty takes. For each of you, how do you usually like to work when making a movie? \nJAMES: Really it varies for me, most of the time I would say I like the Clint Eastwood method where you kind of if you get it you get it and you can move on you don’t wanna out do things. But it depends on the scene if you feel like you can find different stuff and do it I think it’s great to do that. With a movie like this where you have such a tight schedule and if you feel like you got it there’s always that danger if you’re not doing anything different and new let’s just try to make it work and move and you feel like you know that the scene you’re working on now is in detriment of the scenes you gotta try to do later, you know you wanna make sure you get in. \nHENAO: Yeah, I think it all depends on what the scene is. I know that working for Tyler Perry you know there are a lot of times you shoot the rehearsal and then we have maybe we have another take and that can work or it can not work depending on the nature of the scene. So I personally like a little rehearsal, not if I‘m gonna have a super emotional scene you wanna have it be a fresh thing. I think both can work like I said depending on the nature of the moment.

      "text": "Netflix, Lockheed, IBM Upgraded; Qualcomm Downgraded; Taser PT Hiked Netflix was upgraded to a buy with a price target of 151 by Loop Capital. (Netflix) \nNetflix ( NFLX ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT ) and IBM ( IBM ) were upgraded to buy Thursday, while Taser International ( TASR ) had its price target raised, and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) was downgraded. Netflix \nThe streaming video giant was upgraded to buy with a price target of 151 by Loop Capital. Netflix's stock is near its record high, but concerns over costs and plans for 1,000 hours of original content are prompting a new question: Should investors still view the company as a tech disrupter shaking up Big Media , or has its seduction by Hollywood left it unable to still act like a nimble tech startup? \nNetflix initially rose higher but reversed to close down 5.5% at 115.42 in the stock market today as investors dumped many big-cap techs. \nRELATED: \nApple, FANG Stocks Aren't Joining Trump Rally Lockheed Martin \nThe Pentagon contractor was upgraded to a buy from hold with a price target of 275 by Deutsche Bank. The Defense Department finalized a $6.1 billion contract with Lockheed Martin last week for the ninth batch of F-35 stealth fighters, though both sides remain in a dispute about pricing. \nLockheed Martin stock rose 1.5% at 257.22, after rallying 6% Wednesday on expectations that a Trump administration would boost military spending. IBM \nBig Blue was upgraded to a buy with a price target of 185 by Bank of America. The artificial intelligence of IBM's Watson will be used to make millions of General Motors ( GM ) cars smarter through a new partnership between the automaker and tech giant, the companies said Wednesday. \nIBM rallied 3.5% to finish at 160.22. Qualcomm \nQualcomm was downgraded to equal weight from overweight with a price target of 65 by Morgan Stanley. Qualcomm reported Q3 earnings last week that beat on the top and bottom lines. Its Q4 outlook was largely below views. The outlook may give some indication of the fallout from Samsung's Note 7 fiasco, as well as the strength of demand for the Apple iPhone 7. \nQualcomm last week announced plans to buy NXP Semiconductors ( NXPI ) for $39 billion. \nQualcomm stock briefly rose but has reversed to end down 2.3% to 66.31. Taser \nTaser had its price target raised to 35 from 33 by Craig Hallum. Taser reported third-quarter earnings late Wednesday that beat estimates. The company, which provides stun-weaponry, body cameras and online information storage systems, has over the years landed sales deals with a variety of law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. \nShares jumped 13% to close at 26.82, retaking the 50-day line.

      "text": "Previous Post Haute Shopping: The Best of Melrose Place \nPhoto Credit: TK \nZulay Henao is an actress that is as “hot” as she is “haute.” The Colombian- born beauty can next be seen opposite Kevin James in Netflix action/comedy, True Memoirs Of An International Assassin on November 11. The film has some serious comedic chops: in addition to James as the star, the film is directed by Jeff Wadlow ( Kick Ass 2 ), written by Jeff Morris and produced by Todd Garner ( Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 ), Guy Riedel ( Couples Retreat, Wedding Crashers ) and Mark Fasano for Broken Road Productions. Henao has been making a mark for herself in the comedy realm from the start: she garnered a lot of buzz for her role playing opposite Mike Epps in the hilarious Lionsgate comedy Meet The Blacks, which was released earlier this year, as well as Lionsgate’s 2014 film, Single Moms Club and the comedy series Love Thy Neighbor . In addition, Henao will next start production on season 4 of OWN’s #1 rated drama If Loving You Is Wrong and recently wrapped the independent feature White Space, starring opposite Holt McCallany with the team behind The Matrix. Here, this hilarious beauty shares her haute secrets to the City of Angels. Where were you born: I was born in beautiful Medellin, Colombia How long in LA: I’ve lived in Los Angeles a total of 7 crazy fun years, consider this home now. Neighborhood: The Valley, specifically Studio City for six years and have now bought a house in the Santa Clarita Valley. Occupation: Amazingly, I’m a working actress. Favorite Restaurant: So many! I have a conflict with having a “favorite” anything, but right now I am at Sugar Fish alone, so that’s very telling. Love this place. Best Sushi: SUGAR FISH Best Italian: Dan Tana’s- the food is divine and it also just has this beautiful old world charm that I love. Best dessert: Anything A la mode preferably with caramel salted ice cream. Best place for a romantic date: Malibu wins this one, so many beautiful places to eat fresh and delicious, and catch the most stunning sunsets. Best place for a power business meeting: I would definitely go with Soho House in Malibu. It is private where you could feel like you are in your living room but also lends itself to randomly meeting Brian Grazer. Yeah, so random right! If you have out of town guests, which hotel would you recommend? I always recommend The London hotel. The decor is absolutely stunning, and views from rooftop are unmatched. I think location is great too, very in the mix but just off the main Sunset strip, which offers a little more privacy. Favorite shopping venue/boutique: I love shopping at T he Grove. You can spend an entire day; shop, eat, watch a movie and finish the day off with great ice cream. ;) Best Spa: Without a doubt, the Four Seasons spa offers state of the art skin care, with their hydra-facial among many and just a really beautiful, relaxing experience overall. Favorite Charity Event: I absolutely love the Eva Longoria Padres Contra el Cancer charity, I’ve attended for the past couple of years, and I have to say their commitment to their mission is admirable. Best Steakhouse: Mastro’s Malibu- best date night in Malibu, steak is AMAZING of course but that sunset is hard to forget. Best Gym/Athletic Facility: The Heart and Hustle Gym is the gym of GYMS!!! Owned by my very good friend Greg Miele, they really cater to their client’s specific needs and are responsible for a lot of our top athletes competitiveness. Best Limousine/Driving Service: Empire CLS is a really great company. They are headquartered out of the east coast so that makes me really happy. I have to say they employ some do the kindest, hardest working people in the business. Ask for Peter next time you are in town! Describe your city in three words: Hectic, eclectic and charismatic. All-around favorite spot in Los Angeles: I really love the South Bay- the beach, the easy like a Sunday morning vibe of the beach is beautiful and sometime so necessary. Best Aspect of Los Angeles: The diversity of this city has to be the best thing for me. The hope in so many dreams, from so many creative people all living in this huge metropolis really, really inspires me. Follow Zulay on social media!",

      "text": "\nIf you are feeling stressed over current events, or are just tired of hearing about it, Netflix offers some of the best series that are binge-worthy and offer a good escape. Netflix’s House of Cards is critically acclaimed and it is a compelling series, but probably isn’t the break from politics that you are looking for. Whether you are heavily involved in politics and need a break, or simply want a relaxing evening at home without thinking about the stresses of life, Netflix has the answer for you. Some of the shows listed below are Netflix originals, and others are TV series that are often overlooked.\nThe Usual Suspects Even those that aren’t Netflix subscribers, or avid TV watchers, have heard of popular shows like Daredevil and American Horror Story . But newer Netflix audiences may not have yet seen these shows; and for those that have, revisiting them makes for a good breather.\nOrange is the New Black \nOne wouldn’t think that a show about a woman serving time in prison (based on a true story) would be so refreshing—but it is!\nStranger Things \nOften regarded as the most popular series on Netflix, this show is easy to binge-watch as there is only one season with eight episodes.\nJessica Jones \nNot every Marvel show will give you a break from politics. Although well done, much needed, and very popular, Luke Cage is likely to remind you of current events. But for those wanting a show that is both compelling and fanciful, Jessica Jones may be the superhero you are looking for.\nMaster of None \nOne of the highest rates series on Netflix, Master of None offers plenty of laughs.\nAmerican Horror Story \nFor those that think things couldn’t get any worse, at least you aren’t living in a haunted house or an insane asylum. This is a great series for those wanting to forget reality while being scared at the same time.\n[Image by 20th Television] The Best Overlooked Series on Netflix iZombie \nThough this show is very popular among people who are fans of comic books and the “zombie” genre, many people overlook this series thinking that it will be more of the usual. But the genius of this show is that it breathes new life into the genre by adding unique twists. At times, it is as laugh-out-loud funny as it is dramatically compelling.\nWet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp \nIf you are looking for a series that will offer you nothing serious at all, then this Netflix original is perfect! Based on the hilarious satirical movie ( Wet Hot American Summer ), this show serves as a prequel and pokes fun at ’80s sex-comedies.\nArrested Development \nThough it was popular among both viewers and critics, this series seems to remain in the “cult classic” category as it never received mainstream attention. A stellar cast paired with brilliant writing makes Arrested Development one of the funniest series on Netflix.\nLady Dynamite \nAnother Netflix original series, Lady Dynamite tells a story based on the true life events of comedian Maria Bamford.\nLouie \nWhat’s funnier than a stand-up routine from Louis C.K.? A series based on his life!\n[Image by 20th Television] Twin Peaks \nIn one of the most bizarre TV shows of all-time, Twin Peaks is funny, spooky, confusing, and compelling, often all at the same time. Creative Loafing describes why this is one of the best series on Netflix .\n“Not since “Who shot J.R.?” had TV asked a question as compelling as “Who killed Laura Palmer?” David Lynch’s startling series brought big-screen innovation (and the director’s patented eccentricities) to the boob tube with a murder-mystery that found FBI Agent Dale Cooper (an excellent Kyle MacLachlan) sleuthing in the title town, a place as notable for its oddball citizenry as its killer cherry pie.”\nOTHER NETFLIX ARTICLES FROM THE INQUISITR \nThe Deal Has Been Made! Netflix Movies And Series Available On Comcast \nNetflix’s ‘Stranger Things’ Season 2: Cast Revealed, Filming Begins \nThe Top 10 Best, Highly-Rated Thriller And Horror Movies On Netflix \nThe 20 Best Movies On Netflix To Watch After A Long Day At Work \nFrom Orange is the New Black to Twin Peaks, Netflix offers many series that are a great escape from politics.\n[Featured Image by CBS Television Distribution]\nThe Best Series On Netflix To Binge-Watch And Escape Politics is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "2016 5 Netflix Family-Centric Movies To Watch This Thanksgiving Thanksgiving will be harder than ever this year with a divided America. Here are movies to get you through it Thanksgiving November 10, 2016 \nT hanksgiving is going tbe rougher than usual this year. Half of America is terrified and distraught that Donald Trump has been elected president; the other half voted for him. Although family gatherings filled with political disagreements are par for the course, this is different. This year, your drunk racist uncle has been validated , and when base prejudices are the issue, it’s harder to come to a consensus. It will be more difficult to remain civil, which means that when you’re killing time with some Netflix post-Thanksgiving dinner, the movie selection is essential. Here are five currently streaming that are failsafe choices. 1. The Princess Bride \nIt’s impossible not to love The Princess Bride . If you’ve seen it a million times, it never gets old, and if you haven’t seen it, your world is about to be rocked. The story of a simple farm boy turned pirate — Dread Pirate Roberts, to be specific —, a Princess Buttercup, Rodents of Unusual Size, and the chattiest duel in the world never fails to elicit smiles. This is an iron-clad classic. No matter what happens to America, we will always have The Princess Bride . 2. Johnny English \nBefore there was the Kingsman series, there was Johnny English, starring Mr. Bean ’s Rowan Atkinson. The topic of Britain has come up a lot in comparing the rise of Trump to Brexit, but selecting this movie allows you to circle that topic while dispelling the tension with laughs. \n3. The Little Prince \nThis deceptively simple “children’s” classic has deep existential musings on love, curiosity, and tolerance. It’s the perfect family movie for an atmosphere of mistrust and tension. Even if your family does not have kids, this is one cartoon that demands attention from adults too. 4. Holes \nThis is Shia LaBeouf’s best movie. In our post-fact world, that is an inarguable truth that anyone can agree on. From it’s weird early 2000s music nostalgia to its dusty setting, this story has always been far more charming than it’s got any right to be. 5. To Kill A Mockingbird \nBecause there’s nothing wrong with stirring up the family gathering with a little bit of pointed commentary through fiction. If suspicious eyebrows are raised, you can pretend you just really like Atticus Finch’s glasses.",

      "text": "The election of Donald Trump has been stock market manna for every industry that benefits from an expanding economy but one: technology.\nLosses among computer and software makers mushroomed Thursday and were pronounced in the “FANG” block of Facebook (down 1.9 percent), Amazon.com (3.8 percent), Netflix (5.5 percent) and Google parent Alphabet (2.9 percent) . The Nasdaq 100 Index slumped 1.6 percent, the biggest retreat since Sept. 9.\nWhile opinions vary about what’s going on, one possibility was concern about the impact of Trump’s policies on trade overseas, where U.S. technology companies thrive. Others saw a rational retreat for a group that through Election Day had surged 11 percent in 2016, or even the potential for retaliation by the president-elect against an industry that didn’t exactly cozy up to him during the campaign.\n“There’s been these violent moves as investors try to sort out what the election means,” said Terry Morris, manager director of equities at BB&T Institutional Investment Advisors in Wyomissing, Penn. “These exaggerated moves are just that, and I think we’re going to come back to more reasonable valuations.”\nMost Read Stories Trump impact: How will Amazon fare? 5 people shot in downtown Seattle; search for shooter continues  WATCH Trucker accused of keeping women as sex slaves gets 20 years Seattle will remain ‘sanctuary city’ for immigrants despite Trump presidency, mayor says  VIEW Seahawks' Richard Sherman says election allowed people 'to show their true colors' Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Investors are shifting focus to banks and commodity producers amid speculation that Trump policies such as tax cuts and fiscal spending will benefit companies that are more geared toward the economy. Financial shares rallied 3.7 percent Thursday to their highest level since May 2008, while industrial stocks advanced 2.1.\nTech shares are moving in the opposite direction from the market at a rate last seen when the internet bubble was bursting. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.2 percent to a record high, for a divergence of more than 2 percentage points that’s the widest since March 2001, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nTech stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 Index, slumping with defensive shares such as utilities and consumer staples whose losses exceeded 4 percent over two days. \n“The fear has unwound into a rotation into different sectors once everybody was able to look at the landscape and see what sectors were benefiting and which ones are not,” said Joe Bell, a Cincinnati-based senior equity analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “Some of those names that are beaten down badly from a market-cap perspective have outperformed recently with the election results.”\nTrump’s presidency leaves the U.S. tech industry in an uncomfortably uncertain position. Total contributions to Hillary Clinton’s campaign from the internet industry came in at 114 times the level they did for Trump, according to statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a strongly worded rebuke to Trump’s views on immigration at the company’s developers conference in April, although he never called him out by name.\nClinton had laid out plans for targeted tax credits, pledged to carry on Obama’s policies toward net neutrality, and a national commission on digital security and encryption. It was met with wide approval from an industry that thrived during the Obama years.\nTech’s decline resumed a retreat that started during the latest earnings season, where companies from Apple and Amazon reported disappointing results, sending the Nasdaq 100 to a nine-day slump through Nov. 4. The story of retailing in the past few quarters has been Amazon gaining at the department stores’ expense. Today, that’s being turned on its head after better-than-expected results from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom.\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, sparred with Trump through his candidacy.Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Post, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny.\nOn Thursday, Bezos congratulated the president-elect. “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,” Bezos wrote on Twitter.\nWhile Alphabet and Netflix recently beat analysts’ financial estimates, higher valuations are one reason that investors are more inclined to sell, especially after their outsize gains this year. At an average of 140 times profit, the FANG group traded at a multiple that’s seven times the S&P 500’s.\nSeattle Times staff contributed to this report, as did Bloomberg reporters Joshua Brustein, David Wilson, Spencer Soper and John Hyland Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday  ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nPhotographers looking for a Netflix binge this weekend may want to tune into a new series produced in part by Canon Australia. Tales by Light , a six-part series, follows five photographers as they work in rarely photographed remote areas. \nSeason one of the series is slated to arrive on Netflix on Friday . Director, producer, and videographer Abraham Joffe follows the five photographers as they explore both nature and culture in little-known areas of the world, from Antartica to the bottom of the ocean. \nMore: Nigel Barker giving photographers the ‘Top Model’ treatment in new web series \n“Having Tales by Light Season One available on Netflix is a wonderful acclamation of the quality and broad appeal of our Australian-made photography series and we are excited that it will now entertain millions of subscribers around the world,” said Jason McLean, the executive producer and Canon Australia’s director of consumer imaging. “This series is unique and started from our simple aim of celebrating the amazing visual storytellers who push the creative boundaries and it’s great that this concept resonates so well across regional divides.” \nShot in 4K, the first season of Tales by Light debuted on the National Geographic Channel in Australia and New Zealand. Produced in 2015, a trailer of the show’s second season is already available. \nThe series follows Art Wolfe, a nature and cultural photographer, Darren Jew, a nature and underwater photographer, Krystle Wright, an adventure sports photographer, Richard I’Anson, a travel photographer, and Peter Eastway, a landscape photographer. While the series travels across the globe, the production work was completed in Australia. \nEach episode dives into a behind-the-scenes look at a different project (or two), from India’s festival of Holi to Alaskan brown bears. While there is no word on a Netflix release date for season two, the second set of videos follows Big Cat Diary ’s Angela and Johnathan Scott, WetPixel’s Eric Cheng and war photographer Stephen Dupont.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIf you were planning on battling your post-election blues by binge-watching episodes of Chopped or House Hunters on Netflix, get it all done while you can. By year’s end, you won’t be able to get any more of those Food Network or HGTV shows — or any of Scripps Networks Interactive’s shows for that matter — by way of the popular streaming service. \nSure, by December, you will be so busy eating real food in your home that you may not be pining after television cooking and house repairs, but it is still a marked loss for Netflix. Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns both the Food Network and HGTV, held its earnings call on Monday, wherein COO Burton Jablin noted his company “made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year.” He added, “In the end, it really is not the kind of dual-revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.” \nNetflix has yet to comment on the departure of the networks from its platform. \nMore : Netflix gets topical with Israeli political thriller ‘Fauda’ \nOn the same earnings call, SNI CEO Kenneth Lowe noted the company would also be “forgoing advertising dollars with the Netflix deal,” Variety reported. As Lowe said, “We have such compelling content for advertisers that we just don’t want to really cut ourselves off from any opportunity.” He mentioned, however, that “[SNI] gained a lot of internal knowledge on the digital side and on the best way to monetize this content, including the further expansion and development of our digital sales team.” \nThe departure of both Food Network and HGTV means a rather significant loss of Netflix repertoire, including rerun favorites like: Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives , Food Network Star , Cupcake Wars , Chopped , and Cutthroat Kitchen on the Food Network side and House Hunters , Property Brothers , Flip or Flop , Fixer Upper , and Love It or List It on the HGTV side. This does not even mention the other two channels owned by SNI — Travel Channel, which runs Man v. Food and Expedition Unknown on Netflix; and DIY Network, which is responsible for Kitchen Crashers . \nSo get all that watching in before you make your New Year’s resolution. Hey, maybe they will disappear just in time for you to make good on your promise to cut back on your Netflix intake. Also watch: I Love You, Man – Trailer",

      "text": "Five industries that should take a cue from Netflix and crowdsource parts of its tech Posted Devin Guan Crunch Network Contributor Devin Guan is the CTO of Drawbridge . How to join the network In 2006, Netflix took a long, hard look at its world-class Cinematch Technology. Cinematch was as straightforward as it sounds: With user-submitted data, the technology could predict which movies a user may or may not enjoy. With it, Netflix created personalized movie recommendation lists, custom-built for each individual user. \nCinematch worked, but behind the scenes, Netflix worried it was not operating at full potential. So, in a move completely unheard of at the time, Netflix made public a huge set of its anonymous rating data and issued a global challenge: develop an algorithm that could beat it. \nThe Netflix Prize, as it came to be known, was the first large-scale public crowdsourced competition of its kind. The competition helped draw attention to the value of recommendation engines across the world. Soon, e-commerce companies were touting similar technology, and, as a result, the internet became a better place for consumers and for brands. The Netflix Prize opened new doors for data science, and pushed it to new heights. \nNow, nearly 10 years since I handed out the million-dollar Netflix Prize, I think it’s time for five more industries to issue a “Netflix Prize” of their own. By crowdsourcing for solutions using machine learning to utilize the abundant data available across these five industries, we can find relevant signals and patterns among the noise and make these industries not only more efficient, but also more integral to improving our lives. Digital security The security industry, and specifically methods around risk and fraud detection, is a very rules-driven market. When consumers make purchases online or in stores with a credit card, the card issuer will run a quick approval process that involves questions such as: Is the consumer’s account in good standing? Is the card being used at a merchant that’s relevant to the consumer? Is the location of the store in line with locations of recent purchases? Based on these (and several more) data points, the transaction is either approved or denied. \nThese rules-based authentication systems are woefully incomplete, and often unable to adapt the changing nature of data. There is so much more data about consumers and their devices, both online and offline, that can be taken into consideration. \nA crowdsourced competition, like the Netflix Prize, could provide the opportunity to expose user patterns across devices, time and location to uncover unique user behavior that provides a more complete view of the purchaser. Ultimately, applying machine learning to the security industry could allow security teams to build adaptive learning strategies to not only make fraudulent transactions less likely, but also ensure legitimate transactions aren’t flagged. Health and pharmacology Data is the key to saving lives, but right now, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers largely operate in their own silos. This is a poorly designed system for solving critical health issues. A crowdsourced Netflix Prize for medicine and healthcare could produce radical results. In fact, there is already evidence to support it. In 2012, the pharmaceutical company Merck hosted a contest wherein it shared data on the chemical structure of thousands of different molecules, and tasked the scientific community to identify which might lead to new and better drugs. The winning result demonstrated a 17 percent improvement over the industry standard benchmark, and blazed new avenues for pharmaceutical research aided by machine learning. If we were able to input every piece of data from every drug study, we could potentially make better predictions about drugs. \nBeyond chemical data, patients have generations’ worth of family data we willingly provide to doctors. From heart-rate records, urine samples, family history, blood pressure and pages and pages of doctors’ notes, the body is one large data science dream. If we apply big data machine learning techniques to all of that data, while complying with HIPAA patient confidentiality, could medical professionals detect patterns and susceptibilities in families and individuals before they become a problem? Likewise, if we were able to input every piece of data from every drug study, we could potentially make better predictions about drugs, beyond even the Merck example. Advertising and marketing In the world of advertising and marketing technology, a big gap that every brand, agency and enterprise faces is digital identity. The issue stems from the global phenomenon of device proliferation. Between our smartphones, tablets, laptops, connected TVs, smartwatches and even connected cars, our digital lives are extremely fragmented, and customer experiences on the internet are largely broken. \nFacebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix and others have “solved” this by forcing a login. For example, my Facebook News Feed is identical on mobile and desktop; Amazon recommended products that are consistent across devices and unique to me. But what about the rest of the internet? What about the time I spend online and in apps where I’m not logged in? \nThe good news is that the internet, by definition, is a boundless sea of data. Browser data, device data, location data, usage data, network data — enough data to keep an army of data scientists busy trying to resolve identity by using these signals. Several companies are already addressing this question of digital identity, but there are few, if any, open standards and very limited collaboration. \nIf solved by a crowdsourced data science competition, digital identity can revolutionize online experiences for both brands and consumers. Recommendations and content can be personalized, and marketing can be automated. Cross-device attribution becomes simple, and the marketer’s view of consumers becomes holistic. Traffic and transit Think of all the data we issue every morning while combating our daily commutes. We input data to Waze, share our location and speed with GPS, drive through speed monitor zones and even provide license plate information and traffic patterns with intersection cameras and toll booths. There’s data coming from millions of drivers, and even more from buses and trains. Machine learning could create a more efficient transportation environment and experience. \nWhat if there were a crowdsourced “Netflix Prize” to produce an open-source program that could tell us exactly when to leave our house to minimize our commute time or arrive precisely when we want, beyond what Google Maps can do today. If all of this data was more widely available to data scientists, a data science challenge could help determine how many lanes to have open at a given time of day, how to fluctuate tolls dynamically based on traffic needs, how to monitor and rate the changing of traffic signals and much more. Machine learning in this realm could vastly improve traffic flows and create a more efficient transportation environment and experience. Precision agriculture By 2050 , Earth will be home to nine billion people. That’s a 35 percent increase from today, or two billion additional mouths to feed. Can our current agricultural practices keep up with that demand for food without wreaking havoc on the planet? Agriculture has become one of the most contested practices when it comes to environmentalism. Crops take water, emit carbon dioxide, require pesticides and send runoff nitrogen and other waste into our precious water. It’s time for a more data-driven approach to farming. \nFrom weather patterns to soil nutrient levels, even insect life and plant growth records, agricultural data can be used to determine not only which crops to plant, but also when to do it, where to do it, how to harvest and even how much to irrigate. The Farmer’s Almanac and human hunches have been trusted sources for centuries, but at this crucial turning point, is it possible to make the industry a more precise science, and potentially save our race? By implementing a crowdsourced solution that fuses machine learning with innovative engineering, we could build sustainable solutions to support generations to come. \nTen years ago, the Netflix Prize used data and science to change recommendation engines for the better. Algorithmic intelligence changed the things we watched on our screens. What would happen if we applied those same concepts to other industries? These five are just the beginning.

      "text": "By Laura Hurley 10 minutes ago \nNetflix has become a behemoth of a streaming service thanks to its vast library of TV and movies that range from classic to current to entirely original. Subscribers have access to just about every genre, and a culture of binge-watching has been born among folks who are willing to prioritize TV over more trivial things like eating and sleeping. Now, we have an idea of just how many hours of content each subscriber watches per year on average, and the number is staggering. In 2015, each Netflix subscriber caught nearly 600 hours of streaming video. \nThe streaming service counted 74.76 million subscribers in 2015, and those consumers watched a total of 42.5 billion hours of content over the span of the year. Those measurements break down to 568.49 hours per person with an active subscription to the streaming service. 568 hours equals nearly 24 full days of nonstop viewing. \nThe 2015 numbers represent a sharp rise from those measured only four years previously. In 2011, 23.53 million people subscribed to Netflix and streamed 7.3 billion hours of video, which breaks down to an average of 310.24 hours of viewing each. (310 hours is equal to nearly 13 days.) Netflix hasn't yet released any numbers for 2016, but estimates from Cordcutting.com suggest that the figure may jump from 568 hours to 600 hours of streaming. \nFrom a mathematical point of view, the Netflix statistics for the last five years point to a trend of continued growth that shows no signs of stopping. From a general point of view, the stats are super crazy and kind of hard to believe. Even those of us who binge-watch on a regular basis might not have realized that we've literally been devoting full weeks each year to Daredevil , BoJack Horseman and Adam Sandler movies. \nAll things considered, it's likely that the increases in viewing hours is related to Netflix's library of TV shows. The streaming service offers plenty of movies to fill a queue, but movies generally aren't meant for binge sessions. I know that I'm much more likely to say \"Just one more!\" when it comes to episodes of TV than feature films, and Netflix has a pretty stellar variety of TV offerings. Although the website has been dropping channels and focusing on original content in recent years, there are still plenty of long-running series from days gone by that can be watched for days on end. \nMany of the originals have been exceedingly popular, to the point that subscribers may feel the need to binge-watch ASAP if only to keep from being spoiled. Honestly, when it comes to the Marvel Netflix series alone, it's easier to hole up for a weekend and watch an entire season than it is to avoid spoilers online. Throw in Orange is the New Black and House of Cards , and that's a few days' worth of TV right there. \nNetflix is planning on increasing its original programming in the coming years. It has even borrowed a lot of money in order to produce as many originals as possible. Hopefully we won't lose too many other shows to make room for them. As much as I'm a sucker for the Marvel Netflix shows, I'd be heartbroken if I lost The X-Files and The West Wing to make room for more. \nCheck out our picks for the best shows on Netflix right now, and don't forget to take a look at our breakdown of the best originals .

      "text": "If your Netflix queue is full of hits like Property Brothers , Chopped, and Flip or Flop , I have some rather sad news for you.\nTelevision shows from HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, the Cooking Channel, and the Travel Channel will be removed from Netflix at the end of 2016, Fox News reports. The Scripps Network Interactive, the parent company for all of the channels, just announced the decision not to renew its partnership with the online streaming platform.\nNetflix has been a second home for these lifestyle shows since 2014, but all of that is about to change. The company doesn't want to be limited by the partnership anymore, said Scripps' chief operating officer Ken Lowe, during an earnings report conference call. They've grown and no longer need to rely on partnerships or the streaming service.\n New year, new show!! My new series #GiadaEntertains premieres tmrw at 11am est @foodnetwork... hope u like it! @linguinepics @wayfair\nA photo posted by Giada DeLaurentiis (@giadadelaurentiis) on Jan 2, 2016 at 5:04pm PST\nLove Fixer Upper style? #HGTVMagazine has the tips you need to recreate it at home. Just click the #linkinbio for more!\nA photo posted by HGTV (@hgtv) on Jul 22, 2016 at 3:00pm PDT\nThis year alone, a single episode of Fixer Upper attracted more than 8 million viewers to HGTV, and one of the best Flip or Flop episodes drew 7.9 million viewers, according to the company's press releases . Both shows were among the top-watched cable programs on their given night. And despite major events like the 2016 summer Olympics and the U.S. election, five of the six parent company's networks grew in the most recent quarter of 2016.\nThankfully, there are plenty of other ways to watch your favorite shows. Tons of free programming and full-length episodes can be found on HGTV.com , FoodNetwork.com , DIYNetwork.com , and the rest of the networks' websites, but if you want to catch all of the seasons in order, you'd better watch them on Netflix while you can!\nFrom: Country Living\n ",

      "text": "Twitter Freeview film of the day: The King’s Speech Enjoying The Crown on Netflix? Don’t forget this right royal tale of George VI’s dogged fight against his very public impediment ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Friday 11 November 2016 at 12:01AM \nThe King's Speech ★★★★ 9.00-11.20pm More4 Is there such a thing as “too British to fail”? If so, this film demonstrates that empirically. Not just a runaway home-grown success story, it’s an independently funded success story, too. The King’s Speech eclipsed The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire in the public imagination as the definitive UK export. It ticks every box in this regard: a true story involving royalty, period costume and war, with an “issue” at its heart, namely, reluctant King George VI’s stutter and his mastery of this speech impediment in time to unite the nation against Hitler in 1939. Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush are pitch-perfect as the King, a no-nonsense Queen Elizabeth and daring Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, and director Tom Hooper keeps the whole thing marching smartly along. Whether such Britishness seems more relevant post-Brexit or fills you with melancholy will be a matter of taste. For more of today’s free-to-air films, see our TV listings",

      "text": "\nWhile the Netflix series The Crown focuses on the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, there are several side stories that if you know, will only enhance your understanding of the time period and the series. This includes the backstory of the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated the throne of England to marry Wallis Warfied Simpson, of Baltimore, Maryland, who was not of noble birth, and had been divorced more than once.\nThe Crown on Netflix starts with King George VI, the then Princess Elizabeth’s father, on the throne. King George VI (known to family as Bertie) is only the king of England because his brother Prince Edward (known to family as David), refused the throne to marry Wallis Simpson (King George VI was the subject of The King’s Speech ). In the second episode of The Crown , when the king passes , Prince Edward, at that point known as the Duke of Windsor, comes back into the picture, but with an icy relationship with the rest of the royal family, says the Inquisitr. The Duke of Windsor calls Queen Elizabeth Shirley Temple and her mother Cookie, because the rumor was that her mother was actually the family’s French cook.\nPhotographs from the wedding of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson are set to go under the hammer https://t.co/XL3PXcnsp3 @BellmansAuc pic.twitter.com/lzIQR3JTmt \n— Sussex Life magazine (@SussexLifeMag) November 9, 2016 \n\nThe Vulture mentioned the benefit to knowing the history (and family history) behind many of the icy English stares And many of them were either toward or about Wallis Simpson, or the Duchess of Windsor, referred to by many in the royal family as “that woman.” Episode three of The Crown is called simply “Windsor,” examines Elizabeth and family taking the name Windsor, rather than Mountbatten, the adopted last name of her husband Prince Philip, also called the Duke of Edinburgh.\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix \nNetflix: ‘The Crown’ Creator Talks Season Two And Hints At Season… \nOne Of Queen Elizabeth’s Last Welsh Corgis Has Died – The Inquisitr \nMuch of the confusion for some of the American audience, is the lack of familiarity with British royal history, and the fact that each character in The Crown has several names. So here it is, the main players, and all of their names. As an aside, the family name was Hanover, but was changed to Windsor because Hanover sounded too German.\nQueen Elizabeth II, also known by her family nickname, Lilibet, born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, and Elizabeth Windsor.\nPrince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh, born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, and House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-GlĂźcksburg\nKing Edward VIII (though he never went through with his coronation) was born Prince Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David, known as David to his family, became the Duke of Windsor and after his abdication, was also named Governor of the Bahamas.\nWallis Warfield Simpson , born Bessie Wallis Warfield, then became Wallis Spencer, and then Wallis Simpson. After marrying King Edward, she became Wallis Windsor, or the Duchess of Windsor.\nThis is the \"Prince Edward\" our school is named after. Prince Edward VIII who abdicated the throne to marry Wallis Simpson #HappyPacerBday pic.twitter.com/GSSkbnUeiG \n— Ms. Walker (@7WPacers) November 2, 2016 \n\nThe mother of King George VI and the Duke of Windsor (David) is Queen Mary, who is portrayed as one frosty lady. Though the Duke and Duchess of Windsor are treated sympathetically, there is an undertone, and certain things are just hinted about, like the idea that many believed the couple were Nazi sympathizers. We get to know Wallis Simpson mostly from the missives sent from David to Wallis, saying that England is “cold and sunless” and filled with family members with “ice in their veins.”\nAfter the Duke abdicated he and Wallis were exiled in a sense, and spent most of their time in the Caribbean and the United States. While the Duke of Windsor says he chose love (the twice divorced Wallis) over his country, he is perceived as having chosen himself, and it is a deep family shame. The Crown also lets audiences know that a big part of the Duke of Windsor lingering in England after King George VI’s death is to secure a nice allowance for himself and Wallis, despite the Queen Mum’s attempts to send him packing.\nBattle royal over Wallis Simpsonâ€™s French knickers | Royal | News | Daily Express https://t.co/yG1IYlXwcl \n— British Royal News (@UKRoyalNews) October 29, 2016 \n\nAs a side note, there is a current legal battle going on involving Wallis Warfield Simpson, and her French silk knickers . It seems that there is a question of who owns the Duchess’s knickers, said to be valued at $6500.\nAre you enjoying The Crown ?\n[Featured Image by BIPPA/AP Images]\nThings Netflix ‘The Crown’ Viewers Need To Know About Wallis Simpson In The Story Of Queen Elizabeth is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Netflix are reviving Gilmore Girls for four feature length specials this month, and we are so hyped to return to Stars Hollow. Not only will we finally hear those mythical \"four final words\" that were planned to be in season seven but an insane amount of cast members are making their return – you can find out exactly who is coming back (and everything else you need to know) right here. There is one glaring omission from the cast list of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (as Netflix are calling it) and that's Marty, played by Wayne Wilcox. TVLine spoke to executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino about this very matter, and their reasoning is logical, if a bit sad. \"We absolutely tried,\" Amy said. \"Organically it just didn't fit in. We love Wayne.\" \"In true Palladino fashion, we broke out the six hours of story (and) we had about eight hours of story,\" Daniel explains. \"So we had to rearrange things just to fit the format. Because we didn't want to… tax the limits of people's patience. We would've done a much bigger story.\" So it seems that Netflix wouldn't let them make four instalments of two hours each. Disappointing for sure, but the Palladino's seem to be okay with that, implying too much of a good thing might not be for the best. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life comes to Netflix on November 25.

      "text": "By Jacob Whritenour   \nIf you’re in need of a new show to binge on Netflix, look no further than Skylanders Academy . It follows an all-star cast of Skylanders characters as they hone their skills and powers in order to save the Skylands. A familiar face also joins the team — Crash Bandicoot! \nThe Crash Bandicoot series celebrates its 20th anniversary this year which got many fans’ hopes up for a brand new adventure. Over the months there have been plenty of clues to keep rumors circulating until it was announced Crash would be a playable character in Skylanders Imaginators . \nNow this platforming marsupial takes his jumping, squashing and twirling abilities to the small screen in the Netflix-exclusive show. He makes an appearance in episode 11 titled, “Crash Landing,” where he has come to Skyland via a magical portal. After completing his mission and making new friends, he returns to his world which in-turns affects Master Eon in a negative way. \nIt’s exciting seeing Crash back on his feet after years of absence. Stay tuned to Skylanders Academy to see your favorite characters and possibly more Crash Bandicoot. Post navigation",

      "text": "There was no episode of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. last night as the Tuesday Night Superhero Ratings War took a back seat to Actual World War 3: The Prelude , but the show’s slow burn slide into dismal ratings has been documented on Bleeding Cool before , and with a new normal of less than 1 in the 18-49 demographic, we may finally be seeing the finale of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s long game of ratings limbo. But before that ship sinks, Marvel may want to get its most valuable passengers onto a lifeboat , by getting them into spinoff series on Netflix or even into the Marvel Movieverse. According to Ghost Rider actor Gabriel Luna , there are “deals in place” for exactly that.\nSpeaking to comics new juggernaut ComicBook.com , Luna revealed he’d be glad to escape the ailing show in any way possible, saying, “I don’t have a preference. People talk about ‘Ah man he’d be great as a feature,’ which is [an] idea too… It could be in the cinema, it could live on Netflix, whatever it is.”\n“It’s been talked about, there’s definitely deals in place for that potential,” Luna continued, explaining how he deals with the stress of constant threat of looming cancellation. “But I just take it one day at a time.”\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is set to return to ABC, possibly for the final time, later this month.\nPrevious: Kevin Smith And How Supergirl Flies Next: Paul Rentler Of The Young Animal Ashcans Creates “Original Art” Variant Covers For December",

      "text": "You soon won't be able to stream any more of those Food Network or HGTV shows, or any of Scripps Networks Interactive's shows for that matter. Those three networks are cutting ties with Netflix. More If you were planning on battling your post-election blues by binge-watching episodes of Chopped or House Hunters on Netflix, get it all done while you can. By year’s end, you won’t be able to get any more of those Food Network or HGTV shows — or any of Scripps Networks Interactive’s shows for that matter — by way of the popular streaming service.\nSure, by December, you will be so busy eating real food in your home that you may not be pining after television cooking and house repairs, but it is still a marked loss for Netflix. Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns both the Food Network and HGTV, held its earnings call on Monday, wherein COO Burton Jablin noted his company “made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year.” He added, “In the end, it really is not the kind of dual-revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.”\nNetflix has yet to comment on the departure of the networks from its platform.\nMore : Netflix gets topical with Israeli political thriller ‘Fauda’\nOn the same earnings call, SNI CEO Kenneth Lowe noted the company would also be “forgoing advertising dollars with the Netflix deal,” Variety reported. As Lowe said, “We have such compelling content for advertisers that we just don’t want to really cut ourselves off from any opportunity.” He mentioned, however, that “[SNI] gained a lot of internal knowledge on the digital side and on the best way to monetize this content, including the further expansion and development of our digital sales team.”\nThe departure of both Food Network and HGTV means a rather significant loss of Netflix repertoire, including rerun favorites like: Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives , Food Network Star , Cupcake Wars , Chopped , and Cutthroat Kitchen on the Food Network side and House Hunters , Property Brothers , Flip or Flop , Fixer Upper , and Love It or List It on the HGTV side. This does not even mention the other two channels owned by SNI — Travel Channel, which runs Man v. Food and Expedition Unknown on Netflix; and DIY Network, which is responsible for Kitchen Crashers .\nSo get all that watching in before you make your New Year’s resolution. Hey, maybe they will disappear just in time for you to make good on your promise to cut back on your Netflix intake.\nThe absolute best TV shows streaming on Netflix right now Here’s all the new music coming out in November 2016 Check out 25 of the best Android Wear apps for your smartwatch",

      "text": "Game publisher Ubisoft is in talks with Netflix to produce a series, CEO Yves Guillemot announced Monday. The company has already produced a Rabbids show for Nickelodeon and has several films in the works. More French game publisher Ubisoft has already entered the world of film production, as well as the traditional television space, but its latest venture may take one of its franchises to Netflix.\nSpeaking to reporters at a news briefing Monday, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that “Ubisoft was in talks with Netflix over a series,” but stopped short of disclosing what particular game franchise, if any, the publisher had planned to use for the project.\nThough the obvious choice would appear to be the Rayman spinoff “Rabbids” series, it already exists as a Nickelodeon program titled Rabbids Invasion .\nSeveral other films based on Ubisoft’s series are already in the works. Assassin’s Creed , starring Oscar winner Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender, hits theaters this October, while adaptations based on Tom Clancy’s The Division , Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell , Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon, Watch Dogs , and Far Cry are also in the works.\nMore: Ubisoft celebrates 30th anniversary by making Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon free later this month\nIn the past, Ubisoft has seen its series make their way to the screen, but results have been mixed. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time stands as one of the most profitable video game films of all time , but received a mixed critical response. The first Far Cry film, directed by the infamous Uwe Boll and released in 2008, was also predictably terrible, though original developer Crytek appeared to have been in control of the series’ film rights at this point.\nGuillemot’s announcement was made as media giant Vivendi continued its efforts to exert more control over Ubisoft’s board. Vivendi now holds more than 24 percent of the company’s stock and more than 21 percent of its voting rights. Ubisoft has continued to seek investors to block a potential “hostile takeover” of the company — an event that occurred with Gameloft, a company founded by Guillemot’s brother, earlier this year.\nMichel Ancel is still Instagram teasing revival of ‘Beyond Good & Evil 2’ Novel approach: Ubisoft looks to produce books in-house with new publishing unit 'Just Dance' isn't the only game Ubisoft is bringing to the NX",

The channel is extremely popular in Norway for its tremendously lengthy episodes of various mundane activities. \nFrom a 134-hour cruise ship journey through Norway’s west coast to 18 hours of salmon swimming in the sea, this channel hosts anything and everything unusual and prolonged. \nThe show was previously only available in Norway. \nHere are the shows that are all available on Netflix—go forth into that hazy night: \nSlow TV: National Firewood Evening (2016) Slow TV: National Firewood Morning (2016) Slow TV: National Firewood Night (2016) Slow TV: National Knitting Evening (2016) Slow TV: National Knitting Morning (2016) Slow TV: National Knitting Night (2016) Slow TV: Northern Passage (2016) Slow TV: Northern Railway (2016) Slow TV: Salmon Fishing (2016) Slow TV: The Telemark Canal (2016) Slow TV: Train Ride Bergen to Oslo (2016)",

      "text": "Share Paramount Pictures \nLet’s be honest: we’re all still in recovery mode from Tuesday, right? The election has been taking it out of us for more than a year now, and even with it “over,” we’re stuck in the immediate backlash and psychic fallout period, where we can’t quite believe things can be different in the coming weeks, months or even years. Really, we’re just… tired. \nWith that in mind, it’s time to consider a recovery list. Something to bring some relief to the internal stress and angst that we’ve all been feeling for as long as we can remember… Something like, say, a classic comedy or two. Or, indeed, ten. Something to remind us what we love about this country, when we’re not at ideological war with each other, and harken back to simpler times. When, you know, America was “great.” Although, as these movies suggest, maybe that greatness was always just a little… off. \nSit back, relax and don’t think about politics for awhile. You’ve earned it. \nMONKEY BUSINESS (1952) A potential “cure” for the aging process goes wrong, leaving Cary Grant acting particularly goofy and childlike, but who can blame him when Marilyn Monroe is around as the beautiful, unsuspecting secretary of his boss? \nTHE SEVEN YEAR ITCH (1955) More Marilyn, as the former model who lives upstairs from Tom Ewell, the frustrated husband and father who is fantasizing about roads less traveled just a few years into married life. Things don’t exactly end as he images, but that’s probably for the best. \nBEDAZZLED (1967) Sure, this piece of 1960s satire might be a retelling of the classic Faust story, but there’s so much more to enjoy that recreations of Satanic legend—like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore clearly enjoying the chance to vamp on a larger scale, and Raquel Welch as the personification of lust. Because why not? \nBARBARELLA (1968) Talking of 1960s sexcomedies, it’s still surprising that Jane Fonda agreed to play the oversexed space starlet in this piece of camp joy. Come for that opening sequence, stay for the orgasmatron and wondering why we didn’t get to see a million sequels for this. \nTHE STING (1973) Has Robert Redford ever been more charming than he is as one of the two professional con men—Paul Newman being the other—who decide to rip off a local mob boss? The answer is no, because almost everyone involved in this movie peaked right here. It’s a masterpiece. \nMODERN ROMANCE (1981) Can we finally admit that Albert Brooks is the Woody Allen that was less problematic and never managed to disappear into his own ego? If you’re unconvinced, take a look at this relationship comedy and get ready to apologize. \nBIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA (1986) From the sublime to the intentionally ridiculous, with John Carpenter’s enjoyably over-the-top action comedy that sees one trucker save the day, the U.S. and true love itself thanks to a case of being in the wrong place at the right time. \nFERRIS BUELLER’S DAY OFF (1986) If there is any movie in the last thirty years that has felt more like the guidebook for the way the modern world wants to work than this one, I’d like to see it. Doesn’t everyone want to be Ferris, even if we all end up much more Cameron than we’d hope for. \nCOMING TO AMERICA (1988) While we try to recover our patriotic love of the nation, here’s a tool that might help: Eddie Murphy’s love letter to the U.S. (and his own talent; he plays multiple roles in this movie, of course) and a reminder than the late ‘80s were a hell of a time in so many ways. (No, really; this movie hasn’t aged particularly well, but in the best way.) \nGROSS POINT BLANK (1997) And then there’s this alternate take on the American Dream, as John Cusack, Minnie Driver and more address their unhappy high school pasts and even unhappier adult lives, with a helping of hit man humor and some gleeful murder. It’s not as if you’ve not thought about killing a few people in the last couple of months, let’s be honest. Share ",

      "text": "How to change quality in Netflix | 1-855-531-3731 0 Download   How to change quality in Netflix 1-855-531-3731 Slide 2 How can I control how much data Netflix uses? Watching movies or TV shows on Netflix uses about 1 GB of data per hour for each stream of standard definition video, and up to 3 GB per hour for each stream of HD video. This can create headaches for Netflix members who have a monthly bandwidth or data cap on their Internet service. Here you'll find a few ways to reduce the amount of data Netflix uses, without having to resort to drastic measures (like actually watching less Netflix :). Slide 3 Adjust your data usage settings Adjusting the data usage settings for your account is the easiest way to reduce the amount of bandwidth used while watching Netflix. There are four data usage settings to choose from. Each estimate below is per stream: Low (0.3 GB per hour) Medium (SD: 0.7 GB per hour) High (Best video quality, up to 3 GB per hour for HD and 7 GB per hour for Ultra HD) Auto (Adjusts automatically to deliver the highest possible quality, based on your current Internet connection speed) Slide 4 How to change? To select a setting that works best for your Internet plan, navigate to the Your Account page and select Playback settings in the My Profile section. It can take up to 8 hours for these changes to take effect. Restricting data usage may affect video quality while watching Netflix. Slide 5 We hope our solution worked for your problem.

      "text": "(Bloomberg) — The election of Donald Trump has been stock market manna for every industry that benefits from an expanding economy but one: technology.\nLosses among computer and software makers mushroomed Thursday and were pronounced in the FANG block of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., each of which fell at least 1.9 percent. The Nasdaq 100 Index slumped 1.6 percent at 4 p.m. in New York, the biggest retreat since Sept. 9.\nWhile opinions vary about what’s going on, one possibility was concern about the impact of Trump’s policies on trade overseas, where U.S. technology companies thrive. Others saw a rational retreat for a group that through Election Day had surged 11 percent in 2016, or even the potential for retaliation by the president-elect against an industry that didn’t exactly cozy up to him during the campaign.\n“There’s been these violent moves as investors try to sort out what the election means,” said Terry Morris, manager director of equities at BB&T Institutional Investment Advisors in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. “These exaggerated moves are just that, and I think we’re going to come back to more reasonable valuations.”\nInvestors are shifting focus to banks and commodity producers amid speculation that Trump policies such as tax cuts and fiscal spending will benefit companies that are more geared toward the economy. Financial shares rallied 3.7 percent Thursday to their highest level since May 2008, while industrial stocks advanced 2.1 percent.\nTech shares are moving in the opposite direction from the market at a rate last seen when the Internet bubble was bursting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 percent, for a divergence of more than 2 percentage points that’s the widest since March 2001, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nTech stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 Index, slumping with defensive shares such as utilities and consumer staples whose losses exceeded 4 percent over two days. Facebook slid 1.9 percent to $120.79. Amazon was down 3.8 percent to $742.25 after falling as much as 7 percent earlier. Netflix declined 5.5 percent to $115.42 in its biggest slide since July. Alphabet lost 3.1 percent to $780.29.\n“The fear has unwound into a rotation into different sectors once everybody was able to look at the landscape and see what sectors were benefiting and which ones are not,” said Joe Bell, a Cincinnati-based senior equity analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research Inc. “Some of those names that are beaten down badly from a market-cap perspective have outperformed recently with the election results.”\nTrump’s presidency leaves the U.S. tech industry in an uncomfortably uncertain position. Total contributions to Hillary Clinton’s campaign from the internet industry came in at 114 times the level they did for Trump, according to statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a strongly worded rebuke to Trump’s views on immigration at the company’s developers conference in April, although he never called him out by name.\nClinton had laid out plans for targeted tax credits, pledged to carry on Obama’s policies towards net neutrality, and a national commission on digital security and encryption. It was met with wide approval from an industry that thrived during the Obama years.\nTech’s decline resumed a retreat that started during the latest earnings season, where companies from Apple Inc. and Amazon.com reported disappointing results, sending the Nasdaq 100 to a nine-day slump through Nov. 4. The story of retailing in the past few quarters has been Amazon.com gaining at the department stores’ expense. Today, that’s being turned on its head after better-than-expected results from Macy’s and Kohl’s.\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, sparred with Trump through his candidacy. Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Post, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid anti-trust scrutiny.\nWhile Alphabet and Netflix beat analysts’ estimates, higher valuations are one reason that investors are more inclined to sell, especially after their outsize gains this year. At an average of 140 times profit, the Fang group traded at a multiple that’s seven times the S&P 500’s.\nThe loss may be another blow to hedge funds, who have crowded to the industry and pushed bullish bets on the group to an all-time high last month. According to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, large speculators were net long more than 160,000 Nasdaq 100 mini futures contracts at the end of October after boosting positions in five of the past six weeks.\n“The group has been popular for hedge funds to own,’’ Brett Mock, a managing director at JonesTrading LLC in Mill Valley, California, said in an interview. “Some are not sure what Trump victory means for trade and multinationals, so have to assume there is not as much enthusiasm short term to own. It could also just be noise. There are lot of short-term repositioning last few sessions around election.’’",

Now that competing services will be offered space on the Amazon Fire TV home screen, Netflix could highlight its series “Luke Cage” there. (Myles Aronowitz / Netflix) MAE ANDERSON Associated Press \nAs more and more people get their favorite TV shows and movies online, Disney is also learning to embrace the stream. \nThe Walt Disney Co. once resisted offering channels like ESPN directly over the internet, preferring old-fashioned cable subscriptions. Its investors are fretting over ratings as more people cut the cord and cancel cable or satellite service. NFL game viewership is also down, and the contentious election drew viewers away from Disney networks like ABC to cable news networks. \nDisney stock was down 9.6 percent for the year, at Thursday's closing. But despite a weaker-than-expected earnings report, which showed a drop in ESPN revenue, shares rose more than 2 percent late Thursday after an initial dip in extended trading. \nThe media conglomerate, which owns Marvel, Star Wars and its own Pixar and Disney Studios, is forging ahead with new streaming deals involving Netflix, Hulu and others. \n\"Disney is the one media company that can succeed in taking its brands directly to consumers,\" said Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente. He expects Disney could one day offer ESPN as a stand-alone service, for example, similar to HBO 's $15-a-month \"HBO Now.\" Caption Disney World guest dies after riding Star Tours \nAccording to state records, a 67-year-old man recently died after riding Star Tours at Disney's Hollywood Studios. \nAccording to state records, a 67-year-old man recently died after riding Star Tours at Disney's Hollywood Studios.

But last quarter it took a $1 billion stake in BAMTech, which provides streaming for Major League Baseball. The company said it plans to use that technology to offer an ESPN streaming service that offers live game streaming and programming not offered on regular ESPN. \nThe BAMTech deal is a \"great way for us to move ESPN and probably other Disney assets into digital, mobile platforms in a more effective way,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger said at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York in September. It's also a way for Disney to learn more about its viewers for advertising purposes, he told analysts on a conference call Thursday. \nMeanwhile, in the U.K. there is Disney Life, launched a year ago, a 10 pound ($15) monthly service that offers Disney movies, TV shows, e-books, and other children's content online. Iger said Disney wants to learn from that service before launching a similar service in the United States. \nWhile there's some \"inevitability\" to launching a similar service in the U.S., \"I'm not prepared to discuss timing,\" Iger told analysts. \n\"You can use that as a template for what they might do in the U.S.,\" Nomura's DiClemente said. \nSo far in the U.S., Disney has been working with streaming services Hulu and Netflix to bring its properties to the stream. Its deal with Netflix, inked in 2012, finally kicked in this September, and gives Netflix the right to stream Disney movies like \"Zootopia\" before others. Netflix is also the exclusive home for Marvel TV shows like \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Luke Cage.\" \nAnd last week, Hulu said there would be a Disney channel on its upcoming live online TV service. Disney owns part of Hulu, which is a joint venture between Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast 's NBCUniversal and Time Warner . \nIn short, Disney is adapting to the stream, and those efforts will pay off eventually, DiClemente said. \nInvestors hope that day comes soon. Disney reported Thursday that fiscal fourth-quarter net income rose 10 percent to $1.77 billion, while sales fell 3 percent to $13.14 billion. But adjusted earnings amounted to $1.10 per share, which fell short of Wall Street estimates. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $1.16 per share on revenue of $13.5 billion. \nDisney said sales and operating income in media networks, its biggest unit, were down because of lower advertising and affiliate revenue from ESPN, along with higher programming costs. Disney Channels also saw lower results. \nRevenue from Disney parks and resorts grew slightly, while the studios division saw revenue rise 2 percent to $1.81 billion. The company said the films \"Finding Dory\" and \"Captain America: Civil War\" are still drawing crowds, making up for the weaker-than-expected performance of \"Pete's Dragon\" and \"Queen of Katwe.\"",

      "text": "\nEven though the buzz surrounding Stranger Things has died down since the summer, fans are hungry for any scrap of news they can get about the second season. But since we don’t frequently get updates like Sean Astin and Paul Reiser being added to the cast in key roles, sometimes we just need some Stranger Things stuff to hold us over, and we’ve got a nice little video to do just that.\nOne dedicated fan and LEGO builder has decided to recreate some of the scenes from Stranger Things using some custom minifigures and sets and the magic of stop-motion animation. Watch the LEGO Stranger Things video after the jump, but beware of spoilers if you haven’t watched the entire first season. \n\nNow before you get bent out of shape about the fact that this stop-motion animation clearly isn’t professional, that’s actually what I love about it. This was clearly a passion project by a true fan, and they spent hours creating it. So while this might not be as impressive as you hoped, I actually think the fact that it feels like a quaint, homegrown project adds a certain charm to it.\nPlus, I like that the video gives us LEGO versions of all our favorite characters, even the sadly forgotten Barb. Maybe one day we’ll get an official LEGO Stranger Things set. After all, we’re getting a whole line of Funko POP Vinyl figures of characters on the show.\nIf you haven’t seen it yet, watch the A Charlie Brown Christmas mash-up with Stranger Things over here.\nThe post LEGO Stranger Things: A Homegrown Brick Recreation Of Netflix’s Popular Series appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "Tweet \nWe have had a good mixture of new films on Netflix UK this week starting with another Netflix Original movie, “True Memoirs of an International Assassin” starring Kevin James. When a publisher rebrands a novice author’s crime novel as a memoir, he gets forced into a political heist. With only his book-writing knowledge to help him, he must pretend to be his lead character in order to survive. \nThe highly-rated Dutch war film “Black Book” has made a welcome return this week. After evading capture by the Nazis, Rachel, a Jew, ends up in The Netherlands. Taking on a new Aryan identity she joins the Dutch Resistance to try and infiltrate the enemy. \nFollowing on with the war theme, which seems appropriate given today’s date, we have the harrowing documentary series “Einsatzgruppen: The Nazi Death Squads”. The series examines the Nazi group that were responsible for mass-murder of Jews, Russians and Gypsies during the war. \nAnd, finally, for our last pick of the week is another interesting documentary filmed, perhaps surprisingly, in North Korea under strict government control. While essentially a propaganda film, the documentary often continues to film off script giving some insight into the life of a young girl and her family as she gets picked to take part an the annual ritual/ceremony often described as brainwashing youngsters to be a part of ‘the system’. \nRead on for the full list of this week’s additions: 11 New Movies Streaming on Netflix UK: \nAllende (2014) Black Book (2006) – Streaming Again Capote (2005) – Streaming Again Here on Earth (2000) – Streaming Again The Innocents (2015) Kathleen Madigan: Bothering Jesus (2016) The Late Bloomer (2016) Once Upon a Holiday (2015) Ouija (2014) True Memoirs of an International Assassin (2016) 8 New Documentaries Streaming on Netflix UK: \nA Syrian Love Story (2015) The Beginning of Life: The Series (2016) Einsatzgruppen: The Nazi Death Squads (2009) My Way (2016) Patterns of Evidence: Exodus (2014) Roman Empire: Reign of Blood (2016) [Season 1 Added] Tales by Light (2015) [Season 1 Added] Under the Sun (2015) 2 New TV Series Streaming on Netflix UK: \nEstocolmo (2016) [Season 1 Added] Love Family (2013) Also on What's on Netflix Subscribe to our newsletter",

      "text": "11/11/16 AT 10:20 AM Close \nCan you believe it’s been 15 years since “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” (“Philosopher’s Stone” for some) was released in theaters? \nIn celebration of the movie’s release date anniversary on Monday, Nov. 14, it’s likely fans of J.K. Rowling’s tale will want to relive the magic on the small screen.

      "text": "If you've watched even just an episode or two of Netflix's The Crown , you've likely already fallen under its spell — lush sets, elaborate costumes, stunning cinematography (it's rumored to be one of the most expensive shows ever produced), but what gives the show its pathos is lead actress Claire Foy, who portrays the first days of Queen Elizabeth with a performance that ranges from naïve to steely to circumspect — often all in the same scene. Yahoo Style: How did the role come your way? \nClaire Foy: Just in the classic way, actually. I just auditioned for it. My agent rang me up and asked, “Do you want to go on a meet?” Of course, at the time I didn’t realize I’d be meeting [director] Stephen Daldry, [writer] Peter Morgan, and Andy Harris, the producer. They’re all quite big wigs. That was a bit scary, but it was just a really lovely chat. I had no expectations of getting it or anything, so I think I was really quite relaxed. It was just really lovely. Then I had a second audition, and then found out that I’d got it, which was a real shock. Really exciting. \nHow familiar were you with the Queen's early years? \nI think everybody in England and around the world is familiar with her because she’s been around for my entire life — our generation has grown up with her there as a prominent figure. But I wasn’t aware of her as a young mother or anything like that. Obviously, I knew everything about Edward the 8th and the abdication of the throne, and the fact she wasn’t destined to be Queen, but that’s what happened. Her life could’ve been very, very different. I didn’t really know anything about the death of her father and how unexpected it was. \nHow did you find yourself inhabiting that state of mind? \nI think Peter’s scripts are amazing and they do all the work for you, really. Also, I think if you’re grieving or you’re in massive amounts of shock, I think you just take every day as it comes. I don’t think as a character she could’ve thought about the magnitude of what was happening to her and the job that she was taking on and how that would change her life. I think she would’ve had a breakdown. She so obviously didn’t, in public anyway. \nWould you say that was the most challenging part of the production? \nI had a newborn baby, so-\nOh, my gosh. Congratulations. \nThanks very much. That was quite challenging. Amazing but challenging. It was also one of the biggest jobs I’d done, and there was a lot to get right. It wasn’t just about having an emotional connection to it. It was also about getting the physicality and the voice, and all those things that come with a character, so there was a lot of homework to do as well in order to, when you were on set, be able to be relaxed and just play the scene naturally. It took quite a lot of inhabiting to get to the point where you’re comfortable with that.\nDid you work with a coach who helped you do those things? \nYes. William Conacher, who’s the best dialect coach in the world because he didn’t ever say to us, “This is how she sounds. You’ve got to do it.” We all found our collective sounds, which I think is really important, but we also found ourselves in the voices. It wasn’t like we were trying to do an impression because otherwise we’re trying to be perfect the entire time. You’re not going to be able to play a scene, so he was just amazing at giving us little ways in and funny little physical things that distract you from your voice and you end up doing it anyway.\nObviously the Queen has been portrayed on film and in theater numerous times already. Did you feel any pressure from that? \nNo. Those performances matter because they’re amazing, but I tried not to let them affect me. I watched The Queen very early on, mainly just because it’s a really good film, and I could pretend I was doing research, but luckily, the pressure was off in that way because I was playing her younger and there’s not that much footage or accounts of her when she’s at that age. The pressure to be an identical version of her, I didn’t really feel that so much. I didn’t go and see the play. I would’ve loved to but I just think it would’ve terrified me, if I’d have gone to go and watch those two amazing women do it. I would’ve probably not been able to do the job.\nThat pressure would be too great! \nRead More As an actor, you’re used to other people playing, especially if you do Shakespeare or you’re used to that “There’s been a thousand people before you” idea. Obviously a couple of people have played her, but it felt very original to me. It felt like a very original story.\nAs the Queen rises to power, there's this tension because she's obviously a woman who ascends the monarchy and position of power. In ways, it feels remarkably topical and yet also very specific to its time and place. \nI think there’s a real risk to turn her into a sort of feminist icon. I think it’d be, not missing the point, but a bit too convenient because it’s far more complicated than that. I think she’s definitely in a man’s world and she’s definitely trying to find her way through it and do the job to the best of her ability, but the thing that’s so amazing about the show and her is she’s a fully fledged, fleshy human being. She is a mother, she’s a wife, she’s the Queen, she’s a daughter. Every aspect of her life is so complex, when it comes to the fact that at the center of it, she’s got to be the head of the family, the head of the church, the head of the country. It would be amazing to identify it as one thing, of her as a leader, but it's not simply that.\nWe all inhabit different roles in different arenas. \nThat’s why I think it feels modern, but it is very much a product of its time. The fact is that they have a very conventional, 1950s marriage, she and Phillip, and she wants it to be that way. She insists that to love, honor and obey being part of the marriage service [in the first episode], and that she very much, as time went on, insisted that he was the master of the house and she was the Queen. I do think it’s very much of its time as well as being relevant for today because we're watching people struggle with things that we all struggle with.\nHave there been other projects that you've been free to work on? \nI did do a film in the summer, which was lovely. It's called Breathe with Andrew Garfield, directed by Andy Serkis. Andrew Garfield plays a polio sufferer called Robin Cavendish, and I play his wife, Diane Cavendish, based on a true story. That’s why the hair.\nYes, you're blonde! \nI know. That was for the film. I never, ever would’ve done it. I’m so dark naturally, so that’s one of the real perks of the job. You can completely change the way you look and the risk is that you might look like rubbish, but you could always say, “I’m doing this for work.” It isn’t like you’ve taken a massive risk.\nYou can absolve yourself of responsibility. \nYou can say, “It wasn’t my fault!” Also, they get the best possible people to do it. I love it. I really do think blondes have more fun.\nDo you? Do people react differently to you? \nDefinitely. A lot more friendly. I think it’s just a natural thing. It’s just more shiny and, \"Ooh, the light catches you.\" When you’re brunette, I think your eye isn’t drawn in the same way. I’m probably going to be blonde for the rest of my life. I’m going to be really depressed to go back.",

      "text": "Marvel and Netflix are pushing forward with a third season of Daredevil, and that's sure to come with the introduction of more new characters. Someone that actor Charlie Cox would love to add to the mix is Bullseye. Of course, his co-stars don't share that same enthusiasm. In an interview with ScreenGeek, he explained: “It’s no secret, I’ve said it before and I get in trouble every time I say it, I’d like to see Bullseye make an appearance at some point. I think it’s a really interesting opportunity. Deborah Ann Woll obviously does not want Bullseye to show up for obvious reasons. Elodie Yung, who plays Elektra, doesn’t want Bullseye to show up either.” For those of you who are familiar with the comics then you know why Woll and Yung don't want to bring in Bullseye... because he ends up killing them. Of course, Marvel has been known to change things up for the sake of the MCU, so if they did introduce Bullseye, they could take his story arc into another direction. The character could definitely add some hardcore emotional weight to the series. Cox goes on to talk about how he purposely blinded himself so that he could portray the character properly. “I don’t know if you know this [or not] but on the first season, I was trying to figure out how to do it. I went to this specialist, an opticianist – and I had these lenses made that were identical to my eyes but they completely blinded me. You put them in and I couldn’t see a thing and I thought great, I’ll do that and I don’t have to do any acting. The problem with that was that after every take, someone from the crew had to come and get me and lead me away and kind of sit me down. After the second day, I was like this is going to get really old, really quick.” It doesn't sound like it would be very fun or easy to be wearing those lenses when trying to play this character, especially in those action sequences! I seriously doubt that he wore them when they shot those scenes, though. The next time we'll see Daredevil in action is in The Defenders, which is being released in 2017. Would you like to see Bullseye make his grand entrance in the MCU in season three?",

      "title": "Who Is Rory Most Likely To End Up With On Gilmore Girls?",
      "text": "By jessica rawden 16 minutes ago \nNetflix is usually pretty tight-lipped about its original programs, but there has been a lot of talk in particular about one of the shows that is coming up: Gilmore Girls . We've heard a lot about the past characters that will be showing up in the new episodes, including each or Rory's former boyfriends on the series. But who will Rory end up with? Luckily, there are some clues out there to help us get to an answer. \nFirst and foremost, Dean is probably not it. Alexis Bledel revealed in a recent interview that she only filmed one scene with Jared Padalecki for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . It would be really hard to spark up a relationship, figure out all of your problems from the past and end up happily ever after all in one scene, so I think it's safe to say that Dean is going to be out of the running, here. \nGilmore Girls is being far less transparent with Logan and Jess . According to his IMBD profiles, Milo Ventimiglia---who plays Jess---is expected to appear in three of the four 90-minute episodes. If his profile is correct, Matt Czuchry's Logan will actually appear in all four episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life , which should theoretically give him the most time to impress Rory. In a recent interview, however, Matt Czuchry inadvertently revealed that while he knows how the show is ending, he's not actually in the final scene. Here's what he said, per Haute Living . \nI am not going to talk about the details of the ending right now. That is for Amy and Dan to talk about because it is their ending, not mine. I am very protective of Amy and Dan since they trusted me by sharing the last scene and last four words with me before the release of the series. I know fans are really excited about the ending. As they should be, and they will certainly have a LOT of passionate discussions about the ending. I guarantee that. \nSo, Matt Czuchry knows what the final scene is, but he doesn't look to be in that final scene, since the creators had to share the ending with him. This doesn't necessarily preclude his character from ending up with a Gilmore. I personally always guessed that the last four words on Gilmore Girls , the words show creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has been thinking about for a decade, had to be words between Lorelei Gilmore and Rory Gilmore. The show has first and foremost been a series about a mother-daughter relationship, and to me, that ending would make the most sense, and wouldn't preclude Luke and Lorelei figuring their stuff out or Rory finding someone to spend her future with. \nThe latter especially fits, considering that Amy Sherman-Palladino has been touting the idea that Rory's story has always been more about her career than her boyfriends. While I'd argue both have been equally important to the storyline, she's the writer, and if she wants Rory's love life to take the backseat or to even take a new turn with a new boyfriend, that's going to be what happens. \nIf you are hoping for an answer to those four little words ahead of the premiere, don't bet on it. Amy Sherman-Palladino revealed to TV Line that they may have filmed some decoy final scenes, much like The Walking Dead and other shows. \nWe shifted it around a lot, did a couple of rewrites. It was a little silly. It was a little cloak and dagger. \nIf we're looking just at episode count, Logan's currently ahead on who Rory will end up with, but with all of the information out there, there's no ruling out Jess, another man or no man at this point, although I think it's safe to say #TeamDean is out. Luckily, we'll find out soon. New episodes of Gilmore Girls hit Netflix on November 25. To find out what else is coming to Netflix, check out our 2017 schedule .

      "text": "Tweet \nNetflix’s new smash American-British period series The Crown follows the biographical story about the early reign of Queen Elizabeth II from her wedding in 1947 to the present day. Reportedly the most expensive series Netflix has made yet, with a staggering budget north of $120 million, that money is obviously worthwhile. From the sets, makeup, and sumptuous costumes to the stunning cast, it succeeds in completely transporting the viewer to another time. Set against the backdrop of a Great Britain still recovering from the impact of World War II, the drama follows the young Queen facing enormous responsibilities to Crown and country. It looks at the intrigue, love lives and political rivalries behind notable events, especially how responsibility to her title affects her family relationships. The crown itself changes their entire family dynamic. It has been billed as the “the inside story of two of the most famous addresses in the world – Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street.” The Cast \nThe most obvious sign of money well spent is The Crown’s brilliant cast. Claire Foy (Wolf Hall) is magnificent as the young Queen and has surpassed all expectations. Matt Smith (Dr. Who) is her beleaguered husband Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who has his own problems adjusting to their new stations in life. Already having his own cross to bear in regards to country and family, he is reluctant to concede to the traditions of the British Establishment. But the biggest standout by far has to be John Lithgow. He is completely transformed as cantankerous Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Lithgow said of the role: \n“He has two particular on-going dramas. One is teaching the Queen to be a Queen, and the other is hanging onto the role of Prime Minister…A lion in winter.” Jon Lithgow as Winston Churchill \nThe remainder of the cast is all outstanding, particularly Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret, Ben Miles as Group Captain Peter Townsend, and Jeremy Northam as Anthony Eden. All characters we can expect to see in season 2. First The Bad News \nDon’t fall in love too deeply with ANY of the actors because they will be replaced as the story progresses and the characters age. They will be returning for season 2, but as this is projected to be a 6 season project covering about a decade each season of history, obvious changes will have to be made as the story moves forward in time. New performers will be brought on for the third season. What’s Next? \nSeason 2 has started shooting at locations around the U.K. The series will move forward historically in season two, continuing the young queen’s story through 1964, with one or two different characters. Creator Peter Morgan: \n“It’s the post-Churchill era. But it’s still a very particular era of Britain,” Morgan said. “It’s not yet what I would call modern Britain. That would start in the mid-’60s.” \nWe are also going to be introduced to a lot more of Prince Phillip’s history. As Phillip embarks on a world tour, more focus will be placed on his background. Actor Matt Smith, who plays character Phillip says, \n“We learn a lot more about Prince Philip,” he also reveals, “A lot about his past. He had a very interesting past, Philip. Quite a mad past. And we go into that in a lot of detail.” \nThe Crown makes a solid argument for the exercise of power as the stuff of compelling drama. I expect the series will be a serious player come awards season. \nSeason 2 should be released in the late fall 2017. Likely, Netflix will see how the show fares in early November and possibly move it to Thanksgiving or the holidays to generate buzz for the series. Netflix typically releases a huge show around Thanksgiving or at the very end of November. Perhaps, next year will be the year for The Crown. Season 1 of The Crown is streaming now on Netflix.

(photos provided) \nVaidya stars as Balan Shri Ramakrishnan, a recent import from India in the Netflix show, “Brown Nation.” “It’s really hard to play a dumb guy smartly,” Vaidya told India-West. “You don’t know what’s going to come out of this guy’s mouth half the time. Abi allowed me the freedom to do a lot of improv, and I feel it’s definitely a memorable character.” \nIf you just finished streaming your favorite series on Netflix and are looking for something exciting to fill the void, “Brown Nation,” a satirical comedy full of heart and laughs about the lives of Indian Americans, may just be the one. \nStarring actor-comedian Omi Vaidya (“3 Idiots”), Melanie Chandra, (“Code Black”), Shenaz Treasurywala (“Delhi Belly”) and New York-based theater artist Rajeev Varma, among other talented cast members, the series, with a relatable storyline and witty dialogues, will see its world premiere on Netflix Nov. 15. \nA 10-part Season 1 of “Brown Nation” whirls around the everyday life of Hasmukh, a hilarious character who is dealing with a failing IT company in Queens, New York. Other than holding his dysfunctional office together, Hasmukh also has to navigate various personal relationships: with his struggling artist wife, live-in father-in-law and a dog. \nDirected and written by Indian American filmmaker Abi Varghese, the series mirrors real-life situations and fictionalizes some in equal measure. \n“The show is about the daily quirkiness that we have,” Varghese told India-West . “You know, issues like marriage, five-year anniversary, little things like slices of life. We have tried to incorporate a lot of that which will be relatable to the major audiences.” \nIn an attempt to reignite his business, Hasmukh brings in Balan Shri Ramakrishnan from India, played by the ubiquitous comic actor Vaidya. \n“I wanted to do something different and Abi approached me with this role of Balan,” Vaidya told India-West . “He is really terrible at English, and he tries to communicate, but he struggles. He is dimwitted but he has a very warm heart.” \n“Hasmukh wanted a South Indian guy, since he has a theory that they are smarter. So he brings in Balan, and he turns out to be the opposite,” Varghese added. \nThe premise of the first episode, titled, “Farewell Papaji,” is: Grandparents from India are coming to the U.S to stay with their daughter’s family. That day, they find out their grandson is gay and have difficulty dealing with it. \nVaidya said he had never played a character like Balan before but asserted that it is a likeable character. “It’s really hard to play a dumb guy smartly,” he stated. “You don’t know what’s going to come out of this guy’s mouth half the time. Abi allowed me the freedom to do a lot of improv and I feel it’s definitely a memorable character.” \nVaidya admitted that while he was attracted to the production design, the style of comedy of the sitcom, along with his cute lovable character, he was still a bit apprehensive prior to joining the cast. His dilemma was it may be too Indian for a network in America and a bit too international for an Indian channel. \n“This was a new project in English about a bunch of South Asians and international people,” Vaidya explained to India-West . “I was like, where is it going to go? I have never seen a market for something like this.” \nEchoing similar thoughts, Varghese said, “Initially we had difficulty knowing where is the audience. We didn’t know if it was a Star Plus show.” \nNetflix, which is building a truly global network, finally came around, the duo said. “They are really trying to capture the global audience and this is a global product. It is about all sorts of different people in an international city of New York. It very timely and its very funny,” asserted Vaidya. \nVarghese went on to say, “Netflix, I think, is the right audience for it since it is for younger generation. People who are able to understand English but who have grown up watching ‘The Office’ and ‘Modern Family’ and all that.” \nLauding Varghese for his attention to detail, Vaidya said, “Abi comes from a corporate background originally, so he put a lot of that sort of comedy of working in a corporate environment into the show.” \nVarghese, who in the past has chronicled the lives of a middle-class Malayali family settled in the U.S. in the Malayalam sitcom “Akkara Kazhchakal,” which aired on Kairali TV from 2008 to 2010, also directed the Vijay Raaz and Fahadh Faasil-starrer Malayalam film, “Monsoon Mangoes.” \nCreative freedom drew Varghese back to TV, he said. “After ‘Monsoon Mangoes,’ I decided to come back to a TV sitcom because I enjoy it. It is also a little bit more relaxing on set as you get to explore the characters a bit more,” Varghese told India-West . “There is also a lot of room for improvement within the set itself, something that we would not be able to do in the writing plan.” \nFor “Brown Nation,” he said he and some of his friends created three pilot episodes back in 2013. The episodes stirred a lot of interest among those who watched them, so he decided to take it up a notch. The pre-production work, which lasted three months, began in late 2014, he said, adding that it took another three months to finalize the cast. The total shoot time of all the ten episodes was 30 days. \nIt is often said that comedy is harder than drama, and Vaidya, known for his impeccable comic timing, seconds that notion. \n“In comedy television you are finding the funny, and to find the funny you have to be aware of what is going on in the scene. How they are shooting it? What is the crux of the scene? How you can add to it? What takes away from the crux?” he told India-West . “It’s like you are creating a symphony and you are the violinist. You want to add the right notes that makes everything sounds better. But if you add a bit too much then you take away from everyone else. Maybe you look good but everything else suffers. It’s a delicate balance.” \nVaidya said he approached this role without expectations, but stressed that even as a comic actor he keeps his serious side on camera. \n“Even though people know me as a comedian I take my work quite seriously in every scene,” the Indian American actor said. “Every time I was talking or adding or changing something, I would always try to make it for the benefit of the scene. I would try to find something new, something special in the character.” Tags ",

      "text": "Home > Android > Why Doesn’t your Android TV Box Play Full HD or 4K Videos in Netflix? Why Doesn’t your Android TV Box Play Full HD or 4K Videos in Netflix? Tweet \nI’m not a Netflix user myself, but I know many of my readers are, and a frequent complain was the inability to play Full HD or 4K content, except on specific devices such as WeTek Core or Nvidia Shield Android TV . Until now, I thought most TV box manufacturers did not get DRM and Netflix support to reduce costs, but after reading one article about this very subject on AndroidPCReview , I realized it was more complicated than that. \nBeside the obvious hardware requirements that you need a Full HD or 4K capable player and television, the device needs to be certified by Google, and Widevine Level 1 DRM is required to stream anything above SD resolution from premium apps such as HBO Go or Netflix. \nHowever while many devices are certified by Google , only a few are officially supported by Netflix. The company also ranks device by categories such as Smart TVs, Smartphones & tablets, and within the “streaming media players” category only Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Roku, Amazon Fire TV (2015), British Telecom BT DTRT-4000, TiVo Bolt, Google Nexus Player and NVIDIA Shield are said to be supported. \nIf you run Android on a media player, it will likely be considered as a tablet, and you allegedly need to run Android TV on your media player for it to considered for certification. But since WeTek Core is simply running Android 5.1, and supports Netflix Full HD video playback (but maybe not 4K), there may be exceptions to this rule… \nSo the biggest problem with Full HD or/and 4K support in Netflix is the need for Netflix certification. One relatively well-known Android TV box manufacturer has been trying for 2 to 3 years, and unfortunately Netflix simply does not want to work with them. \nOne of the reason might be because it’s a small company not selling million of units in the US per year. It’s very common that companies don’t want to sell, work or even talk to you if you don’t have a significant volume projections, but if you do they’ll even invite you for lunch or dinner regularly… This is because every company has to manage their resources carefully, but we don’t exactly what the workload on Netflix is to certify one device. The company in question is probably roughly the same size as WeTek, so it might depend on your business relationship too, not only volume or company size… Another reason could be that the company in question in based on Asia, albeit in a “country” with a decent IP protection record, and Netflix might be wary to give their secret DRM sauce to regions of the world it might not trust. \nSo the takeaway here is that if you want to have Netflix Full HD or 4K in your Android device, you’ll have to buy a certified device, and Neflix won’t be found on low cost Android TV boxes, not because the manufacturers want to cut costs and/or don’t go through the certification process, but simply because Netflix won’t let them in in their “closed system”.",

      "text": "Stream the Debut Film From the Director of ‘Moonlight’ on Netflix By Monica Castillo Tracey Heggins and Wyatt Cenac in “Medicine for Melancholy.” David Bornfriend/IFC Films \n“Moonlight” has been rapturously received by audiences. The Miami-based drama about Chiron, a young, gay African-American boy, and his maturity into manhood has earned high marks from several critics, including The New York Times’s A. O. Scott , who called it “about as beautiful a movie as you are ever likely to see.” Only the second feature film from the director Barry Jenkins, the movie is filled with vibrant color, gorgeous uses of light and deep wells of emotion — fear, love and betrayal. \nThe film is slowly rolling out to theaters across the nation, but if you’ve seen it and are in need of a post-“Moonlight” fix (or if you’re just curious), you can stream Jenkins’s first film, the low-key romantic drama “Medicine for Melancholy,” on Netflix . A trailer for \"Medicine for Melancholy.\" Video by strikeanywherefilms \nSet in San Francisco, “Medicine for Melancholy” begins after an awkward one-night stand between strangers. Micah (Wyatt Cenac) wants to learn more about Jo (Tracey Heggins), but she’s standoffish, in a long distance relationship and not interested. At first. Like Ethan Hawke’s character in the “Before Sunrise ” trilogy , Micah convinces her to spend the day (and night) with him so that they can learn more about each other. \nBut the movie is more than just romantic tension. Micah and Jo openly fight about class and their rapidly gentrifying city. Each has a different view about how race affects relationships, including their own. Micah seems bothered more by the fact that Jo’s boyfriend is white than by the fact that she has a boyfriend. “Medicine for Melancholy” is no less subtle when it comes to money issues. Micah works a manual job setting up aquariums for rich clients while Jo’ helps her curator boyfriend in San Francisco’s art gallery scene. The contrast also extends to their apartments: Jo’ calls a spacious loft home and Micah squeezes his belongings into an overstuffed studio. Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins in “Medicine for Melancholy.” IFC Films \nWhile the characters flirt and romance starts to bloom, the screen’s colors do not reflect what’s happening. “Medicine for Melancholy” almost looks as though it were filmed in sepia, with a few splotches of color popping here and there. It’s as if there were clouds looming over the couple’s impromptu fling. Only a few scenes are in full color, which can be intrusive after your eyes have adjusted to the muted landscape. This usually happens when the two are not together and no words are spoken. \nFor a first film, “Medicine for Melancholy” is an accomplishment and a promise of things to come. Here Jenkins is still playing around with form, color and story to find his voice. Sometimes the experiments work, other times they don’t. One sidebar scene leaves Micah and Jo to drop in on a random group discussion on gentrification. But that’s not where our attention is. It’s on the two characters we were watching, wondering if they will awkwardly melt together or tear each other apart. \nSee where to stream “Medicine for Melancholy.” HAVE A MOVIE OR TV QUESTION?

      "text": "By Caitlin Gallagher 3 hours ago \nSome movies and TV shows you have repeatedly watched on Netflix. And that's understandable since you really can't ever get enough of Friends episodes. But other movies and TV shows you have ignored on Netflix . Yet again, this is understandable since Netflix's catalog is impressive and at times, overwhelming. Still, just because it's understandable does not mean it's acceptable and there are movies and shows that you are guilty of scrolling past on Netflix repeatedly. Luckily, this list is here to help you remedy your streaming laziness problem. \nMaybe you have been planning to watch that show for years. Or maybe you didn't even know that movie existed. Yeah, yeah — I've heard all those excuses before because I've said them too. However, I also know for a fact that sometimes your eyes just glaze over the plethora of titles available on Netflix and you enter default mode as you select Gilmore Girls again for the 100th time. So whether you've been procrastinating watching a classic film or just were unaware of a TV series that's totally worth watching, it's time to broaden those glorious streaming horizons and step out of your comfort zone. \nNetflix's scheduling is always changing, but here are 17 movies and shows that are available on Netflix right now that you should make the time to watch — for real. 1. BoJack Horseman [Embed] \nIf for nothing else, watch this Netflix original animated series about a washed-up horse actor —yup, that's the premise, don't judge — to pick out all of the awesome actors lending their voices. 2. Moana with Sound \nWith Disney's new animated film Moana hitting theaters on Nov. 23, watch this restored 1926 \"docufiction\" film , which had the name first. It highlights Samoan culture and will impress you visually — especially considering it's an astounding 90 years old. 3. Piku [Embed] \nHave you noticed how many Bollywood films are on Netflix, but don't know where to start? Check out Piku — this 2015 comedy-drama that deals with constipation — but I promise there's much more to it than that! 4. Trailer Park Boys [Embed] \nNetflix has an unholy amount of Trailer Park Boys available, from the original series, to the Netflix reboot, to comedy specials, to movies. I was reluctant to watch — and trust me, it can be offensive — but this Canadian mockumentary has officially won be over. You'll be drinking liquor and cursing like Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles before you know it. 5. On Golden Pond [Embed] \nIf you're into Oscar stats, then you already know that both Katharine Hepburn and Peter Fonda won the Best Actress and Best Actor statues for their roles, so you know their worth watching. 6. Real Husbands of Hollywood [Embed] \nIf you have a love-hate relationship with reality TV, then Kevin Hart's BET series making playful fun of shows like The Real Housewives has got you covered. 7. A Trip to the Moon [Embed] \nIt's only 15 minutes long, so you can make time for this silent French film from 1902 (in color and with music on Netflix). Plus, next time you see the iconic image of the man in the moon from the movie on someone's wall, you'll actually know what it's referencing. 8. Blue Is the Warmest Color [Embed] \nOn the other end of the French film spectrum is this three-hour-long 2013 film about a relationship between two young women. You've probably heard about it even if you haven't watched it since it was critically acclaimed, but also because of its notably graphic and notably lengthy lesbian sex scene . 9. Planet Earth [Embed] \nYou have seen clips of Planet Earth since it premiered in 2006, but it deserves you sitting down and watching all 11 breathtaking episodes. 10. Fruitvale Station [Embed] \nThis film was also adored by critics in 2013 and it's based on the true story of the shooting of Oscar Grant. You can watch Michael B. Jordan lead this powerful — and socially important — film. 11. The Endless Summer [Embed] \nAnother movie with an iconic poster that you have surely seen around. But if you have never watched this surfing documentary, bask in the summer sun and waves this winter. 12. The Spoils of Babylon & The Spoils Before Dying [Embed] \nDidn't catch these two ridiculously quirky spoof miniseries when they originally aired on IFC? Let Will Ferrell's Eric Jonrosh lead you into his dramatic world. 13. Trainspotting [Embed] \nWith Trainspotting 2 going to be released before you know it, make sure you've seen the original '90s film beforehand. 14. Cheers [Embed] \nDid you know all 11 seasons of Cheers are on Netflix?! Well, now you do, so you're required to watch this sitcom gem. 15. Carousel [Embed] \nThis Rodgers and Hammerstein musical will make you want to sing and dance. And cry, like most definitely cry, during the classic and moving song, \"You'll Never Walk Alone.\" 16. Documentary Now! [Embed] \nIFC loves its weird and you can enjoy Bill Hader and Fred Armisen bizarrely pay homage to notable documentaries in this series even without having seen the original docs they are parodying. 17. Club de Cuervos [Embed] \nNetflix's first Spanish-language TV series about the humorous and dramatic power struggles over a Mexican football club was critically praised, so don't let the subtitles scare you away. \nSo no more excuses! Next time you see these titles, give them a chance. \nImages: Eduardo Ramirez/Netflix, Netflix; Giphy (2) Must Reads ",

      "text": "Netflix LUKE CAGE Writer To Pen New (Netflix-Looking) ELEKTRA Title By Chris Arrant, Editor November 11, 2016 11:20am ET Credit: Marvel Comics Credit: Marvel Comics \nA new Elektra series is on its way from Marvel next year, with one of Netflix's Luke Cage screenwriters at the helm. Matt Owens and artist Alec Morgan are working on a new Elektra series scheduled to launch in February 2017. The new series will be set in Las Vegas. \n\"When we find Elektra in this story she is trying to hide in plain sight. She’s running. From everything,\" said Owens. \"Vegas is a place that is extremely unfamiliar to her so that makes it perfect for her to hide out. But much like New York, Vegas has a dark side. And Elektra may not be able to stay out of trouble for long.\" \nAlthough she hasn't ever called Hell's Kitchen home, Elektra is best known for appearing as part of Daredevil in comic books, films, and movies, and Owens has a keen view of the two characters' relationship as it pertains to this new series. \n\"Theirs is an ideal relationship. That might sound strange,\" Owens said with a laugh. \"They bring out the best in each other as far as their fighting and drives are concerned. But they also understand and accept each other’s flaws. Matt and Elektra are two damaged people. It’s hard to open yourself up when you see yourself that way. But these two found one another. But for all the issues they have they are ultimately the one other person they have to turn to for understanding. I think it’s very sweet.\" \nThis will be Owens first time writing comic books - but not his first time working in the comics industry. Owens revealed that he interned at Gaijin Studios under Cully Hamner and Brian Stelfreeze. \n\"I couldn’t be more thankful to finally jump in on my first book!\" said Owens. \"I had an internship in college under such greats as Cully Hamner and Brian Stelfreeze so while I’m not new to comics, this is my first time writing one professionally.\" \n\"Elektra has a very deep and complicated past. It’s a challenging balance to honor that while also trying to move a character forward. No matter where we find her we know one thing to be true about her above all else: she’s a badass. That part will never change,\" said Owens. \"Putting her in unfamiliar places and matching her against unfamiliar foes is what will bring out sides to her she has not explored or is trying to run from. She’s Yojimbo, wandering from nothing and toward nothing. But the call of a hero is hard to ignore.\" ... Updating",

      "text": "Corey D. + Sara Jaye \nGirl power, anyone? \nMeet the young ladies of Netflix’s original series Project Mc 2 : Bella Shouse, 16, Genneya Walton, 17, Mika Abdalle, 16, Ysa Penarejo, 16, and Victoria Vida, 17. \nAs the Emmy-nominated show centers around empowering young women in their day-to-day lives, PEOPLE sat down with the girls to get a better idea of how they plan on getting their message across. \n“The meaning behind the show is that smart is the new cool and that girls can do anything,” Shouse says. “The message is to really focus on S.T.E.A.M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) and to embrace it.” \nThis isn’t your average group of teenage girls — they don’t have time for relationships, gossip, going to the mall or school pep rallies, but they say it’s totally worth it. \n“It’s not your typical teenage life, but you’re surrounded by people who are doing the exact same thing as you that know what it really means what it means to be a part of something like this.” \n“Many times, there’s this idea that girls can’t do science and can’t do this and that, but I love that we’re breaking that stereotype,” Vida adds. “We women are very strong, and very smart. Our role in S.T.E.A.M needs to be bigger. We don’t do that to diminish the role of men, but it’s important for us to embrace women. We can still keep that femininity and wear four-inch heels going to work. I like how diverse we are. There’s not just one type of beauty — beauty comes in all shapes, colors, sizes. That’s what makes our world beautiful, because of the diversity in it.” \nThe show’s third season, which premiered on Oct. 14, encourages a new generation of girls to continue to explore, dream, create and, most importantly, be their true selves.

      "text": "Tweet Nov 11, 2016 \nDownton Abbey lovers can weep with joy at Netflix’s latest original series. The Crown centers around Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II , during her earliest years as England’s reigning monarch. Here are ten reasons to royally binge-watch starting now! \n1. There’s a star-studded cast. tumblr \nViewers might recognize Doctor Who alum Matt Smith , the legendary John Lithgow , and Mad Men alum Jared Harris (to name a few). Known British actors from both TV and film grace this Netflix newbie. We think the acting is, in a word, superb . \n2. Claire Foy, Claire Foy, Claire Foy. giphy \nAnother familiar face comes in the form of Queen Elizabeth II herself. It’s no easy task taking on England’s ruling royal, but Claire Foy (also seen as Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall ) is pretty much flawless. From her mannerisms to her voice, her performance in The Crown is spot on — and certainly one to remember. \n3. It’s a new genre of Netflix original. \nThis year, Netflix has given us superheroes, documentaries, and even aliens. The Crown reaches a whole new audience (see Downton Abbey reference above) and appeals to fans who like their TV dramas with just a splash of class. \n4. It’s based on true events. wordpress \nWe open on a young, newlywed version of the Queen. From her marriage to Prince Philip to the pressures of spearheading an empire in the 1950’s, we get tidbits of history thrown into this fictionalized tale. History nerds and royal family-buffs will love getting the inside scoop on Her Majesty’s early years on the throne. (#LongLiveTheQueen) \n5. The costumes, scenery, and music are beautiful. \nUm, need we say more? \n6. It’s the perfect TV drama. tumblr \nThe royals may seem prim and proper (and they kind of are), but plenty of drama still goes down in this series’ premiere season. Sip your cup of tea and soak in a whole 10 episodes of this masterful period piece. It’s worth it. ",

James Gill and Tim Glanfield \nCan't work out what to watch on Netflix UK? Not sure what's new to the service or where to find the best box sets on Netflix? \nWell, hopefully this updated guide to the best TV shows available right now should be a good start. \nFrom top Netflix original series like Stranger Things and House of Cards, great British dramas like Sherlock, Doctor Who and Peaky Blinders to brilliant US and UK comedy, here are the best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now. \nAnd if you still can't work out what to watch, why not check out our guide to the Top 50 Netflix movies available now ? Stranger Things \nThere's a reason why everyone's talking about it; this brilliantly scary horror series following four normal 1980s kids and one telekinetic super-girl is packed with heart. And an inter-dimensional monster that walks through walls. Oh, and an unmissable soundtrack too. Just watch it. Peaky Blinders \nThis Cillian Murphy-starring crime epic has won acclaim all over the world, with everyone from Tom Cruise to the late David Bowie singing its praises. That's quite a broad fanbase, but the Brummie-based 1920s gang series really does have something for everyone. Sharp suits, sharper razor blades, and performances that cut through all the usual bingewatching dross.",

      "text": "Meet the cast of new Netflix drama The Crown Everything you need to know about the cast and characters of Netflix's £100m series   Radio Times staff Friday 11 November 2016 at 3:40PM \nThe Crown is a brand new Netflix original series, which dramatises Queen Elizabeth II's early reign, revealing the personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries behind the great events that shaped the second half of the 20th Century. \nIt's a 10-part series and is Netflix’s most expensive and ambitious project to date. \n“The Crown brings with it a set of responsibilities and fundamentally realigns the power structure in a way that can only be challenging,” says Peter Morgan, the show's creator. Suddenly, Elizabeth is no longer just a wife, a sister, or a daughter. She is the Queen, the head of the family, the head of state, the head of the Church of England, and the head of the Commonwealth of Nations. \n“What’s made it so interesting to write is not this or that historical event,” says Morgan. “It’s been that this is a family, and within that family is the Crown, and the Crown is a bomb that changes the structure of everything.” \nClaire Foy and Matt Smith are playing the royal couple, but there's plenty more of the cast you need to meet... Claire Foy – Queen Elizabeth II \nPrincess Elizabeth expects to have many years of married bliss before ascending to the throne, but no such luck. Her simple life is cut short when her father, King George VI, dies unexpectedly, and at the age of 25, she inherits the Crown and the unimaginable burden that comes with it. \n“Peter Morgan’s Elizabeth is a quite naïve, sheltered person,” says Foy. “She has been brought up very well, to respect people and do the right thing. But she’s grown up from the age of eleven knowing that she was going to be Queen one day. \n“Ultimately, I think she’s a very kind, loving, strong, determined, funny, clever person. Sometimes she’s allowed to show it, and sometimes she’s not.” \nWhere do I recognise her from? \nFoy is no stranger to period dramas – she played Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall and appeared in Upstairs Downstairs. She is also known for Season of the Witch, Going Postal and Wreckers. Matt Smith – Prince Philip \nPhilip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is in many ways the opposite of his wife. He is reluctant to be browbeaten by the British Establishment, and has his own cross to bear surrounding his own family history. Emotionally orphaned as a young boy, Philip’s greatest sense of loss is that of the tight family unit that he worked so hard to create. \n“He is a loyal person, he has a sort of irreverence and curiosity,” says Smith. “He has a thirst for progress, knowledge and modernity. Plus, he’s got a great sense of humour.” \nWhere do I recognise him from? \nDoctor Who, of course! He was the eleventh – and youngest – person to play the Doctor. Smith also appeared in The Ruby In The Smoke and Diary of Call Girl with Billie Piper, had a role in BBC's Party Animals, and popped up in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies in 2016.",

      "text": "Enlarge Image This is what your Netflix probably looked like yesterday. \nPhoto by Screenshot by Iyaz Akhtar/CNET We know Netflix runs a lot of testing , sometimes without subscribers even noticing -- most notably changing the title card photos of certain properties often. Now, it's begun testing an interface change on desktop.\nPreviously, if you clicked a piece of content, it would open to an Overview tab where you would see a short synopsis of the show, a look at which episode you're on if any, the option to add it to \"My List\" and a large play button. You had multiple tabs for episodes, more content like it, and more details.\nNow, clicking any piece of content gives you a large overlay and an immediately plays the first or next episode with a short overview underneath the playback.\nOnce you've clicked to open a show, you can scroll to see every episode of that particular season. Playing a movie and then scrolling will show you similar titles or more details, such as the cast, genre, ratings and more.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Caitlin Petrakovitz/CNET When you do scroll for more information or content, whatever you're playing will automatically pause. \nEven though the show or movie begins to play in a scrollable overlay window, after about 10 seconds it seamlessly transitions into the full-window experience you would expect. As another change, once it plays full-width you can scroll to access the details and episode list . Again, scrolling will automatically pauses the content, unless you hit spacebar or press play before continuing down the page.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Caitlin Petrakovitz/CNET Don't worry if you hate it though! There's a way to opt-out of the current (and future) testing.\nWhile logged in on a computer, go to Your Account in the upper right. Under the Settings section on this page you'll see a link for Test participation . On this page you can exclude your account from tests and previews; as Netflix says, \"Turn this off to be shifted to the standard experience now.\" (Or just click here .)\nPersonally, I really like the new interface and the ability to scroll through every episode available. But not everyone is enjoying it quite so much . We've reached out to Netflix for comment and will update this once we hear back.\nIn the meantime, check and see if you're in the test group and let us know: Will you exclude yourself from testing immediately, or do you like the change?",

      "text": "\nNetflix is pulling out all the stops to advertise its upcoming Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life revival series: first the Luke’s Diner pop-up cafes, and now the Festival of the Four Seasons.\nThe Festival of the Four Seasons, which was announced today via On Location Vacations , will provide West Coast Gilmore Girls fans with the opportunity to celebrate Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life before it airs. The Festival of the Four Seasons will take place on the Los Angeles campus of the University of California. UCLA and Netflix teamed up to transform part of the campus “into a real-life Stars Hollow,[and] will include a town gazebo, Luke’s Diner, Taylor’s Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe, Kim’s Antiques and much more.”\nThere's a new festival in town. Join us and @netflix for the Festival of Four Seasons on November 19 & 20! Info: https://t.co/cBCtPTOky1 pic.twitter.com/zGOdE66XA5 \n— Gilmore Girls (@GilmoreGirls) November 11, 2016 \n\nThe poster for the Festival of the Four Seasons depicts many classic Gilmore Girls locations. The iconic gazebo, where (spoilers!) Luke Danes and Lorelai Gilmore got engaged, will also be making an appearance. Most interestingly, the poster advertises “appearances by real Stars Hollow citizens,” meaning there will be actors in character as Gilmore Girls characters.\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the “citizens” will be main characters of Gilmore Girls or auxiliary characters. Having Alexis Bledel or Lauren Graham show up to surprise some fans would certainly be great advertising for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .\nThe best way to rewatch \"Gilmore Girls\" https://t.co/82USF7wTeV via @Watching pic.twitter.com/3fOSEWnWlO \n— The New York Times (@nytimes) November 5, 2016 \n\nTickets to the Festival of the Four Seasons are free, and attendees can choose whether to go November 19th or 20th. The event organizers anticipate crowds and advise attendees to arrive early and plan to spend around 45 minutes inside the festival.\nMore information about the festival can be found at the official Stars Hollow website, which is packed with Gilmore Girls Easter eggs. The site advertises the Black & White & Read Bookshop movie night and features a directory section which lists beloved Gilmore Girls institutions like Al’s Pancake World (where no pancakes are served), the Dragonfly Inn, and Miss Patty’s School of Ballet.\nWatch @alexisbledel and @thelaurengraham talk about bringing back @GilmoreGirls to @Netflix_CA https://t.co/1Bxsh7Tfd7 pic.twitter.com/5drV9Fb19u \n— ET Canada (@ETCanada) November 7, 2016 \n\nAdditionally, the site features an advertisement for a new segment called “Ask Kirk.” Kirk Gleeson, the Gilmore Girls village oddball, apparently runs an advice column now, and clicking the advertisement allows the viewer to send Kirk an email asking him for advice. Maybe Kirk, who has always been a jack-of-all-trades, has finally settled down on one profession: giving advice. If so, we could see him working on his column in the upcoming Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .\nAccording to the website, Kirk has one other job as well: webmaster. The front page of the official Stars Hollow website features a message from Kirk.\n“Please excuse any outdated sections of our site as we (Kirk) misplaced the password in 2007. He just found it. We expect to have a fully updated site by November 25th, 2016. Please visit our Town Updates section for a full rundown of what our site has to offer.”\nNovember 25th is the date that Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres on Netflix, so it’s possible that the Stars Hollow website will feature new content to match.\nThe Stars Hollow website also shows that one thing definitely hasn’t changed in the time between Gilmore Girls and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : Taylor Doose is still in charge. The website calls him the “leader and town selectman” who officiates any town meetings or events.\nLastly, the site also features fan artists’ images under the banner of “Local Artists.”\nhttps://sarahwrightart.tumblr.com/post/148506139553/gilmore-girls-ep7-kiss-and-tell-i-got \nFans of Gilmore Girls have been building buzz for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life for months, and the Festival of the Four Seasons will probably provide new hints and clues about the new season.\nThe Festival of the Four Seasons will take place November 19th and 20th and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres on November 25th on Netflix.\n[Featured Image by Warner Bros./Delivered by Online USA]\nCelebrate ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life’ At Festival Of The Four Seasons is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Markets Today Trump, Net Neutrality and Netflix The president-elect has tweeted his displeasure with net neutrality, but ending the policy could require the courts or Congress -- and would shake up the video market. Chris Nolter Nov11,20163:44PMEST \nAs Donald Trump prepares to take office, the fate of net neutrality, or the policy that broadband providers do not favor traffic from one source or destination over another, is in question. \nThe outcome could affect video streaming and other services that consumers use, and and impact companies with streaming services such as Netflix ( NFLX ) , Dish Network ( DISH ) and network operators such as AT&T ( T ) , Verizon ( VZ ) , Comcast ( CMCSA ) and Charter ( CHTR ) . \nComcast is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells CMCSA ? Learn more now . \nNetflix faces the greatest risk among the media companies that UBS tracks, analyst Doug Mitchelson suggested in a report. \n\"Without Net Neutrality rules in place, broadband providers would be able to charge online video services for bandwidth usage, as well as sell priority access (guaranteed streaming quality) and favor their own services,\" Mitchelson wrote. \nNetwork operators could charge Netflix, which declined to comment, a fee to carry its movies and shows. Netflix could face a disadvantage against Hulu, Mitchelson added, because the rival streaming service has struck deals with Cablevision ( CVC ) and other cable providers to allow its service through a channel on set-top boxes. \nWhile net neutrality is absent from the \"positions\" page of the Trump campaign site, the president-elect has tweeted his displeasure with the regulations.

      "text": "\nElektra is ditching Hell’s Kitchen for greener pastures—Las Vegas. Elektra #1 finds her on the West Coast and trying to make sense of her new environment while hiding in plain sight. The comic is being written by Matt Owens, one of the writers from Netflix’s Luke Cage , and is illustrated by artist Alec Morgan, who also worked on DC’s Aquaman series.\n“When we find Elektra in this story she is trying to hide in plain sight,” Morgan told Marvel.com . “She’s running. From everything. Vegas is a place that is extremely unfamiliar to her so that makes it perfect for her to hide out. But much like New York, Vegas has a dark side. And Elektra may not be able to stay out of trouble for long.”\nTrouble finds her in the form of Arcade, the classic Marvel villain who first popped up in Marvel Team-Up #65 . “[Arcade] is so kooky. But at the same time he is not someone to be underestimated,” he added. “He’s a brilliant inventor and a sadistic killer. He’s incredibly dangerous. It’s a different kind of threat for Elektra. As far as his interest in Elektra, she is one of the most formidable killers in the Marvel Universe. She fits perfectly into the new game he has constructed. So when she comes on his radar he simply can’t resist!”\nThis formidable threat is what will eventually bring her back to New York City. Elektra #1 heads to stands in February 2017 and will feature cover art by Elizabeth Torque.\n(via Comic Book Resources , image via screencap)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip is seen sleeping in several scenes in Netflix's lavishly scripted royal drama The Crown. \nThe difference is, his royal bum is exposed. \nIs Prince Philip a fan of sleeping in the nude? \nAccording to some reports, yes, and like many other royal factoids, the detail has been massaged into The Crown, a highly watchable and addictive series that dramatises the life and relationships of the young queen, who was made monarch in 1952. \nBritish actress Claire Foy plays the Queen and Matt Smith, who starred in Dr Who from 2010 to 2013, is her husband Prince Philip. \nThe Crown, whose first season of 10 episodes was released on Internet streaming service Netflix last week, looks at all that young Elizabeth had to deal with when she was suddenly made queen at the age of 25 after her father, King George VI, died of lung cancer. \nNo one imagines her as a young woman making choices about a marriage, learning how to become queen and the kind of sacrifices she had to make. No one imagines her as a romantic creature and becoming a mother. \nPETER MORGAN, creator and writer of The Crown, who wants to humanise the royal family \nSet in post-World War II Britain, the sumptuous US$120-million (S$169-million) drama also has sensitive portrayals of towering historical figures - no, not Smith's pair of kingly globes - such as then-prime minister Winston Churchill, played by John Lithgow as an ageing but determined politician. \nIt is also a highly personal behind-the-scenes look at Her Majesty's life when she takes off the crown. \nIt features marital squabbles between the Queen and her husband, as well as sibling rivalry with her sister Princess Margaret (played by Vanessa Kirby). \nBut lest you think that the show is indulging prurient curiosities, creator and writer of the series Peter Morgan assures viewers that this was never the intention. \nIncluding such personal scenes simply helps to \"humanise\" the royal family, says Morgan at an interview with The Straits Times in a hotel in London. \n\"There is something about the royal family - you think you know them, but you don't, really. \n\"I always say that the Queen is the most visible invisible woman in the world. \n\"No one imagines her as a young woman making choices about a marriage, learning how to become queen and the kind of sacrifices she had to make. No one imagines her as a romantic creature and becoming a mother,\" he says. \nHaving said that, Morgan, 53, was careful \"not to tip into the salacious\" - which means there will not be any racy sex scenes between the royal couple. \n\"You want to go close, but not too close on some things. I was more interested in the emotional aspects of their lives - that loneliness and difficulty the Queen must have felt when she was suddenly made queen at the age of 25. \n\"As a woman, mother, wife and sister - how does she deal with all of that?\", says the Oscar-nominated writer of The Queen (2006) and Frost/Nixon (2008). \nIn a separate interview, the show's director and executive producer Stephen Daldry, 56, muses on the same topic: \"It's all a matter of taste, isn't it? \n\"I'm interested in the drama in the Queen's family and how that affects our lives. I'm not interested in seeing them in intimate circumstances,\" says the Oscar-nominated film-maker of Billy Elliot (2000), The Hours (2002) and The Reader (2008). \nThe second season of The Crown, which moves the story into the 1960s, is currently in production. \nIn the role of the Queen, Foy, 33, says she had to constantly remind herself not to let any pre-conceived notions about her character get in the way. \n\"You have to forget everything you know because I don't think you can approach this role as someone who's grown up with that family. \n\"You want to hold the royal family on a pedestal and you want to see them as these perfect creatures, but you can't do that when you're playing a character. You just have to forget a lot of stuff, start at the bottom and then work your way up.\" \nThis is not Foy's first queen - she played Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall (2015), the acclaimed six-part TV adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novels Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up The Bodies (2012). \nShe says: \"I think the pressure is that you don't want to play these roles by 'being queen'. You don't want to just sit upright and wear these beautiful costumes. If you're doing something that's period, you have to live in it and make it resonate with you.\" \nSince the release of the first season, The Crown has been widely praised for being \"moving\" (New York Observer) and \"pitch perfect\" (The Telegraph). \nThe Hollywood Reporter wrote that where it \"lacks for nudity and dragons and bloody upheavals... The Crown makes a solid argument for the exercise of power as the stuff of compelling drama in its own right.\" \nOn reviews aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Crown is \"certified fresh\" with an approval rating of 90 per cent from critics, and an even higher score of 92 per cent from general audiences. \nWhile much of the dialogue in the show is evidently fictionalised, details of the story are all as close to the truth as possible, says Morgan, who adds that the show's research team pored over royal biographies, studied newspaper clippings and consulted historians. \nThat extensive research turned up facts and anecdotes that surprised both Morgan and his cast. \nSmith says, for example, that he enjoyed discovering how progressive his character Prince Philip was as a young man. \nPrince Philip was the one who pushed the idea of televising the Queen's coronation for the first time in history in an attempt to modernise the monarchy. \nThat makes him \"more three- dimensional\" than the version so commonly portrayed in the media in more recent years: A silly old man who constantly makes undiplomatic verbal blunders. \nReportedly, Prince Philip once told children from the British Deaf Association who were standing by a Caribbean steel band in 1999: \"If you're near that music, it's no wonder you're deaf.\" \nSmith, 34, comes to his defense, citing Prince Philip's difficult childhood with his mother being committed to a sanatorium, his father going off with a mistress, and his pregnant sister dying in a plane crash while coming to visit him. \nHe says: \"Then when his wife becomes Queen, he has to always walk two steps behind her and be constantly emasculated. \n\"When you look at the history of his life, I think it has made him a certain way. His circumstances have led him to speak his mind and against things, but he also has this profound love for his wife and he wants to respect her. \n\"I definitely have a lot of affection for him now.\" \nMorgan hopes viewers will find the series just as enlightening in their own way. \n\"If not, then I would have failed because it's not just the drama of the royal family, but it's what the drama represents. The Queen provides the eyes through which we are looking at these huge events in the 20th century, which has shaped us all,\" he says. \nIn previous media interviews, he has said that the royal family is \"very aware\" of the show. Now that it is finally out, does he think the royal family will watch and enjoy the series? \nHe says with a shrug: \"Who knows? These are the most satirised, portrait-painted people in the world. \n\"What do they care?\" \n•All 10 episodes of The Crown Season 1 are out on Netflix.

      "text": "You can now watch Netflix shows offline for only a DOLLAR Lately, there’s been a lot of talk about Netflix making offline viewing available for their subscribers . This would be awesome, because it would give us the ability to watch things like Gilmore Girls and Kimmy Schmidt when wifi service isn’t around — like say, on a subway or in an airplane, or somewhere else where there’s not a copious amount of wifi. We’ve been talking about this for MONTHS, and it seems that Netflix is actually on the brink of making it happen .\nUntil that happens for real, though, do you wanna watch some Netflix shows for only a dollar? PlayOn Cloud , a free video streaming recording app, allows you to download things you stream, for $1 each title. The video is then stored on your device for 30 days, and you can watch it as many times as you want before it disappears. Even better, it actually works with a dozen different streaming platforms, not just Netflix: Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo View, HBO Now, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, PBS and the CW.\nAs PlayOn Cloud explains:\nWhen you select a video in the PlayOn Cloud app on your iPad or iPhone, we start a stream on a virtual PC in the cloud and record that stream like a DVR records cable TV. Once that recording is complete, an .mp4 file will be ready for you to enjoy. You can download that the .mp4 video file from the PlayOn Cloud app on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. We also email you a link to it so you can download it to any other device that does not have the app installed. This sure sounds pretty awesome….but just remember, it’s a dollar an episode. If you want an entire season of House of Cards on your phone for 30 days, that’s going to cost you $13, which is almost double what it costs for a month of Netflix. But, if you do have a lot of traveling come up, and you KNOW you need that Parks and Rec episode for your journey, dropping $5 for five episodes doesn’t sound too bad.\nIf this sounds like something you need in your life right now, you can download the app here . Even better, your first five recordings are free!!\nThe post You can now watch Netflix shows offline for only a DOLLAR appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "  \nMaking A Murderer absolutely smashed it when it premiered on Netflix towards the end of last year, and for about two months all anybody could talk about was Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey and whether or not they were innocent. It was nothing short of a phenomenon, and may actually succeed in getting both of them released at some point. Featured Image VIA \nWhilst it’s probably going to be a long long time until Making A Murderer season 2 ends up getting released, Netflix is raising the bar yet again with their new documentary series Captive. From executive producer Doug Liman (he directed the Bourne movies), it tells the story of people who have been involved in real life hostage situations around the world and looks like one of the most intense and exciting/terrifying documentaries I’ve ever seen: \nJesus. Imagine being the CEO of Coca Cola Brazil and getting kidnapped – that is some next level shit. It seems like everyone involved in these stories gets out alive as they’re being interviewed, which might make them a little less suspenseful but I’m sure even hearing about their experiences will be scary as hell. \nTo be honest I’m surprised nobody has come up with this idea for a TV show yet because it’s clearly going to be totally captivating television (sorry). Can’t wait.",

      "text": "TWEET As if the world weren't dark enough already, here's an extra bit of bad news: All the Food Network shows are leaving Netflix, along with HGTV, DIY Network and the Discovery Channel's series. The reason, as reported by / Film , is that Scripps , the company that owns and operates these networks, is letting its deal with Netflix from 2014 lapse. Since Netflix shows all of its programs without advertising, thus depriving Scripps of any potential ad revenue, Scripps CEO Kenneth Lowe reportedly said on an earnings call that the company was losing money. The deal is over at the end of 2016, so there are a few precious weeks left to cram in as much Chopped , Guy's Grocery Games and Cutthroat Kitchen as one person can. Source: Food Network/YouTube Though the shows leaving Netflix are hardly your grandmother's cooking shows — no Sandra Lee or Ina Garten here — it's still a shame that their departure coincides with one of the most uncertain periods in American history. Cooking shows can serve as a kind of comfort food for the soul; a light lift in a crowd of heavy dramas and increasingly dark comedies. In other words, after a hard day, sometimes one just wants to come home and watch chefs have to make desserts out of fruit leather and pistachios on Chopped . Unfortunately, for the cable-less out there, starting in 2017 it'll be just a little bit harder to find that comfort. Like us on Facebook: ",
