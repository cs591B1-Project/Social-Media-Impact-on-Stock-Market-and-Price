      "text": "After an amazing performance on Saturday Night Live , the world can thankfully expect to see a lot more Dave Chappelle. The comedian has partnered with Netflix with plans to deliver three new stand up specials to be released on the streaming service.\nNews: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \n\nLisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement, “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential. Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.”\nChappelle has not performed a stand up special on television in over 12 years. He left the country at the height of his Chappelle’s Show popularity and has widely avoided the public spotlight since the show’s end in 2006.\nOne of the three specials will be an original filmed for Netflix, while the other two will constitute previous performances at Austin City Limits Live and the Hollywood Palladium. Those two will be released simultaneously in 2017.\nThis news comes on the heels of Netflix already ordering two specials from Chris Rock, who is making a reported $40 million from the company. While most were shocked at the initial amount, Netflix has stated their plans to spend at least $6 billion on future content, more than both NBC and CBS.\nThis year, Netflix has already released specials from comedians Aziz Ansari and Patton Oswalt, the latter of which won an Emmy.\nVia Huffington Post \n",

      "text": "REVIEW THE SHOW “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life”\nWHEN | WHERE Starts streaming Friday on Netflix\nGRADE A\nWHAT IT’S ABOUT This four-part reboot — each chapter 90 minutes — is divided into winter, spring, summer and fall, and picks up nine years after the series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino ended. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) is still running the Dragonfly Inn in Stars Hollow, Connecticut, with a cranky assist from Michel Gerard (Yanic Truesdale). One day, daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) returns home. With one notable exception, core characters have returned, including Lorelai’s mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), and Luke Danes (Scott Patterson). Also back are Kirk Gleason (Sean Gunn), Paris Geller (Liza Weil), Lane Kim (Keiko Agena), Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry), Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia) and Taylor Doose (Michael Winters). What about Lorelai’s BFF Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy)? Sorry, you’ll just have to watch to find out. Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino — her spouse, also writing partner on the first six seasons — wrote and directed all six hours. In a contract dispute with The CW, they quit before the seventh and final season.\nMY SAY In theory, the idea of a “Gilmore Girls” reboot always tempted the fates as much as the fans. What if this turned out to be trite, irrelevant or dated? What if the original was an unbootable relic from the proto-Internet age? What if the characters got old, reminding us that we got old? What if this was depressing? I always figured “Gilmore Girls” was one dark quip or one failed relationship away from becoming the third act of “Our Town” anyway. Maybe Stars Hollow was secretly just a sunnier version of Grover’s Corners, or Bedford Falls (the one without George Bailey) or even something out of M. Night Shyamalan (“The Village?”). Nah, not “The Village.”\nMost popular Reports: West hospitalized; Kardashian skips NYC event Reports: West hospitalized after cancelling tour Gigi Hadid sorry for Melania Trump impression Report: LI’s Madison Beer to star in reality show Review: Disney’s ‘Moana’ more than a princess tale And so there you pretty much have it: After six straight hours of “A Year in the Life,” I too have become Lorelai Gilmore (or maybe Rory — same basic difference) while looking for any excuse to place vaguely absurd non sequiturs like “Thom Yorke” and “Carmen Miranda” in the same sentence. (Mission accomplished).\nPhotos Best TV shows on Netflix WHAT TO WATCH Best TV shows online now Photos 36 big new TV shows for fall Plus what’s with all those “what ifs?” Maybe I just turned into Emily instead. Don’t I have anything good to say for all that time spent?\nI do: “A Year in the Life” is a triumph. Engineered — or rather re-engineered — for an emotional wallop as much as for laughs, this is a big-hearted, generous, deeply felt gift to fans who years ago were left wondering about all the what-might-have -beens. Also consider this recompense for a disappointing seventh season, and all those other seasons that might have been.\nWithout giving anything away, the title and four-part structure are your keys to re-entry. On one obvious level, winter, spring, summer and fall refer to Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” — King, by the way, reprises her on-screen role — while on a less obvious level, to the circle of life. Not just “The Lion King’s” “Circle of Life,” but “the full freaking circle,” to Quote: Lorelai here. Like the cycle of seasons, cycles can hold sway over individual lives, too. Brokering peace with those, or simply breaking them, can be another key — that one to happiness.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\nMeanwhile, strap yourselves in, or at least first find the rewind button on the remote. Your arrival back in Stars Hollow will be bracing, also lightning-fast. (Cultural references, you’ll recall, were the lingua franca of “Gilmore Girls,” and still are). Before the opening credits, you’ll hear a stream of familiar voices from the distant past — “Honestly Lorelai, it’s not your looks that are keeping them away — think about that” . . . “People die, we pay” . . . “Did you say something slutty.” Those all merge together, becoming a babble. Then suddenly silence, followed by this from Lorelai: “I smell snow.”\n“A Year in the Life” doesn’t waste time with reintroductions. Viewers are thrown right back into a familiar world, too, although some might begin to suspect that Stars Hollow circa 2016 isn’t necessarily the one circa 2007. There’s a sharpened edge to “A Year in the Life,” a distinct melancholy, too. A little bit of tempus fugit may explain that, or possibly contemporary culture and technology — so vast and discombobulating that even Rory and Lorelai can’t begin to quip their way through a fraction of it. (They do try, of course.)\nTV Best TV shows on Netflix Reasons for the melancholy are immediately self-evident. Edward Herrmann, who played patriarch Richard Gilmore, died in 2014, and without him, the possibility of this revival remained in doubt. Sherman-Palladino and Palladino could have just gone the usual TV route in matters of bereavement — dedicate an episode to him, which they did. Instead, they also pull him right into the heart of these six hours, honoring both his memory and that circle-of-life theme. Even in absence, Richard — and Herrmann — still hit some of the sharpest emotional notes here.\n@Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Fans will be happy with “A Year in the Life,” but what about newcomers? These six hours are packed with inside jokes, and literally dozens of characters from the past. “A Year” can have a secret-society feel to it at times, welcoming only to the cognoscenti. It can also be whimsically self-indulgent. Some scenes, notably music ones, can be padded while beloved characters are trotted out so fast — then disappear as fast — that you’d think this was a curtain call (At times, this is).\nTo hesitant newbies, I’d say this: “Gilmore Girls” is, and always was, about mothers and daughters. It’s all about navigating that most important of relationships while creating an identity of one’s one. It’s also about the crushing burden that culture places upon young women — then using the power of humor, and especially language, to slay that particular dragon. Most of all, it’s about the joy — and necessity — of self-discovery.\nSo dive right in. The themes are universal, the water warm and welcoming.\nBOTTOM LINE A sweet, sad, sentimental and (above all) joyous return to Stars Hollow.\nTV Best TV shows online now ",

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said.Chappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season.Earlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Reruns make the heart grow fonder. “Gilmore Girls” was not a hit during its 2000-07 run on the now-defunct WB Network, drawing only 5 million viewers a week at the series’ peak. But its return via four “mini-movies” on Netflix Friday is being treated as one of fall’s most anticipated events.\nThe show has graced the cover of Entertainment Weekly twice this year. Jimmy Fallon has been ranking his favorite characters on a nightly basis.\nIt may have taken DVD box sets and a syndicated run on ABC Family for the masses to finally appreciate what I saw in the series back in 2000, when I chose it as the best show on television: the all-too rare delight of watching two strong, complicated, adorable, hilarious women trading quips without the need of a Y chromosome.\nTV review ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ When/where: All four episodes begin streaming Friday, Nov. 25, on Netflix.\nThat crackling chemistry is on full display in the opening “winter” episode of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” as Rory (Alexis Bledel) joins mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) at the town’s gazebo, the pair riffing on “Les Misérables,” hummus dip, “Zoolander 2” and getting “gooped,” all within a breathless minute.\nMost Read Stories UW cornerback Darren Gardenhire announces he's leaving team Cops, homelessness and goodbye to Pronto: Seattle’s new budget Boeing goes outside for new Commercial Airplanes CEO Quarter-mile walk from light rail to Sea-Tac could get a little cozier Thanksgiving, Apple Cup travel alert: ‘Parade of storms’ to bring rain, wind, mountain snow Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “Wow, winded,” says Rory, who has just flown in from London, where she’s making a run at being the next Nora Ephron. “Felt good.”\nGreat, actually. Each 90-minute installment is jampacked with pop-culture references, from imagining a Huckleberry Finn prequel in which we learn our beloved rafter was once a Klan leader, to playing snooker at Michael Bay’s home.\nAt one point, Rory glances at a framed photo of the late Minnesota journalist David Carr. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who split writing and directing duties with her husband Dan Palladino, never bothers to identify Carr — and doesn’t care. Have no idea who the man is? That’s OK. A nod to Kim Kardashian is just seconds away.\nEven those who have never cracked open a People magazine will appreciate the warmth and wit between its two plucky heroines. If only there was more time with just the two of them.\nThe original series lost much of its magic after Rory moved away to college and Lorelai had to bounce zingers off coffee-shop proprietor Luke, who never managed to keep up. The same could be said in this reunion, with the title characters spending long passages apart. The separation is particularly glaring in the fourth episode, in which nearly an hour goes by without the two sharing a scene.\nI understand the urge to squeeze in visits with all of Rory’s exes and the eccentric residents of Stars Hollow. Nearly every former cast member is on board — even Melissa McCarthy, who went on to become of Hollywood’s biggest box-office draws, albeit only for one scene as Lorelai’s delightfully harrowed bestie.\nThe early episodes do a fine job of honoring the late Edward Herrmann, who played the family patriarch. As Lorelai’s now-widowed mother Emily, Kelly Bishop takes advantage of every scene she’s in, from squabbling with Lorelai during the worst therapy session never conducted by Bob Newhart, to questioning her allegiance to her fellow “ladies who lunch.”\nThere’s also a delightful roster of cameos — classic crooners, celebrity chefs, alt-pop musicians and Graham’s former castmates from NBC’s “Parenthood.”\nDon’t confuse these performances with any great statement on feminism. Despite their independence, the Gilmores live in an old-fashioned female fantasy, where junk food never leads to an ounce of fat, unemployment doesn’t stop you from dressing like a fashion plate and all men are smart, good-looking and above average. If the WB had the kind of cash suitors are willing to throw these ladies’ way, it would still be in business.\nThat said, few TV shows — or movies for that matter — have given women this much license to be funny and smart. That was true in the 2000s and remains the case now.\nDie-hard fans know that Sherman-Palladino wrote the final four words of the series during the original run, but never had a chance to reveal them as she left the show before its last season, taking much of the dialogue’s bite with her. That long-anticipated coda is finally delivered and I must admit I was genuinely surprised — and moved — by it.\nThe final scene between mother and daughter takes place back at that gazebo. Fittingly, it is just the two of them.\nNeal Justin  ",

      "text": "The 10 Best Adventure Movies On Netflix Right Now Joel Stice best adventure movies on netflix right now More 20th Century Fox/United Artists Man-eating creatures, harrowing tales of survival, sword-fighting action, supernatural beings: Netflix has a rich offering when it comes to adventure. With movies that run the gamut from medieval action to stories of human vs. nature, these films deliver the goods if a white-knuckle adventure is what kind of movie you’re after. So grab some snacks and prepare for some cinematic excitement with the best adventure movies on Netflix right now, currently available to stream at your leisure. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) The trailer for Kevin Costner’s 1991 blockbuster doesn’t include a single line of dialogue from Costner or any of the other actors, but that’s okay. There’s plenty of sword fighting, crashing through stained glass windows and shooting flaming arrows, and that’s really all an audience wants from Robin Hood anyway, right? The summer blockbuster dominated theaters when it came out and would go on to become the year’s second highest-grossing film after Terminator 2 . Costner, Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater all turn in fine performances, but it’s Alan Rickman’s dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham who is the true standout. The true feather in this Robin’s hat: Mel Brooks felt it was worthy of a spoof two years later with Robin Hood: Men in Tights . Add To Netflix Queue The African Queen (1951) The fact that African Queen holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes — an almost impossible feat — should really be all proof one needs to add this adventure flick to their Netflix queue. Should you need a little more persuasion, though, the story of a gin-guzzling steamboat captain who offers a ride to a British missionary down the wild Ulanga River won Humphrey Bogart his only Oscar for Best Actor. It’s the chemistry between Bogart and Katherine Hepburn that makes the movie a ride worth jumping aboard for. Add To Netflix Queue Alive (1993) Alive may not be the best movie to watch before setting off on a flight over the Andes. Based on a harrowing true story, it follows the members of a Uruguayan rugby team who survive a plane crash in the wilderness of the Andes and must resort to the most desperate of measures to make it out alive. Starring Ethan Hawke, the film is about survival, but also about the bond that forms between friends who find themselves in dire straits. Add To Netflix Queue The Naked Prey (1965) Way before Leonardo DiCaprio took home an Oscar for playing a historical figure fighting for his life in The Revenant , Cornel Wilde took on a similar task. The movie has barely any dialogue after the first 30 minutes, but there’s no shortage of tension as the central character known only as Man (played by Wilde, who also directs) runs for his life. Based on the story of John Colter who was pursued by Blackfoot warriors in 1809 Wyoming, Naked Prey moves the story to the African savanna as Man is hunted by a band of warriors who seek revenge for an insult. The movie has some torture scenes that are disturbing even by today’s standards, but the film’s soundtrack of African drums and wild filming locale wonderfully enhance the movie’s chase and combat scenes. Add To Netflix Queue Big Trouble In Little China (1986) If you haven’t yet watched John Carpenter’s bizarrely wonderful sci-fi adventure, stop what you’re doing and add this to your Netflix Instant Watch queue. Part of a stretch when everything John Carpenter and Kurt Russell collaborted on became a cult hit, Big Trouble tells the story of a wisecracking truck driver who must battle centuries-old Chinese supernatural forces in San Francisco’s Chinatown. The film pretty much ate it at the theater when it was released, but has since become a cult classic, and for good reason. Carpenter took the visual effects wizardry from The Thing and successfully transferred it to comedic use in Big Trouble . Ol’ Jack Burton would likely agree that you really can’t go wrong with ordering some Chinese takeout and putting this classic on. Read More Add To Netflix Queue The Way Back (2010) Director Peter Weir’s drama of a group of men an unimaginable 4,000 miles of wilderness is an epic journey spotlighting the human drive to survive. Based on The Long Walk , a memoir by a Polish prisoner of war, The Way Back tells the story of a group of men who escape a Soviet Gulag in Siberia and quickly find themselves at the mercy of the elements. Crossing through freezing forests and barren deserts, the men take on a grueling test of endurance in their search for freedom. It features Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell and Ed Harris delivering strong performances, and the movie works as a fantastic showcase of exotic terrain in Bulgaria, Morocco, and India. Add To Netflix Queue The Princess Bride (1987) Adapted from William Goldman’s novel, this Rob Reiner-directed gem takes the form of a bedtime story read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his grandson (Fred Savage). His tale concerns a modest farmhand (Cary Elwes) and his true love, Buttercup (Robin Wright), following him as he sets out to rescue Buttercup from an evil prince who’s forcing her into marriage. If you haven’t seen the movie since childhood, it holds up just as well as you remembered. Add To Netflix Queue Pirates Of The Caribbean (2003) The Pirates franchise has been Disney’s cash cow for 13 years now and it’s likely things will remain that way when the fifth film, Dead Men Tell No Tales , rolls out next May. It’s not every day that a theme park ride successfully transitions into a billion dollar movie series, but Johnny Depp’s likeable Jack Sparrow and lots of swashbuckling action deliver the goods. The first film follows a young blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) who teams up with the disreputable Sparrow to rescue the damsel in distress (Keira Knightley) from a Jack’s murderous first mate who’s now in command of a ghost crew. Clocking in at a hefty 143 minutes, the film runs a little long, but there’s enough high-flying action to move the story along without too much drag. Add To Netflix Queue Touching The Void (2003) With mountain climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates providing the narration, actors Brendan Mackey and Nicholas Aaron provide a reenactment of Simpson and Yates’ treacherous tale of a climbing expedition gone terribly wrong. The docudrama tells the story of Simpson and Yates’ 1985 near-fatal climbing disaster of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Both experienced climbers, the two men make it to the mountain’s summit only to have Simpson break his leg on the way down. As far as docudramas go, few masterfully tackle their subject as well as Touching the Void , and the movie serves as both a gripping warning on the unforgiving power of nature and as an example of our primal will to survive. Add To Netflix Queue Jaws (1975) The granddaddy of summer blockbusters, Jaws set the standard for big budget thrillers and is still making ripples in the pop culture universe. From the movie’s instantly recognizable ” dunnn dunnn dunnn” music to lines like “we’re gonna need a bigger boat,” Steven Spielberg’s summer horror story expertly plays on viewers’ most basic of fears and led the way to movies like Jurassic Park and Sharknado . Based on Peter Benchley’s novel of the same name, the Roy Scheider struggles to maintain order and put an end to the man-eating shark that’s treating the vacationers of Amity Island like a buffet. All four of the Jaws movies are currently streaming on Netflix, but the original is really the only one truly worth biting into.",

      "text": "Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nOne of the most beloved shows of the 2000s comes to life after 10 years off the air with Netflix's four-part revival \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" available to stream on Friday.\nSince it went off the air in 2007, \"Gilmore Girls\" reached cult status with a combination of the WB-turned-CW show's original fans yearning for more and new fans who discovered it later and binged their way through the seven seasons. I admit, I belong to the latter group. There's no telling how big that combined audience is now. Even if it isn't that big, bringing the show back could've only been made possible by a company like Netflix. It doesn't need high ratings — it just needs new subscribers.\nThat said, fans of the show are going to be delighted with this new revival. It's constructed to do just that. And everyone seems to have made their way back, even if for one scene, including the cast members who have gone on to stellar careers: Movie star Melissa McCarthy reprises her role as Lorelai's best friend, Sookie St. James; \"This Is Us\" star Milo Ventimiglia is back as Luke's nephew and Rory's ex, Jess; \"The Good Wife\" star Matt Czuchry reprises his role as Rory's college boyfriend, Logan; and \"How to Get Away With Murder's\" Liza Weil returns as Rory's alpha-female frenemy, Paris.\nNot to mention, there's a host of cameos by some pretty big stars, which Netflix has made me and other critics promise not to reveal.\nSplit into four 90-minute-ish episodes named after the four seasons, \"A Year in the Life\" brings Rory (Alexis Bledel) back to small, quirky Stars Hollow and reunites her with mom/best friend Lorelai (Lauren Graham) within seconds. That first hour of the show feels like a trippy fan dream as the two run around Stars Hollow and get reacquainted with the eccentric townsfolk who never left.\nSaeed Adyani/Netflix As the title suggests, this show has always really been about the Gilmore family girls and the ways that life brings them together and pulls them apart.\nIn these new chapters, we see them once again in different stages of their lives. The funny thing is all three — yes, don't forget the force that is Lorelai's mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) — are struggling with romantic and career questions that are very specific to where they are in their lives.\nThere is also a tear-inducing flashback to an even that affects all of them: the death of patriarch Robert Gilmore. The actor who played him, Edward Herrmann, died of brain cancer in 2014.\nPossibly the biggest problem with the miniseries is that there's very little story for pretty much the first episode. Things pick up going into episode two. But again, fans just want to see their favorite characters again and probably won't care about an extended tour of the show's world for an episode. It's the same reason there's a call for a new \"Sex and the City\" movie — even if the past ones are pretty awful.\nThe true joy for fans will be creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's return after leaving the show ahead of its final season. After all, it's her world and rapid dialogue that we fell in love with. She splits the the writing/directing of the miniseries with her producing partner and husband, Daniel Palladino, but she gets to start and finish the tale with \"Winter\" (episode one) and \"Fall\" (episode four) — as it should be.\nAnd finally, fans will find out the last four words Amy Sherman-Palladino had always planned for the \"Gilmore Girls\" series finale and never got to use. We're interested to see if they live up to the fandom's built-up expectations. I suspect there will be some displeasure over it.\nWatch the trailer below: \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/kGGNNSmGDpU\nWidth: 853px\nHeight: 480px \nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n",

      "title": "How Netflix is winning the nostalgia game",
      "text": "Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix.\nIn addition to channelling past decades with Baz Luhrmann’s hip-hop saga The Get Down and the ‘80s-era phenomenon that is Stranger Things, the streaming network has revamped animated kids’ favourites such as Popples and Voltron and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel The Little Prince. Beat Bugs, another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show Gilmore Girls, on Friday.\nOf course, Netflix isn’t the first to evoke bygone eras — Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as All That and Clarissa Explains It All in 2011. But that was before the days of “peak TV” and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix’s early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia’s reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network’s ambitious plans for original content.\n“We’re looking, always, for the great stories,” said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. “We’re not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.”\nDebt offering\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion (Dh3.67 billion) through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\nStranger Things wasn’t a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late ‘70s and ‘80s, including Ridley Scott’s Alien, Rob Reiner’s 1986 film Stand By Me and ‘80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including E.T. Similarly, The Get Down added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\nStranger Things was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network “definitely knew we had something special” after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second instalment.\nSarandos said Stranger Things is popular on a global scale, although that’s difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn’t share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers “with incredible granularity,” but it doesn’t consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn’t sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nTraditional reboots\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the immense social media following that Stranger Things and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show’s dedicated fan base. “There’s no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,” Sarandos said.\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. Full House and Gilmore Girls both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing.\nAnd Netflix isn’t just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived Rush Hour reboot — Fuller House and the Gilmore Girls miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven’t succeeded, at times, with the remake format — MacGyver has done well on Friday night for CBS, Lethal Weapon has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and The Exorcist, which isn’t a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you’re a fan of the horror genre.)\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in Stranger Things and The Get Down. “It’s all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,” he said, using the rotary phones in Stranger Things as an example.\n“My 20-year-old son never said ‘What’s that?’ because he’s so used to seeing it [on] film and television,” Sarandos said. “It’s almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.”",

      "text": "Netflix Slots Three Dave Chappelle Specials One original special and two unreleased performances coming up 11/23/2016 06:00:00 AM Eastern Follow @bcmikemalone \nNetflix has ordered three comedy specials from comedian Dave Chappelle. He and director Stan Lathan will produce an original special, with the premiere date to be announced. Two unreleased performances, filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium, come from Chappelle’s personal vault; they’ll be released simultaneously in 2017. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy--searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP of original documentary and comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nBalancing both a prolific standup output and a recent reclusive streak, Chappelle was a well regarded host of Saturday Night Live Nov. 12. Chappelle's Show ran for two seasons on Comedy Central.  ",

      "text": "\nDave Chappelle is about to get a whole lot richer after making a deal with Netflix to create three new comedy specials. After making his debut on Saturday Night Live , Chappelle thrilled fans with the announcement that he will be working with Netflix. For his comedy comeback, Chappelle will be paid $60 million and all three specials are expected to be released at the same time next year.\nDave Chappelle’s Netflix comedy specials will be the first specials he has released in 12 years. According to Page Six, t wo of the specials are coming from Dave’s archive while the third will be produced by Netflix. This is a huge deal, both for Chappelle, who has remained off the comedy radar for years and for Netflix.\nThe two previously recorded specials include one from Austin City Limits and another from the Hollywood Palladium. Both specials are two years old and were directed by Stan Lathan. Chappelle will be working with Lathan again to produce the all-new third special just for Netflix.\nHE’S BAAAACK! \nNetflix announces THREE Dave Chappelle comedy specials: https://t.co/yBleBVnoM2 pic.twitter.com/xJd29U7HyX \n— Complex (@Complex) November 21, 2016 \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital and, now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP Original Documentary and Comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.”\nWhile it’s unknown if Netflix will actually profit from the Dave Chappelle comedy specials, the news is expected to generate a lot of press. In turn, Netflix believes their new deal with Chappelle will pay off as new subscribers sign up to see what the former Comedy Central host has to offer fans now.\nIn 2005, at the height of his career, Dave Chappelle walked away from Chappelle’s Show on Comedy Central right in the middle of a contract. At the beginning of Season 3, Chappelle walked right out of production and ended up going on a trip to South Africa. He was reportedly upset at Comedy Central and felt that Chappelle’s Show was ruining his stand up comedy, which ultimately was what Dave wanted to do the most. Chappelle complained that he couldn’t even perform stand up without hearing his iconic “I’m Rick James b***h!” which had become a catchphrase after one of his sketch comedy skits became overwhelmingly popular.\nLet’s take a live look at Dave Chappelle after signing his $60 million @netflix deal…. pic.twitter.com/XGoBTgVQpD \n— Bossip (@Bossip) November 22, 2016 \nAlthough rumors of Dave Chappelle’s exit from Comedy Central pointed at drug addiction or mental health issues as the reason that he quit, that definitely was not the case. It wasn’t until much later that fans began to understand the reason behind Chappelle’s departure from the entertainment business but that didn’t mean that they didn’t want him to come back and keep everyone laughing.\nIn an interview with Inside the Actors Studio that was broadcast in 2006, Chappelle admitted that it was his father’s death seven years prior that prompted his trip to South Africa. He said that with all the projects he had going on, Dave was never able to properly mourn the death of his father. He also said that it was the media-fueled rumors that he was a drug addict or that he was having mental health issues that made him stay in South Africa even longer.\nPrior to this new deal with Netflix, Dave Chappelle still did stand up but not at the level that he used to. His 2013 return to the mic was great but limited. Oftentimes, Chappelle would show up to smaller venues and just do surprise sets but there has definitely been a demand for more of him and it looks like fans might finally be getting that.\nNetflix announces major deal with comedian Dave Chappelle https://t.co/3RxnXqSfMo \n— TheBlaze (@theblaze) November 22, 2016 \nIt’s still not known if Dave Chappelle will ever return to Chappelle’s Show to finish what he started. He always said that he might come back and complete what he started but not without major changes to the way things were previously done. As far as the Netflix deal, fans should be on the look out at some point in 2017 when the streaming company drops all three of Chappelle’s highly anticipated stand up specials at one time.\n[Featured image by Stuart Ramson/AP Photos]\nDave Chappelle Is Rich B***h!

      "text": "print \nNetflix \nWith holidays and cold weather arriving at the same time, it's the perfect time of year to curl up on the couch and lose yourself in a good movie. \nAnd if you're looking for something entertaining and beautiful that'll also make you knowledgeable, there's an incredible variety of science- and nature-focused documentaries and TV episodes streaming on Netflix right now. \nYou can find compelling documentaries that'll captivate you with the beauty of the planet, you can delve into the details of how food arrives on your plate, or you can explore the mysterious and alien world that exists in oceans around the globe. \nBut there's a downside to all of that choice: It's a lot to choose from. So to make it easier, we've asked our colleagues to pick out some of their favorites from the Netflix documentary selection. Here are our favorites, listed in no particular order: \nThis is an updated version of a post originally by Julia Calderone. \"Cooked\" (2016) Netflix \nWhat it's about: Journalist and food expert Michael Pollan explores the evolutionary history of food and its preparation in this four-part docuseries through the lens of the four essential elements — fire, water, air, and earth. \nWhy you should see it : Americans as a whole are cooking less and less, relying more on unhealthy, processed, and expensive and prepared foods. Pollan aims to bring viewers back to the kitchen by forging a meaningful connection to food and the joys of preparation. [ Click to watch ] \"Blackfish\" (2013) YouTube \nWhat it's about: This film highlights abuses in the sea park industry through the tale of Tilikum, an orca in captivity at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Tilikum has killed or been involved in the deaths of three people while living in the park. \nWhy you should see it : This documentary opens your eyes to the troubles with keeping wild animals in captivity through shocking footage and emotional interviews, highlighting potential issues of animal cruelty and abuse when using highly intelligent animals as entertainment. Sea parks make billions of dollars off of keeping animals captive, often at the expense of the health and well-being of its animals. This documentary played a huge role in convincing SeaWorld to stop their theatrical \"Shamu\" killer whale shows. [ Click to watch ] \"Particle Fever\" (2013) Google \nWhat it's about: This documentary follows six scientists as they prepare for one of the biggest and most expensive experiments in history: recreating conditions from the Big Bang with the launch of the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. Their aim is to unravel the mysteries of the universe and the origins of matter. \nWhy you should see it : Physics is often considered a forbiddingly dense subject, but 'Particle Fever' gives you a window into physics without breaking your brain. It documents the discovery of the famous Higgs boson particle that many physicists think holds the key to understanding the universe. Instead of getting bogged down with the complexities of particle physics, the film focuses more on the human drama of the discovery, and how it could change our understanding of the world around us. [ Click to watch ] \"Planet Earth\" (2006) BBC Video \nWhat it's about: David Attenborough narrates this dazzling high-definition documentary series, which offers incredible footage of the world's breathtaking natural wonders — oceans, deserts, ice caps, and more. \nWhy you should see it : \"Planet Earth is why HDTV was invented. It has s ome of the most amazing visuals ever. And then when you learn to the depths at which they went to get the footage, such as camping out for days on end in camouflage, you have such a great appreciation that the people behind it. They truly want to give you a one of a kind experience,\" says Sam Rega, producer and director for Business Insider Films. \n\" You've never seen nature like this. I'd argue that Planet Earth, with its high definition footage that took five years to shoot, changed the way nature documentaries were made — all for the better.\" \nIt's a journey around the globe to the incredibly varied environments that make up our world. Every episode shows you things you've never seen: caves with their eyeless creatures, jungles brimming with life, and to the mountains which tower over us. [ Click to watch ] \"The Blue Planet\" (2001) BBC \nWhat it's about: This critically-acclaimed series plunges into the mysterious depths of the world's oceans by traveling to a variety of coasts and poles to examine all of its creatures, big and small. It's narrated by Sir David Attenborough, one of the most famous voices in documentary filmmaking. \nWhy you should see it: This is a must-watch because our planet is covered by water and there are mysteries and alien creatures in the oceans that seem like they're from another world. The next-best thing to exploring that yourself is seeing those incredible environments and having David Attenborough talk you through fragile and colorful coral reefs, the dark abyss of the deep ocean, and the lives of the powerful creatures of the open sea. [ Click to watch ] \"Good Eats\" (2011) Food Network \nWhat it's about : Chef Alton Brown isn't satisfied just making food in front of a camera. He creatively explores how and why the things we do in the kitchen work, and — with goofy flair — walks you through the science and history of everything from proper cutting technique to preparing classic dishes. \nWhy you should see it : \"It's tempting to write off Brown as a hokey jokester, but give him a chance: 'Good Eats' is easily the most empowering cooking show ever made. There's nothing quite like understanding the reason you're doing something in the kitchen — and the genius hacks you can use to save time, skip steps, substitute ingredients, and so on. I also love Brown's show because there's a sharp focus on basics. We're all so eager to rush into whipping up eggs Hollandaise, but so often it's poor technique that leads to terrible misadventures in cooking.\" —Dave Mosher, science and tech correspondent. [ Click to watch ] \"Bigger, Stronger, Faster\" (2008) BSF Film \nWhat it's about: This documentary sucks you into the bizarre yet pervasive world of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. Through interviews with bodybuilders, doctors, coaches, and politicians, you get an intimate sense of the American obsession with doing whatever it takes to win. \nWhy you should see it: Christopher Bell's documentary about steroid use focuses on himself and his two brothers, but it's really a story about what it means to be a 'better' or science-augmented human and a philosophical consideration of the American psychological obsession with being the best: biggest, strongest, and fastest. \nScientifically you see the physical and mental effects of common performance-enhancing drugs. At the same time you consider what it means to use technology and science to be a better athlete — how do we decide what's fair? [ Click to watch ] \"Life\" (2009) BBC \nWhat it's about: This 11-episode British animated series was made over four years and filmed on every continent and in every type of habitat in the world. It chronicles some of the most unusual and bizarre behaviors that both plants and animals adopt to survive on our planet. \nWhy you should see it: \"E ach episode is unique, but they all have these \"whoa\" moments, like when the chimpanzees SHARE their tools. I t’s also the fact that they know how to share, and it makes you think about how we’re not so different from animals. O verall, the theme of the series is that life is this insane system of creatures adapting any way they can to survive.\" —Steve Kovach, senior correspondent. [ Click to watch ] \"Fed Up\" (2014) Atlas Films \nWhat it's about: An investigation into the American food industry and a first-hand look at how processed foods — particularly sugar — contribute to deadly diseases like obesity. \nWhy you should see it: \"Obesity is typically thought of as a matter of will power. It's something you avoid by willfully eating well and staving off through exercise. Fed Up argues that big corporations, via intense lobbying, have convinced the federal government to put sugar into everything ... Kids don't have a chance even if they wanted to take action.\" —Chris Weller, senior innovation reporter . [ Click to watch ] \"Into the Abyss\" (2011) IFC Films \nWhat it's about: A Werner Herzog masterpiece, this documentary tells the story of death row inmate Michael Perry, who was convicted of a triple murder in 2001. \nWhy you should see it: This film delves into the fraught realm of capitol punishment through interviews with convicted killers and their families, and Texas criminal justice system members to explore the psychology of why people — and states that enforce the death penalty — kill. [ Click to watch ] \"The Ivory Game\" (2016) The Ivory Game \nWhat it's about: Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson document the struggle to protect elephants, following armed law enforcement officers fighting poaching in Africa and trying to infiltrate the organized-crime run black market for ivory in China . \nWhy you should see it: Persistently sad, thrilling, and beautifully shot, this film helps shine a light on one of the biggest criminal enterprises on the planet. It's tragic to watch these intelligent, social, majestic animals being slaughtered for their teeth, but this film helps show the scope of the problem and at least offers a glimpse of what it would take to prevent these animals from being hunted to extinction. [ Click to watch ] \"Cowspiracy\" (2014) Netflix \nWhat it's about: Documentary filmmakers Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn reveal the eye-opening environmental impacts that meat production has had on our planet — including global warming, habitat loss, pollution, and more. \nWhy you should see it : The US is one of the biggest consumers and producers of meat, yet most people rarely understand how their food choices tie in to abstract problems like climate change, drought, habitat loss, and pollution. As meat consumption continues to rise, so too will its negative effects on the environment. [ Click to watch ] “Everest” (1998) Arcturus Motion Pictures \nWhat it's about: A team of filmmakers follow avid and fearless climbers and their guides as they make their annual attempts at summiting Mount Everest — Earth's tallest and one of its most treacherous mountains. \nWhy you should see it: This expedition led by noted climber David Breashears helps reveal the massive efforts that go into trying to get climbers up to the top of the world. Plus, it's stunning. [ Click to watch ] \"Virunga\" (2014) Netflix \nWhat it's about: In the midst of a civil war and fight over the Congo's natural resources, a team of embattled and devoted park rangers risk their lives to protect eastern Congo's Virunga National Park from poachers and armed militia. \nWhy you should see it: This film is a dynamic and impressive mix of investigative journalism and nature, bringing to light the troubles of protecting one of the most biodiverse places on the planet and home to the few remaining mountain gorillas in Africa's forgotten national park. [ Click to watch ] \"Antarctica: A Year On Ice\" (2013) Antzworks \nWhat it's about: This feature-length film provides stunning footage of what it's like to live and work in one of the harshest environments on Earth: Antarctica. This unique look at the bottom of the planet was filmed across 15 years by Frozen Planet photographer Anthony Powell. \nWhy you should see it: A fun, charming look at an entire year living in the most extreme place on the planet. It's his first film, but New Zealand filmmaker Anthony Powell has years of experience at the bottom of the globe, and it shows. \nPowell uses a combination of time-lapse photography and footage shot over a 365-day-period to show the both the extreme beauty and the day-to-day normal tasks that keep the people that choose to make Antarctica their home busy. Plus, it's shot in some of the most extreme conditions possible, surrounded by icebergs and massive storms and either 24 hours of day or night. [ Click to watch ] \"Human Planet\" (2011) BBC Earth \nWhat it's about: From the Arctic to the desert, and coasts to jungles, this awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping series explores humankind's adaptation to and relationship with nature. \nWhy you should see it: \"It feels like I’m watching it for the first time, every time. Amazing visuals and excellent narration. I don’t feel like I’m wasting time when I’m watching these documentaries.\" –Antonio Villas-Boas, tech reporter. [ Click to watch ] \"Touching the Void\" (2003) FilmFour \nWhat it's about: This is the true story of two young climbers who attempted to summit Siula Grande in Peru in the 1980s and their perilous journey along the way. It's widely considered one of the most defining mountaineering tales of our time. \nWhy you should see it: This incredibly intense film tells the story of Joe Simpson's and Simon Yates's attempt to climb Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. After reaching the summit, Joe falls and breaks his leg. Simon attempts to lower Joe down, but while a storm rages overhead, Joe falls off a cliff. Stuck holding onto a dangling rope, Simon was forced to cut Joe loose. \nSomehow, unknown to his climbing partner, Joe survives the fall, and has to try to drag himself back to camp. It's a story about survival and perseverance in the face of death, and one that redefines resilience. [ Click to watch ] \"Making a Murderer\" (2015) Netflix \nWhat it's about: This true crime series tells the story of Steven Avery, a man who spent 18 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of a crime . \nWhy you should see it: If you've avoided this captivating series so far because you weren't sure if it could live up the hype, give it a shot. This twisting tale goes far beyond a look into forensic science to see how it can go wrong or be wrongfully used — it asks serious questions about the justice system and how it treats the vulnerable, whether or not they are guilty. [ Click to watch ] \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\" (2014) Cosmos Studios \nWhat it's about: This documentary series is a spin-off of Carl Sagan's award-winning and popular 1980 show, \"Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.\" The illustrious Neil deGrasse Tyson takes viewers on a journey across the universe and planet Earth in a dazzling demonstration of the human quest for knowledge. \nWhy you should see it : \" Neil Tyson is great at taking complex science things and making them accessible; he’s very good at making it sound magical.\" —Steve Kovach, senior correspondent. [ Click to watch ] \"Food, Inc.\" (2008) Magnolia Pictures \nWhat it's about: Director Robert Kenner offers a deep look into how the food industry has changed drastically since the 1950s, driven mostly by multinational corporations and fast food companies. The film was nominated for an Oscar, and for good reason. \nWhy you should see it: \"Everyone eats food, but very few of us stop to consider where all of it comes from. And when you look as deeply and as widely as author Eric Schlosser did with 'Fast Food Nation,' which director Robert Kenner based his documentary on, the picture is shocking and often disturbing. \n\"There are some political leanings apparent in Food, Inc., and a few facts that seem suspect. But the larger picture — a desperate need for a better, healthier, more humane food system — remains firmly intact. If you eat food in the United States, you must watch this movie. It's as moving as it is informative.\" — Dave Mosher, science and tech correspondent . [ Click to watch ] \"Into the Inferno\" (2016) YouTube/Netflix \nWhat it's about: Director Werner Herzog and volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer scour the globe, examining the power of active volcanoes. \nWhy you should see it: This film delves not just into volcanoes themselves, but into the spiritual beliefs and practices that have developed around them. It's a look at how humanity interacts with dangerous natural phenomena — plus, there's some stunning imagery. [ Click to watch ] \nDid we miss any of your favorites? Let us know by emailing .",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle is bringing three stand-up specials to Netflix - CBS46 News Member Center: Dave Chappelle is bringing three stand-up specials to Netflix Updated: \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth . \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com View the original article on TVGuide.com *DISCLAIMER* : The information contained in or provided through this site section is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional advice.

      "text": "Shaunee Flowers \nDave Chappelle is about to get a whole lot richer after making a deal with Netflix to create three new comedy specials. After making his debut on Saturday Night Live , Chappelle thrilled fans with the announcement that he will be working with Netflix. For his comedy comeback, Chappelle will be paid $60 million, and all three specials are expected to be released at the same time next year. \nDave Chappelle’s Netflix comedy specials will be the first specials he has released in 12 years. According to Page Six , two of the specials are coming from Dave’s archive while the third will be produced by Netflix. This is a huge deal, both for Chappelle, who has remained off the comedy radar for years and for Netflix. \nThe two previously recorded specials include one from Austin City Limits and another from the Hollywood Palladium. Both specials are two years old and were directed by Stan Lathan. Chappelle will work with Lathan again to produce the all-new third special just for Netflix. \nHE’S BAAAACK! \n— Complex (@Complex) November 21, 2016 \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital and, now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP Original Documentary and Comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nWhile it’s unknown if Netflix will actually profit from the Dave Chappelle comedy specials, the news is expected to generate a lot of press. In turn, Netflix believes their new deal with Chappelle will pay off as new subscribers sign up to see what the former Comedy Central host has to offer fans now. \nIn 2005, at the height of his career, Dave Chappelle walked away from Chappelle’s Show on Comedy Central right in the middle of a contract. At the beginning of Season 3, Chappelle walked right out of production and ended up going on a trip to South Africa. He was reportedly upset at Comedy Central and felt that Chappelle’s Show was ruining his stand-up comedy, which ultimately was what Dave wanted to do the most. Chappelle complained that he couldn’t even perform stand up without hearing his iconic “I’m Rick James b***h!” which had become a catchphrase after one of his sketch comedy skits became overwhelmingly popular. \nLet’s take a live look at Dave Chappelle after signing his $60 million @netflix deal…. pic.twitter.com/XGoBTgVQpD \n— Bossip (@Bossip) November 22, 2016 \nAlthough rumors of Dave Chappelle’s exit from Comedy Central pointed at drug addiction or mental health issues as the reason that he quit, that definitely was not the case. It wasn’t until much later that fans began to understand the reason behind Chappelle’s departure from the entertainment business but that didn’t mean that they didn’t want him to come back and keep everyone laughing. \nIn an interview with Inside the Actors Studio that was broadcast in 2006, Chappelle admitted that it was his father’s death seven years prior that prompted his trip to South Africa. He said that with all the projects he had going on, Dave was never able to properly mourn the death of his father. He also said that it was the media-fueled rumors that he was a drug addict or that he was having mental health issues that made him stay in South Africa even longer. \nPrior to this new deal with Netflix, Dave Chappelle still did stand-up but not at the level that he used to. His 2013 return to the mic was great but limited. Oftentimes, Chappelle would show up to smaller venues and just do surprise sets, but there has definitely been a demand for more of him, and it looks like fans might finally be getting that. \nNetflix announces major deal with comedian Dave Chappelle https://t.co/3RxnXqSfMo \n— TheBlaze (@theblaze) November 22, 2016 \nIt’s still not known if Dave Chappelle will ever return to Chappelle’s Show to finish what he started. He always said that he might come back and complete what he started, but not without major changes to the way things were previously done. As far as the Netflix deal, fans should be on the look out at some point in 2017 when the streaming company drops all three of Chappelle’s highly anticipated stand-up specials at one time. \n[Featured Image by Stuart Ramson/AP Images]",

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via ... more Photo: Saeed Adyani Witty return of 'Gilmore Girls' 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nStars Hollow has been quiet for almost a decade. No quick exchange of witty banter. No late-night mother-daughter chats. No rants about cellphones in the diner. \nAfter seven seasons and 154 episodes of watching the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore unfold among family and friends, \"Gilmore Girls\" came to an end. Fans wept. \nThe voices are back on Netflix in the four-part series \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" The story is told through 90-minute chapters — each spanning one season: winter, spring, summer, fall. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel headline the returning cast that features some very familiar faces to fans of the show. \nIt's been almost a decade but Graham and Bledel found it easy to slip back into their mother-daughter world. \n\"It was literally like no time had passed. It was not difficult. It was easy. It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. I mean, there was no sense of having to resuscitate something. It was just like it was meant to continue,\" Graham says. \nOne reason it was so easy to return was that conversations about \"Gilmore Girls\" never stopped, despite the cast going off to do other roles. That's why both actors signed on to reprise their roles even before scripts had been written. More Information \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" \nWhen: Released 12:01 a.m. Friday \nWhere: Netflix \nIt didn't hurt that those scripts would be penned by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino . The energetic writer and producer, along with her husband Dan Palladino , had left the series before the start of the seventh, and final, season. \nOne conversation with the fast-talking Sherman-Palladino and it's obvious the rapid fire conversations on the series are of her making. Bledel says slipping back into playing Rory was a breeze because Sherman-Palladino's writing gives an actor all the information they need to play the role. \nA simple question to Sherman-Palladino about returning to the sets on the Warner Bros. lot ignites a verbal barrage. \n\"(Expletive deleted), they changed our Stars Hollow. They got a deal on brown paint. I've never seen so much brown paint in my entire life. I'm like, 'Who the (expletive deleted) doesn't want some color in your town?' There wasn't any red. There wasn't any yellow,\" Sherman-Palladino says. \"There wasn't a posy. There was still the sidewalks that we put in. They're cracked. So we had to go back in and zhoosh up Stars Hollow. We had to rebuild all the sets. I just remember the day that Scott (Patterson) walked into Luke's Diner for the first time, because it wasn't Luke's Diner. It's the 'Pretty Little Liars' are lying in there constantly now. So we had to get the lies out and put the diner back in.\" \nBledel had a few conversations over the years away from Stars Hollow where Sherman-Palladino told here that she still loved the characters and wanted to explore stories with them. \nThe actor knows \"The Gilmore Girls\" is Sherman-Palladino's vision. The only thing Bledel wanted to make sure happened in the new episodes was a reveal that all of the hard work Rory had gone through in those 154 episodes had paid off. \nBledel is coy when she talks about where her character's love life has gone. She does say that all of her ex-boyfriends make an appearance. \nFor years, both Graham and Bledel have had people approach them lamenting the loss of the program. A major reason for the feeling of loss was the relationship the Gilmore mom and daughter had. \n\"More people than I would have ever thought said it was the same relationship they have with their mother or daughter,\" Graham says. \"I would think, 'Wow, you must be really cool.' I think people see themselves in the characters more than they don't. That probably has to do at least in part with us being here. Some of those daughters are now mothers and the cycle begins again.\" Today's Deals",

      "text": "Is Netflix's Exclusive Disney Deal A Game-Changer For How We Watch Movies And Television? November 23, 2016 at 07:39AM By Jack Carr @jackc Posted by Jack Carr @jackc You are the Princess Shireen of the House Baratheon, and you are my daughter. \nOn Christmas Day this year, something magical will happen. While Santa is trying to hoist himself up your chimney and contemplating that diet Mrs. Clause has been threatening for the last twenty years, Spider-Man, Iron Man and friends will appear in your living room at the push of a button. \nYep, Captain America: Civil War is coming to #Netflix this holiday season, and although it's not the first Marvel movie the streaming giant has snapped up, it does represent the first fruits of a major new deal between Netflix and Disney. The Best Thriller Movies On Netflix: December 2016 Edition \nBack in May, word hit the internet that Netflix had agreed an exclusive deal for the rights to all #Disney movies — that's #Pixar , #Marvel and #Lucasfilm , which means everything fromStar Wars to Doctor Strange to Finding Dory — almost immediately after their Blu-ray releases. (Art via hanzsolo on Deviantart) \nIn the case of Civil War , that's a seven month gap between hitting theaters and making itself available for a binge watch — which, even for a generation who wants everything now, is barely any time at all. It wasn't so long ago that a two-year wait for a blockbuster to hit a mainstream TV channel was standard. \nWe've already seen independent movies like Barry , the biopic which follows a young Barack Obama deal with issues of race during his college years, skipping theaters altogether to go straight to Netflix, where they'll presumably have the chance to reach a much wider audience — all of which raises the question, does Netflix's immense spending power represent progress or a threat to the way we consume movies? The FOMO Is Real \nIf you're alarmed by the idea that the next generation might skip the theater altogether, you're probably not alone, but think of it like this — can you imagine staying home while your friends watch Star Wars 8 next year, on the grounds that Netflix will have it a few months later? In that sense, a primal fear of missing out could be the phenomenon that keeps the cinema-going experience alive. \nStar Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens didn't become the biggest movie of all-time because everybody in the world saw it once. That eye-watering $2bn was made because a big chunk of the audience made repeat visits to a galaxy far, far away. I know a girl who saw it five times. Is she insane? No comment, but she's not alone. In other words, the Netflix-Disney deal isn't likely to strip away the appeal of seeing a film in its intended surroundings — it's more like the dessert after a satisfying main course. (HBO) \nThe exclusivity deal has wider implications, though — if a channel like HBO can no longer secure the rights to the latest Marvel movie, the average subscriber has fewer reasons to keep paying for that service. Less money from subscribers means less money to produce the kind of big-budget TV shows, like Game of Thrones or Westworld , which give channels like HBO a competitive edge against Netflix. Essentially, the element of healthy competition is threatened — but ultimately, if shows like Game of Thrones don't get made, it's not the HBO money men who lose out. It's us. Why Disney Buying Netflix Would Be Bad News For The Industry \nThat might sound a little doom and gloom. For the most part, the fact that Civil War is available to watch this Christmas on a service that costs ten bucks a month is a good thing. More money in the bank for Netflix means more original content like The Crown , the most expensive-ever streaming series, and perhaps the best TV show of 2016. \nAn increase in quality content can't hurt — but neither can diversity of choice, which is why Netflix's rivals might want to start taking bolder moves to stay in the game. \nDoes the quick availability of Marvel and Disney movies make you more likely to pay for Netflix? And is the streaming giant killing the game, or merely adding to diversity of choice? \nTo check out more from the awesome artists featured on this page check out Vance Kelly (cover image) and Hanzsolo (Star Wars image in body) Trending from our Creators ",

      "text": "View Comments Print By Susan L. Hornik — Special to The Washington Times - - Wednesday, November 23, 2016 \nSome television shows stay in the heart for years after they go off the air. So when it was announced that fan favorite “Gilmore Girls” would be returning to Netflix, a Twitter-trend storm began immediately among its legions of fans. \nSubtitled “A Year in the Life,” the highly anticipated reboot — a run of four 90-minute movies — is a continuation of the beloved comedy-drama series that’s been missing from the airways for nearly a decade. \n“It was literally like no time had passed,” said Lauren Graham, who returns as single mom Lorelai Gilmore, at the Television Critics Press Tour. “There was no sense of having to resuscitate something. It was just like it was meant to continue.” \nThe popular series, which followed Lorelai and her daughter, Rory, living in the quirky, fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, ran from 2000-2007, earning legions of devotees along the way. \nWhile acknowledging there has been no shortage of quality dramatic shows since 2007, Miss Graham believes that audiences still thirst for shows like “Gilmore Girls” that enter their living rooms like a revered old friend. \n“I think it’s extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort,” Miss Graham said of the show’s appeal, both then and now. “But also, it’s so well written that you can come to it at” any age, she said. “Maybe at a young girl’s age, you just got the relationships, and then as you watch it again, you get more of the [cultural] references.” \n“Talking as Fast as I Can: From Gilmore Girls to Gilmore Girls (and Everything in Between),” Miss Graham’s book of personal essays, will be released this month to coincide with the revival. \nAt one point during its run, “Gilmore Girls” boasted more than 5 million viewers. The show explored issues of family, ambition, friendship, work and romance, as well as challenges within multigenerational families. Lorelai and Rory, the mom-and-daughter duo, spoke quickly, loved pop culture references and enjoyed their caffeine together. \nSeries creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who returns as co-writer and executive producer for the four-episode arc of “A Year in the Life”— with each installment named for a season of the year — said that, much as in real life, the issues faced by Lorelei and Rory weren’t resolved when the final credits rolled in 2007. \n“It’s a constant evolution of ‘Maybe this Thanksgiving, it will’” get worked out, she said of the show, which premieres the day after Thanksgiving. “That’s why this was such a great show to write, because you’re never going to run out of conflict. \n“What is cool about writing for these two characters is that now it wasn’t a high school girl and her mom; it’s two women. … Suddenly they can have cocktails together. They can sit and drink and talk” as equals, Ms. Sherman-Palladino said of revisiting her somewhat-older cherished characters. \nThere was no Netflix streaming, no Amazon Prime when “Gilmore Girls” was originally on the air, but the renaissance of online content delivery has revolutionized the entertainment business — and allowed for beloved older properties like “Gilmore Girls” to enjoy a resurgence. “Full House,”“Wet Hot American Summer” and “Arrested Development” are just a few others that have been given the Netflix makeover. \n“We thought, what a great opportunity to delve into a different form, to tell stories in a different way using beloved characters that we loved,” Ms. Sherman-Palladino said of bringing the “Girls” back on the Netflix platform, adding that its commercial-free model allowed for more creative freedom when penning new adventures for Lorelei and Rory. \n“You’re writing not to commercials or to sell soap or tampons. … It’s really just there to tell stories,” Ms. Sherman-Palladino said. \n“Amy and I would talk from time to time. She would ask me what I was working on, and expressed an interest in taking these characters further,” said Alexis Bledel, 35, who returns as the now-adult Rory. “These characters are still very much alive for her. We would talk about different possibilities. \n“Going into this experience knowing what [Rory] means to people, and knowing how many young women she inspired to work hard and pursue an education at the highest level, you treat the experience with great care,” Miss Bledel said. “It’s almost like a circle: I can energize people, they can energize me, and we just keep going along that way.” \n“A Year in the Life” sees Rory chugging along in her budding career as a journalist right at the inopportune moment that newspapers are faltering in the digital era. This brings a tension to Rory’s story shared by so many millennial professionals — journalistic or otherwise. \n“Her field changed dramatically as she was getting up and running,” Miss Bledel said of the eight years in both real time and story time since Rory was last seen in 2007. “She has been living a vagabond life, chasing each [news] story that she becomes passionate about and wants to tell. She’s crashing on couches and staying with friends — not necessarily planting roots anywhere.” \nIn true Netflix fashion, all four episodes of “A Year in the Life” will be made available Friday, offering fans a post-Thanksgiving binge possibility that may keep them away from Black Friday shopping. \nAnd as before, it all starts with family, Ms. Sherman-Palladino explained. \n“Family is great because it is, for a writer, the gift that keeps on giving.” \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” premieres Friday on Netflix.",

      "text": "  ‘Gilmore Girls’ makes triumphant return to Netflix Most of the original cast of the long-running ‘Gilmore Girls’ series returns for four new 90-minute episodes Post to Facebook ‘Gilmore Girls’ makes triumphant return to Netflix Most of the original cast of the long-running ‘Gilmore Girls’ series returns for four new 90-minute episodes  //detne.ws/2fTxhN6   Join the Conversation To   ‘Gilmore Girls’ makes triumphant return to Netflix Luaine Lee, Tribune News Service 12:08 a.m. EST November 24, 2016 Most of the original cast of the long-running ‘Gilmore Girls’ series returns for four new 90-minute episodes Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel star in “Gilmore Girls.” (Photo: Saeed Adyani / Netflix) \nBeverly Hills, Calif. – — Just when we thought the Gilmore Girls had shuffled off to the TV bone yard, they are back, chatting like rappers on speed and proving you can go home again. \nCreator-writer Amy Sherman-Palladino has assembled most of the original cast of the long-running “Gilmore Girls” series for four new 90-minute episodes. They transport the audience over the course of a year in “Gilmore Girls: a Year in the Life.” The series begins streaming Friday on Netflix. \nIt’s been 10 1 / 2 years since the young single mom (Lauren Graham) and her precocious daughter (Alexis Bledel) bonded their way into adulthood, while on-again-off-again boyfriend (Scott Patterson) bided his time. \n“It’s not a story about a little girl anymore, who’s in high school,” says Graham, 49, who has since costarred in “Parenthood,” “Web Therapy,” “The Odd Couple.” \n“It’s a story about a young woman and kind of the struggles she faces. Yet the dynamics ... between these two characters, they’ve grown up, but they’re the same. And that kind of foundation of ‘Here are the people you have to rely on’ can take you through any age. I think that’s what this show continues to tell us about family anyway,” she says. \nSherman-Palladino didn’t harbor much hope that her girls would ever see the quaint town of Stars Hollow again. “When Netflix popped up and decided to storm the world and just take over overnight, we thought, ‘Well, what a great opportunity to delve into a different form, to tell stories in a different way using beloved characters that we loved’ ” she says. \n“And we get back in a room with these three actors and to be able to go at it again, but in a completely different way ... There was no grand Master Plan. It was just, ‘Hey, there’s a Netflix now, which means we could do a billion minutes because we have a lot of words, and ... it was a different form. \n“You’re writing not to commercials or to sell soap or tampons. Nobody gives a s—. It’s really just there to tell stories. And it was just such an exciting challenge, and form, and a way to get us all back together again and put on a show.” \nBledel, who’s 25 and has since costarred in “Mad Men,” “Us & Them,” “Jenny’s Wedding,” says falling back into the role was like riding a bike. “It really was as if no time had passed,” she says. \n“It’s all on the page. Amy’s writing just informs you right away. You know how it’s supposed to be said, and it’s all there for you ... It’s amazing to know that people are eagerly awaiting the release of these episodes, and that they have loved the show all these years ... It’s why we do this, to be able to communicate something that people are going to love and talk about and enjoy it together.” \nIt’s more than just enjoyment, says Patterson, 58, who has costarred in “Aliens in America,” “Meth Head,” “The Event.” He says the original show has left its indelible mark on those we least expect. \n“I was walking through the Austin airport, and a fellow walked up to me and just started crying, and he said he was in a sniper battalion in Iraq, in Fallujah, and he had done four tours. And they watched ‘Gilmore Girls’ obsessively. It’s a safe place for them. It’s like nothing bad can happen while they’re watching that show. He even got his commanding officer on the cell phone, who was in Fort Bragg and about to be shipped back over. And he said, ‘I’m standing here with Luke.’ And he goes, ‘F— no!’ I mean, it was just this huge reaction. It was kind of amazing.” \n“I do want to say what was so great about this (project) is I really feel like we got to do it together,” says Sherman-Palladino. \n“The first show was, like: You cast. You get on a plane. You don’t know anyone. You’re in Canada. It’s cold. You’re wandering around. It’s like you’re exhausted. There’s elevensies. I don’t know what it is, it’s like ‘Lord of the Rings.’ And then you’re in this whirlwind of production, and you’re tired, and you’re sick, and you don’t feel well, and you’re throwing up, and you don’t remember when you got your hair done last, and then it’s over. \n“And this time I felt like, because we would talk, and we were all in contact, and it felt like we got to sit and say, ‘Do we want to go on this journey together? Do we want to band together and like — Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland, this s —?’ And for me ... there will be nothing else in my career like what we got to do.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "Netflix taps into nostalgia througout shows;",
      "text": "Netflix taps into nostalgia througout shows By Bethonie Butler / The Washington Post Published Nov 24, 2016 at 12:02AM Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. In addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann’s hip-hop saga “The Get Down” and the ’80s-era phenomenon that is “Stranger Things,” the streaming network has revamped animated kids’ favorites such as “Popples” and “Voltron” and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel “The Little Prince.” “Beat Bugs,” another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show “Gilmore Girls,” on Friday. Of course, Netflix isn’t the first to evoke bygone eras — Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as “All That” and “Clarissa Explains It All” in 2011. But that was before the days of “peak TV” and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix’s early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia’s reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network’s ambitious plans for original content. “We’re looking, always, for the great stories,” said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. “We’re not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.” As reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. “Stranger Things” wasn’t a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late ’70s and ’80s, including Ridley Scott’s “Alien,” Rob Reiner’s 1986 film “Stand By Me” and ’80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including “E.T.” Similarly, “The Get Down” added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. “Stranger Things” was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network “definitely knew we had something special” after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. Sarandos said “Stranger Things” is popular on a global scale, although that’s difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn’t share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers “with incredible granularity,” but it doesn’t consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn’t sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. Anecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that “Stranger Things” and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show’s dedicated fan base. “There’s no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,” Sarandos said. When it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. “Full House” and “Gilmore Girls” both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. And Netflix isn’t just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived “Rush Hour” reboot — “Fuller House” and the “Gilmore Girls” miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven’t succeeded, at times, with the remake format — “MacGyver” has done well on Friday night for CBS, “Lethal Weapon” has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and “The Exorcist,” which isn’t a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you’re a fan of the horror genre.) Sarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in “Stranger Things” and “The Get Down.” “It’s all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,” he said, using the rotary phones in “Stranger Things” as an example. “My 20-year-old son never said ‘What’s that?’ because he’s so used to seeing it (on) film and television,” Sarandos said. “It’s almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.” 15691693 ",

      "text": "The food has been eaten, so get those decorations up and welcome the season. To help you get in a festive mood, here are five holiday movies and specials to watch again (or discover for the first time) on Netflix:\n“Love Actually” – In a Seattle Times reader poll a few years back, I was amazed at how much people love Richard Curtis’ 2003 romantic comedy that weaves together several stories set at Christmastime. The huge cast features Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Andrew Lincoln and Martin Freeman.\n“Pee Wee’s Christmas” – A nontraditional favorite, this 1988 TV special has it all. There’s Paul Reubens’ quirky man-child, a kitschy list of guest stars (Whoopi Goldberg, Grace Jones, k.d. lang, the Del Rubio triplets, Cher, Oprah) and a kick-butt opening number featuring a chorus of Marines (!)\n“Scrooged” – Bill Murray plays a nasty television executive who produces a Christmas special called “The Night the Reindeer Died” in this 1988 comic update of “A Christmas Carol.”\n“A Very Murray Christmas” – Murray, again! The comedian’s 2015 special is set backstage as Murray and crew prepare for a holiday show and worry that no one will show up. It also features Paul Shaffer, Michael Cera, George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Chris Rock and Maya Rudolph. Like Murray himself, it’s laid-back, quirky and fun.\n“White Christmas” – Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney croon Irving Berlin’s score in this 1954 tale of army buddies at a winter resort. Classic, musical entertainment.\nWant to see a movie currently in theaters? Check out our holiday movie guide .\n \n \nDoug Knoop : dknoop@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @DougKnoop .  ",

      "text": "Did anyone really need a “Gilmore Girls” revival? No more so than an updated “Full House,” which doesn’t mean the practice isn’t smart business-wise for Netflix — not just tapping into nostalgia, but offering fans an excuse to revisit old episodes.\nEnter “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” four 90-minute installments — length-wise the equivalent of about eight TV episodes — served up as a bountiful Thanksgiving weekend binge. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has reassembled practically the entire gang (with the sad absence of the late, great Edward Herrmann), plus some bonuses, kicking off with “Winter” and proceeding through the seasons.\nThose four episodes have caused quite the stir online, with longtime fans of the show tweeting about their excitement and enjoyment of the Thanksgiving arrival.\nme the whole weekend… ❤ #GilmoreGirls #GilmoreGirlsRevival @thelaurengraham @ScottGPatterson @alexisbledel @MiloVentimiglia pic.twitter.com/gZnZRCPfih \n— marta (@Marta_Delena) November 25, 2016 \nI have this fear that Netflix is going to crash because we're all going to be watching at once. #GilmoreGirlsRevival @netflix \n— Casey Tate (@SteadfastPdcast) November 25, 2016 \nif you need me, i'll be in stars hollow. #GilmoreGirlsRevival \n— jacqueline davis (@_jackietdavis_) November 25, 2016 \nIt's incredible how much one small, fictional town can feel like home. #GilmoreGirlsRevival \n— Kelly Frailly (@kay_lynnnn) November 25, 2016 \nThe only relevant gif today. #GilmoreGirlsRevival pic.twitter.com/FHlHKvJ6ou \n— j | GG SPOILERS ☕️ (@lorelaigilmors) November 25, 2016 \n\nNetflix loaded up its screeners with detailed spoiler warnings, which seems silly given the contours of the exercise. All that really needs to be said — not quite a decade after the show concluded its seven-year run — is that 32-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel) comes back to visit Stars Hollow, where she finds her mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) as feisty and fast-talking as ever, along with a lot of other familiar faces.\nThose include Lorelai’s mom (Kelly Bishop), still wrestling with the grief of her loss; and Luke (Scott Patterson), who in one of the amusing recurring gags keeps giving out wrong passwords for his diner’s Wi-Fi access.\nThe four-season structure actually creates some problems. At 90 minutes, the story tends to meander, providing lots of time for rat-a-tat banter (and references to things that weren’t on the radar when the show signed off, like “Game of Thrones”) but moving the plot along at a snail’s pace.\nSo while there’s plenty of trademark whimsy, there are also indulgences like the musical number in the third episode, which is clever but drags on too long.\nThose pacing issues also apply to the closing chapter, which, without giving anything away, allowed Sherman-Palladino to craft an ending she was denied, having left before the show completed its network run.\nGranted, this tepid appraisal comes from someone who, unlike much of the critical community, wasn’t gaga for “Gilmore” during its original incarnation. For the faithful, just seeing the cast re-inhabit these characters — or savoring interludes like Lorelai and her mom awkwardly braving therapy sessions — is probably reward enough.\nNetflix’s pragmatism in bankrolling such revivals nevertheless contains a whiff of cynicism, inasmuch as it’s so obviously designed to bolster the “If you just watched” part of its algorithm, while exploiting a media sphere that increasingly caters to the passions of small fan bases, in essence serving as its eager marketing partner.\nIt’s hard to argue with the strategy, validated by the fact “Gilmore Girls” has been trending since the review embargo broke November 16. To borrow from a Carole King song, that’s because the streaming service has recognized that even if something like “Gilmore Girls” isn’t a showstopper, where it leads, we will follow.\n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” premieres November 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "10 \nWarning: This recap will tell you what happens in the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ‘s first episode, “Winter.” If you don’t want to know, click elsewhere. \nIt seems sacrilegious to say so, but the finest exchange in Gilmore Girls ‘ triumphant revival isn’t a bit of supersonic, pop culture-reference-laden, upbeat banter between Lorelai and Rory — at least, not in the first episode, “Winter.” \nYeah, yeah — I know: That thought is as surprising as the existence of a kale salad on the menu at Luke’s. Don’t worry. There are plenty of smart, touching, funny, eminently quotable moments between Rory and her mom in A Year in the Life ‘s first 90 minutes. But after the credits roll, the scene that’ll stay with you is a nasty fight between Lorelai and her mother, Emily. VIDEOS Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : The Amazing Behind-the-Scenes Story of Amy and Dan’s Revival Pitch to Netflix \nThe argument, as usual, stems from Emily refusing to cut her kid any slack for doing something kinda dumb. But it takes place after Richard’s funeral. And both women are at an emotional nadir at the end of a very long day. So when they rip into each other, Emily in particular, goes for blood. The so-harsh-it’s-good dialogue is a reminder that underneath all of the series’ quippy repartee and zany townies, one of Gilmore ‘s guiding themes is all the ways we disappoint those we love. \nThat may seem like an odd compliment to pay the revival; let me be the first to assure you that the miniseries is an altogether sunny, funny, heartwarming return to the show we cherish. But it’s also aware that time — and age — can make you start thinking about the big questions, and Gilmore is unafraid to toss Lorelai, Emily and Rory into that tumult and see how they come out the other side. \nSo let’s recap the highlights, shall we? VIDEOS Gilmore Girls ‘ Scott Patterson: Netflix Revival Is ‘Fuller, Longer, Deeper’ \nWELCOME BACK! | Confession up front: I was a big Gilmore fan back in the day. So from the moment that “Winter”opens with audio callbacks to the original series, I’m like Luke when it comes to Lorelai: All in. We open on Lorelai sitting in the Stars Hollow gazebo, wearing a baby pink peacoat that is going on my Christmas list right… now and sipping on — what else? — a coffee. Rory meets her mother there; she’s just flown in from London and can only stay a day, because her new career path as a freelance journalist allows — nay, demands! — her to flit about the globe with abandon. She’s had a Talk of the Town piece published in The New Yorker , she’s got a meeting with Condé Nast. As she later tells Lorelai, “This is my time to be rootless and see where life takes me.” Lorelai seems OK with that agenda. (Rory’s zero-to-Susan Orlean career trajectory seems a little suspect to me, but we can discuss that later. Or in another recap, because we’ve got three more to go!) \nThe pair’s opening dialogue, in which Lorelai accuses her kid of looking far too glam for having just disembarked a transatlantic flight (“You’ve been Goop’d!”) is pure Gilmore : It comes flying out of their mouths at two miles a minute and includes references to Les Misérables , Zoolander 2 , and New York’s Yonah Schimmel Knish Bakery. At the end, Rory laughs at how winded she is. “Haven’t done that in a while,” she says. “Felt good,” her mom responds, smiling. AW, GUYS! VIDEOS Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life Video: Kelly Bishop Talks Richard’s ‘Presence,’ Confirms ‘Healing’ for Lorelai-Emily \nAROUND THE TOWN | As Rory tries to find a place where she has service on one of her multiple cells phones, we get a brief walk through/update on the town. The highlights: Taylor wants everyone to switch from septic systems to sewers. Lane somehow looks younger than she did in the original run. Kirk has a pig named Petal and a taxi service called Öööber. And Luke has added “No man buns” to his list of Don’ts at the diner. \nSpeaking of Luke, he’s at home at the house, making dinner. He’s very proud of Rory’s New Yorker gig, but not so proud that he’ll sanction pre-meal junk-food bingeing. (#TheMoreThingsChange) A guy named Paul shows up at the front door, and if you don’t remember him, don’t worry: No one in the house does, either… which is a pity, because he’s Rory’s current boyfriend. Luke and Lorelai have met him before, but they can’t recall a thing about him. The forgetting-Paul gag, which runs throughout the episode, is a funny one. But for real, though: Why is the amazing, gorgeous, smart, funny, savvy Rory with this human equivalent of a beige paint swatch? VIDEOS Gilmore Girls ‘ Lauren Graham on Reuniting With Melissa McCarthy in Revival: ‘I Was a Complete Mess’ \nI’D TAP THAT | Later, upstairs, we get the Lorelai-and-Luke-getting-ready-for-bed-together scene for which my heart has longed for for many years. When she realizes that he’s folded her balled-up pajamas and put them back in the drawer, she calls him “Felix.” He immediately shoots back, “Oscar,” and something about how easily he responds with a pop culture reference makes me more verklempt than half of the Richard stuff in this episode. It just speaks to how much Luke has allowed himself to soak up Lorelai’s life and ways; I find it oddly touching. They get into bed, kiss and prepare for sleep; it is so decidedly unsexy, yet somehow REALLY sexy. \nLorelai wakes up from a nightmare about dirty bathrooms to find Rory “stress tap-dancing” in the kitchen. Here’s where stuff starts getting real. Rory’s a little anxious about her future; “I have a lot of irons in the fire,” she reassures her mom, but a planned Atlantic Monthly article fell through. (Do magazines still do kill fees?) Lorelai in turn offers that she’s been “feeling my mortality lately,” and if there’s a better line reading in the world than the one Lauren Graham gives on “and then I broke a hip!,” I haven’t heard it. \nAnd then, 20 minutes into the episode, Rory quietly asks, “Do you think it’s because of Grandpa?” NOT YET, PALLADINOS. I AM NOT PREPARED TO LOSE IT YET. Thankfully, the conversation turns toward caffeine, which is a totally appropriate drug to consume in the wee hours of the morning. VIDEOS Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel Contemplate a Second Gilmore Revival: ‘This Week on Grandma Girls…’ \nSOOKIE UPDATE | Edward’s absence isn’t the only one that is sorely felt: Sookie took off for a six-month sabbatical but hasn’t been back for a year. “She abandoned us,” Michel sniffs, causing Lorelai to defend her pal’s decision to run off and spend time at Blue Hill Farm. (I have so many questions. Is Jackson with her? The kids? Also, isn’t she a partner in the Dragonfly? Can she just do that?) \nGRIEF MAKES PEOPLE DO STRANGE THINGS | Our first Friday Night Dinner of the revival doesn’t go great. It starts with Lorelai mocking Emily for the wall-size portrait of Richard she commissioned, then riding her for refusing to admit that she got the dimensions wrong. “Fine, I made a mistake!” Emily finally relents, and the hurt in her voice makes me feel bad that I laughed hard at Rory’s near-snarfing of her martini when Lorelai goes all Gandalf and shouts, “WIZARD, YOU SHALL NOT PASS!” at the giant work of art. \nEmily storms out. Lorelai lets on that Grandma is still really mad about something that happened after Richard’s funeral. In a flashback, we see the terrible day unfold. First, the graveside service, set to Tom Waits’“Time.” Nearly unbearable. Then much later, after Luke has chauffeured Rory to the airport, Lorelai falls asleep while her mom and some of Richard’s friends are reminiscing about him. Emily asks for everyone’s favorite story of the man; when it’s Lorelai’s turn, she twists herself into a pretzel — literally — trying to get out of saying anything, then word-vomits up some unflattering memories about his absence during her childhood and his catching her having sex when she was 15. VIDEOS Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel Contemplate a Second Gilmore Revival: ‘This Week on Grandma Girls…’ \nBRACE YOURSELF | In the kitchen afterwards, Lorelai apologizes, but Emily’s WASP phaser is set on “icy contempt.”“You have nothing but contempt for this family,” she says, tossing off Lorelai’s assertion that she’s unbearably upset. There are a few laughs in there, but mostly the whole scene is just Kelly Bishop and Graham going for the jugular, and It. Is. So. Painfully. Good. Emily lands the coup d’grace by saying that her daughter could not care less that Richard is gone. “That’s horrible. You’re horrible,” a shocked Lorelai responds. Back in the present, “You couldn’t just have said he was well-read?” Rory asks. (Heh.) \nDinner proceeds, with Kirk (who Öööber’d Lorelai to Hartford) coming inside to eat and Luke showing up to awkwardly stand at the table rather than sitting in Richard’s old chair. Emily seems oddly unfazed by all of this and is more focused on Rory’s leap-and-the-net-will-appear approach to life. “So, you’re homeless,” she says, succinctly summing up her granddaughter’s living situation. I write in my notes: ” WHY DO I IDENTIFY WITH EMILY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE NOW AM I OLD THIS IS TERRIBLE.” PHOTOS Gilmore Girls : 23 Future Stars Who Passed Through Stars Hollow \nBABY BRAIN | Update on April: She’s at MIT. (Note to A Year in the Life : It’s cool if that is the only update on April we get this whole time.) Talking about Luke’s daughter makes Lorelai ask her man if he ever wanted “a fresh kid.” He replies he’s all set; he has April, and “I’ve always considered Rory to be a little bit mine.” Props to Scott Patterson for the pride he infuses into every word of that line. When Lorelai presses, bringing up their talk at the Twickham House back in the day, he replies with the most Luke-ian thing ever: “Well, nobody gets everything they want in life. All in all, I think I did pretty good.” \nStill, pretty soon they’re at a fertility office called… wait, Dynasty Makers? What the heck is this insanity? Oh wait, Paris runs it? Yeah, that tracks. Rory’s old friend is now someone who arranges surrogates for couples wanting children; don’t worry, she’s still horrifyingly inappropriate. She visually assesses Luke’s junk through his pants. She brags about handling Neil Patrick Harris’ surrogacy. And the moment Lorelai and Luke leave her office, he’s got a firm answer: “No.” \nACROSS THE POND | In London, Rory meets with a kooky woman named Naomi Shropshire whose autobiography she’s going to co-author. (Hi, Alex Kingston!) Naomi is crazy-in-a-fun-way, but the way she too-easily dismisses Rory’s questions about payment makes me worry she’ll turn out to be crazy-in-a-truly-crazy way. Launch Gallery \nRory stays with Logan while she’s in town. They have some kind of arrangement that allows them to be together when she’s around but with other people when she’s not. Rory, I know you’re all continental and sophisticated now, with your Condé Nast meeting and your frequent flier miles, but I also know that at heart, you’re still the girl who cried her eyes out at the Dance Marathon after Dean dumped her. Don’t fall for Logan’s cocky, pretty, indescribably rich schtick. VIDEOS Gilmore Girls : Team Palladino Explains Why [Spoiler] Is Missing From Revival \nTHE HEPPEST OF ALIENS | Seemingly 10 minutes later, Rory is back in Stars Hollow, a visit that coincides with Paris’ apology tour of Luke’s… which turns into hanging out with Rory while she does a few errands before taking off again. (Side note: Who is bankrolling all these flights?) How are Rory’s longtime pals doing? Quick update! Paris and Doyle have kids and are divorcing (noooo!) because he’s changed so much since becoming a Hollywood screenwriter. (Nice Danny Strong meta burn there.) Lane and Zack are doing great, Hep Alien sounds awesome and Steve and Kwan are so big! \nOne more thing: Rory is lying to her mom about where she stays while she’s in London, aka Lorelai doesn’t know about Logan. Interesting … VIDEOS Gilmore Girls Video: Lauren Graham Teases That Revival Cameo —‘Lorelai’s Head Is Turned By [Spoiler]’ \nSPARK JOY | Over at Emily’s, Lorelai is astounded to see her mother wearing a T-shirt and ripped jeans. If ever there were a time for the revival to make good use of Netflix’s relaxed language standards, it’s now: “Holy s—t,” Lorelai says. Turns out, Emily has read The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up and is Marie Kondo-ing most of her possessions right out the door. (The clothes she’s wearing are Lorelai’s, and they were basically the only things left.) \n“Mom, nothing is going to bring you joy right now,” Lorelai sadly informs her. “I was married for 50 years. Half of me is gone,” Emily responds. And just when I think these two might be reaching a new understanding of each other, Emily poo-poohs Luke as not much more than Lorelai’s “roommate” who could take off at any point. \nIs it any wonder when we meet up with the couple again, as they attend a fair in the town square, that Lorelai looks a little sad? And that she says she’s fine with letting go of the surrogacy idea, but her eyes say that she’s not? Then Emily calls and says she took Lorelai’s advice and went to see a therapist and that it’s really helping — and Lorelai is too high on the notion that her mom listened to her to notice that she also ropes her into coming to the next session. But when Luke points it out…“Oh crap, I’m going to therapy with my mother,” she realizes. Sigh. Let’s end on a happier beat, shall we? It is my divine pleasure to inform you that throughout this entire scene, Paul Anka is dressed as a doggie Luke, right down to the plaid shirt and mini order pad and pen. \nNow it’s your turn!

      "text": "Kris Holt \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life has finally hit Netflix, and with it an answer to a question that has long mystified fans: what are the famous last four words spoken in the show? \nGilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has teased fans for years by saying she knew exactly how she wanted the show to end — with four very specific words. Sherman-Palladino left Gilmore Girls before the final season of its original run on The CW, so she was never able to tell that last story with the beloved Gilmore family. That meant fans have spent almost a decade speculating about what those words might be. \nGilmore Girls: A Year In The Life, however, has given Sherman-Palladino the chance to reveal the last four words in the most appropriate setting: a special four-episode season of the show, where each movie-length episode covers one season in a year in the lives of the Gilmores. \n— Alyssa Rickels (@alyssa_rickels) November 25, 2016 \nNetflix gave the show a new life after Gilmore Girls apparently proved tremendously popular on the streaming service. So that meant fans finally had the chance to find out exactly what the last four words are, and now that Netflix has released the new episodes, they’re no longer much of a secret. \nThe last four words were seemingly so important that Netflix built part of its marketing campaign around them and even released a video with Gilmore Girls stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel begging people not to spoil them for other fans. \nWarning: Major spoilers for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ahead. \nThe last scene of the final episode, “Fall,” shows Lorelai and Rory Gilmore sitting in the Stars Hollow gazebo and talking about growing old together while drinking champagne. Lorleai teases Rory about her childhood crush on Pee-Wee Herman and Rory gets dumped by text from her boyfriend Paul, according to TV Line . \nAs terrible as it is to be on the receiving end of a break-up by text, it’s clear that Rory has something else on her mind. Lorelai asks her what’s up. \n“I want to remember it all. Every detail,” Rory says before beginning the last four words of dialogue of the show. \n“Mom?”“Yeah?”“I’m pregnant.” \nThe last thing fans see in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is an expression of shock on Lorelai’s face before the credits roll. \nThe last four words are, in hindsight, fairly obvious. Gilmore Girls is primarily about an especially close bond between a mother and daughter who are also best friends. Rory ends Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life as a 32-year-old, the same age as Lorelai was when Gilmore Girls began. Rory’s pregnancy brings the narrative full circle and opens up some more questions that may never get answered. \nIt is not immediately clear, for instance, who the father is. Rory and her long-time, on-off boyfriend Logan break up at the end of the previous episode, “Summer,” but there are hints that Jess is once again involved in her love life. Thank you so much @GilmoreGirls for the #DateNightWithMom perfect binge kit! Mom and I are SO ready for Friday! pic.twitter.com/BGFq3FIcRW \n— Chelsey P. (@CisforChelsey) November 23, 2016 \nA few days before Netflix released Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , cast members Scott Patterson, Liza Weil, and Sean Gunn appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon , where Fallon, a fan of the show, tried to guess the last four words. \nPatterson, who plays Lorelai’s partner, Luke, knew what the last four words are , according to Time , but of course refused to reveal them, suggesting only that the dialogue was “philosophical.” \nGunn suggested the words might be “Kirk is your overlord,'” while Patterson said he had pitched, “Drop the gun, Kirk,” to Sherman-Palladino. Fallon, meanwhile, suggested that the last four words might be “Stars Hollow never existed.” \nWhat did you think of the last four words of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ? \n[Featured Image by Eric Charbonneau/AP Images]",

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! By Bethonie Butler November 25 at 9:48 AM Follow @bethoniebutler Michael Che in his Netflix comedy special “Michael Che Matters.” (K C Bailey/Netflix) \nMichael Che isn’t known to shy away from controversy behind the desk of “Weekend Update” on “Saturday Night Live.” His Netflix comedy special, which begins streaming Friday, is no different. \n“Michael Che Matters,” predictably, confronts discussions around the Black Lives Matter movement — including its opponents. \n“They don’t tell you black lives don’t matter,” the comedian and former “Daily Show” correspondent tells his audience at Brooklyn’s Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse. “That’s not what they say — that’s not the argument. They hit you with that slick s—. Like, well, ‘All lives matter. ‘ Really, semantics? That would be like if your wife came up to you and was like ‘Do you love me?’ And you’re like, ‘Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?’” (Note: the video below contains some strong language). \n“Why do black people always have to get over s— so quickly?” Che continues. “Every time we bring some s— up. Slavery. ‘Oh, that was 400 years ago.’ Segregation. ‘You guys got Black History Month out of it. We gave you February.’ Police shooting. ‘That was two weeks — come on, still?’ 9/11. ‘Oh, never forget.’” \nChe pauses as the crowd claps and cheers. “That’s why this September, I’m getting a T-shirt that says, ‘All buildings matter.’ I’m gonna see how that works.” \nThe one-hour special also finds Che sharing his opinion on President-elect Donald Trump. “I actually like Donald Trump, to be honest with you,” he says, leading to a few audible boos. Che’s response? “Shut up.” \n“I don’t think he should be president,” Che clarifies. “But I do think he’s a real sh—y guy and he’s hilarious and he should be my best friend.” \nThe special was filmed in August, and Che tells the audience he expects Hillary Clinton to be elected president. But just for kicks, he suggests that maybe — when the country isn’t so divided, Trump should get a year in the White House. \n“When we’re doing really good, when it’s safe — like when you let a baby drive a little bit,” Che jokes. \nIn a recent interview with Uproxx, Che noted that the special was taped before nearly a dozen women accused the then-Republican presidential nominee of touching them inappropriately or kissing them without their consent. “So much has come out about him, which makes him seem like much worse of a dude,” Che told the site , adding that “all the bits I do are basically just honest, gut reactions to what I feel hearing this news.” \nChe said that aspect of comedy was much like some of the statements Trump made during his campaign, and even before he was a candidate. \n“The stuff that he says about Obama? He didn’t know he’d be in this same exact position eight years later and now he has to face it,” Che told Uproxx. “And now he’s like, ‘Well, I think everybody should just be fair and stop protesting the president. I’m the president of everybody.’ And go back eight years ago and he’s like, ‘Everybody protest Obama.’” \nRelated:",

      "text": "Brittany Lovely \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is finally available to stream on Netflix. Here’s why you should immediately begin streaming this revival. \nThere is something for everyone in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . The heart and soul of the revival exists between the three Gilmore women. Although there are a few messy bits, Stars Hollow still welcomes you home with a comforting hug and a warm cup of joe. ‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix review \nWARNING: This review contains spoilers for the ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.’ This has been your warning! The good \nThe returning roster of guest stars is impressive. Not only do each of them serve the story, but not a single notable appearance felt unwarranted. One unexpected guest had me digging for the tissues early in the first episode. Two others took far too long to fold back into the mix, yet they both resolved some unspoken tensions. \nIn fact, even the last-minute appearance by the Supernatural family man and the pining publisher caused my heart to skip a beat or two. Honorable mentions to Paris, Doyle, Gil, Taylor, and, let’s face it everyone from Stars Hollow! \nThe Palladino’s direction of these episodes, each taking two a piece, is also note-worthy. Forget the houses, stores, and inns you knew. Updated sets and new camera angles offer a glimpse of the Stars Hollow you always wanted to see. \nEven the most insane aspects of the revival, which we’ll get to in a minute, felt right at home. After all, this is still our little snow globe world where anything (and we mean anything) can happen. The questionable \nEmily’s storyline left some things to be desired. The matriarch of the Gilmore family spent her year taking in her maid’s family, half-shacking up with Richard’s friend, and wearing jeans. You definitely felt every beat of her grief hit you like a ton of bricks, but I was disappointed by how Rory and Lorelai handled the fallout. \nBroken promises and commitment to the Gilmore name were never high on Rory and Lorelai’s to-do list. It makes a certain amount of sense that the girls remain true to their character (doing nothing for Emily) while Emily does the same (carries on with disappointment). The frustrating \nRory’s character arc has an air of redundancy and far too much self-pity. For this Logan fan, I felt nothing but joy seeing his shining face in London. However, playing the “other woman” and the “casual dater” never worked for our Gilmore girl before. Why should we expect it to now? \nAdditionally, Rory’s floundering felt so right, but her decision to write that tell-all felt so wrong. The series sent her down a road with no direction and left her at the doorstep of her old house. She is about to readdress the same demons, the same hopes, the same fears she has for the last 32 years. \nWhat is waiting for her on the other side of this process? It’s hard for me to see her make any great move beyond what she’s already discovered about herself– thinking you’re the best, doesn’t actually mean you are the best. \nThat leads me to… the final four words . Those words were stewing in Amy Sherman-Palladino’s brain for over 15 years. How she would get there is no longer a mystery, but were the circumstances surrounding it the right call? \nFor the time-being I am okay with them. I think it sets up a new chapter of uncharted territory for the girls to explore. However, it could wind up being a whole lot of history repeating. Logan is, after all, Christopher in a smaller, slightly better fitting suit. The insane \nDoes Stars Hollow: The Musical even need an introduction? The 15-minute detour in the third installment of the series was a magical fever dream that I want to relive over and over again. \nMeanwhile, the Life and Death Brigade adventure is a fantasy trip that is treated as such. I respect their blatant homage to the Wizard of Oz and the point it serves. Living over the rainbow isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Sometimes you just need to get back to what really matters and Rory eventually finds her way there. \nKirk’s ability to work double-sided tape and glitter is the seventh wonder of the world. The best \nEmily, Rory, and Lorelai Gilmore are the heartbeat of this show. When the series showcased their bond, for better or for worse, you felt it. The town of Stars Hollow is a special place, the characters there push the story along and provide some of the best scenes of the entire series. But it is these three women who keep their fantasy grounded. \nThe departure of Richard Gilmore is gutting. The funeral scenes are not the only bits that hit the hardest. Much like Emily’s experience, you feel the grief in giant waves. Richard is sewn into every line of dialogue, every temper tantrum, every wrong and right turn. The show doesn’t fall apart because he isn’t physically there. Quite the opposite. I would say it thrives in the ways it honors his departure. \nThe return of this show set high expectations. It cleared all of mine with plenty of room to spare. Was it absolutely perfect? No. But neither was the original series. \nIt is the perfect blend of nostalgia, drama, and fun. It provided a catharsis I didn’t know I needed and I believe I’ll continue to process these six hours for a long time. Perhaps best of all, it rekindled my love for this series and reminded me why Stars Hollow holds such a special place in my heart. Grade: A",

      "text": "\nSome of the best horror movies and thrillers can be found on Netflix. There are the usual Netflix staples when it comes to thrillers and horror movies: Hush , The Usual Suspects , Jaws , and much more. But sometimes movies fly under the radar of Netflix subscribers, or they are skeptical if the film is any good; this article focuses on three titles that are often overlooked.\nThe Perfect Host \nDavid Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford star in one of the best thrillers on Netflix. Fans of Frasier (also available on Netflix) remember Pierce as Niles Crane, but this is David like you have never seen him before. Though this is more of a thriller than a horror movie, fans of the genre are likely to enjoy this gem. The less someone knows about the film the better; this reporter recommends you don’t watch the trailer. In fact, don’t even read Netflix’s synopsis of the film or it will give away an otherwise clever surprise. The general premise is that a criminal on the run takes a man hostage inside his home, and he gets more than he bargains for.\nPer his usual, Pierce is absolutely brilliant in his performance and Crawford does a tremendous job as well. There is plenty of humor and wit throughout the movie, but it doesn’t override the mystery. Because, just when you think the film has revealed all it has to offer—it gives more! The story builds to a pleasing climatic finish that most viewers won’t guess. If you like some twists and turns in your thrillers, then The Perfect Host is the film for you.\n[Image by Magnolia Pictures] Intruder \nOn a dark and stormy night, a woman who lives by herself doesn’t realize that she isn’t alone. This film is perfect for those that like to watch horror movies alone in the dark.\nIndependent thrillers and horror movies often get a bum rap from critics, and this is one of those movies. If you go into this expecting an edge-of-your-seat horror flick like Hush , then you will surely be disappointed. But if you appreciate a slow-burn thriller, then you will like Intruder . Film Journal International describes why this is one of the best thrillers on Netflix. \n“The elements of Intruder are all strictly by-the-book, and though it’s audacious to cram all of them into the same slim volume, writer-director Travis Zariwny (credited as Travis Z)—a longtime production designer and director of this year’s Cabin Fever remake—manipulates the material with efficient skill. He quickly establishes beyond the shadow of a doubt that Elizabeth isn’t imagining anything , a daringly pragmatic choice that surprisingly few horror filmmakers make.”\nThis is not the film to watch if you want to be scared from beginning to end, but rather, it’s one of those movies that are constantly creepy and that tell a good story.\n[Image by IFC Midnight] Grand Piano \nElijah Wood and John Cusack star in this tension-filled movie. With films like Identity and Maniac , Wood and Cusack are no strangers to thrillers and horror movies; and this is one of their best. The film received a 78 percent on Rotten Tomatoes , and the site provides the premise for one of the best thrillers on Netflix .\n“Tom Selznick, the most talented pianist of his generation, stopped performing in public because of his stage fright. Years after a catastrophic performance, he reappears in public in a long-awaited concert in Chicago. In a packed theater, in front of the expectant audience, Tom finds a message written on the score: “Play one wrong note and you die.” Without leaving the piano, Tom must discover the anonymous sniper’s motives and look for help without anyone realizing…”\nThis is a throwback to Hitchcock movies and cat-and-mouse thrillers and horror of yesteryear. Wood plays the nervous pianist to a tee, and Cusack is always enjoyable. This is a great flick to watch on Netflix for those that can appreciate some improbable scenes in their thrillers, and are able to embrace the story.\nOTHER NETFLIX ARTICLES FROM THE INQUISITR\nBest Horror Movies On Netflix: Review Of ‘I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House’ \nBest Thrillers And Horror Movies On Netflix That Are Edge-Of-Your-Seat-Good \nThe Top 10 Best, Highly Rated Thrillers And Horror Movies On Netflix \nNetflix Thrillers And Horror Movies: Review Of The Nonsensical ‘Mercy’ \nThe Netflix films The Perfect Host , Intruder, and Grand Piano are definitely worth watching for fans of thrillers or horror movies.\n[Featured Image by Magnet Releasing]\nBest Thrillers And Horror Movies On Netflix: ‘The Perfect Host,’ ‘Intruder,’ And ‘Grand Piano’ is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Holiday quality time with the family can be stressful even at the best of times, and TV has always been a welcome escape. Finding something everyone can watch is its own anxiety, but it's more than likely I'm going to spend Thanksgiving watching — ahem, re-watching — Brown Nation with my parents.\nReleased Nov. 18 on Netflix, Brown Nation centers on Hasmukh (Rajeev Varma) and Dimple (Shenaz Treasurywala), a married couple living in Queens with Dimple’s eccentric father (Kapil Bawa). While his wife chases dreams of artistry and stardom, Hasmukh runs a small startup and often gets roped into questionable side projects with his friend Hyder (Remy Munasifi).\n\"We shot late 2014, and we were really pitching it out to Indian TV and lot of networks,\" director Abi Varghese tells Mashable . \"But we were stuck somewhere because we didn’t know where the audience was. It was too American for the Indian audience and vice versa. It’s only when Netflix approached us that we were really like 'Man, this is the platform where it’ll get to the right audience.'\"\nSEE ALSO: Why an Emmy for ‘Master of None’ feels like a personal victory for millions\nIt takes a couple episodes to figure out Brown Nation 's style and sense of humor, but once you understand and accept it, there's a quiet brilliance to the slow-burn humor and scenes that delicately teeter between parody and sincerity. At least one of my watch-mates couldn't wrap his mind around it, the same way Documentary Now! stumped a friend of mine several months ago.\nImage: netflix\nIt’s important to note that the main characters Indian, not Indian-American. And that is a fine distinction. Half the characters speak with thick, glorious Indian accents (including lifelong Californian Omi Vaidya and the New Zealand-born Varma).\nBy contrast, there wasn’t one authentic accent to be found on NBC's Outsourced , which had an American and British cast. That might fool the average viewer, but Hollywood can and should aim higher; don’t fool the novice — fool the expert.\nWhat’s extra smart about Brown Nation is that it isn’t Culture 101. There are snatches of regional Indian languages. There's talk of arranged marriage and tense family relations, but handled with a key ingredient: nuance.\nIt's not an Indian comedy so much as a comedy about Indians.\nYou won't get background if you don't know Salman Khan or R. Madhavan (an extra deep cut because his film Three Idiots also stars Vaidya ) . The show assumes an intelligent or at least inquisitive audience. When Dimple gets an acting agent, she asks him about Karan Johar — a name that means nothing to the average Netflix viewer, but her delivery alone will tell the astute that he’s a big deal .\nDoug E. Doug as Lemont, the sleeper star, and Remy Munasifi as Hyder.\nImage: netflix\nThere are no heavy-handed issues like religion or caste (which was casually and inappropriately forced into NBC's Outsourced pilot), but an enjoyable in-joke about the testy relations between different regions of India — Hasmukh is from Gujarat and Dimple from Punjab, which provides some laughs in their interactions and with their family members later on.\n\"We just kind of based it on our lives,\" Varghese says, referring to his fellow writers George Kanatt and Matt Grubb. \"We were doing a smaller business with our production company, so we dealt with all these little things that makes it so hard for a small company to survive.\"\n\"And also me, George and Matt, we went through all these relationship ups and downs and getting married,\" Varghese adds. \"So all that stuff comes into play as well; we try to kind of base it on our lives and the friends that we have, the in-laws and also the outer world that we deal with in New York.\"\nShenaz Treasurywala and Rajeev Varma as Dimple and Hasmukh.\nAnd take a moment to appreciate character names like Hasmukh, Balan and Gautam; real Indian names to counter the brown people on TV named Alex or Mindy or Cece. Varghese and his team picked typical names from different regions of India, most of which are shared by people he knows.\nEarlier this year, Priyanka Chopra brushed off her Quantico character’s name (Alex) in an interview, and with the many religions in India, it’s true that you’re as likely to meet a Matthew as a Mahesh, but at least one of those is a name rarely heard on American television. Bringing in diverse characters is crucial, but Americanizing their names isn’t helping anybody.\nAt 10 half-hour episodes, Brown Nation is an easy binge, and an enjoyable one at that. There's no singular pop culture analogy for what it feels like, but the characters are authentic in their heritage and as goofy as any sitcom could want. In the meantime, Varghese and his colleagues wait tentatively for audience response and a possible second season.\n\"We’re just waiting on if there’s some good response, because we would love to do it,\" he says \"I think there’s a lot of stories that we could portray with Hasmukh and his friends.\"",

      "text": "Michael Che has a creative comeback to the phrase 'All Lives Matter' in his Netflix special Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 6:00 AM \nBy Bethonie ButlerThe Washington Post \nMichael Che isn't known to shy away from controversy behind the desk of \"Weekend Update\" on \"Saturday Night Live.\" His Netflix comedy special, which begins streaming Friday, is no different.\n\"Michael Che Matters,\" predictably, confronts discussions around the Black Lives Matter movement — including its opponents.\n\"They don't tell you black lives don't matter,\" the comedian and former \"Daily Show\" correspondent tells his audience at Brooklyn's Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse. \"That's not what they say — that's not the argument. They hit you with that slick (expletive). Like, well, 'All lives matter. ' Really, semantics? That would be like if your wife came up to you and was like 'Do you love me?' And you're like, 'Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?'\n\"Why do black people always have to get over (expletive) so quickly?\" Che continues. \"Every time we bring some (expletive) up. Slavery. 'Oh, that was 400 years ago.' Segregation. 'You guys got Black History Month out of it. We gave you February.' Police shooting. 'That was two weeks — come on, still?' 9/11. 'Oh, never forget.'\"\nChe pauses as the crowd claps and cheers. \"That's why this September, I'm getting a t-shirt that says, 'All buildings matter.' I'm gonna see how that works.\"\nThe one-hour special also finds Che sharing his opinion on president-elect Donald Trump. \"I actually like Donald Trump, to be honest with you,\" he says, leading to a few audible boos. Che's response? \"Shut up.\"\n\"I don't think he should be president,\" Che clarifies. \"But I do think he's ... hilarious and he should be my best friend.\"\nThe special was filmed in August, and Che tells the audience he expects Hillary Clinton to be elected president. But just for kicks, he suggests that maybe — when the country isn't so divided, Trump should get a year in the White House.\n\"When we're doing really good, when it's safe — like when you let a baby drive a little bit,\" Che jokes.\nIn a recent interview with Uproxx, Che noted that the special was taped before nearly a dozen women accused the then-Republican presidential nominee of touching them inappropriately or kissing them without their consent. \"So much has come out about him, which makes him seem like much worse of a dude,\" Che told the site, adding that \"all the bits I do are basically just honest, gut reactions to what I feel hearing this news.\"\nChe said that aspect of comedy was much like some of the statements Trump made during his campaign, and even before he was a candidate.\n\"The stuff that he says about Obama? He didn't know he'd be in this same exact position eight years later and now he has to face it,\" Che told Uproxx. \"And now he's like, 'Well, I think everybody should just be fair and stop protesting the president. I'm the president of everybody.' And go back eight years ago and he's like, 'Everybody protest Obama.'\"",

      "text": "Netflix continues to expand its original programming with new TV shows, movies and documentaries. Debuting exclusively on Netflix in December are the new movies “Barry,” an original drama about young Barack Obama at Columbia University; and the war-movie-turned-science-fiction-thriller “Spectral” with James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood. \nNew series include the time-travel drama “Travelers” with Eric McCormack; the animated crime comedy “Pacific Heat” ; the miniseries “Call Me Francis,” about the life of the man who would become Pope Francis in 2013; and the animated series “Trollhunters” for kids.

      "text": "Michael Che has a creative comeback to 'All Lives Matter' in his Netflix special Published November 29. 2016 12:01AM Bethonie Butler, The Washington Post \nMichael Che isn't known to shy away from controversy behind the desk of \"Weekend Update\" on \"Saturday Night Live.\" His comedy special that is now streaming on Netflix is no different. \"Michael Che Matters,\" predictably, confronts discussions around the Black Lives Matter movement — including its opponents. \"They don't tell you black lives don't matter,\" the comedian and former \"Daily Show\" correspondent tells his audience at Brooklyn's Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse. \"That's not what they say — that's not the argument. They hit you with that slick ----. Like, well, 'All lives matter. ' Really, semantics? That would be like if your wife came up to you and was like 'Do you love me?' And you're like, 'Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?' \"Why do black people always have to get over ---- so quickly?\" Che continues. \"Every time we bring some ---- up. Slavery. 'Oh, that was 400 years ago.' Segregation. 'You guys got Black History Month out of it. We gave you February.' Police shooting. 'That was two weeks — come on, still?' 9/11. 'Oh, never forget.' \" Che pauses as the crowd claps and cheers. \"That's why this September, I'm getting a T-shirt that says, 'All buildings matter.' I'm gonna see how that works.\" The one-hour special also finds Che sharing his opinion on president-elect Donald Trump. \n\"I actually like Donald Trump, to be honest with you,\" he says, leading to a few audible boos. Che's response? \"Shut up.\" \"I don't think he should be president,\" Che clarifies. \"But I do think he's ... hilarious and he should be my best friend.\" The special was filmed in August, and Che tells the audience he expects Hillary Clinton to be elected president. But just for kicks, he suggests that maybe, when the country isn't so divided, Trump should get a year in the White House. \"When we're doing really good, when it's safe — like when you let a baby drive a little bit,\" Che jokes. In a recent interview with Uproxx, Che noted that the special was taped before nearly a dozen women accused the then-Republican presidential nominee of touching them inappropriately or kissing them without their consent. \n\"So much has come out about him, which makes him seem like much worse of a dude,\" Che told the site, adding that \"all the bits I do are basically just honest, gut reactions to what I feel hearing this news.\" Che said that aspect of comedy was much like some of the statements Trump made during his campaign, and even before he was a candidate. \"The stuff that he says about Obama? He didn't know he'd be in this same exact position eight years later, and now he has to face it,\" Che told Uproxx. \"And now he's like, 'Well, I think everybody should just be fair and stop protesting the president. I'm the president of everybody.' And go back eight years ago and he's like, 'Everybody protest Obama.'\"",

      "text": "The 20 best holiday movies you can watch on Netflix, HBO GO, and Hulu 20 fabulous holiday films you can stream right now November 29, 2016 \nThey’re cheesy, they’re on all the time, and they’re never going away: Holiday movies. \nAs soon as Halloween ends, the “Holidays” begin. This means it's time to start scouring the internet for access to every single bell-ringing, snow-falling, heart-warming movie out there. To that end, we’ve compiled some of the best for you, from die-hard classics to modern day holiday rom-coms — as well as where to find them! Netflix 1. 12 Dates of Christmas Credit: ABC Family \nYou may not have heard of it, but this is probably one of the best Netflix Christmas movies. It’s got 4 stars and is actually funny. Credit: Walt Disney Home Studios Entertainment \nIf you’re into puppies and Santa Clause, this will definitely be the right movie for you. 3. The Ref Credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures \nFor those of you who don’t want a sappy holiday film, this under-appricated 90s movie has got its fair share of dark comedy. 4. White Christmas Credit: Paramount Pictures \nThis 1950s, feel-good romance comedy has got all the makings of a perfect holiday film: it’s funny, sweet, and oh-so-vintage. 5. Ernest Saves Christmas Credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures \nThis 80s film is the perfect mix of screwball and sweet. It's also a great film to keep the kids entertained.",

So instead of wasting your time browsing for the best holiday movies, TheWrap’s got you covered with 18 of our favorites.\n“Scrooged” \nIt’s another take on Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” so we already pretty much knows how this movie plays out. This time though, it’s a successful and cynical TV executive who gets haunted by three Christmas ghosts.\n“Beethoven’s Christmas Adventure” \nThere are very few things better than Beethoven the dog in a Santa hat trying to rescue an elf and save Christmas.\n“Mickey’s Magical Christmas” \nvar googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); You can never go wrong with Mickey and Christmas especially when the movie features pretty much all of the Disney characters from Donald Duck to Aladdin’s Jafar.\n“Christmas With The Kranks” \nThe Kranks cause a riot when they decide to skip Christmas and go on a vacation instead (the blasphemy) because their daughter is away in Peru. After almost heading out the door for their cruise, their daughter decides she’s coming home after all, leaving the Kranks scrambling to get a fancy Christmas party together in the nick of time.\n“Miracle on 34th Street” \nA typical feel good Christmas movie to remind everyone that Santa Clause is really real. A woman is tasked with hiring a Santa Clause look-a-like to pose for pictures at a department store when she comes across a man named Kris Kringle–who happens to really be Santa.\n“12 Dates of Christmas” \nA woman keeps reliving Christmas Eve, including a date with a man named Miles, over and over again. How horrible.\n“Marry Me for Christmas” \nMost people dread the holidays because they don’t want to be asked about who they’re dating, when they’re getting married/pregnant, etc. In this movie, a woman gets one step ahead of the game when she enlists her employee to pretend to be her fiancee to make her family happy.\n“The Legend of Frosty the Snowman” \nIt’s not Christmas without Frosty the Snowman. Don’t argue with us on this.\nFrosty ends up in the little town of Evergreen where its mayor is strict and doesn’t tolerate any talk of magical nonsense–that is until Frosty comes through and changes things forever.\n“Last Holiday” \nA shy ambitious woman writes her dreams of being a professional cook down in a journal, but never pursues it. Instead, she works in the cookware section of a department store, until one day she bumps her head while flirting with her co-worker.\nUpon examination, doctors tell her she has weeks to live, so the woman decides to quit her job and live life to its fullest.\n“A Russell Peters Christmas Special” \nSometimes, we don’t want cuddly sentimental Christmas movies with cute dogs and love stories. Sometimes, we just want to laugh.\nIn comes comedian Russell Peters with a Christmas special\n“Santa Buddies” \nThere are few things better than Beethoven trying to save Christmas–Air Bud’s puppies trying to save Christmas.\n“White Christmas” \nWe couldn’t leave out this Christmas classic. This romantic-comedy-musical involves two singing acts joining together to save a former commanding officer’s failing inn in Vermont.\n“While You Were Sleeping” \nOne of Sandra Bullock’s earlier films, she plays a lonely woman working for the Chicago Transit Authority and has a crush on a regular commuter. On Christmas day, she saves him from a tragic accident and accompanies him to the hospital where a nurse mistakes her for his fiancee.\n“Love Actually” \nProbably one of the best classic Christmas movies out there.\nIt’s a romantic-comedy that follows nine intertwined love stories and it will give you all the feels. Just keep a box of tissues handy.\nRead original story 17 Great Christmas Movies You Can Stream on Netflix Right Now (Photos) At TheWrap",

      "title": "Matt Czuchry on Logan and Rory's Future in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\"",
      "text": "Netflix The last moments of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is open-ended yet hopeful. As the final four words reveal , Rory Gilmore is pregnant. Fans have been quick to narrow down the list of worthy contenders for the father of Rory’s unborn child: is it Logan? Jess? Or the guy beneath the Wookie costume? Or could it be Paul, the boyfriend who should’ve been dumped two years ago? Matt Czuchry, the handsome creature who plays Logan, has offered his take on the big reveal and where the revival leaves Rory and Logan. In a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Matt says it was fitting that Logan and Rory’s story included another excellent chapter from the Life and Death Brigade. “On the page, it felt like this is the best of Logan, this is the best of Rory, this is the best of them together,” he says. “For me, one of my favorite episodes in the original series was 'You Jump, I Jump, Jack' which was very early on for Logan where Rory goes to her first Life and Death Brigade event. I loved that episode, and to me, this was just that episode elevated to the nth degree.”\nTumblr The 2016 edition of the Life and Death Brigade sequence ends with a sad but probably necessary farewell between Rory and Logan. According to Matt, the goodbye is pretty final. “I think the way I approached it was they had had their journey together, and from my perspective, Logan, no matter what happens moving forward, will always love Rory, and in this particular moment, they know it's time to move on,” he tells THR . “Just like their relationship throughout these four chapters was mutual, this ending for them and saying goodbye was mutual. They could feel that it was the time to say goodbye.”\nGiphy As for the whole “Who’s the father?” game, Matt is staying out of it. “I think the intention is to keep that open. I think that’s Amy and Dan’s intention, otherwise they would have done something differently or made it more specific.” He also doesn’t think there will be more episodes, which, depending on how you feel about the ending, could be a blessing or your worse nightmare. “At this particular point, I haven’t heard about anything more or not. And at this particular point, it’s really just finished, so I’m not sure that anybody’s in that mind frame.”\nRead the full interview at The Hollywood Reporter .\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is now streaming on Netflix. Feel free to rewatch all of Logan’s scenes with these helpful notes in mind.\nFollow Peggy ",

NFLX, +0.50% said Wednesday morning it is rolling out the ability to download TV series and films, a feature lauded on other platforms such as Amazon.com Inc.'s AMZN, -0.55% Prime Video. More and more consumers are watching video content on the go where cellular and wireless internet connections can be spotty, at best. The feature is available Wednesday for all plans and across all available devices, Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu wrote in a blog post on the company's site. It's not clear exactly how many series and films are available for download. In the blog post Wu writes many of viewers favorite series are available, with more on the way. Shares of Netflix are up nearly 3% in the year to date, underperforming the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.13% which is up almost 8%.",

Today the company announced that it’s launching offline playback for “many of your favorite streaming series and movies.” Right now, that selection seems largely limited to shows and movies made by Netflix, so you’ve got Stranger Things, The Crown, Narcos, Orange is the New Black , and others available to view offline on day one. \nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 Once you’ve updated to the latest version of Netflix on Android or iOS (the update doesn’t seem to be out just yet), a download button will appear next to the play button, letting you save content to watch later on when you might not have any internet connection. Better yet, offline playback is available for all streaming plans, so Netflix isn’t trying to use it to up-sell people on higher subscription tiers. \nOffline playback is a feature that Netflix executives have previously said the company was unlikely to embrace. But other video rivals like Amazon Instant Video and more recently Vudu have allowed customers to download content to watch anywhere.",

      "text": "Michael Che has a creative comeback to the phrase 'All Lives Matter' in his Netflix special By Bethonie Butler The Washington Post 9 hrs ago ( … ) \nMichael Che isn’t known to shy away from controversy behind the desk of “Weekend Update” on “Saturday Night Live.” His Netflix comedy special, which started streaming Friday, is no different. \n“Michael Che Matters,” predictably, confronts discussions around the Black Lives Matter movement — including its opponents. \n“They don’t tell you black lives don’t matter,” the comedian and former “Daily Show” correspondent tells his audience at Brooklyn’s Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse. “That’s not what they say — that’s not the argument. They hit you with that slick (stuff). Like, well, ‘All lives matter.’ Really, semantics? That would be like if your wife came up to you and was like ‘Do you love me?’ And you’re like, ‘Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?’ \nThe one-hour special also finds Che sharing his opinion on President-elect Donald Trump. “I actually like Donald Trump, to be honest with you,” he says, leading to a few audible boos. Che’s response? “Shut up.” \n“I don’t think he should be president,” Che clarifies. “But I do think he’s . . . hilarious and he should be my best friend.” \nThe special was filmed in August, and Che tells the audience he expects Hillary Clinton to be elected president. But just for kicks, he suggests that maybe — when the country isn’t so divided, Trump should get a year in the White House. \n“When we’re doing really good, when it’s safe — like when you let a baby drive a little bit,” Che jokes. \nIn an interview with Uproxx, Che noted that the special was taped before nearly a dozen women accused the then-Republican presidential nominee of touching them inappropriately or kissing them without their consent. “So much has come out about him, which makes him seem like much worse of a dude,” Che told the site, adding that “all the bits I do are basically just honest, gut reactions to what I feel hearing this news.” \nChe said that aspect of comedy was much like some of the statements Trump made during his campaign, and even before he was a candidate. \n“The stuff that he says about Obama? He didn’t know he’d be in this same exact position eight years later and now he has to face it,” Che told Uproxx. “And now he’s like, ‘Well, I think everybody should just be fair and stop protesting the president. I’m the president of everybody.’ And go back eight years ago and he’s like, ‘Everybody protest Obama.’” Tags",

      "text": "Netflix Offline Viewing Functionality Finally Available  47 PST \nNetflix is one of the most popular online streaming services in the world that’s used by tens of millions of people across the globe. Many of its users have wanted the ability to save content for viewing offline but Netflix was initially against the idea . It was only a few months ago that the company started warming up to it . Those who subscribe to the service will be delighted to find out today that Netflix offline viewing functionality is finally available. \nDownloading content for offline viewing is very easy. Simply tap on the download button on the details page for a TV show or movie and let the app do the rest. This functionality is currently limited to mobile devices only and will not be available on desktop. \nThis doesn’t mean that all of the content available on Netflix will support this functionality. It’s more or less limited to all of Netflix’s original series but the company does say that more content will eventually support offline viewing. \niOS and Android users need to update their Netflix app today in order to use this new feature. It was only a matter of time before Netflix offline viewing became a reality given that rivals like Amazon Instant Video already provide this functionality to users. There’s no up-sell here, Netflix offline viewing feature is available to all subscribers. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \nFiled in General . Read more about Apps and Netflix . Related Articles",

      "text": "Netflix finally lets you download to stream offline Netflix finally lets you download to stream offline An update to its mobile apps will let you watch without a connection, but not every film and show in its catalog is included. Netflix finally lets you download to stream offline 0 \nNetflix's \"Stranger Things\" is one of the series on the streaming service that can now be downloaded to watch offline. Photo by Netflix \nOne of the deepest desires of Netflix binge watchers is finally here: offline viewing. \nThe streaming giant on Wednesday added an option to its mobile app that will download films and TV shows in advance to watch them without an internet connection. Plane rides will never be the same. \nNot every show and movie in its catalog is included, however. \nOffline viewing has been a long-desired feature for Netflix subscribers. The company resisted it for years, saying that mobile networks would eventually advance to the point that you'd have no disconnected moments. But two things wore down Netflix's resistance in the last couple years. Rivals with offline viewing, like Amazon's Prime video service , have become more competitive. In addition, Netflix's global expansion to places like India brought it to countries with weaker or spottier mobile networks, making downloads more valuable to members. \nNetflix said \"many\" of its series and films are available for download, including originals like \" Stranger Things ,\" \" Orange Is the New Black ,\" \" The Crown \" and \" House of Cards .\" \nSome licensed shows and movies aren't available to watch offline, such as the BBC's \" Sherlock \" series or the Disney's animated hit \" Zootopia .\" Even some Netflix originals, like \" The Little Prince \" film, can't be downloaded. \nNetflix said more downloadable titles are on the way. \nMembers need to update their Netflix app and look for an arrow symbol next to a title to indicate downloading. Subscribers can also look to a new category on the Netflix app's side menu called \"Available for Download,\" which collects all the programs you can watch offline. \nThe app update is available for both Apple iOS and Google Android devices.

      "text": "Tweet \nMany people stream their favorite movies and TV shows today through Netflix. The service, which boasts around 86 million subscribers, is available on all the major platforms, making it easy for users to enjoy it pretty much everywhere and on every PC, smartphone and tablet. That is, as long as there is a working Internet connection. \nThat changes today, as Netflix announces that it is also making its content available offline. Users are now able to download movies and TV shows and watch them while, for instance, traveling on an airplane or in a remote area. Here is what you need to know. \nFirst off, the option to have content available offline does not incur any additional costs. Netflix says that all that users need to do to take advantage of this new feature is to tap on the download button that is on the details page of a movie or TV show. \nNot all content is available to watch offline, however. \"Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today\", Netflix explains. \nThe feature is being made available through the Netflix apps for Android and iOS . There is no word whether it will also be offered on other platforms, but the service does say that it is enabled on all plans and smartphones and tablets running the two aforementioned mobile operating systems. \nObviously, if you want to take proper advantage of the offline support that Netflix just announced, you will have to make sure that all your downloads finish while your device is still connected to the Internet. \nThat can take a bit of time, depending on how much content you want to watch, but suffice it to say that you should start the download as soon as possible before boarding a plane or heading somewhere where there's no Wi-Fi or cellular coverage.",

The spoof is based on the Netflix series The Stranger Things YouTube / Christian Aid \n\"The ambiguous boy alludes to Stranger Things' character Will Byers, Baby Jesus and the millions of displaced people who can't be at home this Christmas,\" a statement from Christian Aid read. \"The boys are helped on their journey with a message from an angelic young girl who knows where the boy can be found.\" \nEmma Wigley, multimedia communications manager at Christian Aid said: \"This year we wanted to find a unique way to highlight our Christmas appeal. With a narrative that involves the search for a young boy, a messenger who bridges two worlds and lights that guide the way, strong parallels can be made between the TV series and the Nativity. Sponsored   \n\"We wanted to use that idea to produce a film that is both contemporary and timeless, but ultimately draws attention to the worst global displacement crisis of our time.\" Advertisement",

      "text": "share Netflix just announced that it’s adding the ability to download TV shows and movies to your Android or iOS devices to watch offline. It’s a big deal for anyone who likes watching movies while flying on a plane or commuting to work on the subway. It’s not just for Netflix’s own original content: full runs of major network TV series and popular movies are available to download, too, although it doesn’t include the entirety of the streaming service’s catalog. To help you out, we’ve put together a list of the best shows and movies you can download to binge-watch on the go: Stranger Things Where to Watch: Sitting on the diving board at your friend’s boyfriend’s house while waiting to go home If you missed out on the Stranger Things hype last summer, it’s still not too late to join in. Pro-tip: Barb only shows up in the first two episodes, so that’s all you’ll need for understanding 90 percent of the cultural references people make. Star Trek / TNG / DS9 / Voyager / Enterprise Where to Watch: Daily commute (seriously, there’s a lot of episodes) It’s the 50th anniversary of Star Trek this year, and now you can watch every episode of all the series of the show anywhere. It’s the perfect time to catch up on the science fiction juggernaut. Breaking Bad Where to Watch: The subway Perhaps the poster child of the so-called “golden age” of TV, Breaking Bad is a drama that depicts mild-manner chemistry professor Walter White descend into a morally gray world of drug dealing as he struggles to support his family and pay for his cancer treatments. Parks and Recreation Where to Watch: Waiting in line at the DMV for your driver’s license NBC’s quirky comedy about small government and the ongoing antics of the Pawnee Department of Parks and Recreation is a modern comedy staple. Skip the short six-episode first season and just skip right to season two, where the show starts to hit its stride. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Where to Watch: Flight to West Covina, California Perhaps the least appreciated show currently airing on television, Crazy Ex - Girlfriend tackles major issues of depression and love in the guise of a brilliant pastiche of musical theater. Hot Fuzz Where to Watch: On the train (commuting from London to Sandford, Gloucestershire) The second film in the loosely connected Cornetto Trilogy, Hot Fuzz is a satirical take on buddy-cop movies with director Edgar Wright’s signature styling and charm that make it one of the best action movies and / or comedies ever. The Imitation Game Where to Watch: In the basement of your grandparent’s house that has no Wi-Fi The dramatized account of British computer scientist and cryptographer Alan Turing takes a few liberties with history, but it’s still a fascinating depiction of the efforts to crack Germany’s Enigma code during WWII. The IT Crowd Where to Watch: Hiding in a closet while avoiding your boss at work This British comedy series about the titular IT department of a major corporation satirizes how self-described “standard nerds” fit into the overall corporate structure. The Crown Where to Watch : International flight, preferably to somewhere in the UK As the saying goes, “Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.” Netflix’s latest big original series focuses on the English monarchy, and the tremendous pressures that the royal position puts on their personal and public lives.

      "text": "Netflix finally adds offline viewing, but with a catch It's about time, Netflix. TJ Donegan November 30, 2016 \nNetflix has grown from scrappy startup to media empire thanks to its sprawling (and ever-changing) media catalog, replete with old movies, new movies, and tons of original content bankrolled by Netflix itself. \nOne thing the service has been missing for years? The ability to download that content and watch with you anywhere. That changes today, as Netflix is rolling out a new update that will let users hit a button to download a show to their device, making it available to watch later. \nOf course, there's a catch: only some shows will actually be available for download. We just installed the new update and Netflix at least helpfully organizes downloadable titles into their own section. Credit: Reviewed.com Shows on Netflix weigh in at about 250MB each with the standard quality setting, and about 1GB at high quality. \nDownloading these titles couldn't be easier; you just tap what you want to watch and next to the \"My List\" button is a new \"Download\" option. You can download one show at a time, but you can tap multiple shows or episodes and they'll download in order until they're done. You can even do this across users, so you can start downloading a show for your kid and then move to your account and queue up a few episodes of Narcos for yourself. Credit: Reviewed.com Netflix helpfully shows you how to download shows once you update the app. \nEpisodes of Narcos rang in at around 250MB on my phone at the default \"standard quality\" setting and downloading one took about 5-6 minutes on my connection, while Love Actually was about twice as big. Bumping that up to the \"High Quality\" setting increases the size substantially, with an episode of Narcos weighing in at 1GB, though Love Actually only bumped up to 1.6GB. Downloading is only available by WiFi by default, but you can turn this restriction off if you want. Downloading these titles couldn't be easier; you just tap the new \"Download\" option next to what you want to watch. \nThe initial batch of offerings is limited, but still quite good. It includes not just Netflix Originals like Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things , but also movies and shows like Minions , Boyhood , Mad Men , and The Imitation Game . It's unclear what percentage of Netflix's catalog is currently available for download. \nThe hangup with the rest of the content is likely due to the messy web of longstanding licensing contracts that allows Netflix to stream these movies in the first place, and those agreements may simply not allow for offline downloads. \nWhether that changes over time remains to be seen, but given that every month tons of content enters and leaves the Netflix universe due to these agreements, it's safe to say it's an open question going forward. \nIn the meantime, Netflix lovers and road warriors can finally cross a requested feature off their wish list. \nOur editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

Not every show or movie is available for download, likely due to restrictions in programming contracts. Netflix says the download feature is available for \" select TV shows and movies .\" Besides Stranger Things , the Netflix announcement said that Orange Is the New Black , Narcos, and The Crown are available for download now. These four have something in common: they are all produced by Netflix.\nRead 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Netflix finally lets you download shows and movies for offline viewing Just in time for holiday travelers on Nov 30, 2016, 12:00 PM TechSpot \nA long requested feature has finally come to Netflix. Today the company announced that it’s launching offline playback for “many of your favorite streaming series and movies.” For now that includes original series like Narcos and Stranger Things, but also plenty of third-party content as well. A bunch of shows including Parks and Recreation, The Office and 30 Rock and many others are available. It’ll vary region-to-region but there’s enough to get you started and comes just in time for holiday travelers. \nThe offline viewing feature is available in the latest version of Netflix on Android or iOS pushed out today. A download button will appear next to the play button for shows that allow it or you can head to the navigation menu in the top left corner, then choose \"Available for Download\" to see everything that’s available in one place. You can also select between a “standard” or “higher” quality download option, depending on whether you want to prioritize video quality or device storage space. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nNetflix had been notably against video downloading and just two years ago company executives were saying it was “never going to happen,” arguing it adds considerable complexity to the product. \nGiven rival platforms like Amazon and YouTube Red now offer offline viewing, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings went on record earlier this year saying they’re keeping “ an open mind ” about the feature, as a way to make Netflix more appealing in developing markets where mobile broadband is expensive or limited. \nThe company ultimately decided it’s a worthwhile addition and it’s not limiting it to specific markets. Just like with their originals, the new offline viewing feature is available for everyone at the same time. Related Reads",

      "text": "Netflix now offers offline viewing of certain movies and shows Netflix now offers offline viewing of certain movies and shows Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Android - Android + Software updates - Software updates + Apps - Apps + \nStarting today, certain Netflix videos can be viewed offline Netflix has never been a big fan of allowing subscribers to view video offline. But some cracks in that wall started to show back in June when an \"open secret\" was revealed by a consulting firm analyst named Dan Rayburn, who toils for Frost and Sullivan. Rayburn said that Netflix was working on a way to allow subscribers to use the service even when they are not connected to the internet . That report said that this capability would be available before the end of this year.As we said, that was back in June and now we are down to the last 30 or so days that Netflix has left in order to make that report come true. But a press release disseminated by Netflix this morning says that offline viewing will launch this afternoon for iOS and Android users. Already, there is word that those with iOS are able to use the new feature now. A special tab lists the shows and movies that are eligible to be viewed offline. Besides thumbing through the tab, you can find a show that can be viewed offline by looking for a little \"download\" button by the title.The whole idea here is to download a streaming movie or show while you have a Wi-Fi connection, and play it back later for viewing at a location where a Wi-Fi hotspot cannot be found. Or, you can view a downloaded video while in Airplane mode. The new feature will be offered on all Netflix plans. We should mention that the default mode for offline viewing is low resolution. If you switch to \"higher quality\" playback, it still won't bump you to the highest resolution available. Earlier today, Netflix sent out a tweet to let every one know that this new feature was here. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

(Or maybe Netflix just wants to distract everyone from the less-than-enthusiastic reception Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life has been receiving.)\nBut the Tanner family won’t be the only new thing showing up on Netflix. The build team from Mythbusters will be debuting their new show, White Rabbit Project , on the same day, and Netflix will be adding both Captain America: Civil War and The Angry Birds Movie at various points in the month as well. (The Robin Williams vehicle Toys will also come to Netflix on December 1st, but nobody really cares about that movie except for me, because I had some misguided fascination with it growing up. I even own the soundtrack. Props to Tori Amos for that “Happy Worker” song.)\nSometimes you just really want to watch ‘Keanu’ Amazon Prime, on the other hand, will be getting TV fans ready for the upcoming second season of Syfy’s The Expanse when it adds the show’s first season in December, and the second season of The Man in the High Castle will also be making its debut. Amazon will be continuing its ongoing relationship with filmmaker Woody Allen, as well, when it debuts Café Society on December 22nd.\nThat’s not going to be enough for everyone, of course. Sometimes the only service you have is HBO Now, and you just really want to watch Midnight Special , Keanu , Self/Less , or Hail, Caesar! Most months, you’d be out of luck — but as Hans Gruber once said, this is the time of miracles , and in December HBO Now customers will be able to do just that. \nOf course, that doesn’t mean the month isn’t without its downsides. It turns out that in December HBO Now will be losing a movie called MI-5 . Now, I hadn’t heard of MI-5 , so when I saw it on this month’s list I looked it up, and it turns out that it’s basically Jason Bourne meets The Rock, with Jon Snow in the Sean Connery and Matt Damon roles. This may not be a completely accurate description, but it’s certainly the vibe the trailer gives. You have until December 31st to find out for sure.\n\nComing to Netflix December 1st \nAlways Angels in the Snow Beverly Hills Cop Beyond Bollywood Black Snake Moan Chill with Bob Ross: Collection Compulsion D2: The Mighty Ducks David Blaine: Street Magic Dreamland For the Love of Spock Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce , season 2 Glory Daze: The Life and Time of Michael Alig Harry and the Hendersons Hitler: A Career Holiday Engagement Honey, I Shrunk the Kids House of Wax (2006) Hannibal Merli , season 1 Merry Kissmas National Lampoon’s Animal House Picture Perfect Rainbow Time Rodeo & Juliet Swept Under Switchback The Angry Birds Movie The Crucible The Little Rascals The Legend of Bagger Vance The Rock The Spirit of Christmas Toys Uncle Nick Waking Life Way of the Dragon We're Back!

      "text": "✕ Netflix now has a “download” feature for offline viewing You can now watch Netflix on phones and tablets without an internet connection, the better to enable your marathons. share Just in case you weren’t already wary of losing too many weekends to Netflix marathons, the streaming service is taking another huge step toward dominating its audience’s viewing habits: It’s making its programming available offline. On November 30, Netflix announced on its media blog that it has launched a “download” option that will allow users to save content to their phones or tablets so they can watch it even without an internet connection — and no, it won’t cost extra. (The download option is not currently available for laptop computers.) This article is part of New Money , a new section on economics, technology, and business. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” the company said in a statement. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” The download option is already available for many movies and series, including Netflix originals Stranger Things , The Crown , Orange Is the New Black ,and Narcos . The company did not specify how much of its content catalog will ultimately be available for download at any given time, merely promising that there’s “more on the way.” Behold, a shiny new option for further marathon enabling! Netflix To see if the series or movie you want is available for download, you’ll need to have the most up-to-date version of the Netflix app on a phone and/or tablet using iOS 8.0 software or later, or Android 4.4.2 or later. Just search the title you want and look for the download icon (the arrow pointing downward to a horizontal line). The Netflix app also features a separate “Available for Download” menu to display all the available content in one place, as well as a “My Downloads” section to keep track of the shows and movies you’ve already saved. Some of the options currently available. Netflix Netflix says that downloading uses about as much data as streaming, so you might want to use a wireless connection rather than a cellular one while downloading. As the Hollywood Reporter noted , this kind of offline download option is one that Amazon made available for Prime subscribers in September 2015. It was probably only a matter of time before Netflix did the same, especially given its increasingly wide international subscriber base. And if you’re a Netflix subscriber, you now have a new tool at your disposal to enable Netflix marathons wherever you go, whether in line at the store, on the subway, in the air, or anywhere in between. Eye contact with other humans is overrated, anyway. (And in case you'd like your on the go marathons with a hefty dose of irony , yes, Black Mirror is available to download, too.)

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo After resisting offline playback for years, Netflix on Wednesday finally added the option . And just in time for the holidays, too. This is a feature that has been available on competing platforms for a while now, so it’s about time Netflix caught up.\nUnfortunately, the service’s entire catalog isn’t available to download. Fans hoping to take Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life on the go won’t be able to do so—at least not yet. However, shows such as Stranger Things , Orange is the New Black , and Master of None can watch these originals on an airplane (or wherever internet isn’t readily available).\nWhile there isn’t a master list of content available for download, Netflix makes it pretty easy to see what you can watch offline. Simply open your app, tap on the hamburger icon, and click on the “Available for Download” section. Here you’ll see everything from “Recently Added” to “New Releases,” along with other content based on your viewing habits.\nBelow is a list of some of the best movies and TV shows you can take offline. If there’s a show or movie we neglected to mention, let us know in the comments down below.\nMovies Hot Fuzz Boyhood Nightcrawler Goosebumps Minions Pulp Fiction Hellboy The Imitation Game Spotlight Jane Got a Gun Good Will Hunting Dazed and Confused Sixteen Candles Moonrise Kingdom Dope Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Chef Big Daddy Wet Hot American Summer Hotel Transylvania 2 Adventureland Swingers Trainspotting Burn After Reading The Babadook Netflix originals Narcos Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Master of None Stranger Things Mascots The Ridiculous 6 House of Cards Flaked Special Correspondents Pee-wee’s Big Holiday Beasts of No Nation The Get Down Making a Murderer Love The Crown Sense 8 Black Mirror Season 3 Bojack Horseman TV Parks and Recreation The Office (U.S.) Penny Dreadful Breaking Bad Californication Mad Men Blacklist Supergirl Weeds Freaks & Geeks 3rd Rock From the Sun House Better Call Saul 30 Rock ",

      "text": "Here are the best shows, movies and anime you should download from Netflix Who says commuting has to be boring? share Netflix Netflix announced today that it was finally allowing subscribers to access certain TV shows, series and specials while offline. In order to play content while in offline mode, all users have to do is download the film or show they want to watch while connected to Wi-Fi or operating on a 3G/LTE network and wait for it to finish. Then, while in the mobile app on Android and iPhone devices, people can click on the downloads section and pick what they want to stream. Although there are a number of films and shows that aren’t available — Disney, Pixar and Lucasfilm content are not, for example — there’s a pretty substantial library of entertainment to choose from. To help make it a little easier, Polygon has put together a list of the best titles to download right now. Films Pulp Fiction — A neo-noir black comedy from Quentin Tarantino that brings together the different storylines of of Los Angeles gangsters, criminals and a mysterious briefcase. Moonrise Kingdom — An eccentric, coming-of-age story from the mind of Wes Anderson that follows two young lovebirds who abandon their camp to run away together. Good Will Hunting — The film that earned Matt Damon and Ben Affleck their first Oscar, the movie follows a young genius working as a janitor at MIT and the professor, played by Robin Williams, who helps him to see his full potential. Wet Hot American Summer — The offbeat, summer camp comedy that was eventually turned into a Netflix original series saw the beginning of many of today’s top comedic talent including Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd and more. Jaws — Steven Spielberg’s classic film about a great white shark that terrorizes a town during one fateful summer. Boyhood — Richard Linklater’s 12-year epic follows the growth of a young boy into a college student. The film was nominated for multiple Oscars, and Linklater took home the award for Best Directing. No Country for Old Men — Joel and Ethan Coen’s neo-Western thriller based on Cormac McCarthy’s acclaimed novel, the film follows a Texas welder and Vietnam veteran in a deserted Texan town in 1980. Hot Fuzz — The second in the Cornetto Trilogy from Edgar Wright, the film stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as police officers in a small village where mysterious deaths keep occurring. Clerks — Kevin Smith’s iconic black-and-white film about two friends who work unfulfilling jobs at video rental and convenience stories. Trainspotting — Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel follows a group of young heroin addicts in Scotland. The sequel is currently in development. Reservoir Dogs — Another Quentin Tarantino movie, Reservoir Dogs centers around a group of criminals just before and right after a proposed diamond heist goes incredibly wrong. Nightcrawler — Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this thriller about modern journalism, obsession and trying to make it in America. Spotlight — Last year’s Oscar winner for Best Picture, Spotlight chronicles the story of the Boston Globe’s pulitzer prize winning investigation into the child abuse scandal being covered up by the Catholic church. The Fast and the Furious — Does this even need an explanation? TV shows Friday Night Lights — One of the best TV dramas in the modern age, Friday Night Lights follows a small, football loving town in Texas and the coach who comes in to shake everything up. Parks and Rec — The series stars Amy Poehler as political hero Leslie Knope that, quite frankly, we could all use today. Seriously, download Parks and Rec and just watch Leslie Knope’s speeches about the power of good politics again and again. 30 Rock — Tina Fey’s iconic series about the behind-the-scenes world of a fictional Satruday Night Live still holds up a decade after it premiered. Breaking Bad — The multi Emmy-award winning series from Vince Gilligan may have single handily redefined what audiences should expect out of a TV drama. Binge this entire thing if you haven’t seen it yet. AMC Better Call Saul — The spinoff of Breaking Bad focuses on the eccentric lawyer Saul Goodman, played by Bob Odenkirk. It’s not as dark as its predecessor, but it’s a great series to dive into. Gossip Girl — Gossip Girl is, without question, one of the best teenage dramas of the post-2000 era. It’s up there with The O.C., One Tree Hill and Dawson’s Creek. Supernatural — The long-time running series on the CW follows two brothers who are tasked with hunting demons and protecting the world from their evil nature. This show is 12 seasons deep and doesn’t look like it’s going to slow down anytime soon. Twin Peaks — David Lynch’s groundbreaking series from the ‘90s is still as creepy, chilling and oddly sensual now as it was when it first premiered. The show is coming back next year, so it’s a good time to get caught up. CW The Flash — If you’re not already watching it, you should be. What the CW has done with superheroes is pretty impressive and Grant Gustin is one of the best Flash’s we’ve ever seen. Arrow — The show that kickstarted it all on the CW. If you’re looking to start from the beginning, start with this one. Supergirl — The newest addition to the CW, Supergirl has quickly become one of the most beloved series on the network after a rough start on CBS. The second season is currently on the air, so you can get caught up pretty quickly by downloading the first season. Anime Attack on Titan — The first season of Attack on Titan is currently available to download. The shoe has risen in popularity and has become one of the most watched in recent years. The second season is slated to be released next April. Naruto — One of the most popular anime series of all time, Naruto follows a young ninja who dreams of becoming his town’s leader, proving to anyone that he’s more than what he appears to be. Death Note — Death Note is currently being adapted by Netflix into a feature-length, live-action film, and it’s not hard to see why. After a teenager discovers a notebook that allows him to kill whoever he wants, however he wants without it being traced back to him, he begins to take out the criminals in Japan. Things start to go awry, however, when the police begin to pice it together. Bleach — The series follows a Soul Reaper who’s forced to take on the duty of protecting humans from evil spirits and help guide those departing souls into the afterlife as much as he can. Kill La Kill — Kill La Kill follows a schoolgirl who is on the hunt for her father’s killer. In the process, however, she has to take on her student council president and her mother’s fashion empire. Gurren Lagan — The show is a mech anime series, so if you’re into things like Gundam Wing or Gundam Seed you’ll probably enjoy this, too. Netflix has confirmed to Polygon that it is currently in negotiations with other studios to bring more content available to subscribers for downloading purposes. At this time, however, it’s only what appears on your screen. Subscribers can choose from a standard-definition or high-definition download, but note that if you opt for the latter, it will take up more downloading space on your phone. Netflix recommends deleting a show or film every time you download a new episode or movie to ensure you have enough room and your device’s storage isn’t too largely impacted.

      "text": "Netflix finally offers offline viewing, video downloads Netflix finally offers offline viewing, video downloads By Joel Hruska on November 30, 2016 at 2:40 pm Comment \nEver since Netflix debuted its online streaming service, it’s had one major limitation — you couldn’t download shows for later viewing. This made the service less useful while traveling, since airport and airplane WiFi are often expensive and/or slow and relatively few vehicles are WiFi-enabled. Amazon implemented downloading for at least some TV shows and movies over a year ago, but Netflix has stubbornly maintained that it wouldn’t bring the feature to its on-demand service. \nThat’s finally changed as of this week . According to a new Netflix blog post, the Details page for movies and TV shows will now include an option to download a show for later viewing, as shown below. \nThere are currently a few caveats to consider. First, the feature appears to be limited to Android and iOS devices, not PCs. This is presumably to prevent content from leaking, since the PC can’t be locked down the way other devices can. There’s no word on whether or not Netflix will bring the feature to its Windows 10 app — Microsoft has previously boasted about its DRM support in Windows 10 and Edge is the only browser that can stream 4K content if paired with a Kaby Lake processor, but apparently the Windows app hasn’t gotten enough engagement to be updated and launched alongside Android and iOS support. We’d guess that there’s a reasonable chance Netflix brings this feature to W10, but only if the Universal app can be locked down tightly enough to satisfy the movie and television studios. \nNot all content is supported yet, but all of Netflix’s self-created television shows are, and most of the back catalog appears to be available as well. You’ll need enough storage space to save the videos — Gizmodo reports that one hour of Black Mirror weighed in at 280MB in standard definition and 440MB in HD. Obviously this will still consume bandwidth off your cellular plan if you’re transferring data that way, so we strongly recommend connecting to a WiFi network before downloading all 11 seasons of Supernatural or whatever TV show you prefer. \nGenerally speaking, standard video looks very nearly as good as HD on a small phone with a 4-inch screen or less (720×480 has a 216 PPI on a 4-inch display). As screen sizes rise, the difference becomes more apparent, and we’d expect most people to be able to see the difference between HD and SD by the 7-inch mark. Whether or not the difference is big enough to matter will depend on the size of your data plan and personal taste. Encode quality of downloaded episodes appears similar to Netflix’s standard streaming video; you don’t lose anything by downloading the content but you don’t gain any quality back, either. \nIf you want to download videos, make sure you’ve got the latest version of the app and either iOS 8.0 (or later) or Android 4.4.2 (or later). Video playback is handled exclusively by the Netflix app itself; you won’t be able to view Netflix video files in a file manager app or watch them on a third-party player. Netflix hasn’t released any information on the file format it’s using for the service, but it’s presumably based on H.264 since H.265 support in mobile devices is still fairly new. 4K videos do not appear to be available for download at this time.

      "text": "Netflix finally offers the feature you've been waiting for! By Francis Navarro, Komando.com \nThere's no denying it, one of America's favorite pastime activities is Netflix. In fact, more than one-third of data usage consumed during peak hours in the U.S. is attributed to Netflix video streaming. \nThere's nothing like chilling at home, searching for that perfect flick to pass the night away. With a solid home internet connection and generous data caps, you can stream to your heart's content. \nOn mobile, it's a different story. Irregular mobile data connections, scarce Wi-Fi hotspots, and limited data caps are some of the factors to consider before taking Netflix on the road. Thankfully, that's about to end. \nAfter months of teases and rumors , Netflix has finally delivered a new feature millions of subscribers have been clamoring for: downloads for offline playback. \nWith the Netflix's update for its iOS and Android app, subscribers can now download a large selection of TV shows and movies straight to their gadget for offline viewing. \nNow, as long as your gadget's storage space allows it, you can hoard your favorite Netflix originals such as \"Stranger Things,\" \"Narcos,\" \"Black Mirror\" or \"Luke Cage\" and a growing selection of movies like \"Boyhood,\" \"Good Will Hunting,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and episodes of TV shows like \"The Twilight Zone\" or \"The IT Crowd\" and watch them as many times as you like even in the absence of a data connection. \nIn this age of mobile streaming, why does this matter again? Well, it will be a most convenient feature to use on that long commute or road trips where mobile connections are irregular and unreliable. \nPreparing for content to watch on those long airplane flights will also be easier with this option, just queue everything up on your gadget while on Wi-Fi and away you binge. \nParents will surely appreciate this feature too. Just download the old reliable shows that your kids enjoy and they will always be available for viewing regardless of the data connection quality. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nAccording to Netflix's announcement: \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.\"",

Many of us don’t have unlimited data but still want to be able to catch up on their favorite TV shows without burning through our data limits. \nStarting today, you can download many of your favorite TV shows or movies, making them available for offline viewing. This is a feature that users have been clamoring for, and it has finally arrived. \nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today. \nNot every single title has been made available for offline viewing as of yet, but there are plans for Netflix to slowly make this a reality. This means you can download all the Game of Thrones that can fit on your device and binge while you wait until the new season comes out. \nIn order to get this new feature, you’ll need to download the latest version of the Netflix Android application. Then you’ll find a small download button on the sidebar of every eligible episode or movie.",

      "text": "Netflix lets subscribers watch shows offline Could have greater appeal in international markets Video Photo Lauren Graham and Alexis Bladel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore on the return of \"Gilmore Girls.\" (Saeed Adyani/Netflix) Reuters Nov 30, 2016 at 6:03 pm | Print View \nVideo streaming pioneer Netflix has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection. \nNetflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year. \nWhile the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less ubiquitous than it is in the United States. \nThe international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States. \nGrowth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point. \nIn that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout. \nNot everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls”revival. Available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,”“The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.” \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet’s Android and Apple’s iOS platforms, the company said.

      "text": "\nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required for its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” “House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, Calif., company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings indicated he might introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections.\n",

      "text": "Variety is the spice of...well, you know. .\nNetflix said Wednesday that its subscribers worldwide will now have access to a much requested new feature, downloading content for offline viewing.\nThe feature, which will be offered as a alternative to streaming content using an internet connection, comes at no extra cost.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation said in a blog post. \"Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.\"\nOffline viewing will not be immediately available for all programs. Netflix says the feature is already enabled for Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown, with more movies and series on the way.\nThe feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS.\nAmazon began offering downloads last year, so now the Netflix-only crowd can join in the fun. Those of us who use both streaming services are now covered in any sort of situation we may need a lively distraction from. Anything that provides travel entertainment or enhances the mobile experience is welcomed with loud cheers around here.\nThis is another smart way for Netflix to promote its original content. They can make their own stuff immediately available for download, thereby making it even more accessible and more likely to be viewed.\nThe value of this service for people waiting in DMV lines is obviously immeasurable.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/30/netflix-rolls-out-downloading-for-offline-viewing/",

      "text": "It's only been three days since Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life was released on Netflix - but the question is, will we see more of Lorelai and Rory? Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino explained: \"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. \"And the whole thought about, 'Is there more, is there more, is there more?' — this has to go out into the universe now. We've got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.\" Related: Gilmore Girls Netflix revival - trailer, cast, episodes, release date, and everything you need to know However, if it was up to Luke actor Scott Patterson, he'd be up for playing his part \"every year\". Earlier this year, he told THR that shooting the Gilmore Girls revival was \"easy\" and \"fun\". \"It'd be nice to do it every year,\" he said. \"Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters.\" Related: Gilmore Girls - 19 best episodes you should binge before the revival begins Far away from Stars Hollow, Digital Spy went to Berlin to catch up with Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, who revealed all about crying on set, working harder than Rob Lowe and whether this new mini-series could pave the way for more episodes… Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is now available to stream exclusively on Netflix.

      "text": "Netflix now allows offline viewing of shows, movies INQUIRER.net / 04:22 PM December 01, 2016 Netflix logo. File Photo Netflix has definitely enhanced our television- and movie-viewing experience, and its latest feature has made it even more accessible to the public. In an effort to showcase its vast array of selections even further, the network-television giant is launching an “offline playback” feature for a selected number of contents. The list includes Netflix originals including Stranger Things, The Crown, Narcos, and Orange is the New Black, as well as internationally acclaimed shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men . ADVERTISEMENT The selection also includes kid-friendly movies like Paddington, Minions and Kung Fu Panda 3, while classics Boyhood, Pulp Fiction, Nightcrawler, Good Will Hunting, Hot Fuzz and many more can now be watched even without being connected to the internet. More contents will be made available in the coming months, Netflix said. The latest version is now available for both iOS and Android users, and can be accessed through a new download button located next to the play switch for the allowed shows. According to Netflix’s guide page, users will be given two options to choose from in terms of video quality. “Standard quality is a slightly lower video resolution that requires less storage space and takes less time to download. Higher quality is a higher video resolution that requires more storage space and takes more time to download,” Netflix said. “Offline Playback” will be essential for users who are in regions that might not have the best internet connection. The update is also believed to be a means to compete with the company’s rivals Amazon Video and Vudu, which both rolled out offline features in their platforms. Khristian Ibarrola",

      "text": "The best Christmas movies on Netflix UK 'One...two ten.' Save Getty Creative \nChristmas isn't Christmas if you're not spending a good few hours of watching films. The terrestrial channels, joined by Sky, often offer a varied selection of festive movies, but thanks to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon, some are also available (albeit it in limited quantities) on demand. Here is our pick of films you might want to prioritise your viewing time around. All I Want for Christmas \nA little girl dreams of stopping her mother marrying another man and for her divorced parents to get back together again. But is that one wish too far for Santa Claus? Watch as people are unexpectedly thrown together, an old love is slowly rekindled and a new one fizzles out. Deck the Halls \nWith Matthew Broderick, Danny DeVito and Kristin Davis amongst the cast of this movie, it goes without saying that you're in for a laugh. There is always one house in any street that outdoes all the others when it comes to Christmas decorations. When someone new moves in and lights his house up so much that it can be seen from space, you have the scene set for a fairy light battle to outdo all others. Deck The Halls is available from December 21st. Arthur Christmas \nWhen a little girl accidentally gets missed off Santa's increasingly hi-tech delivery chain, Arthur Christmas steps in to ensure that no child is forgotten and nobody's belief in Father Christmas wavers. A classic animated family movie starring James McAvoy, Jim Broadbent and Bill Nighy. Jingle All The Way \nThere's always one toy that becomes 'the' toy that every kid wants for Christmas. It inevitably sells out and there's a desperate rush as parents tries to secure one. That's the premise of this film. A work-focused dad, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, leaves it until Christmas Eve to track down Turbo Man for the son he too often lets down. A Very Murray Christmas \nFancy a sing song? Bill is worried that a dreadful snowstorm will stop people from being able to get to his show. But, surprise! A whole host of celebrities show up and sing a variety of Christmas hits with him. A great one to put on after everyone's had a few too many Christmas drinks and want to keep things merry. Die Hard \nIt's often joked that it's not officially Christmas until you've seen Hans Gruber fall from the Nakatomi Plaza. Bruce Willis plays John McClane, an off-duty NYPD cop, who travels to LA to spend the holidays with his his estranged wife but finds himself foiling a terrorist plot inside a city skyscraper. With plenty of guns and violence, it's not your traditional Christmas movie but it does have some classic festive quotes. Scrooged \nBill Murray is Frank Cross, an anguished TV network president who is approaching the Christmas season not in the best of moods. Think Scrooge in an update of A Christmas Carol. Given it was made in 1988, it's not exactly a modern remake but it might be a nice change of pace from the varied selection of animated kids movies that'll be on TV over the Christmas period.
