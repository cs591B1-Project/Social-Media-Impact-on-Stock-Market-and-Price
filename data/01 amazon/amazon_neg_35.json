      "text": "For years, Ticketmaster has existed uncontested as America’s preeminent concert ticket retailer. That may soon change, however, as retailer-multimedia conglomerate Amazon is planning its own ticketing service.\nAs recode points out, Amazon is actively building up Amazon Tickets . The service received a soft launch in the UK last year, but the company is now eyeing expansion into the US, Europe, and Asia. The goal, according to one job posting, is to “position Amazon Tickets as the world’s premier destination for purchasing tickets.”\n“[O]ur vision goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show,” notes the job posting. “The ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.”\nAccording to recode, Ian Freed is heading Amazon Tickets. Freed most recently oversaw the launch of Amazon’s Fire Phone and also runs the company’s restaurant-delivery service.\nBelow, revisit our recent documentary, Sold Out!: Inside America’s Ticketing Landscape .\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqgpzGyfIVM \n ",

Simply ask her, in plain language, and she can play your music, perform Web-based queries, and control smart home devices like connected bulbs and thermostats. She can also perform a steadily expanding set of tasks programmed by third parties including quizzing you on world geography, checking airfares or airport security wait times, or telling you how to mix a mean martini.\nThe Echo Dot also acts as a speaker, though given its size, it's a fairly anemic one. If you want more oomph you'll need to spring for the $180 Echo proper. But you can connect the Dot to a more powerful speaker to enjoy your music throughout the house. And the more Dots you buy, the lower the price. 6 will cost you the price of 5, while 12 cost the price of 10.\n--This originally appeared on PCMag.com.",

      "text": "WILMINGTON A cargo airline whose pilots are striking will seek a court order today in a bid to get the pilots flying again in the crucial weeks before Christmas, the airline said.\nAir Transport Services Group, Inc. (ATSG) Tuesday said one of its two airline subsidiaries, ABX Air, Inc., is taking “multiple steps” to end what it calls an “illegal work stoppage” started early Tuesday by its pilots represented by the Airline Professionals Association of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 1224.\n“We will seek a court order later today to restore the status quo operating environment, even as we continue discussions with union representatives about specific issues of concern,” the company said in a statement.\nJoe Hete, president and chief executive of ATSG Inc., said he hoped the strike would not last long.\n“Hopefully not very long,” Hete said. “Hopefully, sane minds will prevail, and we’ll get this resolved shortly.”\n“We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in the statement.\nHete told this news outlet that an order will be sought in Cincinnati’s U.S. District Court. He said at about 8:45 a.m. that the company’s attorneys were working on a request, but nothing had yet been filed.\nAbout 250 pilots who fly for the cargo carrier ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL, went on strike Tuesday in Wilmington. According to a public relations firm for the union, the move cancelled about 75 flights.\nThe cargo carrier operates 45 flights a day for DHL and 35 for Amazon.\n“We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” Kelly Cheeseman, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said in a statement sent to the Dayton Daily News.\nEarlier this month, a federal court judge rejected a request by ABX Air for a temporary restraining order against its pilots and their union, the Teamsters noted in a release from Berlin Rosen, the union’s public relations firm.\nJudge Timothy S. Black of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Ohio wrote that he denied the restraining order because the “court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims because this matter represents a ‘minor dispute’ under the RLA (Railway Labor Act) that must be addressed through dispute resolution procedures before the System Board of Arbitration, as provided for by statute and contract,” according to a Nov. 8 story by American Shipper.\nPilots will picket outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and outside DHL’s North American hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport.\nRELATED: AMAZON GROWTH HELPS AREA AIR PARK GROW BUSINESES\nThe strike has holiday shoppers worried, and we’re working to learn how this could impact shipping from Amazon and DHL.\nPilots said they are picketing because they are being forced to work for emergency assignments on their off time.\nATSG’s subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. and other companies.\nLast month, the Teamsters asked the National Mediation Board to investigate ATSG.\nATSG owns ABX Air and Air Transport International Inc. The union contends the ATSG operates the two carriers as a single transportation system while “maintaining a facade of two separate carriers,” the union said in a statement.\n“Historically, airline holding companies have owned and operated multiple airline subsidiaries and kept them separate from one another for various reasons, some of which were designed to artificially suppress labor costs and conditions. The historical model no longer works due to vastly changed economic conditions affecting the airline industry, including the increasingly dire shortage of pilots across the world, which are now straining airlines’ ability to efficiently, effectively and safely serve their customers,” the Teamsters said in an Oct. 27 statement.\nFor updates and more news click here to download our free apps.",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

      "title": "Amazon air contractor aims to force striking pilots back to work - Tue, 22 Nov 2016 PST",
      "text": "TUESDAY, NOV. 22, 2016, 10:18 A.M. Amazon air contractor aims to force striking pilots back to work By Spencer Soper and Mary Schlangenstein Bloomberg Twitter \nABX Air, which flies packages for Amazon.com and DHL Worldwide Express, plans to ask a judge to force striking pilots back to work and thwart a threat to disrupt deliveries during the holiday shopping season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., are striking to protest alleged staffing shortages at the cargo carrier. ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. Some flights were grounded. \nThe action comes as the retail industry gears up for its busiest period and shoppers increasingly shun brick-and-mortar stores and shop from their phones and computers instead. Online spending in November and December will increase 11 percent this year to $91.6 billion, according to an October forecast from Adobe Systems Inc. \n“While they go through this court process, planes are not flying,” said Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting Group. “Obviously that is of concern to a company like DHL and Amazon.” But he said Amazon can shift some volume to United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. and can also find some smaller contract parcel shippers to move packages if needed. \nThe pilots are picketing outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe union says ABX Air is violating its contract by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments — preventing them from taking time off — because it doesn’t have enough pilots to meet the growing demands of companies like Amazon. The world’s biggest online retailer in March announced plans to lease 20 Boeing 767 freighters from ATSG to help it move inventory around the country. Amazon said in an emailed statement that it works with a variety of carriers and is confident in its ability to serve customers. DHL wasn’t immediately available for comment. \nPilot strikes in the U.S. are rare due to the Railway Labor Act, a 90-year-old federal law intended to prevent labor disputes from disrupting commerce. And when strikes do occur they often don’t last very long because the company can ask a judge to intervene with a temporary restraining order until the court decides if the strike is legal. On rare occasions, if a dispute substantially threatens essential transportation in the country, the U.S. president could get involved. \nATSG said it will seek a court order Tuesday to “restore the status quo operating environment,” while it continues discussions with union representatives. \n“Hopefully, sane minds will prevail and we’ll get things back to normal operations today,” said Quint Turner, chief financial officer for ABX parent ATSG. The company’s second airline, Air Transport International, is operating and will take steps to accommodate any extra demands caused by the pilot strike, he said. \nThe pilots say their strike is allowed because of the contract violations, and voted to authorize a walkout in May. \n“For the past two years, we’ve been warning them that they are dangerously short on pilots,” said Rick Ziebarth, 59, who’s been with ABX for 39 years. “The lifestyle of our crews have really taken a nose-dive. I can’t tell you how many birthdays, anniversaries and even funerals pilots can’t attend as a result of these emergency assignments.” \nPilots on Amazon runs fly night and day from Wilmington to Dallas to Stockton, California, to Rockford, Illinois, and back to Wilmington — sometimes with nowhere to rest but the cockpit, Ziebarth said. Such routes can increase fatigue because of rotations between night and day, he said. Pilots are willing to make accommodations for customers but want the company to abide by its contract by honoring vacation time and regulating emergency assignments, he said. \nAmazon’s air cargo operation is part of efforts to reduce its dependence on UPS and FedEx, as it expands a $99-a-year Prime membership service that can deliver orders in as little as a day. In addition to ATSG, Amazon in May entered into an agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings to acquire and operate 20 Boeing 767-300 freighters. \nA dedicated fleet helps Amazon shuffle inventory around the country more efficiently to meet demand spikes, while reducing the inventory it has to carry nationally. \nThe ABX strike underscores how a national pilot shortage could hinder Amazon’s air cargo aspirations. Its logistics partners have to compete for pilots with UPS, FedEx and passenger carriers that pay better wages and offer better benefits. That’s a different game than filling warehouses with temporary workers because pilots require years of training, especially for big aircraft, said Matt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics in Golden, Colorado. \n“I don’t think Amazon has encountered a problem like the pilot shortage before and it doesn’t have a quick and easy solution,” Barton said. “A lot of these carriers are going to have a hard time finding the pilots they need.”   10:18 a.m.",

      "text": "What's On NBC Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   11:30 AM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "This device attaches to garbage cans and recycle bins and can automatically reorder common household items on Amazon after people throw them out. (GeniCan Photo) Garbage bins will soon be able to talk to Amazon.\nThanks to a smart device that attaches to garbage cans and recycling bins, users will be able to add to shopping lists and even automatically reorder household essentials through Amazon.\nGeniCan is one of several new brands that have joined Amazon’s Dash Replenishment Service , which leverages sensors in a wide range of smart devices to track when new supplies need to be ordered and automatically purchases them on Amazon on behalf of customers.\nGeniCan’s newest device is set for release in January. It will attach to a bin, and when people throw away items, they can scan barcodes and add them to a shopping list on their smartphone. The integration with Amazon’s DRS means the device can tell Amazon to automatically reorder popular items once they are thrown away or recycled.\nOther brands joining the program include Honeywell , Nestle and WePlenish . Here’s a quick rundown of each brand’s Dash replenishment capability.\nHoneywell Connected Devices calculates when a new air filter is needed and automatically orders one from Amazon. Nestle’s BabyNes system is WiFi enabled and syncs with a smartphone to allow parents to track a baby’s nutrition or get an alert when a caregiver feeds the baby. DRS allows the device to automatically reorder more formula when supply is low. WePlenish Java stores coffee capsules, learns coffee drinkers’ consumption patterns, and — with Amazon’s Dash Replenishment Service — automatically reorders coffee when supply is low. It can do the same for pet food. Other brands using DRS include August, Brita, Behmore, Brother, Cleverpet, GE, Petcube, Samsung, Whirlpool, and others. Amazon also said this morning that more connected devices from these brands have been added to the program.\nAmazon opened up the program to developers who want to integrate a device or service with DRS, removing the need to build a separate back-end infrastructure for authentication, payment systems, etc. Amazon is challenging developers through a contest to come up with something that “helps advance the vision of automatic or low-friction replenishment,” according to an Amazon press release. Project submissions are due by 11:59 a.m. on Dec. 31 and winners will be announced about two weeks later on Jan. 13.\nDRS is a companion project to the Amazon Dash button , which lets consumers press the button to trigger a new order for whichever product (laundry detergent, Mac & Cheese, etc.) is associated with that button.",

      "text": "Amazon’s new show The Grand Tour is already breaking records after just one episode.\nThe show was Amazon’s most watched premiere, the company announced Monday, taking the No. 1 spot from the record-breaking debut of its series The Man in the High Castle. Millions of Prime members streamed the first episode of Grand Tour in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan, the company said , without revealing an exact number of viewers.\nOther than a successful debut, Amazon also sold a record number of Prime memberships on Friday. According to the company, Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days, with the exception of its annual Prime Day. The increase was thanks to a one-day price cut of its annual Prime membership fee from $99 to $79--a price that saved new members about 20%.\n\nThe show’s success is great news for the e-commerce giant, especially because it reportedly cost the company around $160 million to acquire, according to CNBC . However, Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos said this number is most likely low--instead suggesting it was “about a quarter of a billion dollars.”\n\"The guys are back, doing what they do best--the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard, and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining,\" said Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon amzn , in the press release.\nHe continued: \"Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.\"\nEpisode two of the 12-week series will be available on Amazon Prime this Friday, the company said.",

      "text": "Pilots with a cargo airline that flies routes for customers including Amazon.com went on strike Tuesday, a decision that could create hiccups for the Seattle e-commerce giant during the critical holiday shopping season.\nSome 250 pilots employed by ABX Air aren’t flying their scheduled routes as they fight what they say are stressful working conditions and intentional understaffing, especially during the fourth quarter’s shopping frenzy. \nA statement by the striking pilots, who are members of Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, says the interruption could “have a significant impact” on deliveries by ABX Air customers, including Amazon. The pilots portray Amazon as a “major” customer of the air freighter, adding that Amazon customers will see “delays and disruptions.” \nIn March, Amazon inked a deal a deal with ABX Air’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group , to lease 20 airplanes in a dedicated air-cargo network connecting Amazon’s far-flung warehouses. ATSG is already flying 14 of those planes, or 35 flights a day, for Amazon, according to the pilots. The strike also affects DHL, for which ABX makes 45 flights a day. \n  Amazon downplayed the potential impact of the walk-out. “We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.\nThe strike comes at a time when Amazon has aggressively sought to turn the page on the logistics woes that befell its operations in past holiday seasons. Higher than anticipated demand last year resulted forced the company to scramble in order to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps. \nSince then, Amazon has invested billions in building new warehouses and changed the fee structure for its fulfillment service for independent merchants in order to avoid similar troubles this time around.\nAmazon has also invested heavily in creating an air force that would allow it to move items more quickly, especially for members of its Prime loyalty program, who pay $99 a year in exchange for guaranteed fast shipping and other perks. \nIn addition to the 20 planes Amazon has agreed to lease from ATSG, the “Prime Air” fleet is expected to also lease 20 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings.\nWilmington, Ohio-based ABX Air says it will seek a court order on Tuesday to enjoin the pilots to go back to work, even as it continues the talks with the union. “We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under the terms of our current labor agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in an emailed statement.\nHowever, customers are being notified of temporary interruptions in flight operations so they can adjust their shipping networks, Starkovich said. \nThe pilots say that their conflict with ABX Air’s management stems from the firm’s alleged refusal to recall pilots who were furloughed when DHL shuttered its North American hub in Wilmington in 2008. \nÁngel González : 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @gonzalezseattle .

      "text": "print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Mario Tama/Getty Images \nIf you had to pick one tech company most at risk under Trump's presidency, it would have to be Amazon. \nDonald Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos constantly butted against each other throughout the campaign, with Trump once warning that the e-commerce company would face \"problems\" if he became the president . \nSo it's no surprise that Amazon's stock dropped by as much as 9% post-election, despite Bezos offering an olive branch shortly after Trump's win. \nBut over the past week, Amazon has quickly crawled back, and now it's regained all the post-election losses, showing Wall Street's renewed confidence in the $350 billion company. \n\"Initially there was this knee-jerk reaction around Trump’s presidency and his fairly negative comments around Amazon and Bezos while he was campaigning,\" Mizuho's analyst Neil Doshi told Business Insider. \"But I think the market has settled down and gained a little more confidence and sensibility around all of this.\" False accusations \nPart of it has to do with the broader market rally, which is pushing all the major indexes to record-highs on hopes of Trump's market-friendly policies benefiting most companies. \nBut Doshi says it's also because of investors coming to realize that Trump's threats on Amazon are \"grossly false.\" \nTrump has accused Bezos of using the Washington Post as a way to lower Amazon's taxes, while arguing that its online shopping site is violating anti-trust laws. Doshi says neither claim makes much sense, as the Washington Post is owned by Bezos, not Amazon, and Amazon's retail market share is just about 15%, not enough to call a monopoly. \nOn top of that, some of the recent news around Prime Video and the upcoming AWS re:Invent conference, as well as strong e-commerce forecasts for this year's holiday season, could all be driving the snap back, he said. \nStill, there remains some risks. Trump hasn't been entirely clear on where he's going with some of his trade and immigration policies, and has already flip flopped on some of his promises. Plus, Trump has had a contentious relationship with Silicon Valley in general, unlike the Obama administration who was very cozy with the tech industry. \n\"There's going to be a bit of an overhang for technology in general because it’s really unclear how [Trump] is thinking,\" Doshi said. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "title": "Amazon Fire HD 6 Tablet Review",
      "text": "by David November 22, 2016, 2:01 pm \nSo many tablets aimed at casual users get it completely wrong. The manufacturers think that just because their target audience isn’t tech geeks or mobile gaming aficionados they can get away with selling underperforming hardware that’s virtually obsolete the day it hits the market. Amazon Fire HD 6 Tablet Review image Amazon Fire HD 6 Tablet 69.99 \nAmazon knows better, and their smallest tablet, the Fire HD 6, is a great entry-point into their large ecosystem full of books, movies, TV shows, songs, and Android games and apps. Let’s see what makes it different from its competition. Design and Build \nTo some, the Fire HD 6 may seem like the opposite of sleek. It’s true that its plastic, angular exterior devoid of elegant curves and small design touches is quite rough, but it’s also very functional. You can hold the tablet with just one hand without feeling even the slightest hint of discomfort. And that’s great because a small tablet like this begs to become a part of your everyday carry. \nAmazon offers the Fire HD 6 in five different colors—black, citron, cobalt, magenta, white—but you can customize the look of the tablet even further using third-party cases, such as the Fire HD 6 Slim Case from Nupro. \nThe tablet your regular assortment of ports and buttons, including a microUSB 2.0 that allows you to connect the tablet to an HDTV or VGA monitor, and charge the tablet using the included power adapter. Located on the top side of the tablet is a 3.5 mm stereo jack, and an integrated speaker with Dolby Digital Plus sits at the bottom side of the tablet. Performance \nBefore we dive into all the nitty gritty technical details, let us just say that the Fire HD 6 performs sufficiently well for what the tablet is designed to do. Sometimes a magazine takes a few extra seconds to load, and 1 GB of memory isn’t enough to have several demanding apps opened at the same time, but it’s hard to complain about such minor issues when the tablet costs less than $100. \nOnce you open your app of choice and the fast quad-core processor with clock speeds of up to 1.5 GHz fully kicks in, you’ll quickly forget that you are holding an entry-level device. Amazon’s heavily customized version of Android KitKat is not only very easy to use, but it’s also highly efficient. \nThe 6″ IPS LCD   1280×800 pixels displays vibrant colors that look as intended even when viewed from a sharp angle. To keep your eyes healthy and your sleep restful, you can activate a specialized filter that automatically minimizes blue light based on local sunrise and sunset times. Features \nAmazon’s take on the Android operating system heavily focuses on content consumption and keeps in mind the needs of all family members. Parents can use the tablet’s parental controls to restrict access to inappropriate content, and children can enjoy over 10,000 kid-friendly titles with FreeTime Unlimited, an all-in-one subscription that brings together books, games, educational apps, movies, and TV shows. \nThose who want even more content are encouraged to subscribe to Amazon’s unlimited plans for music and ebooks. Amazon Prime members get a small discount on all plans, making them even more attractive. What Users Like",

      "text": "VIDEO???\nAmazon is taking new steps to help sellers battle counterfeiters in its online marketplace, according to a news report.\nThe e-commerce giant is testing a new set of digital tools called Brand Central to help merchants prevent other sellers from copying and selling their products, tech news site CNET reported on Tuesday.\nIn recent months, Amazon's AMZN marketplace, which sells everything from toilet paper to Mickey Mouse t-shirts to exercise equipment, has come under fire for counterfeit items. CNBC reported earlier this year that counterfeit items sold by third-party sellers--many of whom are China-based--are an increasing problem.\nAccording to the report, Amazon has been \"courting\" more Chinese manufacturers, raising the risk of more counterfeit merchandise in its marketplace. Because of this, some sellers are losing trust in the marketplace and are even complaining of a loss in sales.\nApple recently said that many of Apple-branded chargers for smartphones and laptops sold on Amazon are fake, for instance. Amazon is an authorized reseller of Apple products.\nFor more on Amazon, watch this:\n\nIn response, Amazon started in August to impose steeper fees and require additional paperwork from suspicious sellers. The fees, which ranged from $1,000 to $1,500, were assessed to sellers who sold counterfeit items. A few weeks ago, Amazon also filed its first lawsuits against sellers who allegedly sold counterfeit goods on the site. The company, which says it invests tens of millions of dollars annually to combat sales of bogus items, employs a team of software engineers, research scientists, program managers, and investigators to root out counterfeits.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nAccording to CNET, the new anti-counterfeit tool will help sellers protect their trademarked goods and ensure that the source of the items they sell is legitimate.\nAmazon is likely trying to ensure that sellers don’t flee its marketplace during the holiday season, its busiest time of year. It must reassure sellers that they are not at risk of losing sales to competitors selling fakes at lower prices. According to a CNBC report, Forearm Forklift, a seller of exercise equipment, saw annual revenue plunge 30% since 2008 because of competition from fakes on Amazon. Amazon is also trying to send a message to shoppers that everything they buy is authentic.\nAmazon isn’t the only e-commerce giant to deal with counterfeit problems. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has also struggled with fake items. Specifically, Alibaba's flagship e-commerce marketplace Taobao, has been known for selling counterfeit goods.\nAmazon did not respond for a request for comment.",

      "title": "'The Grand Tour' Sets Streaming Record For Amazon",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon’s ‘The Grand Tour’ Sets Streaming Record Amazon’s new show The Grand Tour is already breaking records after just one episode. The show was Amazon’s most watched premiere, the company announced Monday, taking the No. 1 spot from the record-breaking debut of its series The Man in the High Castle. Millions of Prime members streamed the first episode of Grand Tour in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan, the company said , without revealing an exact number of viewers. Other than a successful debut, Amazon also sold a record number of Prime memberships on Friday. According to the company, Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days, with the exception of its annual Prime Day. The increase was thanks to a one-day price cut of its annual Prime membership fee from $99 to $79—a price that saved new members about 20%. The show’s success is great news for the e-commerce giant, especially because it reportedly cost the company around $160 million to acquire, according to CNBC . However, Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos said this number is most likely low—instead suggesting it was “about a quarter of a billion dollars.” “The guys are back, doing what they do best—the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard, and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining,” said Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon amzn , in the press release. He continued: “Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.” Episode two of the 12-week series will be available on Amazon Prime this Friday, the company said.",

(Courtesy of Carnival Cruise Lines) Trending Now Big Agent-Only Cyber Monday Sale From MLT and Delta Vacations Travel Agent \nTo prepare for Black Friday, Carnival Cruise Line has joined forces with Amazon.com to offer customers an exclusive deal on cruise bookings. \nAs part of the pre-Black Friday deal, the first 1,150 customers who click through Carnival’s advertisement on Amazon and book a Carnival cruise between Nov. 21 and 23 will receive an Amazon Echo Dot. \nBy clicking the Carnival display ad on Amazon.com, customers will be redirected to a dedicated page on the Carnival Cruise Line website where travelers book voyages that must be taken between March 2017 and April 2019. \nThe bookings handled through the Amazon.com website will be coded so the cruisers receive the perks and travel professionals still receive commission if their clients book the offer through them. The voyages must be paid in full at the time of booking to qualify for the incentives. \n“Amazon has a huge audience with the potential to introduce thousands of new consumers to the world of cruising, so being one of the first cruise lines to work with them for a Black Friday promotion opens a world of possibilities,” Carnival Cruise Line president Christine Duffy said in a statement. “Both Carnival and Amazon offer an exceptional range of options and experiences in music, food, family and entertainment, which makes this an exciting collaboration.” \nFor those unaware of what an Amazon Echo Dot is or how they work, it is a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, set alarms and more. \nWith a retail value of $49.99, receiving an Amazon Echo Dot for booking a vacation is the perfect way to save money on a gift while also treating yourself this holiday season. \nThe partnership between Carnival and Amazon is part of Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotional line up for both companies. For more information on the offer, check out the official website of Carnival Cruise Line.",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nI've long touted Ford Credit as a huge competitive advantage for the automaker, as it's roughly double the size of General Motors Financial (GMF) and generates more pre-tax income for Ford than any business region outside of North America; it's expected to account for $1.8 billion of Ford's 2016 total $10.2 billion pre-tax result. Unfortunately, it appears that lower used vehicle values at auctions are now spreading into nearly all vehicle segments. \nImage source: Ford Motor Company's \"Let's Chat\" presentation . \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nThesedeclining values are causing Ford Credit to reduce its guidance for 2017. This year, it should manage to reach its $1.8 billion pre-tax guidance. Next year, however, Ford Credit is lowering its guidance by $300 million down to $1.5 billion. \nFor context on Ford Credit, it's worth recalling that back in 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, it posted an operating income loss of $2.5 billion. What investors might be surprised to know, however, is that the majority of those losses were due to a $2.1 billion impairment charge on its operating lease portfolio due to slumping used vehicle auction values sound familiar? \nIn short, Ford Credit is a great profit generator and a competitive advantage ... until the one year it isn't, such as during the first year of a recession. I'm sure Ford has learned from the recent past to some degree, but there's no way for it to totally de-risk this scenario when so many vehicles are leased and auction values drop. That's definitely something investors need to keep in mind going forward. Global pensions take a hit, too \nLet's start with an easy rule of thumb, without getting into the nitty gritty details: When discount rates move lower, pension liabilities move higher. That leads to annual volatility in pension plans' funding status. Many investors overlook the degrees to which pensions are underfunded, but as recently as 2012, Ford's plan was underfunded by nearly $19 billion -- a higher obligation than its automotive debt! \nSince then, though, Ford has taken huge steps to de-risk its strategy by pouring billions into its pension fund, but it's value is going to take a hit due to discount rates declining this year. How much, you ask? Ford estimates that its total pension OPEB remeasurement loss will check in at roughly $3 billion. That will move its global status down about 100 basis points to 95% funded. \nWhat I want to point out, though, is that only about $100 million of that $3 billion decline will happen within Ford's U.S. pension plan because it has taken such huge steps to de-risk it -- for this exact reason. Meanwhile, its non-U.S. pension plan, which is driven by U.K. and Germany, will be responsible for about $1.6 billion of the remeasurement loss. Investor takeaway \nUltimately, an underfunded pension could have been a way bigger deal than it was, and Ford's overall funded status remaining around 95% is still excellent in the grand scheme of things. These takeaways aren't something that should change your investment thesis on Ford, but they're something to keep in mind when comparing Ford with other automakers and worth keeping track of year-to-year.. \n10 stocks we like better than Ford When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Photo via Amazon (CC-BY-SA) If you have a PS4 and a $10 bill, you're in luck. \nGamers are all about digital copies of their games these days rather than physical, but sometimes the latter pays off in savings. Like right now, for Black Friday. \nTom Clancy's The Division still retails for $49.99 if you buy it digitally. But if you can deign to be seen with a physical copy, Amazon has it for $9.99 for Playstation 4 and Xbox One . Rated four and a half out of five stars by yours truly, The Division places you in the role of an agent that must save what's left of society destroyed by smallpox. Lauded for its excellent multiplayer, this is an ideal game to play online with a group of friends who enjoy the possibilities of a gritty, post-apocalyptic world.",

      "text": "Data Dive | Tue Nov 22, 2016 | 1:24pm EST Data Dive: Amazon's opportunity in live sports By Jillian Harding \nAmazon's bet on live sports is anything but a slam dunk. The rights to major sports are mostly locked up by traditional media – the broadcast networks, ESPN and smaller regional sports networks and DirecTV. But there's an opportunity for Amazon in smaller leagues like soccer and lacrosse. Graphiq ID: fwkYH6zZGG9 \nNetflix, Hulu, Amazon and HBO To Go are all cutting into traditional media's revenue with original movies and TV series as well as an ample offering of Hollywood movies and older series. Sports, to this point, has been the one advantage broadcast, cable and satellite have had over the newcomers. Sports made up 93 of the top 100 live-viewed TV programs in 2015, according to media research group Nielsen. \nMedia sports rights are expected to be worth $21.3 billion in 2020 from $16.3 billion last year, according to a report by PWC. Adding to that, the firm estimates sports advertising on television will grow by 62.5 percent over the next five years (pg. 294). \nMajor sporting events, such as the Olympics or the Super Bowl are big kahunas, and networks are holding on tight; consider NBC’s contract to keep the Olympics through 2032, or the traditional media's hold on the NFL through 2022. \nBut tapping into a broader range of niche assets such as Major League Soccer and Major League Lacrosse could be lucrative. As a recent report from research firm Deloitte notes , \"The real beneficiaries of this disruptive new technology are smaller properties, whose avid fan bases are underserved by linear broadcast and cable TV.\" \n",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nPilots with a cargo airline that flies routes for customers including Amazon.com went on strike Tuesday, a decision that could create hiccups for the Seattle e-commerce giant during the critical holiday shopping season. \nSome 250 pilots employed by ABX Air aren’t flying their scheduled routes as they fight what they say are stressful working conditions and intentional understaffing, especially during the fourth quarter’s shopping frenzy. \nA statement by the striking pilots, who are members of Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, says the interruption could “have a significant impact” on deliveries by ABX Air customers, including Amazon. The pilots portray Amazon as a “major” customer of the air freighter, adding that Amazon customers will see “delays and disruptions.” \nIn March, Amazon inked a deal a deal with ABX Air’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group , to lease 20 airplanes in a dedicated air-cargo network connecting Amazon’s far-flung warehouses. ATSG is already flying 14 of those planes, or 35 flights a day, for Amazon, according to the pilots. The strike also affects DHL, for which ABX makes 45 flights a day.

Higher than anticipated demand last year resulted forced the company to scramble in order to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps. \nSince then, Amazon has invested billions in building new warehouses and changed the fee structure for its fulfillment service for independent merchants in order to avoid similar troubles this time around. \nAmazon has also invested heavily in creating an air force that would allow it to move items more quickly, especially for members of its Prime loyalty program, who pay $99 a year in exchange for guaranteed fast shipping and other perks. \nIn addition to the 20 planes Amazon has agreed to lease from ATSG, the “Prime Air” fleet is expected to also lease 20 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings. \nWilmington, Ohio-based ABX Air says it will seek a court order on Tuesday to enjoin the pilots to go back to work, even as it continues the talks with the union. “We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under the terms of our current labor agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in an emailed statement. \nHowever, customers are being notified of temporary interruptions in flight operations so they can adjust their shipping networks, Starkovich said. \nThe pilots say that their conflict with ABX Air’s management stems from the firm’s alleged refusal to recall pilots who were furloughed when DHL shuttered its North American hub in Wilmington in 2008.

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "Fake news sites are using Amazon to hire their writers Don't you dare call it \"reporting\". Save Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nIt appears that right wing websites that traffic in \"alt-right\" fake news are using Amazon's Mechanical Turk system to recruit writers to produce content for them. The Mechanical Turk platform is an \"odd-job board\" where companies can hire random folks from the internet to perform a variety of menial online tasks, like filling out surveys or transcribing audio. In this case, white supremacist outlet The Goldwater wants people to produce \"news\" articles for $5 a pop . \nThe advert, which has since been removed , requested that applicants write in the style of Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones and other white nationalist media personalities. \"At times, we may give you a conspiracy theory to write about. Roll with it,\" the post continues. \"You are a reporter now!\" Of course, regurgitating baseless conspiracy theories on the web doesn't make you a reporter any more than pouring water in a Cup-Noodle makes you a chef. These people aren't covering actual news, they're generating SEO fodder that pads the site's Google page rankings and provides a platform for banner ad sales -- which is why http://Google has recently taken steps to bar its adsense ads from running on such garbage sites. \nThis isn't the first time that The Goldwater has crowdsourced its writers. A similar ad for a post titled \"Predictable: First Lesbian Bishop of Stockholm Boots Out Christ and Welcomes Mohammed\" has already been published on the Goldwater website. And it certainly won't be the last. \n\"When objectionable HITs are posted, there is a link on the HIT for workers to report it to Amazon, but there is no follow up from Amazon with the worker on what action is taken, if any, Online labor \"advocate Rochelle LaPlante told Motherboard . \"I reported the HITs last night using that report button, but there's no way for me to know if Amazon saw and removed it before it was completed by workers, or if Amazon has taken any action against the requester's account.\" ",

      "text": "| Topic: Security Image: File photo \nNEW YORK -- Emma Moore could have been the health and weight loss guru you spent your life looking for. \nYou might be forgiven for not knowing her work -- after all, she has a common name, one that she shares with other similarly successful authors on Amazon. Until this week, she had dozens of health, dieting, cooking, and weight loss ebooks to her name. She published over a dozen ebooks on Amazon this year -- five ebooks alone this month. And Moore would even work with other authors -- like Nina Kelly, Andrew Walker, and Julia Jackson -- who have all published about a dozen ebooks each this year as well. \nHere's the snag: to our knowledge, Moore doesn't exist. None of them do. \nMoore was just one of hundreds of pseudonyms employed in a sophisticated \"catfishing\" scheme run by Valeriy Shershnyov, whose Vancouver-based business hoodwinked Amazon customers into buying low-quality ebooks, which were boosted on the online marketplace by an unscrupulous system of bots, scripts, and virtual servers. \nCatfishing isn't new -- it's been well documented . Some scammers buy fake reviews, while others will try other ways to game the system. \nUntil now, nobody has been able to look inside at how one of these scams work -- especially one that's been so prolific, generating millions of dollars in royalties by cashing in on unwitting buyers who are tricked into thinking these ebooks have some substance. \nShershnyov was able to stay in Amazon's shadows for two years by using his scam server conservatively so as to not raise any red flags. \nWhat eventually gave him away weren't customer complaints or even getting caught by the bookseller. It was good old-fashioned carelessness. He forgot to put a password on his server. Inside the scam \nShershnyov is a former engineer turned \"entrepreneur\". \nHe spent a little over 10 years working as a software development engineer for various companies, including Microsoft. He went on to co-found a startup, Alteroxity, which claims to help authors publish ebooks that are already \"done for you\" -- that includes the writing, the creation, the publishing, and even \"dozens of honest positive reviews\". \nThe company appears genuine, according to public records , but its main source of sales is Shershnyov's catfishing scheme. To date, it's generated over $3 million in revenue. \nAlteroxity's other co-founder, Alex Gorov, doesn't exist. Until recently, Gorov purported to offer an online course promising to spill secrets on what he learned \"from publishing over 2,000 titles on Kindle\". We later found that the photo on Alteroxity's website was taken from a stock image site . \nWe were left to conclude that Shershnyov was the sole organizer of the scam. \nFor two years, Shershnyov has run a powerful and complex database, which was hosted on an Azure instance by Microsoft. \nThat database, found by the MacKeeper Security Research Center , was the brains behind the scam, but it was left open for anyone to peek in -- if they knew where to look. MacKeeper security researchers did just that, sparking our investigation, which led to Shershnyov's scam unravelling. \nHere's what we found. \nAn example of one of the fake Amazon accounts used to log in to download books. (Screenshot: ZDNet) \nEach of the 18 tables in the database plays an important role in the scam. \nOver the past two years, the database has stored data on 1,453 low-quality ebooks. Most have been written in just a few days for a few dollars, covering topics that are extremely mundane or flat-out bizarre: anything from an ebook on understanding non-verbal communications, to a guide on how to stop procrastinating, and even a boxset on herbal, homemade antibiotic lotions. Each book was hastily written and littered with spelling and grammatical mistakes. \nThese books were associated with a publisher's email account used to collect royalties on all the ebook and physical books that were sold. (Shershnyov used his own personal email address, along with other accounts.) Each account was responsible for publishing hundreds of ebooks. If one account was caught or disabled, it wouldn't upend the entire scheme. \nThese accounts worked together to artificially inflate the number of ebooks downloaded, thus raising the ranking of each ebook in Amazon's charts. That visibility helped to draw in real readers. \nThe server hosted a table containing 83,899 fake Amazon accounts (an easy feat given that, when we checked, Amazon doesn't verify email accounts). At any given time of the day, dozens of those accounts could be pushed through one of over 200 proxy servers -- provided by a third-party internet company -- which makes it harder for Amazon to detect the logins. The server installed the Selenium web driver, a browser automation tool, which simulates a real person typing in the accounts' usernames and passwords, one after the other. \nNot all logins will be successful. Some are blocked or banned. If that happens, the table would log the the failure, and move on to the next account. \nThe fake accounts would download hundreds of these ebooks over a short period of time -- usually a few hours. Each promoted ebook can be offered for free for a short period of time, allowing the downloads to run at no additional cost. Free books don't generate royalties, but they do help to raise an ebook's visibility in the Amazon charts. \nAn author who didn't want to be named for the story said that the visibility can drive paid sales, earning the publisher money. \n\"Once a book is visible on Amazon due to being free it can benefit from increased interest. That increased interest and visibility doesn't just go away once the book goes back to its original price,\" explained the author. \nThis list contains all the data on hundreds of ebooks used in the scheme. (Screenshot: ZDNet) \nThe downloads would be tunneled over the Tor anonymity network, masking the IP addresses of the server, making it tougher for Amazon's systems to spot the fraudulent downloads. \nIt can take just a few days for an ebook to rise up the charts and increase visibility -- these books can easily reach the Top 100 list, particularly in niche categories. \nThat visibility could drive dozens of genuine downloads per day. Some reach the hundreds of sales, which can drive thousands of dollars in royalties. Imagine that on a far larger, automated scale -- and those royalties begin to add up. Millions in months \nThere are a lot of four-letter words to describe Shershnyov. One springs to mind: \"rich\". \nOn a small scale, each ebook can generate anything from a few cents to hundreds of dollars over the course of its life span -- until Amazon figures out that the book is a fraud. Fraudulent books get pulled offline quickly but often reappear under a different title, cover, and author's name. SECURITY ",

      "text": "Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping About 250 people on strike, grounding dozens of flights ASSOCIATED PRESS Nov. 22, 2016 | Updated 3:07 p. m. \nASSOCIATED PRESS Print \nWILMINGTON, Ohio — Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike today, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline’s president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company’s labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company’s shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading. They have nearly doubled in price in the past 12 months. Related Items:",

      "title": "Behold China’s Answer to Amazon Echo: The LingLong DingDong",
      "text": "Review: Amazon Tap \nThe DingDong, which costs the equivalent of $118, provides news, weather, and stock updates. It answers questions, manages schedules, provides directions, and plays music and audiobooks. It is the first product from Beijing LingLong Co., a $25 million joint venture between JD.com, China’s largest online retailer, and voice recognition powerhouse iFlytek. \nThe gadget weighs about 3 pounds and stands 9.5 inches tall. It is circular at the top and square on the bottom, and available in white, red, black, and purple. The shape symbolizes tiānyuán dìfāng —the notion that “heaven is round, Earth is square,” a concept that Liu says is central to LingLong’s design language. The colors also are imbued with meaning; white is associated with purity, and red with prosperity. \nThree commands wake the device: DingDong DingDong, Xiaowei Xiaowei (a girl’s nickname), and BaiLing BaiLing (skylark). The DingDong comes in Mandarin and Cantonese versions (the engines required to understand the languages are too complex to include them both in one device). Most people speak Mandarin, and the myriad accents and dialects present a Herculean challenge. Still, the company claims the DingDong understands roughly 95 percent of the population. \nIf the DingDong sounds a lot like the Echo, that’s by design. Although work on the DingDong was well underway when the Echo arrived in 2014, engineers at LingLong took a long look at Amazon’s digital assistant. “Their launch influenced us a lot,” Liu says. No one at the company could get one, so they gleaned what they could from marketing materials and info online. \n“It is a challenge to do on the R&D side,” says Lv Fang, head of sales and marketing. Even now, the product has a few kinks—some customers are having trouble connecting to Wi-Fi. \nSo far, customers primarily use the DingDong for music, drawing on a library of about 3 million songs. The limited feature set won’t change without far broader third-party support. “Echo is really great in this area,” Liu said. “[We have] 10 services like that, but Amazon announced that they have 4,000. It’s really a big gap.” To close that gap, the company recently made a voice service platform available to developers, and is offering tech support and other incentives to bring them aboard. \nAlthough the DingDong can play any number of Chinese music, dramas, and the like, it was flummoxed by a request for Beyoncé when saying her name in English. It couldn’t provide a stock quote for JD.com because it is listed on the NASDAQ, not in China. And it can only provide one response per question or command. But the company plans to incorporate artificial intelligence to make DingDong smarter. \nIt also hopes to work with other companies to sharpen DingDong’s skills. Beyond creating a robust ecosystem of developers, LingLong is offering its technology to other smart speaker manufacturers. And it hopes to work with Amazon to introduce DingDong to Alexa—and vice-versa. “If they want to sell the Echo in China, maybe they will use our voice engine,” Fang says. \nIn fact, LingLong might be Jeff Bezos’s best chance to crack that market. “China is kind of a lost opportunity for these companies,” says Ashutosh Sharma, research director at Forrester. “China is very protective, it’s not as open as India is. The Chinese government also places a lot of requirements.” Alexa could work with DingDong to make inroads where Amazon alone cannot. So Alexa might one day speak Chinese after all.",

      "text": "WILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear.\nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots.\nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union.\nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract.\nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration.\nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike.\nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment.\nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing.\nThe company's shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading. They have nearly doubled in price in the past 12 months.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "Grow Your Business Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading.

      "text": "Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear.\nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots.\nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union.\nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract.\nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration.\nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike.\nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment.\nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing.\nThe company's shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading. They have nearly doubled in price in the past 12 months.\nAssociated Press",

ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading.

      "text": "Okay seriously, this is just aggravating. We love hunting down killer deals to help BGR readers save money on all sorts of gear, but all that hunting means we sometimes end up finding deals on items we recently purchased ourselves. The Samsung UN55KU6600 Curved 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV launched in April at just over $1,300, and we got it at a great price when we bought it a few months ago for around $1,000. Well... Amazon's killer pre-Black Friday sale drops the price of this great curved UHD TV to just $647.99. It's actually priced at $747.99, but that price includes a free $100 Amazon gift card. And with Black Friday fast approaching, you know you'll be spending that $100 at Amazon soon anyway.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nT-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 HTC just unveiled one of the best Android phones of 2016, but you can’t have one ",

      "text": "Mobile Apps Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading. They have nearly doubled in price in the past 12 months.  ",

      "text": "Good afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for checking out this week’s edition of Swerve. Before we break for Thanksgiving, here’s your latest helping of news and musings on AT&T Inc. T, +2.19% Time Warner Inc. TWX, +0.84% and on what’s happening in the media industry as a whole. Plus, the latest news from President-elect Donald Trump. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media .\nBroken promises: President-elect Donald Trump made a lot of promises during his more than 18-month run to win the White House. He’s walked back several of those, including the scale of his planned border wall, the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and the plan to prosecute rival Hillary Clinton. Trump also promised he would straight up block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. His campaign said he “would never approve such a deal.” But as Recode reporter April Glaser writes , the advisers Trump tapped to oversee the FCC and Justice Department transitions “have a history of being very pro-industry and anti-regulation, particularly when it comes to mergers.”\nJeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, who are helping with the FCC transition, argued in favor of AT&T’s proposed, but ultimately failed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011. And Eisenach said consolidation was the best thing that could happen in the cable business when Comcast was considering a Time Warner takeover in 2013.\nAngry bird: Donald Trump made sure the world knew his feelings about the “highly overrated” Broadway hit “Hamilton” and its cast ’s message to his Vice President Mike Pence last weekend. Trump took to Twitter again on Tuesday to vent about the New York Times. And not for the first time.\nI cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 Trump met with — and gave an earful to — executives and anchors from the country’s five biggest TV networks on Monday, according to CNN Money . Trump reportedly vented about media coverage, but also committed to improving media access. On Tuesday he was set to meet with the New York Times, but canceled after incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus urged him to , according to Times reporter Sydney Ember. Priebus was allegedly concerned Trump would face questions he wasn’t prepared to answer. The meeting was eventually rescheduled. Times staffers posted updates throughout the duration of the meeting, which you can read here .\nThe dark side: Donald Trump’s new chief strategist Steve Bannon sat down with Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter to talk about plotting “an entirely new political movement.” Bannon, who is the former news chief of controversial alt-right news site Breitbart, has been slammed since his appointment for being a white nationalist. He told Wolff:\n“Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they [liberals and the media] get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.”\nAmazon’s Hail Mary: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.68% really wants to get into streaming sports. And any sport will do. Wall Street Journal reporter Shalini Ramachandran, citing sources, writes that Amazon has been in talks with the NBA, MLB, NFL and even lacrosse and surfing leagues for the rights to carry live games. Live sports are the last frontier in streaming TV, as one of the few things forcing fans to keep their cable TV subscription. The NFL and Twitter signed a deal to live stream Thursday Night Football games.\nTeam up: The two biggest fantasy sports sites, DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Inc., have agreed to set aside their differences and merge, as they both struggle with regulatory and legal challenges to their core business, writes Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Berzon .\nFOMO: Claire Atkinson at the New York Post reports that Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.04% network ABC is exploring the possibility of a 24-hour news digital news channel.\nForce to be reckoned with: Disney’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” set for its North American release on Dec. 16, is tracking for a massive $150 million box office debut, according to The Hollywood Reporter .\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "Bounce Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike was illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 28 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $16.40 in afternoon trading. They have nearly doubled in price in the past 12 months.  ",

      "text": "Idol 4S \nSkipped the Alcatel Idol 4S because of its price? Now’s the time to put this phone back into consideration. \nWhile select retailers are offering the phone for $399, Amazon just went live with a product listing featuring the Idol 4S for $349. The price is lower because it doesn’t include the virtual reality headset (that doubles as the packaging) or an Incipio case. But that’s not to say this Amazon-only offer carries no value. The Idol 4S is perfectly capable on its own, and for $349 you’re also getting JBL earbuds, a Quick Charge-ready charger, and a tempered glass screen protector. It should be enough value to most prospective buyers. \nHead over to Amazon right now and you can get the Alcatel Idol 4S for $349 with free two-day shipping if you’re a Prime member. Only 11 units are in stock at the time of this post being published, so you might miss out on a good holiday gift for you or someone else by waiting. \nBuy it now: Amazon About the Author: Justin Herrick \nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Justin is a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University where he studied marketing with a focus on digital marketing.

      "text": "Comment Amazon.com \nI am quite sure that many of us are already gearing up for Black Friday this year, as many retailers are kicking off their Black Friday deals this November 24th at 6 p.m. onward. After all, it is one of the rare times throughout the year where you will be able to enjoy relatively decent bargains on items that you might want. Amazon themselves are an exceptional electronic retailer, and have changed the fulfilment landscape to boot. This time around, it seems that Amazon wants Black Friday not only to be just a few days going all the way through to Cyber Monday, as they might be looking at an entire month of sales. \nYes sir, you read that right -- a whole month of sales. Amazon started their 35 straight days of Black Friday deals from this week onward, allowing bargain hunters to obtain some of the stuff that they would like to have without having to break the bank -- at these deals will be long running, meaning they are around for a decent amount of time before Thanksgiving, going all the way after it. It seems that Amazon is working on releasing a new deal up to every five minutes, all the way until December 22nd. That would be three days before Christmas, and it ought to help you heave a sigh of relief knowing that there would still be opportunities to enjoy discounts on last minute purchases then to save your bacon. \nIt is touted that some of the best deals available from Amazon will happen during the “Turkey Five” period, which happens to be the five days that fall between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. You can be sure that a huge range of this will be diversified , where some of them will end up as toys, while electronics ought to see a fair amount of action, not to mention opportunities to enhance your fashion wardrobe on the cheap. \nYou will be able to check out the full list of Black Friday deals from Amazon over here . Feel free to play around with the settings as well as parameters, ranging from price to the percentage of discount. With millions of items available on Amazon, you would surely have plenty of choices to pick from, and the fact that customer reviews are there to help will go to some great lengths in making sure that you would be able to have an inkling of an idea on what you would be getting right before clicking on the \"Purchase\" button. \nAlternatively, you can also keep a keen eye out on Amazon's Cyber Monday deals through this particular page . Some of the other methods to keep tabs on the latest deals made available to the masses would be to being a regular on Today's Deals , where you can then keep track of the Deal of the Day and today's Lightning Deals. Alternatively, how about signing up for deals through daily emails , ensuring that you know what's tomorrow's Deal of the Day? Other methods include following social media accounts like Facebook in order to glean the most recent -- and more importantly, official piece of information. ",

So, women – do you have a hard time shopping for the man in your lives? I do!! My husband doesn’t buy himself much, and I’m always wanting to know what exactly he wants. I try to take note if he ever says he wants something, but it’s usually something so outrageously expensive, that it’s not even an option to buy. Ya know… like the new Tesla that has a $100K price tag. Yeah – that’s not happening. Over the years, I realized my husband just has expensive taste, which is why he never buys himself anything. Even though he likes expensive things, I have found a few of those less expensive items that he was excited to get for Christmas or for his birthday… or just because. I’ve compiled this list with those items and have collected a few more ideas after asking some of the men in my family some of the “smaller” things they’d like to receive as gifts. We know every man is different, but I’d love to hear some of the gift ideas you are planning to get them. I think we could all use as much help as possible, so the more ideas the better!! Here are some of the BEST Gifts for Him… BEST GIFTS FOR HIM",

      "title": "Striking pilots may crimp Amazon’s and DHL’s holiday package deliveries",
      "text": "November 22, 2016, 12:35 PM Striking pilots may crimp Amazon’s and DHL’s holiday package deliveries By Bloomberg News ABX Air, the contractor for Amazon Air, will ask a judge to force striking pilots back to work. \n(Bloomberg)—ABX Air, which flies packages for Amazon.com Inc. and DHL Worldwide Express, plans to ask a judge to force striking pilots back to work and thwart a threat to disrupt deliveries during the holiday shopping season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc. , are striking to protest alleged staffing shortages at the cargo carrier. ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon, No. 1 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. Some flights were grounded. \nThe action comes as the retail industry gears up for its busiest period and shoppers increasingly shun bricks-and-mortar stores and shop from their phones and computers instead. Online spending in November and December will increase 11% this year to $91.6 billion, according to an October forecast from Adobe Systems Inc. \n“While they go through this court process, planes are not flying,” said Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting Group . “Obviously that is of concern to a company like DHL and Amazon.” But he said Amazon can shift some volume to United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. and can also find some smaller contract parcel shippers to move packages if needed. \nThe pilots are picketing outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe union says ABX Air is violating its contract by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments—preventing them from taking time off—because it doesn’t have enough pilots to meet the growing demands of companies like Amazon. The world’s biggest online retailer in March announced plans to lease 20 Boeing 767 freighters from ATSG to help it move inventory around the country. \nAmazon said in an emailed statement that it works with a variety of carriers and is confident in its ability to serve customers. DHL said by email that “due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today.” \nPilot strikes in the U.S. are rare due to the Railway Labor Act, a 90-year-old federal law intended to prevent labor disputes from disrupting commerce. And when strikes do occur they often don’t last very long because the company can ask a judge to intervene with a temporary restraining order until the court decides if the strike is legal. On rare occasions, if a dispute substantially threatens essential transportation in the country, the U.S. president could get involved. \nATSG said it will seek a court order Tuesday to “restore the status quo operating environment,” while it continues discussions with union representatives. \n“Hopefully, sane minds will prevail and we’ll get things back to normal operations today,” said Quint Turner, chief financial officer for ABX parent ATSG. The company’s second airline, Air Transport International, is operating and will take steps to accommodate any extra demands caused by the pilot strike, he said. \nThe pilots say their strike is allowed because of the contract violations, and voted to authorize a walkout in May. \n“For the past two years, we’ve been warning them that they are dangerously short on pilots,” said Rick Ziebarth, 59, who’s been with ABX for 39 years. “The lifestyle of our crews have really taken a nosedive. I can’t tell you how many birthdays, anniversaries and even funerals pilots can’t attend as a result of these emergency assignments.” \nPilots on Amazon runs fly night and day from Wilmington to Dallas to Stockton, Calif., to Rockford, Ill., and back to Wilmington—sometimes with nowhere to rest but the cockpit, Ziebarth said. Such routes can increase fatigue because of rotations between night and day, he said. Pilots are willing to make accommodations for customers but want the company to abide by its contract by honoring vacation time and regulating emergency assignments, he said. \nAmazon’s air cargo operation is part of efforts to reduce its dependence on UPS and FedEx, as it expands a $99-a-year Prime membership service that can deliver orders in as little as a day. In addition to ATSG, Amazon in May entered into an agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. to acquire and operate 20 Boeing Co. 767-300 freighters. \nA dedicated fleet helps Amazon shuffle inventory around the country more efficiently to meet demand spikes, while reducing the inventory it has to carry nationally. \nThe ABX strike underscores how a national pilot shortage could hinder Amazon’s air cargo aspirations. Its logistics partners have to compete for pilots with UPS, FedEx and passenger carriers that pay better wages and offer better benefits. That’s a different game than filling warehouses with temporary workers because pilots require years of training, especially for big aircraft, said Matt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics in Golden, Colo. \n“I don’t think Amazon has encountered a problem like the pilot shortage before and it doesn’t have a quick and easy solution,” Barton said. “A lot of these carriers are going to have a hard time finding the pilots they need.\" Topics",

      "text": "Employment and Internship Opportunities Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nNeither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday. They have gained 86 percent in the past 12 months. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

Quite a few of the big ticket things we've been raving about this last year are slowly joining it. I'm sure the actual week leading up to Black Friday will be crazy, but right now a bunch of things are already super cheap.\n\nNightmare Moon up there for example is only $14! Suddenly I feel bad for paying $25 at Gamestop.\n\nAnyway, almost ALL of the major items can be found below, but you can dig through the entire pony section over here . It will keep adding new sale items over time I'm sure.\n\nExpect more Black Friday coverage as we get closer. Please send anything else you see! \n\nRead more » ",
