      "text": "Shane Laros posted on November 09, 2016 | | The Carr-E robot was developed as a personal mobility solution. (Image courtesy of Ford.) Every year, the Ford Motor Company encourages its employees to submit innovative ideas that could change the world. Some reach this lofty goal, while others are merely entertaining. \nOne of the top ideas out of Germany for 2016 is the Carr-E, a spare-tire-sized personal mobility solution designed for the “last mile” - from your car to the office door, for example. \nDesigned by Kilian Vas, a Ford systems engineer, the Carr-E can transport people or objects up to 120 kg, with a range of 22 kilometres (14 miles) and a top speed of 18 km/h (11 mph). It can be used to transport heavy items, as the device will follow an electronic transmitter the user can carry with them. \nThis wasn’t the only mobility solution imagined this year, with other finalists emerging from the 633 entrants in the category. \nOther entrants included the TriCiti, a ridable device that can be adapted to carry items or folded down to ride on public transport or stored in a vehicle. The TriCiti has a range of 30 kilometres (19 miles) and a top speed of 20 km/h (12 mph). \nAnother invention, the eChair, is a lightweight electric wheelchair able to load itself into a car, designed to offer greater independence to people with reduced mobility. \n“We really need to reinvent the wheel, to find new approaches to mobility,” said Vas. \n“When developing the Carr-E, I was inspired by Ford’s expansion into both an auto and a mobility company, but I’m also aware of how rapidly cities are growing and how getting around urban areas will become progressively more complicated. I really wanted to create a device that makes commuting easier and more fun.” Breakdown of the Carr-E. (Image courtesy of Ford.) Ford received numerous employee submissions in 2016, and is expecting to break the company record from 2015 of 6,000. Many of the submissions come from engineers throughout the company’s worldwide employee base. \n“Innovation and disruption is as much at the heart of how our engineers think now, as it was when Henry Ford first set about transforming the way we move,” said Walter Pijls, supervisor, Innovation Management for Mobility, Ford of Europe. \n“Personal assistant devices can help people to cover the final kilometres of their journey quickly and easily, and to transport heavy objects they might not be able to carry.” \nMobility solutions are at the top of many people’s lists, but are not the only ideas being submitted.

      "text": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co <F.N>, which has endured scathing criticism from Donald Trump over its Mexican investments, on Wednesday congratulated him on his election victory and vowed to work with the president-elect.\n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country, and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said.\nTrump repeatedly said during the campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on Ford vehicles.\nFord shares dropped 2.6 percent to $11.18 on Wednesday.\nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs.\nAt his campaign kickoff speech in June 2015, Trump said he would call Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields to explain the \"bad news.\"\n\"Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax,\" Trump said then.\nEarlier this year, Ford said it will invest $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico.\nIn his final speech of the campaign early on Election Day in western Michigan, Trump returned to the theme. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant ... We're not going to lose your jobs anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\"\nLast month, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford noted the automaker has hired 26,000 and invested $12 billion in the United States since 2011.\nBill Ford was in India on Wednesday after the company announced it will invest 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said it will hire 3,000 people to staff the facility, which will be operational by early 2019.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)",

      "text": "—\nThe first Presidential election I remember with Ford v. Carter. In my 8-year-old mind, this was a no-brainer. On the one hand, there was Gerald Ford, the President of the United States. I loved the guy, for reasons that aren’t clear to me 40 years later, and I thought he was doing a fine job.\nOn the other hand, there was Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer from Georgia. Was this a joke? What on earth would make anyone think a peanut farmer should be President?\nI remember being furious when Carter defeated Ford.\nI see some parallels in this election. One the hand, there was Hillary Clinton, former FLOTUS, Senator, and Secretary of State, the most qualified yet most maligned, investigated and targeted for libel and slander candidate in the race, and arguably in history.\nOne the other hand, there was Donald Trump, a (predominantly failed) businessman, misogynist, xenophobe, and racist, the target of ongoing fraud investigations and the bringer of thousands of lawsuits. The least qualified candidate in the race, and arguably in history. He is everything our nation should stand against. What on earth would make anyone think this man should be President?\nThis time, I’m not furious. Last night as results rolled in, so did my anguish, and later, despondency.\nLast night, evil won.\nHatred won.\nFear won.\nMisogyny won.\nRacism won.\nHomophobia won.\nExclusion won.\nOthering won.\nAnd love lost.\nBut this is not the end. No, in fact, it is a new beginning. This battle may be over, but the war against oppression, the war for inclusion for everyone at the table of the American dream, that war wages on.\nIt is time, my friends, to roll up our sleeves and really get to work.\nThis work will be hard.\nThis work will be discouraging at times.\nThis work will be thankless at times.\nBut we cannot afford to assume someone else is going to do it. We cannot afford to think that love will magically prevail. We cannot afford to allow fear to deter us.\nLast night, I was terrified and hopeless and, frankly, suicidal.\nThis morning, I am strapping on my armor, lacing up my shit kicker boots, and mustering all the forgiveness and love and faith I can manage.\nThis morning, I am ready to fight for all that is America. This morning, I am ready to fight for love.\nJoin me. Because we are still stronger together.\n◊♦◊\n\nClick the red “Now What?” button above to join our #Stop Racism group.

Customers can also add some demands for customization. By Maisum Raza  20 PM EST Tag : ford , ford f-150 raptor , Ford Raptor , 2017 Sign Up for Newsletter This means you can contact your local Ford dealer for ordering information. The all-new Raptor is the truck that’s redefining off-road performance and attitude – (Photo : Ford (Official)) \nFord is one of the world's oldest known car companies. The name ford brings up a nostalgic sense of pride whenever it is spoken about. Their cars are known to be some of the best in the world. Now, they have come back with yet another one. \nThe Ford F-150 Raptor has been in the minds of truck fanatics for quite a bit now. Motor Trend really emphasizes on the end of the wait due to Ford's recent announcement of the pickup truck coming out in 2017. \nFord is apparently already starting mass production of the car and this means that people can start ordering it now. Advertisement \nThe concept of pre-ordering not only confirms that one will be the first batch of people to drive the beautiful piece of machinery, but it also insures a place for people who pre-order because if it comes out, the high demand may run the stocks dry. \nThe basic Raptor has 450 horsepower and is being deemed as a supertruck for its amazing power. The pricing is adequate and floats just under 50 thousand US Dollars. \nThe exterior of the truck, especially the front, has quite an intimidating look with very attractive headlights and a giant Ford logo out front that displays the beauty of Ford craftsmanship. \nHowever, Auto Blog mentions that there are various customization options. \nThe basic truck model will be USD 50,000, but there are many customizations to choose from which change the exterior, interior, and the power of the truck. If all the best ones are applied, the price shoots up to a total of USD 70,000. That is an almost 150% price increase. \nThat will not stop the public as Ford is claiming that 65% of the entire pre-building stock has been claimed already. \nTherefore, if anyone is interested in buying the car they should act fast.

      "text": "Email \nBountiful. \nThe 1932 Ford has become the quintessential hot rod, thanks to its good looks and the fact that the model year coincided with Ford’s release of a V8 engine in addition to the reliable four-cylinder. While highly coveted by enthusiasts, the Deuce’s scarcity has made them expensive. Consider: Ford produced about 15,000 roadsters in 1932, while close to a half million Model A roadsters came off Ford’s assembly lines from 1928 to 1931. \nSo original Model As, such as the car you see here, are easier to find and thereby represent a logical option for a hot rod with a traditional twist. Steve Green, the Canadian owner of this 1930 roadster, can attest to the fact. Having started a challenging ’32 Ford project, he ended up taking a break from it. “Nothing seemed to be going right with the five-window Deuce. So I shelved it for the time being. After a few months, I was getting the bug for building again and dragged out the 1930 roadster body I had in the shop. At first, I thought I would just weld in a few lower patch panels, get the shell squared up and back in shape. But everything was coming along so well that I decided I would just keep going and finish it up.” \nThe Mission, British Columbia, resident knows a thing or two about building hot rods, having tackled several other projects in the past, including a 1936 Ford pickup well-known north of the border. It came to be after he discovered a Californian milestone, an equally cool ’35 truck built by Rudy Rodriguez featured in a handful of magazines. “I first saw the ‘Rudy Truck,’ as everyone calls it, in 2003,” he remembers. “It looked awesome, a totally different way of interpreting hot rods for me. Stripped right down, heavy chop, shortened box and frame, and a flathead Ford engine. I immediately knew this look was for me.” \nSo Steve went to work to create his own “Rudy Truck,” armed with a magazine article and a few ideas. He bought an angle grinder and a MIG welder, learned how to use them, then cut the vintage Ford and stitched it all back together. It proved to be a steep learning curve, as he had little experience with such an ambitious construction, but it turned out great. \nAt about the same time, Steve came to appreciate era-correct traditional hot rods, thanks in part to the renowned Burbank Choppers car club. The club has a deep understanding of our hobby’s early days, with the members’ rides staying true to the period, often to the last nut and bolt. In turn, these same vehicles contribute to the “hot rodding edifice” by inspiring gearheads such as Steve Green, who says, “I became familiar with the cars from the Choppers as they were making headlines and getting a lot of ink in magazines. Their style and taste for period-correct hot rods really resonated with me.” He also read as much as he could find on early hot rods and the pioneers who built them. “It was new to me, and I was fascinated by it all.” \nIt was in 2011 that Steve set the frustrating coupe project aside and went to work on his A roadster, using an assortment of components gathered from all over the West Coast. He envisioned an era-correct hot rod with no compromise, though this type of build involves a certain level of historical knowledge, along with some serious commitment. \n“It took time to source all the period parts and collect the vintage speed equipment that has the right look and patina,” he explains. “The car had to look like it was built in the late ’30s or early ’40s. All the components came from swap meets here in British Columbia, as well as Washington State, Oregon, and even as far away as Pomona and Turlock in California. This hot rod really is just a sum of all its collected parts.” \nThe first item on the agenda called for repairing the shell and creating a new floor in the back, due to the reshaped Model A frame, kicked up 5 inches in the rear. He additionally formed the drip rails in the trunk. Don’t be misled: What you see here is genuine patina and not a faux finish. Better yet, the various pieces of tin display matching colors and the same level of weathering, though they are all clearcoated for protection. The body remains pretty much stock, save for the chopped windshield frame and stanchion posts. Steve then used the press at Flat-Nasty Customs and patiently punched more than 50 louvers in the hood tops, followed by 186 in the trunk lid. The same shop helped him drop an original ’32 Ford axle, using a homemade jig, very much in the spirit of hot rodding’s early days. \nOther alterations to the frame include the adaptation of a ’32 K-member, complemented with lengthened ’34 wishbones. During his parts hunting, Steve had the luck of finding an old chromed drag link (which he connected to an early Ford F-1 steering box), as well as a handful of ’40 Ford parts (brakes front and aft, gauges and housing). The pedal assembly incidentally comes from a ’34 Ford. One easy way to personalize a hot rod consist of mixing and matching headlights and their supports, with fenderless rides often relying on individual mounts. Some folks prefer using a dropped headlight bar, though Steve elected to adapt a stock-height ’32 bar, but mounted pretty low, a look made popular a few years ago by the Rolling Bones team on the East Coast. While stock Model A lights are used up front, more unusual Electroline N5 marker lights equip the rear. These could be found on trucks, travel trailers, and boats occasionally. A 1930 British Columbia license plate with a cool vintage topper complete the tail end of the vehicle. \nBuilding a ’40s-correct roadster usually calls for the use of a four-banger or a flathead V8. Steve chose the latter, in the shape of a 239ci ’39 Mercury engine with an interesting story. “It was pulled out of an old hot rod back in the ’60s to make room for a small-block Chevy. It then sat around untouched for more than four decades.” The motor was simply freshened up with new stainless valves, new rings, and a custom-ground camshaft. A handful of other components give some grunt to the old V8, starting with owner-made headers. The list continues with an ancient Echlin coil, which relies on a light bulb as a resistor and a brass heat sink. Other noteworthy goodies include a pair of Stromberg 97s chromed many moons ago, a crab-style Ford distributor, and a 6-volt generator. \nPonies then travel through a N.O.S. Hayes Racing clutch and a ’39 Ford gearbox, connected to a modified ’36 Ford driveshaft and Banjo with a 4.11 gear ratio. Among the inventive features of this project car, we should mention the custom electrical harness made from vintage cloth wiring salvaged from an old elevator. Finally, the driver side of the firewall displays a timeworn Mobilgas sticker that gave Steve some grief. “It was very delicate, and I tore it when trying to place it. So, I just made it work and clear-coated it. I was upset at first, but decided it looked cool anyway.” \nSteve found inspiration in the early pioneers of our scene when building his hot rod. “I would like to thank them, as well as the generosity of all my friends. I’ve learned a lot over the years and met a ton of great people.” The ’30 roadster has proven reliable and fun to drive, too, with a recent highlight including being part of the happy few who rode on Pismo Beach’s sand during The Race of Gentlemen. It allowed Steve to mingle with like-minded hot rodders, using a playground that our pioneers would have certainly approved, not far from the birthplace of our hobby. Does it get any better than this? The patchy paintjob, low slung Deuce headlight bar, and angled windshield, chopped 3-1/2 inches, contribute to the roadster’s sinister attitude. The ’30 body, from Washington State, proved in decent shape, simply requiring lower patch panels and fresh floor pans. Fake patina? No Sir, not on this puppy. What you see here is “enhanced Mother Nature rust brown with some original black,” as Steve describes it. With British Columbia’s climate being on the damp side, he keeps the metal from decaying by regularly using clearcoat and wax. The no-frills cockpit is home to a ’36 Ford steering wheel and a ’39 Ford shifter, which triggers a three-speed gearbox of the same origin. Steve additionally installed a unique shift knob, made by a good friend in high school back in the ’80s. We bet only a few readers will recognize the low-mounted seats as those out of a ’35 Chevy sedan. Or, what’s left of them when you remove the padding. Bolsters dressed with leather insure an acceptable level of comfort. The faded gauges and cluster left the Ford factory in a truck back in 1940. The V8 emblem to the right is an Art Deco-style badge found in Cad-LaSalle models—a gorgeous piece. Military surplus material often goes hand-in-hand with 1940s-style hot rods, as the equipment was cheap and plentiful after WWII. This gas mask pouch on the side of the cowl is a great touch: period correct and handy for storage, too. The trunk houses a 1960 VW Bus gas tank for no other reason than it was free and of the correct size. A pair of owner-made aluminum straps cushioned with military fabric keeps it in place. Under the floor hides a ’36 banjo rearend, along with its torque tube. Now featuring a compression ratio of 8:1, this 99T-style flathead V8 first motivated a Mercury back in 1939. The factory relieved block was bored 0.040 inches and is fitted with Grant piston rings, as well as a custom-ground 3/4-race Ford camshaft. Steve nickel plated the top of the vintage oil filter (known as a Kralinator Oil Conditioner) in, of all things, a Crock Pot. The process involved vinegar, some guitar strings, and a 6-volt battery! Topping an early Thickstun PM-7 high-rise intake manifold, the Stromberg 97 carbs keep debris at bay thanks to air cleaners of unknown origin found at a swap meet. Our resourceful owner added pot scrubbers underneath to serve as filters. “Made in Canada” aluminum heads? Yes, they came as standard equipment on many local Fords back in the day. “These higher compression heads fit the build perfectly, as they were sought-after in the ’40s by racers who could not afford the more expensive aftermarket heads,” Steve explains. Some hot rodders even painted them after removing the markings, making them the perfect “cheater heads.” Steve’s homemade headers flow into exhaust pipes made from ’36 Ford driveshafts. A few dozen louvers adorn both the hood and decklid. You can recognize the ’32 shell as a commercial unit, as it lacks the fancy chrome-plated die-casting that joins the radiator cap to the Ford script. The grille shell came from California, while Steve found the complete hood in British Columbia. Below the Model A headlights, check out the drilled genuine ’32 Ford axle, dropped 1-1/2 inches by Flat-Nasty Customs and Steve. More vintage components came from the Ford part bins, such as the ’35 Houdaille shocks, ’39 spindles, ’40 juice brakes (with drilled backing plate in front) and a ’48 F-1 steering box with a Model A flange. Louvers, Electroline taillights, and a Hollywood license plate lamp follow the 1940s theme of this very traditional hot rod. Originally fitted with skinny 19-inch rims, the A now runs 16-inch ’35 Ford wires. The bias-ply tires are Coker-supplied Firestone Deluxe Champs that measure 4.50-16 and 7.50-16 for a perfect rake. Minus its headlights and nicknamed Bad Apple, Steve’s roadster made the scene at The Race of Gentlemen in California. Here Steve and a buddy have just successfully negotiated the tricky downhill path to TROG’s pits. (Photo: Wes Allison)",

If the record comes, then it comes. If not, then hey (it's OK).\"\nAll of the commotion will probably die down quite a bit after the game against Georgia Tech (5-4, 2-4). He has 181 catches in his career, and he only needs four more catches to pass Jarrett Boykin (184 catches from 2007-2011) for Virginia Tech's career record. \nFord, a 6-foot-2, 195-pound junior wide receiver from Jacksonville, Fla., already owns Virginia Tech's career receiving touchdowns mark. On Oct. 27, his 16-yard touchdown catch with 7:20 left in Virginia Tech's 39-36 win at Pittsburgh gave him 23 career touchdown receptions, moving him past former Virginia Tech receiver Antonio Freeman (22 touchdowns from 1991-94). \nBy the end of the season, Ford should also own Virginia Tech's career receiving yards mark, as well. He has 2,583 yards, putting him just 302 yards away from surpassing Boykin (2,884). \nAgainst Georgia Tech, Ford will see an average pass defense that's giving up 236.9 yards per game (8th in the ACC) and which is tied for the third-fewest touchdown passes (10) surrendered in the ACC, but the Yellow Jackets have struggled the last two weeks. \nIn last Saturday's 48-20 loss to North Carolina , Georgia Tech gave up 636 yards, including 353 passing. In a 38-35 win two weeks ago against Duke, Georgia Tech's defense was pounded for 559 yards, including 305 passing by freshman quarterback Daniel Jones. \nWhile Ford's productivity speaks to his easy rapport on the field with quarterbacks Jerod Evans and Brenden Motley and former Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Brewer over the course of Ford's career, there aren't any signs of an inflated ego to accompany what he's accomplished in just over 2 1/2 seasons. \n\"He's done a great job of all of that,\" Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said regarding Ford's ability to deal with the spotlight. \"He's a very mature young man, highly intelligent, truly interested in what's best for the team, but he also deserves recognition. He has been a good player here for several years. He's having a good season. He's done as good a job as anybody I've ever been around in terms of handling all the things that come with individual success.\" \nLast fall, Ford set Virginia Tech's single-season records for receptions (75), receiving yards (1,164) and receiving touchdowns (11). He also \nThere's no shortage of well-meaning motivators to keep Ford grounded as he creeps closer to Virginia Tech's career marks. Expectations have understandably grown as his game has matured. \nFord's mom, Jocelyn Grissett, drives from Jacksonville to all of Virginia Tech's games. The only one she missed this season was Virginia Tech's 34-3 win Oct. 8 at UNC in rainy, windy conditions caused by Hurricane Matthew. \nShe was halfway up I-95 on her way to the Virginia Tech-UNC game before police officers told her and all accompanying traffic to turn around and go back because roads were too dangerous to drive on. \nWith that kind of mother's devotion, she's come to anticipate big things from her talented son. She lets him know it in her somewhat tongue-in-cheek pregame texts. \n\"She'll exaggerate a little bit with her good-luck texts and things and her expectations of what she wants me to do in the game,\" said Ford, who leads Virginia Tech with 50 catches (5th in the ACC) for 710 yards and six touchdowns. \"I'm like, 'All right, mom. Come on, now. Let's be a little realistic.' \n\"Every game is like, 'Yeah, I need like 250 yards and three touchdowns.' I'm like, 'OK. I'll see what I can do.'\" \nVirginia Tech's 2016 season in photos. \nPurchase pictures by Daily Press photographers. \nAfter posting a career-high 11 catches for 117 yards and a touchdown in Virginia Tech's season-opening 36-13 win against Liberty, Hokies receivers coach Holmon Wiggins wasn't satisfied. He thought Ford's day could've been a lot better if he could've avoided a drop or two, blocked downfield a little better and finished plays a bit more. \n\"That was an 'OK' day, in my opinion,\" Wiggins said three days after the Liberty game. \"He knows that, because I expect more out of him. He should have had — well, I won't say — but it should've been a better day for him.\" \nFord has seen his fair share of double coverage this season, but there are times when defenses have tried to corral him using man-to-man coverage. Of course, it's hard for teams to devote two defenders to Ford all game long when Evans also has productive receivers Cam Phillips (36 catches for 551 yards and two touchdowns) and Bucky Hodges (33 catches for 492 yards and 5 TDs) to target. \nPittsburgh tried to load up to stop Virginia Tech's run, went with man coverage all game on Ford, Phillips and Hodges and paid dearly for its sins. Ford, Phillips and Hodges became the first trio of pass-catchers in team history to all have more than 100 receiving yards in a single game. \nWhen the season ends, Ford will have a big decision to make on whether he'll return to Virginia Tech for his senior year. \nESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper considers Ford the fifth-best receiver available in the 2017 draft. He's projected to be a second-round pick if he enters the '17 draft, according to nfldraftscout.com, which also has him pegged as the eighth-best receiver heading into the draft. \nThat's all stuff to address later this season or after the season. He keeps NFL aspirations, and any ideas related to impending records, on the back burner on game days. \n\"I think in the heat of the game, I'm not really worried about, 'Catch this. This will be the record right here,' or anything like that,\" Ford said. \"I'm just trying to make the play to help my team.\" \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642",

EST November 09, 2016 A group of UNCG students stand on a downtown street corner, playing jazz to lift spirits and encourage unity. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nGREENSBORO, NC – We wanted to know how people were feeling about America; what did they love about the country? \nWalking down the streets of downtown Greensboro, a few people stopped and gave a light sigh at the question. \n“I guess it’s just the ability to voice your opinion. The ability to like something, dislike something and be okay. I mean, we all have different opinions but at the end of the day we all have to live together,” said Jurita. \nNathan, a passerby said, “We’re able to find a way to come together, put differences aside, move forward.” \nBut when asking people how they felt, a saxophone and trumpets sounded in the air. Music bounced off the sides of buildings in the heart of the city. \nA group of UNCG students were standing on a corner, happily playing jazz music as people walked and drove by. Loading...

Jazz.” \nThe band- with no name, decided to take the streets one day after the election to play music to lift people’s spirits and show unity. \n“Jazz teaches us how to communicate with each other. It teaches democracy,” said Sanchez. \nAfter playing ‘When The Saints Go Marching In’, Sanchez added, “Everyone in the group knows their role. There’s a person that plays the melody, there’s a person that plays harmony. There’s a person that plays counter-melody, people that play rhythm. All these people are so very important in creating this beautiful art form and this one result.” \nJazz music started in the late 19 th century as, in the simplest of terms, a mix of European classical music and African slave folks songs. It’s considered America’s oldest art form, as the genre is hard to define and changes constantly throughout the decades and among different musicians. \nPerhaps, it’s the best way to show a musical form of unity. \n“No matter who you were rooting for in this election, this is the music that reminds us why this country is so great,” Sanchez explained. “We can still come together and rejoice and have a beautiful time together.” \nCopyright 2016 WFMY ",

      "text": "Ford developing Evasive Steering Assist, Wrong Way Alert systems Text: Anton Andres / Photos: Ford   11:59 Ford lines up two active safety features for future models \nAs vehicles continuously shift towards active safety, the Ford Motor Company is working on two features it plans to implement in its future models. The automaker is currently developing Evasive Steering Assist, as well as Wrong Way Alert system to mitigate, as well as to prevent collisions from happening in the first place. \nFord describes Evasive Steering Assist as a last ditch option if a crash cannot be avoided by braking alone. Designed to operate at city and highway speeds, it uses radar and a camera to detect slower-moving and stationary vehicles ahead, and provides steering support to enable drivers to avoid a vehicle if a collision is imminent. The system doesn't steer for the driver. Instead, this feature only kicks in when the sensors detect obstacles that are fast approaching the car. Steering assistance is then given to the driver when he or she applies steering input. It works in conjunction with the stability control system to avoid further loss of control. \nThe Wrong Way Alert system meanwhile aims to warn drivers if they are about to enter a one way street or the wrong side of the highway. Wrong Way Alert works with the use of a front mounted camera that constantly scans for road signs. If signs are unavailable, it then relies on the vehicle's navigation system to warn drivers of a no entry zone. It then alerts the driver with both audio and visual alerts to tell the driver to turn around. \nAt the moment, both Evasive Steering Assist and Wrong Way Alert are being tested at Ford of Europe's grounds in Germany. Ford adds that they aim to introduce these new features within the next two years but did not say which cars will have it first. It is likely that the automaker's European lineup may be the first to get these systems as an option. Related Articles",

      "text": "  Ford Testing The Bronco Against The Jeep Wrangler In Australia's Outback by Gabe Beita Kiser   More proof that Ford is dead serious about making this Bronco a winner. Watch out Jeep. With Chrysler struggling to keep itself relevant now that the 200 is being killed of and the 300 is next in line for the execution block , FCA is struggling to find ways to keep itself relevant while it decides what to do next. Luckily, some of its most popular models are there to keep things churning and as we’ve seen from renderings that have recently popped up on the Internet , the Jeep Wrangler's upgrades will be enough to keep the machine going. Motoring thinks differently, though. We recently got unofficial confirmation that Ford would be bringing the Bronco and Ranger back to the US from the UAW 900 plant chairman, Bill Johnson. Ford never followed up with its own confirmation, but thanks to the Australian automotive publication, we now have an added layer of security protecting the claims that both the mini truck and Jeep Wrangler competitor will make it to America. Motoring’s sources have confirmed that development for the Bronco is underway at Ford’s Victorian-based Asia-Pacific Product Development Center. The center is the home base for Ford’s T6 ladder platform that underpins the global Ranger and the upcoming Bronco. To migrate the platform, Ford will likely make alterations to allow for multiple body styles including two and four-door models. US buyers will probably not see the diesel options available to the global market, but we can be sure to expect a few V6 engines available including twin-turbo EcoBoost units. Unlike many of the softer SUVs Ford has put out to satisfy the crossover craze, the Bronco should retain a rough and rugged appearance as well as actual off-road capabilities. To make sure the Bronco doesn’t slip through the cracks and become a second-place option, Ford has reportedly purchased hardcore Rubicon versions of the two and four-door Wrangler in order to benchmark them against the Bronco. Don't Expect the return of the icon before 2020.",

      "text": "The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president puts new pressure on automakers and other manufacturers that have become dependent on open trade with Mexico, and raises the risk they will face higher costs.\nAutomakers could also take a hit if instability in financial markets undercuts the confidence of consumers in the United States and other major markets at a time when growth in U.S. auto sales has stalled.\nInvestors sold off U.S. stocks and the dollar in reaction to Trump’s unexpected win. Shares in Japanese automakers, which also rely on Mexico as a production hub for the U.S. market, slid as well, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei index, which fell 5 percent.\nIn afternoon Tokyo trade, shares in Toyota Motor Corp were down 6.5 pct, Nissan Motor Co Ltd was down 6.0 pct, while Honda Motor Co fell 7.8 pct. All three companies declined to comment.\nTrump’s promise to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and reject or renegotiate other trade opening deals resonated with voters in industrial states, even though many experts raised doubts that the 1994 NAFTA would be repealed.\nTrump made an attack on the outsourcing of American auto jobs to Mexico a recurrent theme in his campaign, a message that rallied blue-collar workers while threatening to upend the business assumptions behind billions of dollars in planned investment by the auto industry.\nIn announcing his campaign in June 2015, Trump vowed to block Ford Motor Co from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose tariffs on cars it shipped back across the border.\nBut implementing Trump’s agenda would force U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for vehicles, said Charles Chesbrough, senior economist and executive director of strategy and research at the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, a Detroit-based trade group representing auto suppliers.\n“His trade policies could add $5,000 or more to the price of a small car from Mexico,” he said.\nU.S. manufacturers such Ford, General Motors Co, heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc and many of their suppliers have based billions of dollars of investment on the assumption of relatively open trade with Mexico, China and other countries.\nFord in April announced plans to invest $1.6 billion to expand production of small cars in Mexico, drawing fire from Trump. Trump also took aim at GM for its plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico.\nIn September, Ford said its small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Trump.\n“We shouldn’t allow it to happen,” Trump said.\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford last month said he met with Trump to discuss criticism from the candidate, which Ford said he found “infuriating” and “frustrating.” Ford said his company employs more people at its U.S. plants than any other automaker. The company also said its decision to build new vehicles in Mexico would not cost U.S. jobs.\nBetween 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed.\nMexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research.\nBased on current investment plans, Mexico’s auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, the center, which draws funding from the auto industry, estimates.\n“Dismantling NAFTA at this point would be pretty hard to do,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the center.\nRecent pledges by GM and Ford to build new models at U.S. factories are likely to generate a limited new jobs, far short of the industry revival Trump promised on the stump.\n“After we win, I’m going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I’m going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant, and we will do it and we will do lot of expansion,” Trump said in Michigan on Tuesday in his last speech of the campaign.",

      "text": "  7:53 PM The road to Ford Championship Weekend takes teams to Phoenix International Raceway, with just 312 \"Miles2Miami\" remaining in the 2016 Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. John Singler \nThe road to Ford Championship Weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway takes teams to Phoenix International Raceway this week, now with just 312 \"Miles2Miami\" remaining in the 2016 Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. \nSunday’s Can-Am 500 will bring the Round of 8 to a close, trimming the field of title contenders to four. One driver from that quartet will be crowned NASCAR’s 68th Cup Series champion on Nov. 20 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. \nWith victories the last two weeks, Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards know they'll be racing for a championship. That leaves six drivers chasing the two remaining spots. Kevin Harvick's an eight-time Phoenix winner but isn't resting on his laurels entering the next-to-last race of the season. \n\"There are a lot of good drivers and lots of circumstances that could play out to have things go wrong,\" said Harvick, the No. 4 seed in this year's post-season Chase who is faced with what almost amounts to a a must-win situation on the one-mile desert oval. \"You go there with a fresh start like you've never won before and just try to get the car dialed in.\" \nHarvick has won a race in each of the first two rounds of this year's Chase but has struck out so far in the semifinal round, posting finishes of 20th and sixth in his last two starts. \n\"As we go to Phoenix, we have to look at the things we've done well there,\" Harvick said. \"Pay attention to the lines and braking, steering and throttle. You try to mimic that immediately when you get on the racetrack.\" \nThere are currently four drivers bunched within two points of each other who are very much in the mix for the final two spots in The Championship 4. Harvick is on the outside looking in, eighteen points below the cutoff line. \nHe'll draw confidence from the fact he's won before at PIR, including earlier this season. \nIn posting his eighth Sprint Cup win at PIR on March 13, Harvick survived a full-contact side-by-side duel with Edwards on the final lap to claim his first victory of the season in a photo finish. \nHe led the field on the day’s final restart and pulled away before a fast-closing Edwards reeled him in and tapped the rear bumper of Harvick’s No. 4 Chevrolet entering Turn-4 on the final lap. Edwards pulled alongside and leaned hard on Harvick as they exited the corner. Edwards and Harvick bumped again as they took the checkered flag, with Harvick nosing ahead at the finish. \nThe official margin of victory was a mere one one-hundredth of a second. Harvick dominated the second half of the race, leading all but 11 of the final 150 laps including the last 79. \nSeven of the eight drivers remaining in the semifinal round of the Chase have won a Cup Series race at Phoenix International Raceway: Harvick, Johnson, Edwards, Kurt and Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth. Joey Logano’s best finish there is third on two occasions, most recently in the November race last year. \nSo far this fall, all eight post-season races have been won by drivers on the original Chase Grid. The best finish by a non-Chase competitor is Brian Scott’s runner-up effort at Talladega Superspeedway 18 days ago, when he finished second to Logano. \nSprint Cup Series teams will open practice at Phoenix International Raceway on Friday at 1:30 p.m. (ET) and qualify later in the day. Motor Racing Network – \"The Voice of NASCAR\" – will have live coverage of Sunday’s Can-Am 500 starting at 1:30 p.m., with live streaming at MRN.com and on the MRN App. About Us",

      "text": "BLACKSBURG Anytime he sets foot in a Blacksburg restaurant, Isaiah Ford knows what’s coming – the questions, the well-wishers, the compliments. It’s a steady stream.\nMake no mistake, he’s flattered and honored to be considered one of the difference-makers when it comes to No. 18 Virginia Tech’s offense. Yet there’s also a part of him that’s ready for all the interest surrounding his pursuit of Tech’s career receiving records to go away.\n“I go out to eat, and my waiter might say something like, ‘Hey, man. You going to break that record Saturday?’ or something like that, but once it’s be over, then it’ll be fine,” said Ford, who will help lead Virginia Tech (7-2, 5-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) on Saturday when it hosts Georgia Tech. “My focus is just trying to go 1-0, to be completely honest. If the record comes, then it comes.”\nAll the commotion will probably die down quite a bit after the game against Georgia Tech (5-4, 2-4). He has 181 catches and only needs four more to pass Jarrett Boykin (184 from 2007-2011) for Virginia Tech’s career record.\nFord, a 6-foot-2, 195-pound junior wide receiver from Jacksonville, Fla., already owns Virginia Tech’s career receiving touchdowns mark. On Oct. 27, his 16-yard touchdown catch with 7:20 left in Virginia Tech’s 39-36 win at Pittsburgh gave him 23 TD catches, moving him past Antonio Freeman (22 from 1991-94).\nBy the end of the season, Ford should also own Virginia Tech’s career receiving yards mark as well. He has 2,583, just 302 from surpassing Boykin (2,884).\nAgainst Georgia Tech, Ford will see a pass defense that’s giving up 236.9 yards per game (eighth in the ACC) and which is tied for the third-fewest touchdown passes surrendered (10) in the ACC. But the Yellow Jackets have struggled the past two weeks.\nIn last Saturday’s 48-20 loss to North Carolina, Georgia Tech gave up 636 yards, including 353 passing. In a 38-35 win two weeks ago against Duke, Georgia Tech was pounded for 559 yards, including 305 passing by freshman quarterback Daniel Jones.\nWhile Ford’s productivity speaks to his easy rapport on the field with quarterbacks Jerod Evans and Brenden Motley and former Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Brewer over the course of his career, there aren’t any signs of an inflated ego to accompany what he’s accomplished in just more than 2½ seasons.\n“He’s done a great job with all of that,” Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said. “He’s a very mature young man, highly intelligent, truly interested in what’s best for the team, but he also deserves recognition. He has been a good player here for several years. He’s having a good season. He’s done as good a job as anybody I’ve ever been around in terms of handling all the things that come with individual success.”\nThere’s no shortage of well-meaning motivators to keep Ford grounded. Expectations have understandably grown as his game has matured.\nFord’s mom, Jocelyn Grissett, drives from Jacksonville to all of Virginia Tech’s games. The only one she missed this season was Virginia Tech’s 34-3 win Oct. 8 at UNC in rainy, windy conditions caused by Hurricane Matthew.\nShe was halfway up I-95 on her way to the game before police told her and all accompanying traffic to turn around because roads were too dangerous.\nWith that kind of mother’s devotion, she’s come to anticipate big things from her son. She lets him know it in her somewhat tongue-in-cheek pregame texts.\n“She’ll exaggerate a little bit with her good-luck texts and things and her expectations of what she wants me to do in the game,” said Ford, who leads Virginia Tech with 50 catches (fifth in the ACC) for 710 yards and six touchdowns. “I’m like, ‘All right, mom. Come on, now. Let’s be a little realistic.’\n“Every game is like, ‘Yeah, I need like 250 yards and three touchdowns.’ I’m like, ‘Okay. I’ll see what I can do.’ ”\nAfter posting a career-high 11 catches for 117 yards and a touchdown in Virginia Tech’s season-opening 36-13 win against Liberty, receivers coach Holmon Wiggins wasn’t satisfied. He thought Ford’s day could’ve been a lot better if he could’ve avoided a drop or two, blocked downfield a little better and finished plays a bit more.\n“That was an ‘OK’ day, in my opinion,” Wiggins said three days after the game. “He knows that because I expect more out of him. He should have had – well, I won’t say – but it should’ve been a better day for him.”\nFord has seen his share of double coverage this season. Of course, it’s difficult for teams to devote two defenders to Ford all game when Evans also has productive receivers Cam Phillips (36 catches for 551 yards and two touchdowns) and Bucky Hodges (33 catches for 492 yards and five touchdowns).\nPittsburgh tried to load up to stop Virginia Tech’s run, went with man coverage all game on Ford, Phillips and Hodges and paid dearly. They became the first trio of pass-catchers in team history to each have more than 100 receiving yards in a game.\nWhen the season ends, Ford will have a big decision to make. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper considers Ford the fifth-best receiver available in the 2017 draft. He’s projected to be a second-round pick, according to nfldraftscout.com , which also has him pegged as the eighth-best receiver heading into the draft.\nThat’s all stuff to address later. He keeps NFL aspirations and any impending records out of his train of thought on game day.\n“I think in the heat of the game, I’m not really worried about, ‘Catch this. This will be the record right here,’ or anything like that,” Ford said. “I’m just trying to make the play to help my team.”",

But despite the potential negative consequences a Trump presidency may have on these automakers, they are taking the election results in stride, at least publicly. \n“GM congratulates both candidates and parties on their hard-fought campaigns.GM looks forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the new Congress on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. manufacturing base,” the automaker said in a statement, adding that it “will continue to do its part to transform the future of mobility and contribute to America’s competitive strength.” \nFord, which has been the most prized red circle on Trump’s target board, told Motor Trend , “We congratulate the President-elect and new governors, members of Congress and elected officials across all levels of the U.S. government. We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country – and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs.” \nAt the beginning of his campaign, Trump threatened to stop Ford from opening a new plant in Mexico , even saying he would impose tariffs on its cars shipped over here. Recently, Ford said it would move all of its small car production from the U.S. to Mexico over the next few years, substituting the cars with new products. Trump famously suggested Ford would “fire all of their employees in the United States,” to which Ford CEO Mark Fields retorted that no American jobs would be lost in the production shift. \nThe president-elect has also expressed discontent at GM’s decision to spend $5 billion to expand its operations in Mexico. Just today, however, GM announced it would lay off 2,000 people and cut a shift at two of its factories due to slow sales. The affected plants include Lordstown, Ohio, which produces the Cruze , and Lansing, Mich., which builds Camaros and Cadillac sedans. \nIf Trump’s protectionist policies see the light of day, small cars made in Mexico and shipped to the U.S. could become less appealing to U.S. consumers. Prices could go up $5,000 or more, warned Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at Original Equipment Suppliers Association, speaking with Reuters . \nWhile Ford and GM may have reason to worry, the mining and heavy equipment industries could benefit greatly. Investors are predicting that Caterpillar could benefit from Trump’s plans to curtail regulation in the coal industry. Shares for the company increased nearly 7 percent earlier today. \nSource: GM, Ford, Reuters",

      "text": "By : Adrian Padeanu , Editor Ford’s smallest car on sale today will be available from early 2017 in a slightly more rugged configuration. \nSimilar in philosophy with the VW cross up! , the new Ford Ka Trail is a pint-sized five-door hatchback with some crossover cues. It’s sitting slightly higher than the regular model as a result of a jacked-up suspension enabling a more generous ground clearance making it better at tackling bumpier roads. Some plastic body cladding around the wheel arches and a silver front skid plate have also been added to make the ruggedized hatch look more like a crossover. \nRounding off the list of changes are the new 15-inch black alloy wheels complemented by a similar finish for the side mirror caps, and door handles, while the side profile has gained a “Trail” decal on the lower section of the doors. Images of the interior have not been provided, but chances a new seat upholstery and a different trim have been implemented to further differentiate the model from the regular Brazilian-spec Ka. \nFord hasn’t released any technical specifications so far, although most likely underneath the hood resides the same 1.5-liter Sigma naturally-aspirated gasoline engine with 110 horsepower (82 kilowatts) and 107 pound-feet (146 Newton-meters) of torque. Power is channeled to the front wheels through a five-speed manual gearbox, while an optional all-wheel-drive system is out of the question since this is a cheap, no-frills car. \nFord Brazil will have the Ka Trail on sale at the beginning of 2017, and although pricing isn’t out just yet, you can imagine the add-ons will command a premium over the regular Ka. The new Trail version will join the standard five-door hatchback model as well as the four-door Ka+ sedan available locally. Keep in mind a Ka+ model has been launched recently in Europe, but on the old continent it takes the shape of an Indian-built hatchback with five doors and serves as a replacement for the old Euro-spec, three-door Ka based on the Fiat 500. \nSource: Ford Brazil Be part of something big Ford Ka Trail at 2016 Sao Paulo Motor Show",

      "title": "Wallabies recall Genia, Ford playing 100th test for Scotland",
      "text": "EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Will Genia will be back at scrumhalf for Australia against Scotland on Saturday at Murrayfield, after missing the tour-opening win over Wales. Meanwhile, Scotland will feature a novel front row: Edinburgh loosehead prop Allan Dell will make his debut, tighthead Zander Fagerson earns his first start, and hooker Ross Ford becomes the third Scot to reach 100 tests.\nGenia wasn't released by French club Stade Francais because the Wales match was outside the test window. But available again, he was chosen immediately by Wallabies coach Michael Cheika on Thursday.\nIn replacing Nick Phipps, who was in the reserves, Genia was the only change to the starting XV which thumped Wales 32-8 in Cardiff last weekend.\n\"Genia ... he's been one of our best all season,\" Cheika said. \"Nick will finish the game.\"\nUtility forward Dean Mumm was in the reserves after a one-match suspension, along with lock Will Skelton, who hasn't played since August. The forwards-backs split in the reserves was 5-2, perhaps in mind of the weather forecast, which is for rain. Australia's tight five was also criticized, even after dominating Wales, and Cheika expected them to be targeted.\n\"We're going to have to learn how to win in different ways on this trip,\" he said. \"It can't always be like the way it was last week.\"\nCheika kept faith with No. 8 Lopeti Timani, who excelled even after David Pocock left the Wales game early because of a concussion. Pocock was passed fit.\nFord, who made his Scotland debut against Australia in 2004, follows only Chris Paterson (109) and Sean Lamont (105) to a century of caps.\nHis experience will be vital in the front row, between South African-born clubmate Dell, and 20-year-old Fagerson.\n\"He has plenty left to give in a Scotland jersey,\" Scotland coach Vern Cotter said of Ford.\nRegular props Alasdair Dickinson (hamstring) and WP Nel (neck) were injured. Gordon Reid and Moray Low were the backups.\nBacks Finn Russell and Alex Dunbar return after injuries ruled them out of the Japan tour in June, when Scotland won both tests. Dunbar forms a new center partnership with Stormers center Huw Jones, who made his debut in Japan.\n___\nLineups:\nScotland: Stuart Hogg, Sean Maitland, Huw Jones, Alex Dunbar, Tim Visser, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw (captain), Ryan Wilson, Hamish Watson, John Barclay, Jonny Gray, Richie Gray, Zander Ferguson, Ross Ford, Allan Dell. Reserves: Fraser Brown, Gordon Reid, Moray Low, Grant Gilchrist, John Hardie, Ali Price, Pete Horne, Rory Hughes.\nAustralia: Israel Folau, Dane Haylett-Petty, Tevita Kuridrani, Reece Hodge, Henry Speight, Bernard Foley, Will Genia; Lopeti Timani, Michael Hooper, David Pocock, Adam Coleman, Rory Arnold, Sekope Kepu, Stephen Moore (captain), Scott Sio. Reserves: Tolu Latu, Tom Robertson, Allan Alaalatoa, Rob Simmons, Will Skelton, Dean Mumm, Nick Phipps, Quade Cooper.",

(Photo: Jakob Ebrey/LAT Photographic) By John Dagys Nov 9, 2016 at 4:03p ET 0Shares \nFollowing its 24 Hours of Le Mans triumph last June, Ford is pulling out all the stops in quest of class victory in another twice-around-the-clock endurance classic, with the American manufacturer planning a four-car Ford GT effort for the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \nSportscar365 has learned that Ford Chip Ganassi Racing is preparing to enter all four of its cars in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season opener on Jan. 28-29, in what would mark the team’s biggest single-class, single-race effort in North America. \nWhile a formal commitment or announcement has not yet been made, it’s understood preparations are underway, with the team’s FIA World Endurance Championship cars expected to be shipped to the U.S. following next weekend’s season finale in Bahrain for pre-race preparations. \nDrivers from the team’s WEC program, plus some potential Ganassi NASCAR and IndyCar drivers, are expected to complete the four-car lineup in the GT Le Mans class. \nWhen reached by Sportscar365, Ford Performance global director Dave Pericak didn’t confirm or deny the presence of a likely increased effort for Daytona. \n“Our Ford team is completely focused on the remaining WEC schedule and are extremely proud and happy with our Ford GT performance worldwide,” Pericak told Sportscar365. \nThe Multimatic-built Ford GT made its competition debut in this year’s Rolex 24 and since went on to claim three WeatherTech Championship class victories, all with the No. 67 car of Richard Westbrook and Ryan Briscoe, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais. \nIts UK-based, Multimatic-run branch has also tasted success in the car’s first year, with class wins in the two recent WEC rounds at Fuji and Shanghai, both with Andy Priaulx and Harry Tincknell. \nFord’s expected increased effort for Daytona will come as significant boost to the GTLM class, which will again see factory or works-backed efforts from BMW, Porsche, Ferrari and defending champions Corvette Racing. 0",

      "text": "Tweet \nFord’s smallest utility vehicle is bound for North America, giving hope to Blue Oval fans who find an Escape too unwieldy. \nThe EcoSport, offered in overseas markets since 2004, will soon be pressed into service to round out the bottom of the Ford’s domestic utility lineup. \nAccording to Automotive News , Ford can blame the leak on DJ Khaled, who teased his involvement in the reveal on Snapchat last night. \n“Monday I’m introducing the Ford EcoSport,” the rap artist said in a short video. “It’s going to be a world premiere with the new Ford EcoSport.” \nThe unveiling comes on the eve of the Los Angeles International Auto Show. While Ford has confirmed the decision to bring the model stateside, it won’t say when it will go on sale. \nSharing its B3 platform with the Ford Fiesta, the EcoSport offers differing powerplants depending on the market, though a 1.0-liter EcoBoost three-cylinder comes standard in most countries. Select countries see non-turbocharged gasoline and diesel 1.5-liter four-cylinders, as well as a 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter four. Ford hasn’t mentioned what powertrains North American customers can expect. \nThe automaker clearly doesn’t like the idea of being left out of the small but fast-growing subcompact crossover segment, dominated by the likes of the Chevrolet Trax and Mazda CX-3. While only 3 percent of U.S. volume, the segment has seen sales rise by 30 percent this year. \n[Image: Ford of Europe]",

Andrew Boyers Livepic \nLONDON Hooker Ross Ford will become only the third player to reach 100 caps for Scotland as he spearheads a new-look front row against Australia on Saturday. \nFord, who made his debut against Australia 12 years ago, will join Chris Paterson (109) and Sean Lamont (105) as Scotland's only cap centurions when Vern Cotter's side open their autumn campaign at Murrayfield. \nHis experience could prove vital as he will line up alongside debutant Allan Dell and Zander Fagerson, who makes his first international start. \n“To play 100 test matches for your country is an incredible achievement, with his lasting dedication keeping him among the best hookers in the world for a decade,\" Cotter said in a statement. \n“He is a consummate professional and, at 32, he has plenty left to give in a Scotland jersey.” \nFlanker Hamish Watson and centre Huw Jones will also make their first test starts as Scotland face Australia for the first time since their heartbreaking 35-34 defeat in the World Cup quarter-final last year. \nThat match holds painful memories for Cotter's side, who had been on the verge of a stunning upset, before Australia snatched victory with a last-gasp penalty by Bernard Foley that many observers felt should not have been awarded. \nTeam: 15-Stuart Hogg, 14-Sean Maitland, 13-Huw Jones, 12-Alex Dunbar, 11-Tim Visser, 10-Finn Russell, 9-Greig Laidlaw, 1-Allan Dell, 2-Ross Ford, 3-Zander Fagerson, 4-Richie Gray, 5-Jonny Gray, 6-John Barclay, 7-Hamish Watson, 8-Ryan Wilson \nReplacements: 16-Fraser Brown, 17-Gordon Reid, 18-Moray Low, 19-Grant Gilchrist, 20-John Hardie, 21-Ali Price, 22-Pete Horne, 23-Rory Hughes \n(Reporting by Toby Davis, editing by Pritha Sarkar) Next In Sports News",

For improved handling, he installed H&R springs. To help it breathe better, Krachun installed a BBK cold air and Flowmaster Outlaw axle-backs with all mods now tied together with a Bama tune. This is no garage queen—Krachun drives the car every day and attends local car cruises and shows with friends and family. His dad owns Misha’s Auto Body in Mt.

      "text": "Why Ford's Smallest SUV, the 2017 EcoSport, Is Coming to the U.S. newsfeedback@fool.com (John Rosevear) 1 hr ago A Ford EcoSport Titanium, as sold in Europe. Ford will announce next week that the EcoSport, a subcompact SUV, is coming to the U.S. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F) is about to bring its smallest SUV to the United States. As first reported by Automotive News , the Blue Oval has confirmed that a U.S.-bound version of the 2017 Ford EcoSport will be unveiled in Los Angeles on Monday. What is the Ford EcoSport? \nThe EcoSport is a small crossover SUV built on Ford's global \"B\" architecture. That architecture is shared with the Fiesta, which should give you an idea of the EcoSport's size. (It's a little bigger than a Fiesta.) While it will be new to the U.S., the EcoSport isn't an all-new product. \nThe current EcoSport is part of Ford's global product portfolio and has been sold in many other parts of the world since its launch late in 2012 as a 2013 model. It was originally developed as a simple and inexpensive SUV for emerging markets. Ford sells a lot of them: The EcoSport is currently built in China, Brazil, Russia, India, Vietnam, and Thailand. \nA more upscale version of the EcoSport was subsequently developed for Europe and launched last year to compete with popular premium small SUVs like General Motors ' (NYSE: GM) Opel Mokka. That's probably the version that will serve as the basis of the U.S. model, and it will probably have the Mokka's U.S. sibling -- the hot-selling Buick Encore -- in its sights. \nIn Europe, the EcoSport is available with three different engines, including a diesel. It's likely that the U.S. model will be offered with some or all of these gasoline engines: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder making 120 horsepower, a 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost turbo making 123 horsepower, or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 160 horsepower. \nThe European EcoSport is available in upscale trims, including \"Titanium\" and \"Titanium Sport\" models. Expect the U.S. model's trim lines to follow the pattern of the Fiesta and Focus, with two or three versions -- including an upscale model -- available. The U.S.-market EcoSport's interior will probably look a lot like the one in this European model. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nThe U.S.-market EcoSport probably won't be built in the U.S., as most of Ford's U.S. factories are already running near full capacity. It might be built in Mexico, possibly alongside current U.S.-bound Fiestas at Ford's Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly plant in Cuautitlan Izcalli, Mexico. Also possible: Ford may choose to import U.S.-market EcoSports from its vast manufacturing facility in Thailand. Why is the EcoSport coming to the U.S.? \nLet's put it this way: Here are the key competitors in the subcompact SUV segment in the U.S. Note that most have had big sales increases this year. Data sources: The automakers. Year-to-date sales are through Oct. 31, 2016. \nSo to answer the question: Ford wants a piece of that fast-growing action. Since the EcoSport already exists, entering the U.S. small-SUV fray is a (relatively) inexpensive proposition for the Blue Oval -- and the profit potential is quite high. What will the new Ford EcoSport cost? \nWe don't know yet. Ford may tell us on Monday, or it may wait until closer to the EcoSport's launch. My educated guess is that the U.S. EcoSport's starting price will be right around $20,000, with a \"Titanium\" version starting around $26,000. You'll probably be able to get a well-equipped-but-not-lavish EcoSport for around $24,000, maybe a little less. When will the EcoSport go on sale in the U.S.? \nAgain, we don't know yet, though Ford will almost certainly give us an idea on Monday. The timing of the EcoSport's U.S. launch probably depends on where Ford plans to build it. \nIf the answer is Mexico, it might take a while: Ford is in the process of a massive expansion of its Mexican manufacturing facilities, with an all-new assembly plant under construction in San Luis Potosi and a major expansion of the Cuautitlan plant underway now. \nIf the answer is Thailand, the EcoSport could arrive at U.S. dealers much sooner. \n10 stocks we like better than Ford \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Why Ford's Smallest SUV, the 2017 EcoSport, Is Coming to the U.S. newsfeedback@fool.com (John Rosevear) 0 A Ford EcoSport Titanium, as sold in Europe. Ford will announce next week that the EcoSport, a subcompact SUV, is coming to the U.S. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F) is about to bring its smallest SUV to the United States. As first reported by Automotive News , the Blue Oval has confirmed that a U.S.-bound version of the 2017 Ford EcoSport will be unveiled in Los Angeles on Monday. What is the Ford EcoSport? \nThe EcoSport is a small crossover SUV built on Ford's global \"B\" architecture. That architecture is shared with the Fiesta, which should give you an idea of the EcoSport's size. (It's a little bigger than a Fiesta.) While it will be new to the U.S., the EcoSport isn't an all-new product. \nThe current EcoSport is part of Ford's global product portfolio and has been sold in many other parts of the world since its launch late in 2012 as a 2013 model. It was originally developed as a simple and inexpensive SUV for emerging markets. Ford sells a lot of them: The EcoSport is currently built in China, Brazil, Russia, India, Vietnam, and Thailand. \nA more upscale version of the EcoSport was subsequently developed for Europe and launched last year to compete with popular premium small SUVs like General Motors ' (NYSE: GM) Opel Mokka. That's probably the version that will serve as the basis of the U.S. model, and it will probably have the Mokka's U.S. sibling -- the hot-selling Buick Encore -- in its sights. \nIn Europe, the EcoSport is available with three different engines, including a diesel. It's likely that the U.S. model will be offered with some or all of these gasoline engines: a 1.6-liter four-cylinder making 120 horsepower, a 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost turbo making 123 horsepower, or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 160 horsepower. \nThe European EcoSport is available in upscale trims, including \"Titanium\" and \"Titanium Sport\" models. Expect the U.S. model's trim lines to follow the pattern of the Fiesta and Focus, with two or three versions -- including an upscale model -- available. The U.S.-market EcoSport's interior will probably look a lot like the one in this European model. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nThe U.S.-market EcoSport probably won't be built in the U.S., as most of Ford's U.S. factories are already running near full capacity. It might be built in Mexico, possibly alongside current U.S.-bound Fiestas at Ford's Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly plant in Cuautitlan Izcalli, Mexico. Also possible: Ford may choose to import U.S.-market EcoSports from its vast manufacturing facility in Thailand. Why is the EcoSport coming to the U.S.? \nLet's put it this way: Here are the key competitors in the subcompact SUV segment in the U.S. Note that most have had big sales increases this year. Data sources: The automakers. Year-to-date sales are through Oct. 31, 2016. \nSo to answer the question: Ford wants a piece of that fast-growing action. Since the EcoSport already exists, entering the U.S. small-SUV fray is a (relatively) inexpensive proposition for the Blue Oval -- and the profit potential is quite high. What will the new Ford EcoSport cost? \nWe don't know yet. Ford may tell us on Monday, or it may wait until closer to the EcoSport's launch. My educated guess is that the U.S. EcoSport's starting price will be right around $20,000, with a \"Titanium\" version starting around $26,000. You'll probably be able to get a well-equipped-but-not-lavish EcoSport for around $24,000, maybe a little less. When will the EcoSport go on sale in the U.S.? \nAgain, we don't know yet, though Ford will almost certainly give us an idea on Monday. The timing of the EcoSport's U.S. launch probably depends on where Ford plans to build it. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nIf the answer is Mexico, it might take a while: Ford is in the process of a massive expansion of its Mexican manufacturing facilities, with an all-new assembly plant under construction in San Luis Potosi and a major expansion of the Cuautitlan plant underway now. \nIf the answer is Thailand, the EcoSport could arrive at U.S. dealers much sooner. \n10 stocks we like better than Ford \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Restored, Le Mans-Winning 1966 Ford GT40 Coming To LA Auto Show | By Share The 1966 Le Mans-winning Ford GT40 fully restored by Rare Driver and owned by RK Motors Charlotte is set to be showcased at the impending Los Angeles Auto Show . Over the past 20 months, almost 4,000 hours have been spent on returning the famed race car to its former glory. The restoration has been so comprehensive that the finished car even has the very same unequal length exhaust pipes and dripping paint which the car original had in the mid-1960s. RK Motors Charlotte first unveiled the restored model at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August before displaying it at the Ford booth at SEMA 2016. According to president of RK Motors Charlotte, Joseph Carroll, “It’s a thrill for us to be part of Ford’s display at the L.A. Auto Show, one of the automotive world’s preeminent events. We’re proud to bring this important piece of racing history to Auto Show visitors, as well as attending media from throughout the world.” During the vehicle's restoration, it has been subject to a seven-part video series on the RK Motors website , detailing the build and in the final episode, showing it returning to the famed Circuit de la Sarthe and its introduction back into the United States.

      "text": "Roadshow News Crossovers Ford's EcoSport looks like a Fiesta that's been stung by a bee Enlarge Image It's a burly little fellow.\nFord The Ford Escape and Honda CR-V have been locked in battle in the compact crossover segment for years. But where was Ford 's answer to Honda 's even smaller HR-V ? It might be late to the game, but next week, we'll get a look at the EcoSport, Ford's answer to Honda's diminutive ute.\nFord confirmed to Automotive News that it would unveil the EcoSport ahead of next week's   . Ford's relying on exuberant rapper DJ Khaled to help unveil the car, and it appears that a Snapchat post of his may have given away the surprise. \nThe EcoSport is a subcompact crossover based on Ford's global B-car platform, which underpins the Ford Fiesta and a few cars we don't get in the US, like the Ka and the B-Max. That's why I used the HR-V as a point of comparison, since Honda's littlest guy is based off the subcompact Fit sedan platform.\nSince the EcoSport is a global car, its powertrains vary by region. It packs everything from a 1.0-liter turbocharged I3 to a 140-horsepower, 2.0-liter I4. It can equip both manual and automatic transmissions, which is a delightful thing to see. Diesel variants exist, too, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say Ford won't screw with diesel in the US.\nIt's unclear whether the US will receive the current, second-generation EcoSport (seen in pictures here) or a new, third generation. We'll find out on Monday, November 14.",

Live Big\" event will last three days and feature various musicians and examples of people doing a lot with a little, which is clearly a nod to how Ford wants people to see the EcoSport.\n\n\n\nWe contacted Ford for more information, and a spokesperson confirmed the reveal is happening on the night of Monday, November 14. Ford won't confirm which markets the model being shown will br offered in, but given that the unveil is happening in the States, we're very confident the model Ford shows next week is bound for America. (If you haven't noticed, crossovers are the thing right now, and the subcompact class is quickly getting crowded.) We did learn something else: Apparently you're supposed to pronounce the name Echo-Sport, according to a Ford representative.\n\nThe EcoSport, for those unfamiliar, already exists – it's a little crossover based on the Ford Fiesta that has been on sale for a while in other regions. We've seen camouflaged EcoSports running around Michigan since last December, including one with a fascia derived from the current Ford Escape . The EcoSport, along with a new Bronco , will likely be counted as one of four new SUVs Ford adds to its US lineup .\n\nThe unveiling will be broadcast Monday night on Snapchat, so you can follow along from home. And if you're in the LA area and want to attend, you can visit the event's website for tickets . We'll be there and plan to bring you all the details of the little crossover here on Autoblog , so be sure to check back next week.",

      "text": "Editor’s Note : Or Obama will pardon her just like Ford pardoned Nixon… then again, that is if any of these people will ever actually admit she committed crimes in the first place. \n\nAdmittedly, the question is speculative, but not without merit.\nDuring the debates and in the heated final days of the campaign, Donald Trump vowed to assign a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary and send her to jail.\n\nIt was easily the highlight of the entire campaign:\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\nAnd I’ll tell you what. I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor. \nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails — and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\nSo we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been — their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. ( source )\nBut, now that victory has set in, and the election is officially over, can anybody expect that he will actually do it?\nCertainly, we must wait until he is inaugurated and has a chance to show what kind of president he will be.\nHowever, Trump’s victory speech gives good reason to doubt the prospects for his actually assigning a “special prosecutor” against Hillary Clinton.\nHe opened the speech with praise for Clinton and a call for unity – certainly a different chord for now-president-elect Trump:\nTRUMP: I’ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) She congratulated us — it’s about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. \n(APPLAUSE) I mean that very sincerely. (APPLAUSE)\nNow it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\n\nCertainly, there is something to be said for being a gracious winner – and for Trump, proving to his critics that he won’t be their worst nightmare.\nPardon, The Price of Concession? \nBut what really accounts for the shift in tone?\nLate in the evening, John Podesta – top aide to Hillary, thoroughly implicated in wickedness by Wikileaks – announced, in essence, that the campaign would not concede, that they would wait until every last vote was counted.\nClearly, Team Hillary was fully prepared to challenge a recount, to take it to court in every venue possible. Al Gore did so (and with good cause), and she could too.\nHillary and her campaign had every opportunity to deny Trump easy victory, even when there was no real chance left for her. They could have drawn things out for some time.\nAnd yet, shortly after Podesta’s announcement, Trump gave his victory speech, noting a call from Hillary Clinton herself in which she conceded – but on what terms?\nThough it is admittedly speculative – can anyone else claim to know what was said during that call? – it is entirely possible that the primary demand for her swift admission of defeat was that any and all possibility of prosecution and investigation for her sordid and illegal activities be taken off the table. \nDid Hillary make THAT call?\nDid Trump essentially grant her immunity from his own special court in exchange for acknowledging the win he otherwise already earned?\nOnly time will tell.\nFor her part, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway claimed that the question hasn’t been ruled out , but wasn’t discussed in recent days or during the call with Hillary Clinton:\nTrump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are “ looking to unify the country, but we haven’t discussed that in recent days, and I think that it’s all in due time ,” campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC in an interview, as quoted by Reuters. \nBut it STILL seems that Hillary knows something that we all do not – because she has said all along that it is not going to happen… that there isn’t even the slightest chance:\n\n\nSo, is she right about that?\nWhat will Trump do in the first 100 days?\nDon’t be surprised if campaign rhetoric ends up being just all talk. For Trump supporters who were, above all, opposing Hillary Clinton and urging her being prosecuted and held accountable – don’t hold your breath.

Post to Facebook Ford to reveal small EcoSport SUV on Monday in L.A., to sell it in U.S. Ford's decision to sell the vehicle in the U.S. reflects the growing trend of consumer preferences for crossovers and SUVs.   Freep.com: http://on.freep.com/2fFwptH     Ford to reveal small EcoSport SUV on Monday in L.A., to sell it in U.S. Brent Snavely , Detroit Free Press 1:04 p.m.   The EcoSport is one of four all-new SUVs Ford plans to launch globally over the next four years. Ford EcoSport Titanium S - Europa (Photo: Ford) \nFord said today it will reveal a new EcoSport crossover on Monday in Los Angeles and plans to bring the small SUV to the U.S. for the first time in the vehicle's history. \nFord's decision reflects the growing trend in the U.S. of consumer preferences for crossovers and SUVs. The EcoSport, first launched 13 years ago, has long been rumored as a vehicle the automaker would eventually bring to the U.S. as fuel economy standards get tougher and the popularity of small crossovers continues to grow. \nThe Dearborn automaker also confirmed that the EcoSport is one of four all-new SUVs it plans to launch globally over the next four years. \nFord announced plans to reveal the EcoSport on it's Twitter account and said the vehicle will be shown at an event headlined by DJ Khaled — a Miami-based hip-hop producer who has become famous for mini-esoteric discussions on Snapchat. It’s almost time to meet the all-new #Ford #EcoSport . See what @DJKhaled has planned on 11/14 by checking out his Snapchat at djkhaled305! pic.twitter.com/TP6xkjHEGJ — Ford Motor Company (@Ford) November 10, 2016 \nAccording to Fordpresents.com, Khaled will headline a three-day event called “Go Small. Live Big\" that will include special appearances by a number of other music artists. \nFord's event is the night before media events officially begin at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday. Show organizers say they expect more than 50 new cars and trucks will be revealed from Tuesday to Thursday. \nFord confirmed plans to launch four new SUVs over the next four years in February. The new models could be added either to the automaker's mainstream Ford brand or to Lincoln. The SUVs could be launched in North America. \nFord launched the first EcoSport in 2003. A second generation of the small utility vehicle launched in Brazil and other global markets in 2012. \nFord did not say where it would build the EcoSport that it will sell in the U.S. \nThe EcoSport is built on Ford's global subcompact platform, which is the basis for the Ford Fiesta in the U.S. and Europe. The Dearborn automaker currently makes the Fiesta at its assembly plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico.The EcoSport also is produced at plants in Brazil, India, Thailand and Russia. \nIn March, Ford said it would spend $217 million to make the Ford EcoSport at its Craiova Assembly Plant in Romania starting in the autumn of 2017. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

      "text": "Ford, Nissan, Others with Mexico Ties Gird for Trump Aftershocks \nThe results suggested that Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare is finally making headway in overcoming cost overruns and a delay of more than two years on the all-new $6 billion C Series, a model intended to compete with planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profit, announced this year’s second round of major job cuts in October. \nThe widely traded Class B shares climbed 5.6% to C$1.88 at 11:49 a.m. in Toronto Thursday after earlier advancing as much as 7.9%, the biggest intraday gain since April 28. Bombardier, which also makes trains, advanced 33% this year through Wednesday, more than twice the 13% gain of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index. \nTurnaround Plan Makes Progress \nBellemare unveiled plans three weeks ago to cut 7,500 jobs, saying they were needed to ensure competitiveness and improve profit margins. Both rounds are likely to save $500 million to $600 million a year by the end of 2018, executives said on a conference call Thursday. The company is about 80% through its February drive to cut 7,000 jobs, Bellemare said. \n“We’re executing on every single piece of our turnaround plan,” Bellemare said Thursday in an interview. “We are largely done de-risking the company.” Related \nBombardier Cuts 7,000 Jobs \nNow that the C Series is in service, Bombardier has one development program left, the Global 7000 business jet, he said. “And we are focused on that. We have this thing under control.” \nBombardier will provide more details on its financial goals for 2017 at a Dec. 15 investor day in New York. \n“Management’s cost transformation initiatives are taking hold and we believe investor confidence will continue to improve as this management team executes and delivers on its targets,” Walter Spracklin, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to clients. This $73 million Bombardier jet just completed its first test flight https://t.co/omvDKiDnis pic.twitter.com/V0yqsBT6vO — CNN (@CNN) November 5, 2016 \nBombardier expects to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter, meaning it’s likely to end the year with about $3.5 billion in cash on hand and available liquidity of about $4.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said in the interview with Bellemare. \n“We’ve improved our liquidity, and we are well-positioned for refinancing” debt that matures in 2018, he said. \nThe company has $1.4 billion of bonds coming due that year. Bombardier had about $9 billion of long-term debt as of Sept. 30 and $4.4 billion of accessible liquidity, after Quebec injected $1 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series program. \nThe manufacturer spent $320 million of its free cash in the third quarter, compared with $816 million a year earlier. Analysts watch the liquidity figure closely as Bombardier works through costs for programs such as the C Series and the Global 7000. Bombardier has predicted it will start generating free cash flow in 2018. \n‘Future Profitability’ \nBombardier posted an adjusted loss of $10 million in the third quarter, essentially breaking even on a per-share basis. Analysts had expected a 3 cent loss, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 9.7% to $3.74 billion, while analysts predicted $3.95 billion. \nThe third-quarter performance “suggests Bombardier’s underlying cost restructuring actions are on or ahead of plan, potentially positioning the company for better-than-expected future profitability as volumes begin to build for the C Series and Global” jets, Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said in a note to clients. \nFull-year revenue will be about $16.5 billion, at the low end of the company’s forecast range, while Bombardier maintained its outlook for cash-flow use at $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. \nIn the rail business, earnings before interest and taxes will exceed 6.5% of sales this year, up from a previous goal of more than 6%, Bombardier said. Profit in the business-jet unit is expected to be stronger than the previous outlook of about 6% of sales. \nBombardier said its loss in commercial aircraft will be $100 million less than the $550 million previously forecast. \nIn September, it slashed its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the C Series, saying delays in shipments of Pratt & Whitney engines would cause the planemaker to burn through cash more quickly than expected. Seven of the new aircraft are now slated to be handed over this year instead of the 15 previously planned. \nLast week, Bombardier flew its Global 7000 business jet the first time, a milestone for the delayed aircraft that puts the company on track to begin deliveries in 2018. The $72.8 million jet remains on track to make its commercial debut in the second half of 2018. \nBy Frederic Tomesco",

      "text": "Tweet \nEven though Ford hasn’t confirmed it, we know a reborn Ford Bronco is on its way. \nLong before a UAW rep spilled the beans about the manly model’s return, Bronco buffs were already giddy with anticipation. TTAC’s managing editor has hardly slept a wink. \nNow, word comes that there is indeed a development team hard at work on the model (expected to appear sometime in 2018), but you won’t find them in the vast lands bordered by the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. \nSources tell Australia’s Motoring that the Bronco is taking shape at Ford’s Asia-Pacific Product Development Center in the suburbs of Melbourne, deep Down Under. \nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise, as the resurrected Bronco borrows the global Ford Ranger’s T6 ladder platform. Both Ranger and Bronco are due to roll off the automaker’s Michigan Assembly Plant once the Focus and C-max take a hike south , but the Australian is responsible for shaping all products that use the T6. That includes the Everest SUV, a product foreign to U.S. eyes. \nReportedly, early Bronco test mules have been spotted near the company’s You Yang proving ground near Geelong, Victoria. \nThe Bronco’s final shape and specifications is still a mystery that Ford hasn’t shed any light on, but its direct competitor will be the next-generation Wrangler . That iconic (#iconic?) model won’t see its boxy, utilitarian shape change much, so expect a rugged, square-rigged Bronco when the model does go on sale stateside, likely as a 2019 model. \nNow, it would be nice if the Blue Oval fed the anticipation by releasing details on whether the model will come in two-door guise, or perhaps offer a removable hardtop. After all, a true off-roader calls for a feeling of danger and exposure to the elements that only comes through open-top motoring. For those too afraid to handle that, well, there’s always the EcoSport . \n[Image: Ford Motor Company]",

Auto Show Coverage \nThe EcoSport is a subcompact SUV currently built mostly for emerging markets like India and Brazil, but with the current craze of SUVs in the U.S. reaching a fever pitch, the company has decided to bring its own here.

      "text": "Ford, GM React to Trump Presidential Win Motor Trend 23 hrs ago Motor Trend Staff © Motor Trend Staff Ford-Motor-Company-headquarters-dearborn1 During his campaign for presidency, Donald Trump has threatened to renegotiate NAFTA and tighten up trade with Mexico, a market where both Ford and GM seek to expand in the coming years. But despite the potential negative consequences a Trump presidency may have on these automakers, they are taking the election results in stride, at least publicly.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo \"GM congratulates both candidates and parties on their hard-fought campaigns. GM looks forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the new Congress on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. manufacturing base,\" the automaker said in a statement, adding that it \"will continue to do its part to transform the future of mobility and contribute to America's competitive strength.\"\nFord, which has been the most prized red circle on Trump's target board, told Motor Trend, \"We congratulate the President-elect and new governors, members of Congress and elected officials across all levels of the U.S. government. We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs.\"\nAt the beginning of his campaign, Trump threatened to stop Ford from opening a new plant in Mexico , even saying he would impose tariffs on its cars shipped over here. Recently, Ford said it would move all of its small car production from the U.S. to Mexico over the next few years, substituting the cars with new products. Trump famously suggested Ford would \"fire all of their employees in the United States,\" to which Ford CEO Mark Fields retorted that no American jobs would be lost in the production shift.\nThe president-elect has also expressed discontent at GM's decision to spend $5 billion to expand its operations in Mexico. Just today, however, GM announced it would lay off 2,000 people and cut a shift at two of its factories due to slow sales. The affected plants include Lordstown, Ohio, which produces the Cruze , and Lansing, Mich., which builds Camaros and Cadillac sedans.\nIf Trump's protectionist policies see the light of day, small cars made in Mexico and shipped to the U.S. could become less appealing to U.S. consumers. Prices could go up $5,000 or more, warned Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at Original Equipment Suppliers Association, speaking with Reuters.\nWhile Ford and GM may have reason to worry, the mining and heavy equipment industries could benefit greatly. Investors are predicting that Caterpillar could benefit from Trump's plans to curtail regulation in the coal industry. Shares for the company increased nearly 7 percent earlier today.\nSource: GM, Ford, Reuters\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "title": "Not just Ford: Trump’s trade barbs threaten VW, Toyota too",
      "text": "Ford was a favourite target of Donald Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border throughout his campaign. Toyota and Volkswagen, as well as other U.S. carmakers, are just as exposed. Toyota and Nissan, Japan's largest automakers, were spared from Trump's critique by name on the campaign trail. Yet they, along with General Motors and VW, all rely on Mexican plants for millions of vehicles and a high volume of parts. That puts them at risk if the president-elect makes good on his threat to levy hefty taxes on cars assembled across the Rio Grande.\n\"Trump could, or will try to set up trade barriers,\" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. \"Automakers with U.S. factories will therefore be on the winning side. Mexico, the new El Dorado of the auto industry, could suffer.\"\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments. VW's Audi, BMW and Daimler each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the low-cost country, which Trump says has benefited at the expense of the American voters who propelled him to victory. Output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from two million to five million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.\nThe Republican candidate and real-estate developer grabbed headlines during his campaign by threatening to slap a 35 per cent tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He called Ford's plans for a new plant in Mexico \"an absolute disgrace.\"\nTrump would \"start a worldwide trade war\" if he decides to end trade pacts and uses anti-dumping provisions to impose widespread tariffs on other countries, said Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, requires only six months' notice of termination to Canada and Mexico and doesn't specify that the president would need congressional approval, he said.\n\"These other countries would retaliate. Prices consumers would pay would increase sharply. The Federal Reserve would then increase interest rates. It would be ugly,\" Grimes said.\nDespite that threat, U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union extended an olive branch to the president-elect.\n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country — and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford said in a statement. The company's plan to shift small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico was attacked by Trump during his first answer of the initial debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in September.\nGM and Fiat Chrysler said in separate statements they would work with Trump and the new Congress on policies that support manufacturing in the U.S.\nGermanexecutives attending an industry conference in Munich on Wednesday also expressed concerns about Trump's views. BMW is building a new car plant in Mexico's San Luis Potosi that's due to start production in 2019, while Audi started assembling autos in San Jose Chiapa in September.\n\"We need open trade,\" said BMW CEO Harald Krueger. The luxury automaker ships many of the SUVs assembled at its South Carolina factory to markets around the world and in turn exports sedans and Mini cars to the U.S. from Europe. \"We live off exports and imports. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.\"\nDaimler CEO Dieter Zetsche is among executives who held out hope that much of Trump's trade talk was campaign rhetoric and would soften with the practicalities needed to govern. \"Many things get said during the heat of an election campaign,\" Zetsche said. \"I hope and believe this is also the case here.\"\nFor Bob Lutz, the retired vice chair of GM, Trump's victory could ultimately help the auto industry if his advisers and Congress keep him from pushing his protectionist agenda too far.\n\"He's not a dictator,\" Lutz said in an interview. \"No one can go in and abrogate trade deals. There are some aspects of NAFTA that will probably be renegotiated, but he will probably be talked out of his crazier ideas.\"\nRather than threaten Japan auto imports with tariffs, Trump has pointed to wealth generated from the cars being sold in the U.S. to bolster his argument for America to pay a smaller share of the costs related to stationing troops in its biggest Asian ally's territory.\n\"Japan is ripping us off with the cars,\" Trump said at an Oct. 12 campaign event in Florida. In remarks to Ohio volunteers in July, he spoke of \"massive ships\" delivering vehicles to the U.S. from Japan, which he told Americans was \"rich because of us.\"\nJapan's automakers have combined capacity to build about 1.36 million vehicles annually in Mexico and have announced plans for new plants capable of assembling another 430,000 vehicles a year. Models built or planned for Mexican production and sale in the U.S. include the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Versa and Sentra, and the Honda Fit and HR-V. Toyota is shifting production of the Corolla from Cambridge, Ont., to a plant in Guanajuato, Mexico.\"\nIf NAFTA is going to be up for discussion somewhere down the line, that would affect Japanese companies very much, especially auto-related investments in Mexico,\" said Bob Takai, president and CEO of Sumitomo Global Research Co.\nBloomberg",

      "title": "Ford C-Max",
      "text": "John Voelcker Senior Editor \nThe Ford C-Max is a range of fuel-efficient hatchbacks that includes a C-Max gas-electric Hybrid model, and a plug-in hybrid C-Max Energi model. \nThe C-Max is part of Ford's global \"C\" family of cars, which includes the Ford Escape and Focus. The C-Max is built in the same Michigan assembly plant as those vehicles. \nNew for the 2013 model year, the C-Max was coined as a rival for the Toyota Prius, and now also competes with the likes of the Chevy Volt. \nMORE: Read our 2016 Ford C-Max review \nBoth C-Max models sit high and share common Ford design touches, including a large front grille opening meant to tie the C-Max to the appearance of the Ford Focus Electric, the company's only all-electric vehicle. For a tall hatchback, the stylists have done their best to give it flowing lines, including highlighted wheel arches and a slight haunch over each rear wheel. The effect is nowhere near as racy as the Focus five-door hatchback, but this car serves a different audience: buyers who want the highest gas mileage and a car that says it's a hybrid. \nInside, Ford's C-Max shares styling cues with the Focus hatchback and sedan. The modern styling, soft-touch surfaces, and chrome accents give it a more upscale look than the Space Age hard-plastic interior of the Prius. And the full-color gauge and information display behind the steering wheel can be configured to show the car's operating data in a variety of ways, depending on what the driver would like to see. \nThe C-Max models share a 2.0-liter inline-4 tuned specifically to work with Ford's hybrid system, which contains a pair of electric motor-generators that power the vehicle and recharge the battery in constantly changing ratios. Total power output between the engine and drive motor is 188 horsepower, or 54 hp more than the Prius' powertrain. In practice, that means that the C-Max engine doesn't struggle quite as much and sounds less desperate under the heaviest loads, like short uphill freeway on-ramps. \nThe hybrid C-Max sells in greater volumes, but the plug-in hybrid Energi model receives better fuel-economy ratings. The plug-in model is rated at 20 miles of electric range (down from 21 mpg) and 38 mpg combined (down from 43 mpg). In practical terms, this means most drivers can get 15 or more miles of electric-only travel before the C-Max Energi exhausts its battery pack and reverts to being a regular hybrid (with slightly lower gas mileage due to its higher weight and lower gearing). \nThe C-Max receives decent ratings from both the NHTSA and the IIHS, with the former giving both models four stars overall. The IIHS has only tested the C-Max Hybrid, and gives it top marks in all categories except the new small frontal overlap test, where it scores an \"Acceptable\" rating. The models include front and side airbags for both front-seat occupants, side-curtain airbags for the first and second rows, and a driver's knee airbag. They have the usual array of electronic safety systems, including stability control, traction control, and anti-lock brakes. \nSales of the C-Max were affected by complaints from early owners and journalists who were unable to achieve the lofty EPA fuel-economy numbers Ford originally claimed. As a result, the C-Max has had its ratings reduced two times, the first in August 2013 and then again in June 2014. Similar adjustments were made to other Ford and Lincoln hybrid claims. \nWhile the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid was originally rated at 47 mpg city, 47 highway, 47 combined, Ford lowered that rating to 43 mpg combined in 2013, following a pledge from the EPA that it would investigate the situation. Ford agreed to pay the buyers of 2013 C-Max models a set amount for the extra gasoline they presumably had to purchase. \nThen in June 2014, Ford lowered the C-Max ratings a second time, to 42/37/40 mpg after discovering errors in lab-test measurements and calculations for aerodynamic drag. Ford reached an agreement with the EPA to lower the ratings and send an additional check for the increased gasoline costs to all owners of 2013 and 2014 C-Max Hybrids. Altogether, six separate Ford and Lincoln hybrid models had their efficiency ratings reduced at the same time. \nThe new ratings are much closer to the real-world mileage of 36 to 39 mpg achieved by both reviewers and owners. That remains a credible number for a heavy and well-equipped five-door compact car, but the purpose-built Toyota Prius range still trounces it, delivering real-world gas mileage of more than 50 mpg combined (excluding the Prius V wagon, which is rated at 42 mpg). \nUpdates over the C-Max's lifespan have been few, but Ford has added its Sync 3 infotainment system to the hybrid hatchback; it replaced the much-unloved MyFord Touch interface.",

      "title": "Ford Explorer",
      "text": "Bengt Halvorson Deputy Editor \nThe Ford Explorer is one of the best-known SUVs in America. It was introduced in the 1990s as a truck-based sport-utility vehicle, but in recent years has been transformed into a more car-like crossover SUV with very good performance, and less of an emphasis on off-road driving. \nRivals include the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Honda Pilot and GM's crossover-SUVs (Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia) as well as the Toyota Highlander. \nToday's Explorer is front-wheel-drive-based, with all-wheel drive available as an option. All Explorers use an automatic transmission. The Explorer can seat up to seven, and offers a choice of 4- and 6-cylinder engines in trim levels that range from base to XLT, Sport, Limited, and Platinum. \nThe new Explorer \nIntroduced for the 2011 model year, the current Explorer trades in some rock-climbing ability for more all-weather comfort and family practicality. Ditching the body-on-frame design, the car-based Explorer arrived with seven-seat capability, electronic assistance for its all-wheel-drive system, and a 3.5-liter V-6 engine teamed with a 6-speed automatic. A turbocharged 4-cylinder engine became an option for the 2012 model year, and delivers up to 28 mpg on the highway—some 25 percent better than any Explorer before it. For 2013, a turbocharged V-6 was added as a sort of V-8 replacement. \nThe latest Explorer is among our top-rated vehicles for families for its interior and fuel economy as well as for its carlike handling and good safety record. It gets the highest rating of \"Good\" from the IIHS on all tests except the new and tougher small-overlap front crash, where it's rated \"Marginal\"—just one step above the lowest \"Poor\" rating. The NHTSA gives its highest five-star overall rating to 2013 through 2015 Explorers, though earlier models are somewhat lower rated. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Ford Explorer review \nThe current Explorer also includes all the latest connectivity systems, including a navigation system with Sirius Travel Link and Sync, which uses Bluetooth to enable voice control of some vehicle systems. There was also MyFord Touch, a system that used steering-wheel or voice controls to direct audio, navigation, and phone with a large LCD touchscreen to display the interface. It was been controversial, with some publications and customers pointing out glitches and difficulties in getting used to the system, but it is an option. \nIn 2017, it was replaced entirely with Sync 3, a system that doesn't escape faults. We've tested it in other vehicles and found it to be slick, albeit a little laggy and confused in certain situations, i.e. selecting day/night display modes during dawn and dusk. \nFord brought back the Explorer Sport badge in 2013. Instead of a two-door variant like its predecessor with the same name, this version uses the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 from the latest Taurus SHO, making 350 hp. It is paired with standard all-wheel drive and includes more standard features as well as suspension and steering improvements. Ford sees the turbocharged V-6 as a replacement for the Explorer's previous V-8 models, making it the closest thing to a performance-oriented Explorer we're likely to see. Its 0-60 mph times are a full two seconds quicker than the standard V-6 Explorer, too—while towing remains as high as 5,000 pounds . \nThe EPA has rated the Explorer as high as 28 mpg on the highway in 4-cylinder front-wheel drive guise, with all-wheel drive models earning 18 mpg city, 26 highway ratings. \nFor 2015, Ford added an appearance package on XLT models that creates a look more like that of the Sport model. This way, buyers can opt for the sportier monochrome look without moving up to the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. The package includes a gray grille and mirror caps, black lower body cladding, and body-color door handles, among other visual changes. \nA revised version of this Explorer goes on sale for the 2016 model year. The interior and exterior have been given a subtle once-over, with the exterior design now resembling a Land Rover's more than ever. The look is much more sophisticated, with finer details and a more cohesive front-end treatment. A Platinum model has been added at the top of the range, and there's a new 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder available as well, bringing the available engines to three. \nFor 2017, Ford has added a sport appearance package to lower trims that replicates the Sport trim's good looks for a lower price. Sync 3 also replaces the finicky MyFord Touch system with limited effect. \nFord Explorer history \nIn its past, the Explorer was more directly related to Ford's small pickup trucks and was offered in many more versions—everything from a manual-shifted three-door to a V-8-powered quasi-pickup. Introduced for the 1991 model year, the Explorer was distantly related to the Bronco II that it replaced. Compared to that stubby, basic two-door, the Explorer was packaged and marketed much more successfully. It practically inaugurated the SUV era in America along with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and quickly became one of the best-selling, most recognizable and popular vehicles in the U.S. market, with annual sales approaching a half-million. \nThose earliest Explorers were three-door and five-door wagons, and quite crude devices that drove like short-wheelbase compact pickups. In fact, there were still a few shared parts with the Ford Ranger truck. A shortened three-door Explorer Sport was offered through 2003, while a four-door Explorer Sport Trac with a small pickup bed was offered through the 2010 model year. \nThe first-generation Explorer came under fire in 2000 and 2001, when a number of rollover accidents—linked to underinflated or improperly specified Firestone tires—led to the model's recall and replacement of the tires. From that recall, and the hearings around it, grew the federal requirement for tire-pressure monitoring and also arguably sped the deployment of electronic stability control. It also severely hurt the Explorer's brand image, causing sales to plummet. \nThat happened despite the much-improved Explorer that emerged after a full redesign in the 2002 model year. Standard equipment included an independent rear suspension, and a third-row seat became an option for the first time. In 2006, more safety features were added, and the exterior styling was smoothed over. Through this era, the Explorer's interior functionality also got better, with usable seating space for up to seven, and third-row seating that became easier to use. Still, Explorer sales never had quite recovered after the tire-separation issue, and buyers started to migrate to more carlike crossover vehicles like the Toyota Highlander. \nThat Explorer was a better-handling, more refined vehicle than its predecessor—and still is a good recommendation for its towing capacity for those that don't need a full-size SUV. The 4.6-liter V-8 is the engine you'll want in that case; the 4.0-liter V-6 isn't responsive or smooth or particularly powerful. It's not much more efficient either: Explorers equipped with V-8 engines typically get about the same real-world mileage as V-6 models from that era.",

      "text": "Bengt Halvorson Deputy Editor \nThe Ford Escape is a five-passenger crossover SUV with sleek and modern styling, very good handling, decent cargo room, and plenty of technology features. \nWith the Escape, Ford has one of the best sellers in its class, alongside the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V. The most recent model was introduced in the 2013 model year after the first-generation model had a very long 12-year run. Today's model is sold in base, S, SE, and Titanium models. The new Ford Escape \nFord's best-selling SUV gets a mid-cycle update for the 2017 model year, adding new technologies, two new engines, a start-stop function, and a new look inside and out. \nNew front- and rear-end styling are part of the revamp, but the more important changes come under the hood. The base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is carried over, but mid-range Escapes now offer a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 (in place of a 1.6-liter unit) or a new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Power output is about 179 horsepower for the smaller turbocharged inline-4, and 245 hp for the 2.0-liter version. \nFuel economy improves slightly (both come with stop/start), and so does handling, with new springs and shocks. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Ford Escape review The interior was only slightly changed, with some new features such as fast-charging USB ports, updated climate and steering-wheel controls, and an electronic parking brake—but Ford says the addition of more soundproofing makes the Escape a quieter place to be. \nNew safety equipment will include forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, parking assistance, and lane-departure and lane-keeping assistance. However, the Escape's styling changes may not be enough to improve its \"Poor\" rating on the IIHS latest small overlap front crash test. Ford Escape history \nWhen it was first introduced in 2001, it picked up on the compact-crossover trend that was just emerging and almost instantly became one of Ford's best-selling vehicles. The Toyota RAV4 had started the niche, and was followed soon by the Honda CR-V. The Escape joined them as one of the most popular vehicles in the segment, with sales even increasing as the extended first generation aged. \nThat first Escape made good use of space in a small package thanks to its tall and squared-off profile, accommodating passengers and cargo nicely. It also offered the smallest amount of off-road capability thanks to its ground clearance and available all-wheel drive. The car-like ride and handling were a product of it sharing some underpinnings with the Mazda 626, and it continued as a comfortable small-crossover option through 11 years on sale, with updates including revised sheet metal for 2004 and larger upgrades for 2007. \nThe first Escape was a good choice for those who needed compactness and maneuverability yet wanted impressive safety and a flexible, spacious interior. Its original base engine was a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, making 130 hp. It was underpowered, coarse and unrefined. In 2005, this engine was replaced with a 2.3-liter making 153 hp—enough to power the Escape confidently enough, provided you don't carry a heavy load or need to pass quickly on the highway. The 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 that was available gave the Escape a very different character. It's worth noting that real-world fuel economy in 4-cylinder versions of the Escape often didn't prove to be much better than that of V-6 Escapes. \nThrough 2007, interior materials on all but the top Limited model were quite inferior to those of other vehicles in the Escape's class. The substantial refresh given to the model for 2008 fixed that, bringing upgraded materials throughout. At that time, the Escape also received new powertrains, including a 240-hp version of the 3.0-liter V-6 and a new 171-hp, 2.5-liter base 4-cylinder engine. By 2010, its entertainment offerings were upgraded to include SYNC, Ford's voice-driven controller for phone, audio, and navigation systems. \nThroughout its first generation, the Escape earned mostly good scores for safety. The most noteworthy exception is for 2001-2007 models without the optional side airbags, and frontal performance for 2001-2004 models. In the IIHS's new roof-strength test, which came in late in the first generation, the Escape got a mediocre \"Marginal\" score that kept it from getting the Top Safety Pick. Federal testers did not re-score the Escape after it changed its testing criteria for the 2011 model year. \nFord sold an Escape Hybrid from 2004 through 2012. Like other early Ford hybrids, the Escape used a system very similar to Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive, combining an Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine with electric motors in a unique transmission and a large battery pack. All-wheel drive was available, with about half of hybrid customers opting for it. The hybridized Escape was rated at 34 mpg city and 31 mpg highway. Many politicians chose to drive the Escape Hybrid as a way to drive a green American car. \nThe Escape also spawned the Mercury Mariner and the Mazda Tribute, both of which also offered hybrid variants at one time. Both were discontinued in the 2011 model year. \nFord Escape , 2013-2016 \nFor the 2013 model year, a brand-new Escape was introduced. The launch of the 2013 Escape wasn't an easy one, with a number of high-profile recalls that happened in the new model's first few months on the market. For the larger recall, more than 70,000 2013 Escapes sold in the U.S. with the 1.6-liter inline-4 were recalled for overheating that could result in a fire risk. T wo of the first few recalls were linked to its optional 1.6-liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. \nA trio of 4-cylinder engines were offered in this Escape, with a carryover 2.5-liter 4-cylinder being the most inexpensive choice. It was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, as were both other engine choices. A pair of new turbocharged 4-cylinders took over the Escape's performance duties: a 178-hp 1.6-liter turbo-4 was the mainstream engine choice, while a 240-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-4 was the quickest Escape offered in the 2013 model year. All versions improved on fuel economy, with some versions earning ratings of up to 33 mpg highway. \nThe Hybrid model did not return. In its place, Ford offered a more Prius-like gas-electric hatchback, the C-Max Hybrid . \nThis latest Escape remained in the same compact size class, but with more ample interior and cargo space, as well as new conveniences and features. A new flip-fold mechanism for the rear bench seat helps tuck in the headrests for easier cargo loading, as does a motion-sensing tailgate that opens or closes at the wave of a foot under the rear bumper. The Escape's electric power steering can park the car itself, with the driver keeping control over braking, while blind-spot monitors can alert drivers of traffic approaching from the side and rear. \nSafety improved over the first-generation crossover, but more advanced testing has challenged those initial good ratings. The new body structure helped the Escape earn the IIHS' Top Safety Pick status for 2013, but that rating was withdrawn for 2014 when the two-year-old car earned an embarrassing \"Poor\" rating on the new small-overlap front crash test. The NHTSA gives it four stars out of five overall and on most tests, with a five-star rating for side-impact protection. \nMyFord Touch was the Escape's first voice-controlled infotainment system. It ran audio, phone and optional navigation systems. For 2016, a new version of Sync, named Sync 3, took its place, with quicker and cleaner interfaces and better voice recognition. \nAs of 2015, Lincoln began offering its own more luxurious version of the Escape, called the MKC.",

      "text": "Deputy Editor \nThe Ford Fusion mid-size sedan is one of the best-selling family four-doors on the market. \nRivals include perennials like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, but the Fusion also competes with the Chevrolet Malibu, Mazda 6, Nissan Altima, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Subaru Legacy. \nIn its favor, the Fusion has more powertrain choices than many of those—including both a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. (The Fusion Hybrid , and its plug-in hybrid Energi variant, are covered separately.) \nThe new Ford Fusion \nThe Fusion was entirely redesigned for 2013 in stunning fashion. The Fusion was named The Car Connection's Best Car To Buy 2013, for its sleek, elegant good looks; refined performance; and fuel-efficient EcoBoost turbo powertrains. The Fusion has a premium-car feel and an impressive feature set. \nThe latest Fusion wears an entirely new design language that owes much to the themes seen on the Ford Focus. It's a sophisticated look, with some cues that echo details on everything from newer Hyundais to the latest Aston Martins and Audis. The cockpit design is formatted around MyFord Touch, a touchscreen controller for phone, navigation, climate and audio systems—though it's an option, not standard. \nEngines on the 2013 Fusion included a base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with 175 horsepower; a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with direct injection, 178 hp, and an estimated highway gas mileage rating of 37 mpg; and a 2.0-liter turbo-4 shared with vehicles from the Taurus sedan, Edge crossover, and the hot Focus ST hatchback. Most were fitted with a 6-speed automatic, although a 6-speed manual was initially available in 1.6-liter versions. That engine was discontinued after 2015. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Ford Fusion review \nWhile most Fusions make do with front-wheel drive, the top Titanium trim offers the option of all-wheel drive when paired with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine. The 2.0-liter almost needs the extra traction to put its potent power down. All Fusions use an independent suspension design that provides confident, and even sporty, handling. It's fun to hustle and also handles long cruises with comfort. The Fusion also has good interior packaging for a family sedan, with a good balance of front- and rear-seat room. \nWhen this generation was introduced, it offered a strong list of standard and available features. Those include Bluetooth with audio streaming standard, available leather upholstery, a rearview camera, and even park assist, which uses sensors and the electric power steering to put the car in tight spots with the driver only operating the brake and throttle. \nIn the 2014 Fusion , Ford introduced a new 1.5-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engine that returned almost the same performance as the 1.6-liter turbo-4 but with better fuel economy. It comes paired only to the 6-speed automatic and features an engine stop-start system to conserve fuel. The 2014 Fusion also made the inflatable rear seatbelt system that was originally offered in the Explorer available on the Fusion, and Ford added cooled front seats and a heated steering wheel to the sedan's options list as well. \nFor the 2015 model year , Ford quietly dropped the manual transmission and its requisite 1.6-liter turbo four from the Fusion lineup. The Fusion's other features remained: enduring styling, very good handling, and excellent crash-test scores from both the IIHS and the NHTSA. \nFor 2017, the Fusion received a very mild mid-cycle update, with a grille and headlights so subtly redesigned that you might miss them altogether. There's a new top-level Platinum trim, and a new powertrain option as well: the Fusion Sport offers this generation's first V-6, a 325-horsepower 2.7-liter turbocharged V-6, along with all-wheel drive. There's also the latest Sync 3 infotainment system, a redesigned center console with a rotary drive selector, and added active-safety systems including adaptive cruise control that now works all the way down to a stop and back up to highway speeds again. \nFord Fusion history \nThe Fusion name first appeared in 2006, effectively replacing the defunct Contour that had ended production after the 2000 model year. The first-generation Fusion received an styling and equipment update for 2010, when it added a hybrid version for the first time. The all-new second-generation Fusion debuted for 2013, along with not only another hybrid but the brand's first plug-in hybrid, sold as the Fusion Energi. \nBoth generations of Fusion were related to the Lincoln MKZ, which was also revamped for the 2013 model year with a more distinctive design. The first-generation Fusion also spawned the Mercury Milan, which was discontinued along with its namesake division in 2011. \nIn 2006, the first Fusion set a new look for Ford with a very prominent three-bar chrome grille and upright headlights leading to a more conventional look otherwise. Though the look was bold for the time, it aged well and still looked fresh several years later at the end of that model's run. That early Fusion also earned excellent reliability ratings (including the all-important approval of Consumer Reports ); it also gained kudos for quality from many other sources, and has held its resale value far better than the previous Taurus did. \nAnother reason the first Fusion resonated is that it simply was fun to drive. It helped that it was built on some of the same underpinnings as the previous-generation (pre-2009) Mazda 6, another vehicle lauded for its sport-sedan handling. Not counting pricier European luxury makes, the first-generation Fusion was quite possibly the best-handling mid-size four-door sedan available in the U.S. during its run on the market. \nThe base 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine offered from 2006 through 2009 was only adequate with the automatic transmission, but felt considerably peppier with the standard manual gearbox—a combination that was hard to find in some areas. The V-6 didn't stand out for its performance numbers—it only made 240 hp—but it felt strong in the Fusion and the 6-speed automatic transmission worked especially well with it. \nFor 2010, the 2.3-liter engine was replaced with a 2.5-liter that wasn't much more powerful but was considerably less noisy when pressed to perform. And the Fusion finally got Ford's larger, 3.5-liter V-6, making up to 263 hp. From 2007 on, all-wheel drive was been offered on the Fusion, but it was only available with the V-6 at first, and had slightly lower power ratings than front-wheel-drive models. All Fusions received a heavy face lift for the 2010 model year, as well. \nThe first-generation Fusion had a comfortable ride and a roomy interior, but for its first several years, up through 2009, it could feel a little drab inside. A redesigned instrument panel and new seats, along with some improved materials, brightened up the feel of the Fusion for 2010. Ford also stepped up the safety features for 2010; options included blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert. \nThe only common complaint with the 2006-2009 Fusions was that they didn't return the fuel economy of most mid-size rivals—most of which were slightly larger and had slightly larger engines. Despite the improvements for 2010, fuel-economy figures didn't become much better. \nFord remedied that for 2010, with the introduction of the Ford Fusion Hybrid, a model that paired a version of the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor system. The Fusion Hybrid was able to run on electric power at up to 47 mph and achieved an outstanding city rating of 41 mpg, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Changes were minimal from then on, until the Fusion was replaced for 2013.",

      "text": "November 10, 2016 — American / Success Stories | No Comments BaT Auction Success Story: Thunderbid Finds New Home with Ford Family \nThis just in from the buyer of the 1956 Thunderbird purchased via BaT Auctions just last month ( link ). \n“ Dr. Ember C. came from a Ford family. Her father always owned Ford cars and trucks and she kept that tradition with a series of Fords ending with her current Lincoln MKX. But she always longed for a Fiesta Red Baby Bird. When one came up on BaT she squealed, we sat together at lunch bidding and hoping we would win. The excitement of the bidding infected all of us and just as we were leaving the restaurant the news came in: WE WON. \nOn November 7, we took delivery of a ’56 Thunderbird. We plan to complete the restoration that was started by the previous owners and use it as a summer weekend driver. \nAri I.",

      "text": "Part Four: “Ah snap, we only have 24 hours!” Part Five: Reveal, drive to Vegas. \nTheir videos were reminiscent of Gas Monkey or any of the other hundred automotive-based reality shows out there. The episodes were entertaining as they sprinkled in a bit of humor, stressed about the build deadline and tossed in a few outtakes, too. If they step up their video equipment, the BDS content could be pretty entertaining going forward. \nIt's quite commendable that BDS chose to not only complete an extensive build in six weeks, but they also drove their pride-and-joy to Las Vegas from Michigan. Needless to say, if something weren't put together properly they would have found out at some point along the trip. And instead of some silly visual showing the truck pull up to the Las Vegas Convention center, BDS tastefully opted to wrap the series with a video of the Super Duty being put to the test in Moab, Utah - as it should.

      "title": "Ford Fusion Hybrid",
      "text": "Senior Editor \nThe Ford Fusion Hybrid is a gas-electric version of the automaker's popular mid-size sedan. \nWith the Fusion Hybrid, Ford offers two models: one which doesn't plug in to offer electric-only driving, and the Fusion Energi, which does plug in, adding to the Fusion's green credentials and boosting its overall fuel efficiency. \nRivals for the Fusion Hybrid include the Toyota Camry Hybrid, the first in this segment, which just underwent a refresh for 2015; the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, which now also comes in plug-in hybrid form; the Kia Optima Hybrid; and the Chevrolet Volt. \nThe new Ford Fusion Hybrid \nToday's Fusion Hybrid emerged in the 2013 model year. It and its Energi companion are by far the most fuel-efficient in the Fusion sedan range. \nThe cars share powertrains with the compact C-Max Hybrid and C-Max Energi hatchbacks, which are sold only as hybrids—unlike the Fusion lineup, whose five different drivetrain options include three gas-only versions. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid review \nThe two hybrid cars look almost identical to the gas models, with just badging and minor trim differences, as well as the extra charge port ahead of the driver's door on the Energi model. They provide better gas mileage ratings for budget-conscious shoppers who want to save at the pump. \nThe hybrids are more expensive, too. Base hybrid models start at about $2,000 more than their gas counterparts, but come standard with many of the features that are optional on gas-powered Fusions. \nThe two hybrid models of the sleek, fastback Fusion are both fitted with a smaller 2.0-liter gasoline engine and a slightly revised version of Ford's two-motor hybrid system, which together produce 188 horsepower. A new lithium-ion battery pack—smaller and lighter than the previous nickel-metal-hydride pack used from 2010 to 2012—takes up less room in the trunk. This powertrain is shared with the Ford C-Max Hybrid compact hybrid hatchback, the company's first dedicated hybrid (there's no gasoline-only version) and its first direct competitor for the Toyota Prius. \nWhile the 2013 and 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid models were originally rated at 47 mpg combined (47 mpg city, 47 highway) in June 2014 Ford lowered the ratings to 42 mpg combined (44 mpg city, 41 highway) after discovering errors in test measurements and calculations for aerodynamic drag. Ford agreed with the federal government to lower the ratings and send a check for the increased gasoline costs to all owners of 2013 and 2014 Fusion Hybrids, along with those of five other Ford and Lincoln models whose ratings were reduced at the same time. \nThe changes followed reports by numerous outlets, led by the prestigious Consumer Reports , that failed to achieve anything like the 47-mpg combined number. While it lauded the new Fusion Hybrid, the consumer magazine and most other reviews rarely got above 41 mpg for the Fusion Hybrid, some seeing as low as 36 mpg. The discrepancy is especially jarring because the first generation of Fusion Hybrids were widely acknowledged to deliver on their combined 39-mpg rating. The new, lower ratings still beat those for the latest Toyota Camry Hybrid (41 or 40 mpg, depending on model), as well as the most recent Hyundai Sonata Hybrid (38 or 37 mpg, again depending on model). The Honda Accord Hybrid, however, outdoes all of those cars at 47 mpg combined. The current Fusion Energi is rated at 38 mpg combined, and 88 MPGe, the miles per gallon equivalent to calculate mileage on the electric equivalent of 1 gallon of gasoline. \nOtherwise, the new Ford Fusion lineup has received high marks from our reviewers for its \"handsome, even stunning looks,\" generous interior space, and its taut roadholding. Dislikes included only average rear-seat headroom and the profusion of shiny plastic trim in the cabin. \nThe Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid was rolled out only to selected Ford dealers that have been certified to sell plug-in cars. It's one of two Energi plug-in hybrid models—the other being the C-Max five-door hatchback—that share a virtually identical powertrain. The Fusion Energi shares the engine and hybrid system of the hybrid Fusion, but it has a larger lithium-ion battery pack in the trunk, along with a charging port on the fender. Its major difference is that you can plug it into the wall to recharge it, which will give you up to 15 miles of all-electric range, versus the Hybrid's 1 mile or so, after which the Fusion Energi reverts to being a conventional hybrid. \nOnly minor changes have been made through the 2016 model year. A refresh to the Fusion Hybrids and the entire Fusion lineup is expected for the 2017 model year. Changes are likely to focus on the exterior styling, interior layout, and technology offerings; we expect the number of standard and optional active-safety items will increase. The hybrid powertrain could see some tweaks but will probably be largely the same as what is offered today. \nFusion Hybrid history \nThat first-generation Ford Fusion Hybrid launched in 2010, and was a well-engineered, quiet, responsive hybrid sedan that looked \"normal\" and yet delivered remarkably high gas-mileage numbers. It also earned excellent safety ratings—like the IIHS's Top Safety Pick —which the latest 2013 model also earned. That first Fusion Hybrid four-door sedan was Ford's second hybrid model, following the now-departed Escape Hybrid. The first-generation Fusion Hybrid hit the market in spring 2009 as a 2010 model—based on the updated 2010 version of the Fusion that had originally launched way back in 2005. \nThe 2010-2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid used a 2.5-liter engine paired to Ford's two-motor hybrid system, with a total overall peak power of 191 hp and a combined EPA gas-mileage rating of 41 mpg city, 46 highway—better than the Camry Hybrid's at the time, which was 34 mpg combined. The Fusion Hybrid as well as that of the Nissan Altima Hybrid, also 34 mpg (that model was discontinued). It was sold as a well equipped model, containing many of the luxury features fitted to the high-end Fusion SEL model. On the road, it was quiet, responsive, and delivered 40 mpg or better in real-world usage—leading to rave reviews for this first full hybrid U.S. sedan.",

      "text": "#2016 #ford #fordmustang #musclecar #mustang #ponycar The Ford Mustang is a pony car that was introduced at the New York World's Fair in 1964. The car was an instant success, causing a fervor that would not be equaled for another 50 years. The Mustang entered its sixth generation in 2015. 2 basic model ranges were sold; the base model and the GT. It features an independent rear suspension, right hand drive models, the first 4-cylinder engine since the 1980s SVO, SYNC infotainment, a backup camera, and radical exterior styling changes. A coupe and a convertible are offered. Engine offerings are the turbocharged 2.3L EcoBoost I4, the 3.7L Cyclone V6, and the 5.0L Coyote V8. Transmission choices are a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. The GT model comes with the Coyote V8 engine, leather seats, MyFord Touch infotainment, and an upgraded audio system. Seen at a car show in Prescott, AZ. No comments have been added yet. Add a Comment:",

However, the model has been a no show at the annual event. Instead, it can be now confirmed that Ford will be unveiling the new EcoSport at an event on November 14, in Los Angeles, USA. The unveil will also mark the subcompact SUV's entry to the North American market. \nThe 2017 EcoSport facelift is one of the four new SUVs that have received updates for the new year, apart from the Kuga, Everest and the Explorer. The facelift will make its way to India as well, only next year to take on the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza , Mahindra TUV300 and the likes in the segment. The refreshed model will receive styling updates to the front and rear, apart from the updated tech. 7.51 Lakh * On Road Price (New Delhi) FIND OUT MORE 2017 Ford EcoSport Unveil \nThe design is now in-line with that seen on the new Ford Edge SUV and includes a bold new grille with chunkier chrome bars, revamped headlamps, while the rear will receive updates to the tailgate, tail light cluster and bumper. While several international versions have done away with the externally mounted spare wheel, India will retain the same on the 2017 model. \nPower on the Ford EcoSport will continue to come from the 1.5-litre diesel, 1.2-litre petrol and 1.0-litre turbocharged EcoBoost engine options in India. Transmission options will include a 5-speed manual and an automatic unit. Internationally, the Fiesta-based subcompact SUV also comes with AWD system as optional, while the Indian version will continue with the outgoing FWD setup. 2016 Ford EcoSport \nThe Ford EcoSport facelift will also see upgrades to the feature list that are likely to include a new touchscreen infotainment system with SYNC3 that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; LED DRLs and much more. The cabin will see tweaks as well with new materials and upholstery as part of the package. \nThe Ford EcoSport arrived in India in 2013, soon after its global debut at the 2012 Auto Expo. The model has been a game changer for the American carmaker in the country, but has seen stiff competition from newer models eat into its market share in the segment. The update is likely to help Ford grab a chunk of the lost sales figures.",

      "title": "Ford Figo Cross (Ka Trail) Unveiled At 2016 Sao Paulo Auto Show",
      "text": "Twitter 0 \nIt was speculated that Ford will unveil the new Ford EcoSport 2017 at the 2016 Sao Paulo Auto Show, but that didn’t happen. Instead, the American automaker introduced an all-new Ford Ka-Trail pseudo crossover at the event. So, why are we talking about this Brazilian model here? Well, the Ka-Trail is nothing but the Ford Figo Cross which could also make its way to the Indian car market. \nSpeculations were on rife that Ford is working on a tougher Figo, which could be named Figo Cross. In fact, several renderings of the crossover were released to speculate the possible design. Here is all you need to know about the new Ford Ka Trail also known as Ford Figo Cross – Ford Figo Cross (Ka Trail) Launch Date \nThe American automaker will launch the Figo Cross in the Brazilian markets by the early next year. Ford is yet to make any comment on whether the cross will be launched in India or not. But, we expect the Figo Cross might come to India towards the end of 2017. Â Read More – New Ford Endeavour Price, Features, Specs & Other Details Ford Figo Cross (Ka Trail) Price \nThe regular Figo hatch is priced in the range of Rs 4.54 lakh to Rs 7.27 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The Cross version will be slightly expensive than the hatchback sibling. We expect the new Figo Cross would cost around Rs 5 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. Ford Figo Trail Images Ford Figo Cross (Ka Trail) Specifications \nThe Brazilian-spec model is likely to be powered by a 1.5-litre Sigma four-cylinder petrol engine that churns out 110bhp of power and 146Nm of peak torque. Power will be transmitted to the front wheels via a 5-speed manual gearbox. \nThe India-spec model will come in both petrol and diesel fuel options. The Figo Cross is likely to get a 1.5-litre petrol and 1.5-litre diesel engines from the new Figo hatchback. The base model is expected to get a 1.2-litre petrol engine that also powers the Figo twins. Transmission options will include a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed DCT. Read More – Ford Figo 1000km test drive review Ford Figo Cross (Ka Trail) Design \nThe Ka Trail looks like a jagged-up Figo/Ka hatchback. It comes equipped with usual crossover elements to give rugged appeal. The cross comes with higher ground clearance, black plastic cladding around the wheel arches and bumpers, faux silver skid plates, ‘Trail’ decal across the side profile, blackened ORVM caps, door handles and roof rails. The flared wheel arches have been fitted to 15-inch gun metal alloy rims shod with dual-purpose tires. \nInside the cabin, the Figo Trail gets fabric plus leather upholstery for seats with contrasting stitching in orange and green.

This time around, Ford has revealed that it will be globally unveiling the EcoSport facelift on November 14 in North America. Coincidentally, the occasion also marks the EcoSport’s debut in North American market. The facelifted version is expected to be introduced in India sometime by mid of next year. India recently received a powerful diesel engine version earlier this year.\nThe India-bound 2017 Ford EcoSport is expected to continue being offered with a 1.5-litre TDCi diesel engine that generates 99bhp of power, while the petrol versions will continue to be the by a 1.5-litre Ti-VCT and the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine. The international market will however get a new 1.5-litre 'Dragon' three-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine which might come paired to an AWD system.\nAs for design, the new model is likely to sport redesigned headlamps and tail-lights, redesigned bumpers and a new hexagonal grille. The side profile is expected to remain the same except for new alloy wheel design. Inside, the compact SUV will get a revised upholstery, new centre console, new steering wheel and Sync infotainment system with a new colour display. More details about the facelift version will be known post its official debut.",

(AP) — A newly released report says a dangerous chemical has again been detected at a Superfund site in New Jersey where Ford Motor Co. dumped paint sludge decades ago.\nThe Record reports ( http://bit.ly/2g2gEzl ) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says 1,4-dioxane was detected at the Ringwood Superfund site in August. The amount and location are similar to those found earlier this year.\nThe EPA says the chemical, which is believed to cause cancer, was found in concentrations above the state's groundwater standard.\nA small amount was also detected offsite at a Ringwood State Park pond. The report released on Thursday says there were no detections downstream toward the Wanaque Reservoir.\nFurther tests haven't been scheduled. An EPA spokesman says the agency plans to issue cleanup options for the contaminated water next summer.\n___\nInformation from: The Record (Woodland Park, N.J.), http://www.northjersey.com",

      "text": "Ford Mustang GT with Armytrix Straight Pipe Valvetronic Exhaust Is V8 Heaven 11 Nov 2016, 12:44   Tuning Don't try to make a list of all the aftermarket exhaust goodies currently available for the S550 Ford Mustang in the US, unless you have quite a lot of time to invest in this aftermarket adventure. Even so, don't expect tuners from abroad to leave the pony in stock form. Truth be told, especially when it comes to the 5.0-liter V8 of the GT trim, the engine deserves an exhaust setup that allows it to fully express its feelings and emotions. And we're here to bring you the latest example of that, one that comes all the way from Malaysia. This is where exhaust developer Armytrix is based and, with the developer delivering some of the loudests pieces on the market, their Mustang GT offensive is no exception. We're dealing with a new development, as the Armytrix website only mentioned the 2.3-liter EcoBoost 'Stang at the time when this article was published. The five-oh was gifted with a straight pipe setup, which, we have to admit, sounds like something that comes straight from vee-eight heaven. Nevertheless, having such a screaming setup active all the time could easily turn into a nightmare, whether for those inside or outside the car. Fortunately, though, the setup does include Armytrix's Valvetronic hardware. As you can imagine thanks to its name, this involves butterfly valves that control the soundtrack, so you Blue Oval machine won't deliver its full-decibel attack all day long. And while the exhaust developer usually allows customer to control the sound using a remote control and/or a smartphone app, we don't get to see such details, at least not yet. The piece of footage at the bottom of the page allows us to get a respectable aural sample. However, we have to warn you that the street testing methods seen here may be less than legal. And we're not just talking about the dB limit of the exhaust.",

Photo by Chris Lee, SLU 'not very athletic,' so Ford demands emotion, intensity Buy Now Chris Lee \nSt. Louis University forward Jalen Johnson competes for possession against Greenville forward Shane Smith in the second half during an exhibition game between St. Louis University and Greenville on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016, at Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis. Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nThere is a drill run in St. Louis University basketball practices in which volume is the most important factor. When you dunk, you holler or scream or bellow. Just as long as you make noise. \nFor coach Travis Ford, it’s about getting his new players to show some emotion. No one is louder at a SLU practice than Ford, and he wants it to rub off on the Billikens. \n“I like the attitude and effort of our team, they’re just really struggling to figure out their personality, to figure out the toughness you have to play with and the attitude,” Ford said. “You have to have your shoulders back a little and grit your teeth. Our team doesn’t have a lot of emotional guys. They’re great guys, but there’s not much excitement to a lot of them.” \nFord connects emotion to aggressive play and aggressive play to toughness. Coaching a team he has called possibly the least athletic in the country, he will require all of the above from his players when they open the season Friday night at home against Ball State. \nReturning players are unanimous in their summation that Ford runs a more grueling practice then they have seen in the past. He wants to play faster and with greater intensity. \nThose attributes are among the things he promised fans when he was hired in April, so the lack of emotion has been somewhat frustrating. \nIn some ways, it’s about players adjusting to a change in culture. \n“Before, we were told to keep your emotions in — not to show emotions or show your passion,” guard Davell Roby said. “We were to show our passion through our play. Coach Ford wants you to bring it and grit your teeth with attitude. That’s how Coach Ford played and how he likes it.” \nFord inherited a team that includes seven returning players and freshmen Jalen Johnson, Zeke Moore and Elliott Welmer. Expectations are minuscule after the Billikens went 11-21 each of the last two seasons under coach Jim Crews. \nThey averaged 65.8 points and surrendered 72 per game, and leadership was questioned throughout the season. Now Ford is trying to force-feed a leadership lesson. \nHe regularly stops practices and implores players to talk, whether it be shouting direction on defense or encouraging teammates. \nHe questions their willingness to be verbal, a characteristic that does not come naturally to many. \n“He always says you have to have attitude, have emotions — especially with the bigs,” said forward Reggie Agbeko, a self-described “chill guy.” \n“He wants us to scream when we dunk because he feels it’s infectious,” he added. “It helps us play better, especially the way he wants us to play.” \nDefensive tenets will be to pressure, protect the lane, challenge shots and rebound. Ford said the Billikens have not yet been good at keeping players out of the lane but are better at defending shooters. \nIt is not an area in which he is willing to compromise. \n“We’re going to press,” he said. “We’re going to get after it. We’ll see how it goes. We want to be smart but we’ve been working on pressing every day. We’d better be a great rotating defense because we’re not blocking a lot of shots.” \nFord has repeated that SLU could struggle offensively at times, so the focus on defense has been significant. The Billikens lost three of their top five scorers and return only 41 points a game. \nNow comes a new offense. \nFord wants SLU to “strike” when the fast break is available. Otherwise, the halfcourt offense will rely heavily on spacing, ball screens and driving and kicking the ball out for open shots. Set plays will play a bigger role than previously. \nFord is having to get everyone on board and adjusted to a system that they weren’t recruited to play. \n“Some are better than others, but they can all adapt,” he said. “Some are struggling more than others with the pace we’re trying to play. But we’re force-feeding at this point. We may adjust as we get into it how fast and aggressive we’re going to be.” \nFord said he has installed about 50 percent of what he would normally have prepared as the season approaches. \nHe concedes that the Billikens probably will rely heavily on jump shooting and a fair amount of 3-pointers. Senior Mike Crawford led the team in 3s last season (with 43), and Roby topped the team in accuracy, shooting 39 percent. \nSLU also has perimeter threats in point guard Jermaine Bishop and newcomers Welmer and Johnson. But he hopes SLU can play inside out, getting plenty of touches for Agbeko, Welmer and centers Austin Gillmann and Matt Neufeld. \nFord has suggested that the measure of this team will not be wins and losses. But ultimately, winning will come down to fundamentals and execution because trying to match up athletically does not figure to work well. \n“It doesn’t make us bad, we’re just not very athletic. It’s not who we are,” Ford said. “You’re not going to see many dunks in warmup lines. It’s not a knock. You just have to know who you are and adapt. So, we’d better be smart, physical and tough and grind it out.” \nStu Durando",
