      "text": "  \nMicrosoft stock prices, once a sore point for the company and perhaps the main reason that Steve Ballmer is no longer CEO, have rebounded recently, buoyed by renewed energy introduced by new CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft’s position as a leader in cloud computing, which is becoming a darling of Wall Street. \nThis morning, financial investment firm Goldman Sachs upped their rating on Microsoft from “hold” to “buy,” and set a target price for the company’s stocks at $68. Microsoft’s stocks have been trading at just under $60, so the target would mean about a 15% upsurge in the company’s value. \nStreetInsider quotes Goldman Sach’s Heather Bellini on Microsoft’s Azure upside: \n“Azure is the #2 market share vendor in the cloud space, and has grown 100% or more yoy eight of the last ten quarters, and in fact growth accelerated in C3Q16. With a large Microsoft customer base and strong C-level relationships, we believe Azure can continue to grow revenue and improve margins over time. Our views are supported by channel partners as well, who have commented recently that they are seeing strong uptake of Azure amongst enterprise customers, particularly as it relates to hybrid cloud,” said Bellini. \nMicrosoft received a strong push from the market after its latest earnings, and continues to do well with Azure, with Office 365, with a changing perception of the company as “the new Microsoft,” and with some good PR coming from its popular Surface line of computers, and even from getting some Linux love. \nGoldman Sachs expects the company to earn $102 billion in fiscal year 2018, and climbing to $111 billion in FY ’19. Do you think good times are ahead for Microsoft?  ",

      "text": "Authored by Google Security Research , natashenka \nIn Chakra, function calls can sometimes take an extra internal argument, using the flag CallFlags_ExtraArg. The global eval function makes assumptions about the type of this extra arg, and casts it to a FrameDisplay object. If eval is called from a location in code where an extra parameter is added, for example, a Proxy function trap, and the extra parameter is of a different type, this can lead to type confusion.",

      "title": "HubStor Expands Hybrid Cloud Storage for Seamless Archiving and Offsite Data Protection With Microsoft Azure",
      "text": "  09:37 AM EST HubStor Expands Hybrid Cloud Storage for Seamless Archiving and Offsite Data Protection With Microsoft Azure HubStor adds transparent storage tiering to the cloud without needing to disturb users, reconfigure applications, or add new infrastructure. KANATA, ON   \n​HubStor Inc., the market’s only data-aware hybrid cloud storage for business, today introduced the availability of new seamless cloud stubbing for invisible storage reduction and tiering of data to Microsoft Azure without impacting users or applications. IT leaders can now connect their current storage infrastructure to the cloud to reduce backup and storage costs by as much as 87% while providing better protection from threats like Ransomware. \nWith this announcement, HubStor now offers two stubbing methods: the universal shortcut which it has offered since launching the service earlier in 2016 and its new seamless stubbing agent for Windows Server. \n“ Unlike cloud gateway appliances that present a new storage mount point in the client’s environment, our approach enables customers to painlessly cloud-enable their existing storage investments, ” said Elizabeth Lam, VP of Marketing, HubStor. “ IT professionals want to use the cloud to store data that is no longer active, and they need to do this without changing workflows or adding new intricacy that they have to manage. Our new seamless stubbing method is the stress-free way to make it happen. ” \nStorage Tiering to the Cloud \nTransparent stubbing in file systems transforms original data into ghosted files within on-premises primary storage so that the content still appears to users and applications just the same, but the size on disk for the ghosted files is almost zero. When a user or application opens a file that is a ghost, the stubbing agent fetches the original data from the cloud without the user or application knowing. \nHubStor recommends using the policy controls in its virtual cloud gateway to stub targeted subsets of data. To mitigate retrieval requests to the cloud, HubStor provides a configurable caching feature so that any retrieved items remain local for a set period. That way, if inactive data converts back to active again, subsequent retrievals will fetch it from the local cache, minimizing downloads from the cloud. As well, HubStor provides the ability to opt-out certain applications and process IDs from triggering shortcut retrieval requests. \nOptimized Backup and Disaster Recovery \nBy reducing the storage footprint on-premises with seamless stubbing, IT leaders can defer spending on new storage while significantly minimizing the amount of data being backed up and replicated offsite. With most of the inactive data ghosted, recovery time objectives are improved. In the secondary site, HubStor’s seamless stubbing agent needs to be installed to ensure the cloud-integrated shortcuts retrieve as expected. \nRecovery from Cloud Storage \nHubStor includes an ‘Export App’ which handles bulk recovery scenarios, including the ability to replace ghosted items and recover data from the cloud on demand. \n“ The zero lock-in approach that we provide to the cloud is critical to our clients, ” said Stephen Tuckwell, Director of Operations, HubStor. “ It amazes people when they see how without difficulty we reduce their on-premises storage footprint, and then how quickly we can recover it too. ” \nAvailability \nThe new feature suite is generally available and can be used by any HubStor subscriber. \nAbout HubStor \nHubStor provides data-aware hybrid cloud storage for businesses needing to protect, manage, search, and recover unstructured data in a highly secure manner using public cloud infrastructure. \nHeadquartered in Kanata, Ontario and currently serving clients in the United States, Europe, and Canada, HubStor is the world’s first data-aware cloud storage solution. Delivered exclusively on Microsoft Azure, HubStor is a Microsoft partner and a member of the Microsoft Enterprise Cloud Alliance. \n###",

      "text": "  \n(Reuters/ Lucy Nicholson) Shown in photo is Microsoft's logo taken after the company purchased LinkedIn Corp. \nThere is no word yet from Microsoft regarding its rumored Surface Phone that is believed to arrive some time next year specifically targeting the masses. A lot of fans are hopeful it will materialize as it is expected to feature the Windows 10 Mobile. \nReports are hinting that entrepreneur Panos Panay and his team are working on a Surface Phone, a much smaller version of the Surface with the capacity to make phone calls. Panay is the Corporate Vice President for Surface Computing at Microsoft. \nWhile Microsoft has yet to reveal the name of the rumored device, it is expected to come in three variants - the consumer model, business edition, and enthusiast variant. The enthusiast variant is said to be the most high-tech device among the three. The device will also come in three various storage capacities from 64 GB to 128 GB. It is also expected to feature a 4 GB and 6 GB RAM. \nFurthermore, it is also likely that the Surface Phone will come with a Snapdragon 830 processor that is due for release in the first quarter of 2017. Other reports mentioned that it might also run on Intel's Kaby Lake processor. Advertisement \nThis would possibly explain why Microsoft is delaying the device since Kaby Lake is still yet to be released. In addition to this, rumor has it that the device will be able to run on both iOS apps and Android on Windows 10. \nAdditionally, a USB-C feature may come with the device with a liquid cooling technology. It is also believed to come with a compass, proximity sensors, barometer, and a 20 MP Carl Zeiss rear camera. \nRumors suggest that the Microsoft Surface Phone will feature a fingerprint sensor on its display, which is considered a feature on next generation smartphones. Moreover, there is also a possibility the device will support Win23 applications. \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone is expected to be released in April 2017. Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News",

      "text": "Why Microsoft Office Will Dominate The Next Decade As Well Nov.17.16 \nOffice VP Rajesh Jha spoke on the UBS global tech conference. \nWindows hegemony is ending and I wasn't optimistic the company could repeat that success. \nJha's talk helped me understand the future of Office better and appreciate its competitive advantage. Once in a while I look into Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) when it's hitting lows or prospects are bleak to see if it is attractively priced. They have a lot of great products and customer captivity so if you can buy their shares for cheap that's great. Sometimes I do get a bit confused about all the things they are doing from Minecraft, cloud, Office and Windows to hardware like handsets and Xbox. It didn't always make a lot of sense to me. Click to enlarge Source: Hosam Kamel, Microsoft developer I still don't get it completely but the UBS global conference helped me understand the Nadella Microsoft a little bit better and especially the future of office. I'm writing this in Google Docs and seriously want to look into switching to Office 365 now. One mission accomplished by Rajesh Jha who is Microsoft's Executive Vice President of the Office Product Group. The few times I've written about Microsoft I've been bullish as there's a lot I like about the company's competitive advantages and valuation matters. My primary concern for some time has been the landscape which is changing. Work and personal computing are increasingly taking place on mobile devices. Microsoft Windows dominated the desktop OS market but that position didn't carry over to mobile. That OS dominance had been the foundation of Microsoft's ability to sell products for a long time. Its fleet of productivity software is doing well and also selling cross OS. I had my doubts about the future and the competitive advantages of the suite. Clearly, or so I thought, it doesn't possess the moat Windows secured. Jha put things in a little bit of a different light for me: \nIn Office we have billions and billions of data points as our users interact with our products. They are signaling us. When I share a document with you, Brent, that's a signal. If I e-mail if somebody sends me e-mail and I dwell seven or eight minutes on that e-mail versus my typical minute or two, that's a signal. But it's not just these type of subtle signals which also sound kind of creepy. To give some examples: through Wordtap Office helps you find older documents you have written which are relevant to the one you are writing now so you can quickly insert relevant stuff in the current one you are working on. I write over a hundred articles every year and it would be amazing to have access to a feature like that. When you e-mail a number of people (above a treshold) you get data on how many of them actually opened the e-mail. These data based features aren't implemented to let you view more relevant ads and earn more money off of you but to advance your productivity and help you get more out of your workday/life. I love this as a customer but I also love it as an investor. As a customer of Microsoft in the past it sometimes felt like you were held hostage. You would have to shell out your hard earned cash to get their mediocre products but switching costs were just way too high. Everyone was working with Microsoft products, there were compatibility problems, you had to learn to use a new software package, etc. Now it feels like Microsoft is actively trying to make my experience better and add value to my life in order to earn my money. As an investor I love it for several reasons: 1) Because it is a more sustainable strategy to add value to your customers lives 2) Because in order to benefit from the value added features of the Office suite you got to give them access to a lot of data and Microsoft's knowledge about you becomes their proprietary data. Meaning, you can't switch away from them without suffering through a period where you are experiencing a deterioration of the value added experience. 3) Microsoft's sprawling range of products starts to make more sense if you consider them part of one holistic strategy to serve and bind you. 4) As Microsoft collects more and more data on you that it can use to add value to your life it can monetize its customers increasingly more effectively. Or in the words of Jha: \nSo I guess what I'm saying is the more usage we have and the more users we have, the more data we have. The more data we have, the more right we earn to give them premium value as a part of E3 or E5. So that's the basic pieces of how we are adding E5 value. What the conference presentation did for me is enlighten me that the Office suite and other Microsoft products could potentially grow into a business with a moat comparable to that of Windows or even greater, something I did not consider previously, while adding much more value to the lives of its users. About 1.2 billion people in the world use Office and with every document they type, with every e-mail they write, with every Skype call they make, with every presentation they put together and every One Note they save Microsoft is increasing the data advantage it has on a productivity suite provider that wants to compete with them. They can compete on price and basic services but they won't be able to compete with the quality of value added data based services.

      "text": "Loading the player... Stocks remained near session highs Tuesday going into the last hour of trade, as oil prices surged and tech stocks including Apple ( AAPL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) bounced back.\nThe Nasdaq led with a 1.1% gain as it retook its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average was fractionally higher. Volume was tracking lighter on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Monday.\nOil, gold miners and internet stocks spearheaded the advance in the stock market today. West Texas intermediate crude prices surged 5% to above $46 a barrel, as OPEC sought to save its deal to cut production.\nAmong blue chip winners, Microsoft and Verizon Communications ( VZ ) were up more than 2% each, followed by 1.5% or higher moves by Chevron ( CVX ) and Exxon Mobil ( XOM ).\nApple scored a 1.5% gain to create some distance from its 200-day moving average, which it tested during Monday's decline. The stock wasn't fazed by a late Monday regulatory filing that disclosed hedge fund Greenlight Capital cut its stake in the iPhone maker by nearly 1.7 million shares in Q3.\nNewspapers and generic drug makers underperformed, as did retailers -- despite better-than-expected October consumer spending data. Retail sales rose 0.8% in October, above projections for a 0.6% increase. Excluding autos, sales also rose 0.8%; excluding autos and gasoline, sales climbed 0.6%. Economists expected respective gains of 0.5% and 0.3%.\nHome Depot ( HD ) was the Dow's biggest loser, falling 4% to slide below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. The stock is building a flat base with a potential buy point at 139.10. The home improvement retail giant reported Q3 results that topped views and raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $6.33, meeting current estimates.\nOn the IBD 50, NetEase ( NTES ) leapt 5% after a buyback plan of up to $1 billion worth of its U.S. shares during the next 12 months. The Chinese online gaming stock is trying to recoup losses from 4% and 8% drops the past two weeks. Shares are 7% below the 50-day line and 15% off an Oct. 14 intraday high.\nStamps.com ( STMP ) scored a 5% gain as it pulls further away from a 100.42 buy point cleared Nov. 7 in brisk trade. It's now extended from that entry. The electronic postage provider earlier this month delivered a fourth straight quarter of triple-digit profit growth and revenue gains above 66%.\nRELATED:\nThe Case For A New Secular Bull Run In Stocks",

      "text": "Surface Hub \nPlus, any other devices that Microsoft decides to roll out on to from now on. \nIt pretty much sounds like a multi-platform dream, and it certainly is. But how does UWP handle all the different variations on its platform? Each device is different and has its own unique characteristics. The answer in this case is “Extensions \nAs you might expect, Windows 10 has a single “core” which runs on all devices, in exactly the same way. Then for those little extra’s, the UWP platform provides an “Extension” component that is specific to each platform. However, these extensions are also expressed on all the other platforms, so your code doesn’t break and you write the same code as if you were writing for them all. Where a device doesn’t support a certain feature (say the Holographic API on an Xbox), then the code simply does nothing, it doesn’t error, it doesnt crash, your code still works but nothing actually happens. For those platforms with that feature, lights start shining, the bells ring and the choir sings out with joyful praise. \nAlso as part of this “Extension” framework, Microsoft gives you the ability to test if a feature is available or not, allowing you to write different code depending on whether the feature is active, like if you want to use a devices accelerometer if it has one, or use a virtual joystick on a desktop with a touch screen, or fall back to keyboard if hat isn’t available. Sure, there is a bit of thought to go in to building for “Any \nWhen we start looking at building games under UWP, there is a lot of support (that is constantly growing) from third parties. As you can see most of the major engines and frameworks already support the Universal platform out of the box, making it even easier to publish your game as a UWP app. \nUnder the hood, UWP Games are just a DirectX surface and you can write games using native DirectX in either C# or C++, there are even Visual Studio Templates “out of the box \nNow that UWP apps can be deployed / tested and run by anyone with a Retail Xbox, we can go wild and try out our own games to see how they run on the big screen. Once you lick all the bugs and get it just right, you can publish that game “as is” to the Xbox Store. Well, once you have your project accepted by the team (which is even easier for UWP developers now) \nThere is one other caveat, that you need to also have a Windows Store developer account. This normally costs about £19 for an individual, a little more for a company account. You can either get this yourself, or when you are accepted by ID, you will get this account plus a load of other software completely FREE. Up to you. \nOnce you have everything ready, getting started couldn’) 1: Install the “Dev Mode Activation 2: Launch the “Dev Mode Activation 3: Once complete, your Xbox will automatically refresh and then ask you to restart. This will now boot your Xbox in to UWP developer mode with a completely separate sandbox inside your Xbox. Your Retail settings / apps are still safe on your Xbox, you just can’t access them from developer mode. This shows you all the apps / games installed plus a ton of other developer details. Take note of the Tools IP in case Visual Studio doesn 5: The first time you connect to your Xbox from Visual Studio (selecting the deployment as remote and selecting the Xbox, as shown here) you will be asked for a code to pair the Xbox. You get this code from the Developer Portal on the Xbox in the “Pair with Visual Studio section. 6: Done. Just make sure you Run in “Release” or “Master” \nAnd that’s it. You are up and running. The security of the setup ensures that you (and only you) can connect to your Xbox in dev mode and deploy apps, so long as you use the same Microsoft account for everything. You can still sign in other gamers, using their GamerTags for local multi-player (although you can’t grant gamerscore ). \nFor the demo’ What’ \nRight, so you have your project ready, plans are afoot and you know what you either want to build or have a tech-demo (or even a full project) ready. To get ready to be published on the Xbox and Windows Store (for games) you need to be registered with the awesome ID@Xbox program. in the past some developers have been a bit disillusioned with the responses to the program but Times have changed . The team has evolved (especially with UWP deploy now coming to light) and it’ \nMy recommendation (especially if you have a mobile game already or the beginnings of a desktop app) is to apply just for Windows 10 first, get your project out there in the hands of players and then either publish it as a UWP to Xbox or then also apply for the Xbox tier to build a native game (although check the next section for more detail on that). Windows 10 has much easier access but has all the same rewards for all ID developers, it also has fewer requirements and certifications to get published (you can’ \nThe key here is that you are getting your game out as early as possible, getting it in to the hands of players and gaining presence. I state this in the video but you must be prepared for the amount of footwork you need to put in to promoting your game with the general public. ID will be behind you every step of the way to take your content further (many ID games are now even getting in front of Major Nelson these days, thanks to ID). I will stress though, expect a lot of work, ID won’ Key Differences between UWP & \nTo round this session up and to allay some of the concerns and comments I’ve either heard or been asked about UWP on Xbox, I’ \nin short, UWP is simply easier. It’s a friendlier platform and the key benefit is that the single project you build, is also directly shippable on all of Microsoft’ \nWhile at FutureDecoded , the VISR-VR team showcased an awesome VR project called Botanika aimed at helping children and adults who struggle to cope with the effects of autism (it’s also a fun game for anyone btw ). This game was written in Unity, running as a UWP using the Vive VR setup. To make it even more amazing, the lead developer spent 10 minutes converting the project over the HoloLens (the night before the event no less) and had it running perfectly. Granted it wasn’t the full scope of the project but all the key elements were there, all now using HoloLens’s gestures to control the game instead of the \nWhen publishing UWP games to the Xbox, there are slightly fewer resources to native games (about 70% of resources are available) but there are also fewer certification requirements, meaning less headaches trying to figure out why a controller keeps getting disconnected. As the demo’s show, there is a LOT you can get done with that 70% (remembering, it’s 70% of a very powerful beast, do not be fooled in to thinking it’ \nIf you get invited in to the Xbox Native group, which is a tougher crowd and you need your project to shine, you will be given 2 developer enabled Xbox’s and a couple of years to get your project “finished” \nA great number of developers are also taking up Microsoft’s offer of getting a “ Preview ” version of their title out even earlier to consumers. Something not offered on other platforms. Yes, it’ \nI cannot stress more, just how much extra effort is needed to get a native Xbox game out, apart from the stricter certification requirements (which with some engines, you can run into trouble if it’s the engine causing the issue). Most certification builds take months of testing and validation to get ready.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft announced today that Cortana is gaining a new skill; the digital assistant can help you to manage you lists for the holiday season. \"Whether it’s planning a holiday meal, buying gifts, getting things done before you head out for vacation, or keeping track of who’s naughty or nice, you can use your voice or type to quickly create a new list, add to an existing list when inspiration strikes, and pull up your lists just when you need them on any device.\" \nThe feature is exclusive to English speakers in the United States for now, which isn't surprising. It is available on Windows 10 PCs and phones, as well as iOS and Android; however, Microsoft's announcement didn't confirm whether you can use it with Cortana on the Xbox One, although there doesn't seem to be any reason that you couldn't. \nFor more advanced functionality, Cortana also integrates with Wunderlist (and has for some time). You can sign into your Wunderlist account by going to Cortana's Notebook and then selecting Connected Accounts. Doing this will add features such as the ability to add due dates to a to-do list.

      "text": "Nick Kolakowski has written for The Washington Post, Slashdot, eWeek, McSweeney's, Thrillist, WebMD, Trader Monthly, and other venues. He's also the author of \"How to Become an Intellectual,\" a work of comedic nonfiction. nick.kolakowski@dice.com nkolakowski \nThis week, Microsoft launched a preview of its Azure Bot Service. Billed as a “bot service that scales on command,” the platform integrates with Microsoft’s templates for building bots, as well as the ability to quick scale up (or down) in response to demand. \nMicrosoft is following an industry trend that has seen Facebook and other tech firms release some type of bot platform over the past several months. Facebook’s bot initiative, which kicked off in April, allows developers to deploy bots for Messenger, its messaging platform. Whether associated with Slack, Kik, Facebook, Microsoft, or WeChat, many of these early bots are designed to automate either content delivery (weather, news, etc.) or customer service (answering questions and troubleshooting product issues). \nMicrosoft is betting it can stand out from that growing pack in two ways: by offering a variety of platforms for bot usage (including Skype and Teams, the latter a Slack competitor), and by allowing developers to leverage the computing power of Azure, including its machine learning APIs . The bots will supposedly interoperate on third-party platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, Kik, and personal Websites (via a REST API). \n“We want every developer to be able to build bots as the new application for every business and every service,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the Build developer conference in March, when the company first unveiled its interest in the technology. Developers, he added, should have the ability to “infuse” intelligence into the bots, opening them to respond to a greater variety of situations. \nAt that event, Microsoft unveiled the Microsoft Bot Framework , which includes SDKs for bots (in C# and Node.js) and tools (Bot Framework Emulator for Mac and Windows, along with a Visual Studio Template in C#). Also check out Microsoft’s BotBuilder on GitHub : \nIn a corporate blog posting Nov. 15, Lili Cheng, a distinguished engineer in Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, again highlighted the Azure Bot Service’s reliance on the Microsoft Bot Framework, in addition to Azure’s “serverless” (re: cloud) environment. “Integrated continuous deployment support means that you can use your preferred DevOps tool chain and commit code to source control systems such as Visual Studio Team System, GitHub, and BitBucket,” she wrote, “and then automatically publish the code into Azure to continuously improve your bot.” \nThose interested in what Microsoft has in store for bots can check out the company’s dedicated Azure Bot Service page .

      "text": "\nThe South Korean electronics giant announced its partnership with Microsoft to bring more developers to its open source operating system, Tizen.\nSee also: Samsung offering $10,000 reward to Tizen app developers 6 days ago Samsung is slowly expanding its Tizen portfolio – mainly in the form of smartwatches and smart TVs – but while the open source OS gives the company more freedom and autonomy compared to, say, Android, the major drawback here is that Tizen just doesn’t have enough apps. Look at the recently launched Gear S3 , for instance: its specs are undoubtedly one of the best out there, if not the best. The design is flawless (at least in my opinion), but there is a huge problem aside from its price tag: apps are lacking and the quality of those that are available isn’t all too great.\nWell, it seems like Samsung is really convinced that Tizen has the potential to grow. The company has announced today that it would be collaborating with Microsoft on “open source projects, such as .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms” in order to facilitate .NET support for Tizen. .NET is a Microsoft-developed framework that helps developers create apps more easily.\nIn fact, Samsung will be releasing the first preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen today for .NET developers:\nThe first preview supports mobile application development with device emulators and an extension to Visual Studio with full IntelliSense and debugging capabilities. Support for Smart TVs, wearables, and other IoT devices will be added in future releases.\nOn top of that, Samsung released open source codes for Tizen RT, which is currently used in its smart fridges and AC units. According to the company, there are over 50 million devices powered by Tizen right now, and it’s only set to grow further. The success of Tizen will largely depend on its app support, so I’m curious to see how this collaboration will contribute to the growth of what Samsung seems to think is the next OS.\nThe success of Tizen will largely depend on its app support, so I’m curious to see how this collaboration will contribute to the growth of what Samsung seems to think is the next OS.\nWould you switch to Tizen if its app support were significantly better?

      "text": "Russia blocks Microsoft's LinkedIn network - Daily News Egypt Thursday November 17, 2016 Russia blocks Microsoft’s LinkedIn network Russia's communications regulator has ordered the country's internet providers to block access to LinkedIn's website Jobzella Email \nRussia’s communications regulator has ordered the country’s internet providers to block access to LinkedIn’s website, after a court ruling has found the social networking firm guilty of violating a data storage law.Russian internet regulator Roskomnadzor announced Thursday the professional networking site had been added to a register of violators and submitted for blocking by internet operators. \nThe ban comes after a Moscow court last week rejected an appeal and upheld an August decision that LinkedIn broke a controversial new law that requires personal data of Russian users to be stored in the country. The ruling also told LinkedIn to stop giving users' data to third parties without informing them. \nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft and based in the United States, is the first major social network to be blocked by Russian authorities. It has over 6 million registered users in Russia. \nIn a statement to the news agency AFP, the social network said it was starting to hear from members in Russia that they can no longer access LinkedIn. \"We remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request,\" the statement added. \nThe Kremlin said that the decision was \"in strict accordance with the law\" and that President Vladimir Putin did not plan to interfere in the case. When asked whether the move might stir fears of online censorship, government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were \"no such concerns.\" \nInternet crackdown or fear of espionage? \nA Russian law passed in 2014 requires foreign messaging services, search engines and social networking sites that store the personal data of Russian citizens to do so on Russian servers. Sites that breach the law are added to a blacklist and internet providers are obliged to block access. \nThe law prompted a storm of criticism from internet companies but entered into force in September 2015. LinkedIn is the first such service to be taken to court under the law. \nLeonid Volkov, opposition activist and founder of an NGO called Society for the Defense of the Internet, called the current standoff \"a new page\" in Russia's treatment of the web. \"Roskomnadzor has never before had a mandate to directly confront IT giants,\" he wrote on Facebook. \nRoskomnadzor's spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky told the Russian news agency Interfax that representatives of LinkedIn had requested to meet with officials from the agency and that senior staff were settling a date. And Putin's advisor on the internet German Klimenko told Rossiya-24 television he expected that \"LinkedIn will meet the conditions and will be unblocked.\" He also suggested that the law on personal data may need to be \"clarified\" or \"amendments will be submitted.\" \nuhe/jd (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date News, Price Rumors: Q1 2017 Launch Is Likely? Joe Bacaron Nov 17, 2016 08:01 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Microsoft/ Surface Book \nThere's no news yet on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date although the rumor mill alleged that it's going to come out early next year, along with the Surface Pro 5. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book 2 will reportedly retail at $2,399 which is very expensive for a laptop. Its just $600 less than the revolutionary Surface Studio, which costs $2,999. For comparison, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar retails at $1,799, while the 15-inch MacBook Pro is still cheaper at $2,399. \nAccording to CNET , at that price tag, you can already purchase a pretty good Windows tablet along with a laptop. \nThe price for the Microsoft Surface Book 2 could still change, however, during the release date itself. \nAs to the specs, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 will have a 13.5-inch display at 3000x2000 or good for pixel resolution. It will have an 8GB of RAM with 256GB of internal storage. It will have NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 memory. In relation to the battery life, it will reportedly last 16 hours of heavy lifting. That's four more hours better compared to its predecessor.   \nBut what people are not too excited about is the fact that the new model is still using the old sixth-gen i7 processor. Fans have been demanding that Microsoft Surface Book 2 be equipped with the new Kaby Lake processor but that's not happening. \nThere's one drawback, however, as the Surface Book 2 is a bit thicker compared to the original device, The Verge reported. \nWatch out for more news and rumors on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date, which will be published here when they come along.",

      "text": "Neural Networks Applied To Machine Translation Written by Sue Gee   \nBoth Microsoft and Google have announced significant improvements to their interactive translation tool thanks to neural networks. \n\nThe Microsoft Translator team has announced that it is powering all its speech translation, for Skype and mobile devices, through neural networks. The blog post states: In addition to the nine languages supported by the Microsoft Translator speech API, namely Arabic, Chinese Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and Spanish, neural networks also power Japanese text translations. These ten languages together represent more than 80% of the translations performed daily by Microsoft Translator. \nTo see the level of improvement you can expect, there is a Try & Compare feature on the Microsoft Translator website where you can see the outcome of the old and new methods of translation - statistical and neural. For the supplied phrases Neural does seem to perform better: \n\nHowever, when I typed in some promotional material from a Spanish supermarket \"Elegir a la carta una buena hamburguesa\" I was shown an accurate translation \"Choose a good hamburger á la carte\" and one that missed the point entirely: \"Choose a letter a good hamburger\". I was initially surprised to discover that the former was the old Statistical approach but then as Statistical is influenced by the frequency of being asked to translate menus and restaurant reviews. However, the example is probably an anomaly and I'm not going to argue with Microsoft's opinion that the use of neural networks is producing superior translations. The blog post presents this graph used to promote the idea that we can expect future improvements. \n\nOn the same day as the Microsoft blog post, Barak Turovsky, Product Lead for Google Translate also made an announcement about putting Neural Machine Translation into action with an update to Google Translate: \nIntroducing this roll out, Turovsky writes: Neural Machine Translation has been generating exciting research results for a few years and in September , our researchers announced Google's version of this technique. At a high level, the Neural system translates whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar. Since it’s easier to understand each sentence, translated paragraphs and articles are a lot smoother and easier to read. And this is all possible because of end-to-end learning system built on Neural Machine Translation, which basically means that the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations. \nGoogle Translate is using Neural Machine Translation with eight language pairs: to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. According to Google these languages are the native languages of around one-third of the world's population - however if you take into account people who speak them as second languages or have a good grasp of them the proportion of the mobile device and website users is significantly higher, likely to be the vast majority. \nMachine translation does seem to be close to being the babel fish of Douglas Adam's vision. Building translation devices into a wearable with an ear piece is the next challenge. More Information",

      "title": "Microsoft quietly launches preview of Windows 10 'Office Hub'",
      "text": "By James Walker 2 mins ago in Technology Microsoft has launched a Windows Insider version of its new Office Hub feature coming with next year's Windows 10 Creators Update. The app provides a single place to view recent documents, monitor Office installs and check your subscription status. Microsoft released the app in beta form today. It comes as an update for the existing \"Get Office\" app that's preinstalled on Windows 10 PCs. Get Office is essentially useless bloatware that advertises Office to new PC users, simply providing a link to purchase the suite. With today's Insider update, the app has gained a whole new purpose, including a rebranding to \"Office Hub.\" Office Hub is thought to be a key part of the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update . Its existence has been rumoured a few times over the past few months but it has not been publicly announced by Microsoft. The app acts as a centralised repository for all the Office applications, akin to the experience provided when logging into Office.com online. Office Hub preview in Windows 10 - Image via MSPoweruser MSPoweruser Office Hub's homepage features a showcase carousel that provides getting started tips for using Office. There's also links to your recently opened documents from all the Office apps and a pane to open individual programs. It's a simple screen that consolidates your Office activity into one view. The My Account section of the app provides links to online support pages. It includes information on the number of PCs Office is installed on, shortcuts to download the Office mobile apps and details of any extras bundled with an Office 365 subscription. A separate Programs menu provides a description of each Office app, ranging from Word and PowerPoint to Skype, OneDrive and Sway. Wunderlist is also included, indicating Microsoft now regards the popular to-do list app it acquired last year as one of its own products. The final section of the app, Documents, offers an extended Recent Documents list that lets you find files you've been working on in a chronological list. Office Hub preview in Windows 10 - Image via MSPoweruser MSPoweruser The current Office Hub app is a basic experience that may only be part of Microsoft's plans for the feature. It currently provides a desktop version of the existing Office.com landing page, bringing little extra functionality for existing Office users. It's unlikely people will open Office Hub to find a recently viewed file instead of just launching the app it was created in. Microsoft is thought to have wider ambitions for Office Hub though. Previous rumours have suggested Office Hub could be integrated into a new Cortana-style taskbar widget, enabling one-click access to recent Office files. Microsoft may combine its two most important consumer products, Windows and Office, tightly coupling them for a more seamless experience. It could look similar to the \"MyPeople\" taskbar contact selector coming with the Creators Update. The current state of Office Hub can be viewed by opening the Get Office app on the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10. The Windows 10 Creators Update will roll-out to all Windows 10 users in March 2017, bringing with it new 3D and virtual reality authoring tools as well as productivity improvements.",

      "text": "Tweet In May this year, we reported on Microsoft's upcoming plans to bring its SQL Server to the Linux platform, providing developers and organizations with freedom of choice for both cloud and local infrastructures when it comes to implementing a powerful database server. And now, it looks like Canonical prepared a public preview of SQL Server on Linux, allowing Ubuntu users to get familiar with it. We all known that companies dedicated to open source software won't replace the free and powerful MariaDB or MySQL solutions with SQL Server, but it looks like Microsoft's relational database management system promises support for Docker containers and enables choice of data types and development languages. Using Microsoft SQL Server saves costs, adds an extra layer of performance, and improves scalability.",

      "text": "Microsoft Gives Windows Insiders A Peek Of Its Office Hub App By Adnan Farooqui on 11/17/2016 08:54 PST \nMembers of the Windows 10 Insiders program have been given an early look at Microsoft’s upcoming Office Hub app. It’s expected that the company is going to launch this app with the Windows 10 Creators Update that’s due to be released early next year. The new Office Hub app is actually an update to the Get Office app on Windows 10. From the looks of it, the app is going to enable users to install Office apps, access their files, and do more from one central location. \nThe Office Hub app will enable users to view their recent documents as well as easily install Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and more. Users will also be able to view their account details and manage their installs right within the app. \nIt even includes a dedicated section for Help and Training which contains easy to understand quick start guides so that users can brush up on what’s new in Office Hub. Though this feature hasn’t been added yet, it’s expected that even Cortana might be baked into Office Hub at some point. \nThat’s quite possible actually since we still have a few months before Microsoft is due to release the Windows 10 Creators Update so it has a lot of time to make any changes and improvements to the Office Hub app. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "PREV \nAnother issue: You have to make the time to be creative while keeping the trains running. Folks simply aren't going to be able to go all whiteboard all the time. \nSo who will really covet the Surface Studio? I think the Surface Studio may resonate with those of us who fantasize about creating, but are mired in ops. The real customer for Surface Studio may be the Excel-oriented person who wants to look right brained. \nSurface Studio starts at $2,999 and ships in early 2017. The argument for that price is that if you combined a PC and a large digital workspace the cost is warranted. \nA few quick observations: The fit and finish were strong, but all the ports in the back of the base could become clunky over time. Surface's Dial is an interesting device and could allow for differentiation, but we'll need apps and productivity gains to make tool a must have. I'd argue most of us love to draw on a PC like a drafting table. But how many of us will reach into our wallets for the Surface Studio? At $2,999 and up, it's unclear whether enterprises will buy into the Surface Studio. The PC meets drafting table may be seen as a perk for engineers, developers and creatives, but we'll see. \nMicrosoft's Surface Studio appeal to creatives fits in with its productivity strategy that revolves around the cloud and Office 365. It's just a bit of a stretch to see the Surface Studio being a bring your own device play (it's too big to lug into the office). Instead, Microsoft is betting that creatives will go for Surface Studio over Apple options and convince their companies to buy it. \nBottom line: Surface Studio will do well and break some ground, but I don't think Microsoft will win creatives. That's ok since spreadsheet and Office jockeys who want to create once in a wile will be a larger audience. Join Discussion",

      "text": "in: News | November 17, 2016 | by: Jagat Review Direct Release: NVIDIA and Microsoft Accelerate AI Together \nGPU-Accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit Now Available in the Cloud on Microsoft Azure, and On-Premises with NVIDIA DGX-1 \nSINGAPORE — November 15, 2016 — To help companies join the AI revolution, NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate AI in the enterprise. \nBy optimising the first purpose-built enterprise AI framework to run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs in Microsoft Azure or on-premises, enterprises now have an AI platform that spans from their data center to Microsoft’s cloud. \n“We stand at the beginning of the next era, the AI computing era, powered by a new computing model,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO and founder of NVIDIA. “Our close collaboration with Microsoft means companies have the fastest AI platform, the most scalable solution with NVIDIA DGX-1 and Tesla GPUs, and the best tools to transform any product or service.” \n“We’re working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world’s most pressing problems,” said Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research Group. “By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we’ve made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.” \nThis jointly optimised platform runs the new Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK) on NVIDIA GPUs including the NVIDIA DGX-1™ supercomputer that utilises Pascal GPUs with NVLink™, and on Azure N-Series Virtual Machines, currently in preview. This combination delivers unprecedented performance and ease of use when using data for deep learning. \nAs a result, companies can harness AI to make better decisions, offer new products and services faster and provide better customer experiences. This is causing every industry to implement AI. In just two years, the number of companies NVIDIA collaborates with on deep learning has jumped 194x to over 19,000 companies. Industries such as healthcare, life sciences, energy, financial services, automotive, and manufacturing, are benefiting from deeper insight on extreme amounts of data. \nThe Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit trains and evaluates deep learning algorithms faster than other available toolkits, scaling efficiently in a range of environments — from a CPU, to GPUs, to multiple machines — while maintaining accuracy. NVIDIA and Microsoft worked closely to accelerate the Cognitive Toolkit on \nGPU-based systems and in the Microsoft Azure cloud, offering startups and major enterprises: \n● Greater versatility : The Cognitive Toolkit lets customers use one framework to train models on premises with the NVIDIA® DGX-1 or with NVIDA GPU products, and then run those models in the cloud on Azure. This scalable, hybrid approach lets enterprises rapidly prototype and deploy intelligent features. \n● Faster performance: When compared to running on CPUs, the GPU-accelerated Cognitive Toolkit performs deep learning training and inference much faster on NVIDA GPUs available in Azure N Series servers and on premises.(1) For example, NVIDIA DGX-1 with Pascal and NVLink™ interconnect technology is 170x faster than CPU servers for the Cognitive Toolkit. \n● Wider availability: Azure N-Series virtual machines powered by NVIDIA GPUs are currently in preview to Azure customers, and will be generally available in the near future. Azure GPUs can be used to accelerate both training and model evaluation. With thousands of customers already part of the preview, businesses of all sizes are already running workloads on Tesla GPUs in Azure N-Series VMs. \nNVIDIA and Microsoft plan to continue their collaboration to help optimize the Cognitive Toolkit for NVIDIA GPU’s in Azure and as part of a hybrid cloud AI platform, when connected to NVIDIA DGX-1 on premises.

      "text": "0 0 \nOver the years, Microsoft has been known to offer extended support for a variety of products and services they offer. What extended support means, at its core, is that after the regular support period ends, customers can benefit from an addition period of support, sometimes with a fee included. \nWith Office 2007, Microsoft seems to have taken a new path of not offering extended support. In an official statement, Microsoft said that Office 2007 users will no longer have the option to extend support, but will continue to receive regular support until that period ends. The lifeline for Office 2007 will be cut 12 months from now, so users that are still fond of using Microsoft’s 2007 version of the office suite still have plenty of time to adjust and upgrade to a newer version. \nThe reasoning behind this sudden abandonment of Office 2007 is clientele demanding less and less extended support for Office 2007 due to the fact that a lot of people are upgrading to Office 365 , the latest version of Office. With Office 365 popularity growing, Office 2007 has fallen behind to such an extent that Microsoft no longer sees it fit to receive extended support. \nMicrosoft is advising people currently using Office 2007 to consult with their account manager so that they can plan ahead and prepare for the upcoming changes or even prepare for a migration of services to newer versions that still provide extended support. However, since extended support will only cease 12 months from now and regular support is still in effect, there is still plenty of time to take measures. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "  \nIf you followed the news about Microsoft’s annual Connect() developer conference yesterday, you may be aware that the company announced some surprising news: not only did Microsoft join the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member , but Redmond also revealed that Google had joined the .NET community, which you can see as an acknowledgement that the software framemork remains definitely relevant today. \nIndeed, Google is actually not the only one technology giant to support the .NET developer community, as Samsung also joined the .NET Foundation Technical Steering Group earlier in June. Today, the Korean company announced that it has partnered with Microsoft to enable .NET support for Tizen, its open source operating system that currently “powers 50 million Samsung devices” including Smart TVs, wearables, smartphones and smart home appliances (via Android Authority ) \nThe company is releasing today a first preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen which will “enable .NET developers to easily build Tizen applications for Smart TVs, wearables such as the Gear S3, smartphones, and IoT devices.” Support for Smart TVs, wearables and other IoT devices is expected to be added in the future. “Source code will also be contributed to Tizen and .NET open source projects,” added the company. \nIn the press release, Samsung’s Executive Vice President and Deputy Head of Software R&D Center Seung-hwan Cho shared his hope to bring more developers to support Tizen through this new partnership: \nSamsung is excited to be a part of the .NET community. .NET has an extensive developer base and great potential. Through thoughtful and progressive collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung is expecting to create unique development experiences for both Tizen and C# developers, enriching the Tizen ecosystem. \nWhile Samsung definitely helped Google’s Android achieve massive momentum with its popular Galaxy line of smartphones over the years, Tizen has allowed the Korean company to not rely on Google’s software for its other portfolios of smart products including wearable and TVs. These new product categories remain highly competitive markets today as Google’s Android Wear and Android TVs operating systems have yet to reach the same levels of dominance that Android claims on the smartphone market today. \nAs for Microsoft, getting more developers using the .NET framework will be definitely welcome, though it’s worth noting that making it easier for developers to bring more apps to Samsung’s Tizen OS may not help the company’s own Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 for IoT get more traction. You can learn more about Visual Studio Tools for Tizen by checking the Tizen developer website . In this story stream:",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft adds Office Hub app to Windows 10 preview For months, Microsoft has been bundling a Get Office app with Windows 10. Until now, it's been little more than an Office 365 ad. All that's about to change, based on the new Office Hub app included with the latest Windows 10 preview release. | Topic: Enterprise Software \nThe new Office Hub app appears in recent Windows 10 preview builds. \nEvery installation of Windows 10, including those on brand-new PCs, includes a Get Office app. In current releases, that app is little more than an ad for Microsoft's Office 365 subscriptions. But that's about to change, if the behavior of the app in recent Windows Insider releases is any indication. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows \nOn the most recent Windows Insider Fast ring release (Build 14965), the Get Office app acts as a management dashboard on a system where you're signed in to an active Office 365 subscription. \nBrad Sams flagged the new features in a post this morning , and I can confirm on my test systems. \nThe first clue that things have changed is the name of the app as shown in Task Manager. Instead of being listed as Get Office, it appears as Office Hub Application, with Get Office as a child task. This app was previously called Get Office \nThe name of the executable file in current publicly released builds is OHub.exe; the new name is OfficeHubWin32.exe. In both cases, the full file details identify it as Office Hub Application. \nIf you've signed in to a recent Windows 10 Insider preview build with an account that's linked to Office 365, opening Get Office offers a multi-tabbed management experience. \nThe Home tab displays an overview of recent documents with links to installed desktop apps. Clicking the user name in the upper right corner allows you to sign in with a different account. You can sign in with a Home/Personal account or a Business Enterprise account and switch between them easily. \nThe Home tab lets you switch between Home and Business/Enterprise subscriptions. \nClicking the Documents tab opens a much longer list of recent documents, with a link at the bottom to browse for a file that isn't in the list. \nThe My Account tab offers access to the benefits included with a subscription, with links to manage payment options, install desktop apps, and share an Office 365 Home subscription with another member of your household. \nPreviously, most of these tasks required signing on to a web page. \nThe Help and Training tab is a valuable resource for new users, with links to online help resources, tutorials, and support forums. \nThe app is available through the Windows Store; if you're an Office 365 subscriber and a Windows 10 Insider, it's worth a closer look.

      "text": "New partnership with Microsoft aims to expand app availability on Tizen New partnership with Microsoft aims to expand app availability on Tizen Posted: Tags : Samsung - Samsung + Microsoft - Microsoft + Tizen - Tizen + Looking back on Samsung and their activities in 2016, the company kicked out some pretty solid handsets, Albeit for the debacle with the Note 7, the Galaxy S7 series, Gear S3, Gear Fit 2, and Gear IconX all brought something new and fresh to the table. They may not all be the best devices in their class, but each one certainly has something unique and interesting to bring to the table. Although 2016 may be on its way out the door, Samsung hasn't stopped with their efforts in the mobile landscape. The company recently announced that they would be investing a grand total of $9 million to get more developers to create apps for their Tizen operation system , and in a recent announcement that Samsung would be partnering up with Microsoft, it looks like Sammy is taking even more steps to do something once and for all about the lack of apps for their own OS. Thanks to the new deal between Samsung and Microsoft, the two companies will be working together on \"open source projects, such as .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms, to enable .NET support for Tizen.\" According to a press release from Samsung - The first preview supports mobile application development with device emulators and an extension to Visual Studio with full IntelliSense and debugging capabilities. Support for Smart TVs, wearables, and other IoT devices will be added in future releases. What's all this mean though? With Samsung now officially joining the Microsoft .NET community, developers will now be able to use Microsoft's Visual Studio to create apps for Tizen in the C# language. Samsung says that more than 50 million gadgets are currently powered by the Tizen OS, and with the expansion to allow developers to create apps for the platform with a system that they're comfortable with and native to, we should start seeing more and more apps make their way to Samsung's baby in the near future. We recently held a poll to see what our readers though about Tizen, and almost half of the results came back with people saying that Samsung should continue to work on it and make it better. A move like this certainly is a step in that direction to improve the quality of the OS, and with .NET support being released and shipped on Tizen-powered devices starting in 2017, we won't have to wait too much longer to start seeing the results of this partnership.",

      "text": "I can’t remember a time before computers. They’ve always been a part of my life, yet I never considered how little I knew about them until Tuesday.\nExploring the newly expanded Living Computers Museum + Labs in Seattle, I saw the entire evolution of the machines that power our civilization in 2016. The museum, a project of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, is home to the world’s largest collection of fully restored and useable vintage computers. But even though the antique computers exhibit told a clear story, I still struggled to follow it.\nHow could this giant, whirring machine reading paper punchcards be an early ancestor of the iPhone I used to take notes during the tour?\nPunch card machine at the Living Computers Museum + Labs (Photo by GeekWire/Kevin Lisota) The museum’s team recognized this disconnect. Checking out the vintage relics is a nostalgic experience for visitors if they’ve witnessed the progress of computing over the past few decades, but the museum needed a way to reach new generations.\nThat was the impetus for 20 new interactive exhibits and three educational labs, which will open to the public Friday. The first floor of the museum, in Seattle’s SoDo neighborhood, is devoted to new technology. Visitors can build simple machines, drive around some very cute robots, test out a self-driving car simulator, and play with interactive digital art.\nRemote control robots at the Living Computers Museum + Labs (Photo by GeekWire/Kevin Lisota) “We wanted to create a space that was welcoming, where people of all backgrounds could come in and get immersed in technology,” said Lath Carlson, the museum’s executive director.\nThe LCM+Labs is funded entirely by Vulcan, Paul Allen’s investment company. Any proceeds the museum raises are funneled into community and educational programs.\nAllen was “very involved” in the museum’s expansion project, according to Carlson, and his footprint is evident on many of the new exhibits. Several of Allen’s passion projects, like ocean and wildlife conservation, are on display. One exhibit showcases how big data can be used to study shark populations. On display nearby is a drone that was used to survey Africa’s elephant populations and hunt down poachers.\nGeekWire’s Monica Nickelsburg and Dan Richman at Living Computers Museum + Labs. Visitors can see data and footage of shark populations around the world. (Photo by GeekWire/Kevin Lisota) The new exhibits are designed to spark interest in technology by showing its practical applications. Students interested in marine biology, robotics, or art can see how computing powers their passions in on the exhibit floor and then learn about the technology in the nearby labs.\nSoftware lab at the Living Computers Museum + Labs (Photo by GeekWire/Kevin Lisota) The second floor of the LCM+Labs is still devoted to Allen’s vintage computer collection. Those machines have been on display since the museum was founded in 2012.\nThe expansion is part of Allen’s vision to create a place that inspires students with technology, the way his high school, Lakeside, inspired him and Bill Gates.\n“This place is about learning new things, doing work, doing projects,” said Carlson. “This is not a passive museum experience…it’s a museum where we’re encouraging you to create your own things, to solve problems in the world using technology.”",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google Names Former Microsoft Exec to Help Cloud Unit \nGoogle has tapped Sam Ramji, a former Microsoft exec and Cloud Foundry Foundation chief executive, to help steer its cloud efforts, Fortune has learned. \nThe company confirmed the news prior to the published announcement . \nThere were few other details available, but Ramji will work in Diane Greene’s business unit. Greene is the former VMware vmw chief executive that Google brought aboard last year ago to build a business around the Google Cloud Platform. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter \nIt’s not an easy task. Even those who love what Google has done with its variable computing instances and BigQuery data querying tool say the company faces huge challenges catching up to market leader Amazon Web Services. Microsoft Azure is seen as the second largest public cloud. For more on Google cloud, watch: \n“AWS has achieved escape velocity. There is no catching it,” a former Google goog exec told Fortune recently. \nRamji has been CEO at the Cloud Foundry Foundation for about a year. Before that, he was chief strategy officer at Apigee, and he headed up open-source efforts at Microsoft msft . ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Just Made Concessions to EU Regulators to Win OK for LinkedIn Buy \nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft msft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn lnkd makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \n\nU.S. rival Salesforce crm , which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook fb and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.

      "text": "Microsoft has been on top of their game as of late, rolling out Insider Preview builds almost weekly for Insiders in the fast ring. Today is no different, with build 14971 rolling out for Insiders on PC now!\n\nWhat's new Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge: The reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files – you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. Bringing 3D to Everyone via the Paint 3D Preview app: Starting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Opening Paint from Start will now take you to the Paint 3D Preview app. PowerShell in the Shell: In an effort to bring the best command line experiences to the forefront for all power users, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, \"cmd.exe\") in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer's File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. Get Office (Beta): We've heard your feedback about the Get Office app, and today we're happy to announce Get Office version 2.0 for Insiders in the Fast ring! (Well, technically, version 17.7614.2377.0). Whereas before Get Office was largely a collection of links to help you get started with Office, the new and improved app will help you explore and manage your Office experience. The build is rolling out for PC now. No new build for mobile today, unfortunately.\n",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has been releasing a new build of Windows 10 every week lately. And that’s not any different this week either. The company is releasing build 14971 for Windows 10 PCs and Mobile devices with a couple of minor new features and a number of other improvements.\nFirstly, the update brings a major new feature to Microsoft Edge, allowing users to read EPUB books. With this feature, Edge users can read any unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge. Users can also control the font size, text size and use the bookmark feature to leave bookmarks in a book which is pretty neat.\nAdditionally, Microsoft is also making PowerShell the defacto command shell from File Explorer — replacing CMD in the Win+X menu and File Explorer’s File menu. Users who prefer to use CMD can continue to do so by disabling the change from the Settings app’s Personalization > Taskbar section.\nMore importantly, the Paint 3D preview app is now installed by default on Windows 10 which isn’t anything surprising to see as it’s one of the biggest features coming with the Creative Update next year. Lastly, the build also includes improvements to type experiences with Japenese and Chinese input method editors.\nThe update, of course, includes the usual bug fixes, but that’s about it. If you are a Windows Insider in the Fast Ring, you should be able to install Windows 10 Build 14971 from Windows Update in the Settings app. The update is available for both PCs and Mobile devices, in case you’re wondering.",

      "text": "print \nMicrosoft Surface Studio Microsoft \nMicrosoft's premium Surface Studio PC, which starts at $2,999, won't start shipping until closer to Christmas. And even then, Microsoft says it's backordered through early 2017. \nBut I was able to get some time with the Surface Studio at a Microsoft event earlier this week. And it was awesome. \nIf you missed it, the Surface Studio's whole schtick is that it's a desktop touchscreen PC that, wowie-zowie, folds down to a twenty-degree angle to become a 28-inch mega-tablet, complete with Surface Pen stylus. \nPlus, it ships with the Surface Dial (also available separately for any Windows 10 PC for $99), a neat gadget that gives you a physical control for your apps. \nIt's designed to appeal to artists , video editors, and other creative professionals, giving them tons of screen real estate to do their work without distraction or compromise. \nAfter a few minutes with the Surface Studio, Business Insider's Steve Kovach called it \" an entirely new computing category, a sort of desktop-tablet hybrid that already has people excited .\" That's a pretty good summary of what you can expect from the Surface Studio. \nIn a lot of ways, though, that description is only, ahem, scratching the surface. The real genius of the Surface Studio, Microsoft's first-ever desktop PC, is in the details. The way you move \nTake, for instance, the hinge on which the Studio moves. Microsoft calls it the \"zero-gravity\" hinge, and for good reason — it smoothly moves the whole 15-ish pound tablet portion up and down so easily, it hardly takes any effort at all. \nIt's weirdly compelling to just push it up to desktop mode, and down again. Which is good, because Microsoft is promoting uses for the Studio like typing up a Word document, then bringing the screen down to sketching level to annotate, then back up to desktop PC mode. \nThe back of the Surface Studio's base, including the power cable that Microsoft claims will never come out, even if you slide it around your desk. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider \nConsider also the twenty-degree angle to which it folds down. I'm not an artist (quite the opposite, actually), but the angle seems just about right to sketch, annotate, and get work done. It's about the right angle for having a notebook held open in front of you for sketching. \nThe screen portion itself is crazy thin, given how bright and vibrant the display is. Microsoft boasts that it supports a unique 3:2 aspect ratio that makes things appear on the screen exactly as they do on the printed page. Plus, as an added bonus for those kinds of visually-minded professionals, the Surface Studio previews a change coming to Windows 10 that lets you change the color profile of the display at a touch. \nThe Surface Dial can sit on your Surface Studio's screen, or next to it. Just be warned: The Dial will work with any Windows 10 PC, but it needs to be a Surface device for it to work while placed on the screen. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider \nAs for the Surface Dial, it seems similarly well-thought-out, and has a nice little bit of resistance as you turn it. \nThe dial can do anything an app developer wants it to do: Within the same sketching app, the user might be able toggle between using it to choose colors, or the size of a brushstroke, or zooming in and out. It can even affect apps in the background, so you can use it to change a song in Spotify without looking up from your work while you're sketching. \nMicrosoft \nFinally, my favorite little thing about the Surface Studio: Microsoft designed it to be slid around, so you can show someone sitting next to you or across the desk from you what you're working on. To that end, Microsoft boasts that it's built a power cord that will not, can not, fall out of the back of the Studio's base. Slide to your heart's content. Playing with power \nThe bottom line here: I'm biased, because I already loved Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book . And the Surface Studio is really an extra-sized version of those gadgets, almost entirely for the better. \nAt the same time, though, it's a very neat, very premium way for people to get work done. If you can stomach the price tag, Surface Studio seems to be as choice as it gets for creative professionals. And I have a hunch it'll win over some Mac converts.",

      "text": "Provider Nurse Call Supports \"Single Sign-On\" through Microsoft® Active Directory Jeron Single Sign-On with Active Directory NILES, Ill.   Provider Nurse Call Systems streamline alerting and communications between patients and their caregivers for a safer and more productive healthcare environment. Improving both administrators' and caregivers' workflows, Jeron is excited to announce that Provider Nurse Call now supports \"Single Sign-On\" with Microsoft's Active Directory. Through Active Directory, when a network user signs into their computer on the facility's Microsoft network, based on their privileges, they are automatically signed into the Provider LAN-Based software applications including PC Console Activity Display, Staff to Patient Assignment, and Activity Logging and Reporting.The integration of Provider Nurse Call to Microsoft Active Directory (AD) eliminates users managing several different sign-ons and passwords for their computer, the LAN itself, and Jeron Provider applications. With AD, once they are signed into their computer, they simply click on the link to the Provider software application and it is up and running. Active Directory integration also means that every user's sign-on and password comply with the facility's centralized security policies.For Network Administrators, Provider integration with AD greatly simplifies the administration of users by eliminating double-entry of users; active users are automatically synchronized from AD into the Provider LAN-based applications. Anytime a user is added or deleted from the facility's LAN, AD automatically updates the user's access to Provider applications.\"From Network Administrators through to individual users on the facility's LAN, Provider's integration to Active Directory saves everyone steps while supporting a secure network that's so critical in healthcare today,\" says Myles Cochran, Director of Marketing for Jeron.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft today released Windows 10 build 14971 for PCs to the Fast ring. The news comes just a day after 14965 was offered up to the Slow ring for PCs , as phones still need to be on the Fast ring to grab a Creators Update preview. \nThe build contains a number of new features, such as the Office Hub that we reported on this morning . You'll also be able to read EPUB documents in Microsoft Edge. Here's the full changelog: \nRead EPUB books in Microsoft Edge: The reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files – you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. \nYou can download and read unprotected e-books from places like Feedbooks, Project Gutenberg, Free eBooks (requires sign-up), ePubBooks (requires sign-up), Open Library and even our own Microsoft Press. Try out reading an e-book in Microsoft Edge and let us know what you think! \nBringing 3D to Everyone via the Paint 3D Preview app: Starting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Opening Paint from Start will now take you to the Paint 3D Preview app. Please try it out and let us know what you think we should improve or add next! Currently, Paint 3D Preview is only available in English (aka, regardless of your display language, the text will be in English) – support for other languages will be coming soon. Remix 3D Preview, the community counterpart to Paint 3D Preview, is expanding to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland for Windows Insiders today! Remix 3D Preview is currently only available in English but we will continue to expand our region and language support. You can check it out at Remix3D.com and from within the Paint 3D Preview app. \nPowerShell in the Shell: In an effort to bring the best command line experiences to the forefront for all power users, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. Typing “cmd” (or “powershell”) in File Explorer’s address bar will remain a quick way to launch the command shell at that location. For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X” to “Off”. \nFun fact! It’s PowerShell’s 10 year anniversary this week. Hop over to Channel 9to see some of the videos we’ve been sharing about it. If you’re looking to learn more about unleashing the “power” in PowerShell, this page is a great resource. \nImproved Typing Experience with Japanese and Chinese Input Method Editors (IMEs): This build includes many improvements in this space – here are some of the highlights: \nImproved Chinese IME reliability. In particular, we fixed an issue where the IME might crash due to an incompletely downloaded or corrupted dictionary file \nImproved Conversion Accuracy for the Japanese IME. We also fixed various issues, in particular, when conversion was used mixed with prediction, and an UX issue when trying to change phrase segmentation. \nImproved resource usage when typing with the Japanese IME. In particular, we fixed an issue that could result in unexpected graphic glitches after using the IME for an extended period of time. \nGet Office (Beta): We’ve heard your feedback about the Get Office app, and today we’re happy to announce Get Office version 2.0 for Insiders in the Fast ring! (Well, technically, version 17.7614.2377.0). Whereas before Get Office was largely a collection of links to help you get started with Office, the new and improved app will help you explore and manage your Office experience. Easily discover and launch apps and see all your recent Office documents in one place! We still have the familiar help links, but we’ve redesigned the experience to make easier to find what you’re looking for. As you try out the new app, please log feedback – we’d love to hear your thoughts! \nSadly, there's nothing new on the Windows 10 Mobile front. Fast ring builds typically show up weekly, so since phones aren't seeing any love this week, you'll likely see one next week. \nAlso, if you're in the London area, Michael Gillett will be hosting an Insider event. You can register for it here . Our own Andy Weir will be there, so make sure to stop and say hello ( and buy him a beer -- Andy ). Tags",

      "text": "\nDo you use GroupMe on an iPhone? Microsoft’s latest updates for GroupMe – while adding support for gif search and document sharing , Microsoft inadvertently introduced some bugs into the app. In the today’s update to GroupMe, the Skype team focused on fixing a number of bugs with a heavily detailed list including such glitches as missing chat input screens, stuck navigation bars and unreliable read receipts.\nAside from that, Microsoft also caught a bug which would restrict large emoticons from showing up in the chat windows, and another which stopped (…) button in the gallery from working.\nHere’s the full list of squashed bugs.\nThe navigation bar would get stuck in dark mode. The chat would sometimes scroll way up when a picture was opened. Tapping a picture sometimes opened a different picture from the same chat. The chat input field would sometimes go missing. A chat would sometimes not be marked as read. For a direct message, the read receipt would not always be updated. Sometimes, tapping “…” in the Gallery would do nothing. The Cancel button in the chat search field sometimes disappeared. The last message summary was not always displayed properly. It was difficult to swipe between pictures in the gallery. Some large emoticons were not fully visible. The version number is 5.6.2. and it is live now for iOS. You can download it from Apple’s App Store here.",

      "text": "Shares of Microsoft ( MSFT ) are up more than 1% Thursday after an analyst at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised her price target to $68 from $60.\nThe analyst, Heather Bellini, is very smart, said TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio , on CNBC's \"Stop Trading\" segment.\nThe stock hasn't been that strong lately, Cramer said, but he agrees with Bellini that the company's cloud strategies and initiatives should pay off.\nCEO Satya Nadella is being aggressive in the cloud, and he too is very smart, Cramer commented. Nadella is a good leader making the right moves for Microsoft, he added.\nThis isn't the old Microsoft, Cramer argued. This company is chasing growth , and when its projects get to scale, it should see an increase in margins from its cloud business, Cramer said. Bellini is looking for those moves too, he concluded.",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe artificial intelligence (AI) non-profit OpenAI has agreed to partner with Microsoft to develop \"cloud brains\" to test its experiments. \nThe organization, which is backed by Elon Musk, has signed an agreement that will allow it to run large-scale experiments using the company's Azure cloud services. OpenAI aims to discover more about deep learning and AI, while Microsoft will use the partnership to create new tools and technologies that use AI. \nOpenAI was one of the first adopters of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service that was designed to handle the intense computing workloads that are needed to run simulations and deep learning projects. The service is powered by Nvidia's graphics chips and will be made generally available starting in December. \nIn a blog post , OpenAI explains how it will use the power of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines in its upcoming experiments, saying: \"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train\". \nIts new partnership with Microsoft will enable the non-profit to scale up its operations and begin to make advancements in both deep learning and AI. \nOpenAI was initially founded in December of last year with the aim of creating AI that could augment mankind's existing capabilities. The non-profit will continue to offer its software under open-source licensing to make it easier for anyone to run their own large-scale AI workloads using the cloud. \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

      "text": "Shutterstock\nHumans aren’t great at computer security, to the point where Microsoft is taking bad passwords away from us . But most of us know enough to lock our computers when we have to leave them on, right? Well, bad news, because an engineer worked out a way to break into locked computers, and it costs about as much as a value meal.\nThe Poison Tap is engineered off a Raspberry Pi — a small $5 computer that plugs into a USB and has everything you’d need to hijack a system. When you plug the Poison Tap into the computer, it tells that computer it’s an Ethernet device using USB, like a router, so the computer starts routing web traffic through it. That allows the tap to bypass malware screens and other attack prevention tools and inject malicious code into your computer through its browser cache. From there, it’s just a matter of cracking your computer’s internal router and that’s it: You’ve been breached.\nThe good news is that if your computer is in sleep mode, not just locked, the Poison Tap won’t work. You can also fairly easily encrypt your computer , which stops the device cold. Still, the fact that this is such a glaring vulnerability, and that it’s so cheap to exploit, is fairly worrying. Maybe Apple had the right idea getting rid of ports after all .\n(via Gizmodo )\n",

      "text": "Microsoft really has changed, Linux Foundation chief says Jim Zemlin welcomes Microsoft to the open-source consortium U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 17, 2016 10:30   \nScott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's Cloud & Enterprise division, greets Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim Zemlin on stage at the Microsoft Connect conference in New York City on November 16, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Why you need Open Source \nMicrosoft made a splash in the tech industry on Wednesday when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. While the move felt like a welcome extension of the tech giant's open source strategy to some, others saw it as a threat to Linux. \nMicrosoft's addition to the foundation was a positive step for the open-source community overall, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said in an interview. In his view, adding Microsoft as a foundation member is an important move to further the Linux Foundation's mission, \"which is to create the greatest shared technology asset in history.\" \n\"I think there is a burden on the broader open-source community — again, I think that there's a healthy anti-establishment sensibility — but there's the act of being the anti-movement, the rebel movement, and there's the act of being the mainstream movement. And to be in the mainstream does require broadening your tent and bringing as many people into that tent as possible.\" \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nThe two organizations have been working together for a while. The first public partnership between the foundation and Microsoft appeared last year, when they announced a certification for running Linux on Azure. \nBut Microsoft has been helping out the foundation in other ways, Zemlin said. Microsoft engineers have contributed to the popular Node.js project, and the company is lending its security expertise to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a project aimed at helping to secure key open-source tools. \nWhen asked whether Microsoft was joining the Linux Foundation to destroy the open source operating system, as some commenters have mused online, Zemlin said he's \"just not a big conspiracy theorist.\" It would be rather difficult for Microsoft to kill Linux at this stage, he said, and Microsoft was already following through on a commitment to open-source software. \n\"First of all, when you join the Linux Foundation, you're obligated to support the mission of our organization, which is to support the growth of Linux and open source,\" he said. \"And Microsoft has not only committed to doing that as a part of our organization, but I've got to tell you, they're pretty much already doing it.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first rodeo as a member of an open-source group. The company is also a member of the Apache Software Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation. Microsoft has also been opening up its own products: It released .NET, PowerShell, and other tools under open-source licenses. GitHub revealed it is the company with the largest external contributor base for projects it has released. \nTo be fair, the company is paying US$500,000 for its membership, but Zemlin doesn't seem like the sort of person who would put aside potential issues with Microsoft for a big chunk of cash. He was one of the foundation's leading voices speaking out against the tech titan's past actions. \nMicrosoft is facing competitive pressures to engage with open source, thanks to the interest of its customers, as well as the changing times in computing. And as Zemlin pointed out, there's no way Microsoft alone can carry the day when it comes to building the software people need. \n\"In a world where things are in the cloud, everybody has a computer, there is too much software to be written for even Microsoft, with all their engineers, to write it on their own,\" he said. \"It ain't gonna happen.\"  ",

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 Microsoft has released the Windows 10 Insider build 14971 for PCs today, and the new bits bring several new features that will be included in the upcoming Creators Update to be released in early 2017. First, Microsoft Edge now supports unprotected EPUB e-books and provides a customizable reading experience similar to what you can enjoy now with PDF files. This build also includes the Paint 3D Preview app which was first demoed at the company’s Windows 10 event in late October. Among other highlights, Powershell is now replacing Command Prompt as the default command shell in File Explorer, though you can turn if not if you don’t like it. Lastly, as we reported earlier today this new build features a new Get Office app which now lets you manage your Office 365 subscription, install select Office apps, view recent documents and more. Please find the full version notes below : Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge: The reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files – you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. You can download and read unprotected e-books from places like Feedbooks , Project Gutenberg , Free eBooks (requires sign-up), ePubBooks (requires sign-up), Open Library and even our own Microsoft Press . Try out reading an e-book in Microsoft Edge and let us know what you think! Bringing 3D to Everyone via the Paint 3D Preview app: Starting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Opening Paint from Start will now take you to the Paint 3D Preview app. Please try it out and let us know what you think we should improve or add next! Currently, Paint 3D Preview is only available in English (aka, regardless of your display language, the text will be in English) – support for other languages will be coming soon. Remix 3D Preview, the community counterpart to Paint 3D Preview, is expanding to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland for Windows Insiders today! Remix 3D Preview is currently only available in English but we will continue to expand our region and language support. You can check it out at Remix3D.com and from within the Paint 3D Preview app. PowerShell in the Shell: In an effort to bring the best command line experiences to the forefront for all power users, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. Typing “cmd” (or “powershell”) in File Explorer’s address bar will remain a quick way to launch the command shell at that location. For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X” to “Off”. Fun fact! It’s PowerShell’s 10 year anniversary this week. Hop over to Channel 9 to see some of the videos we’ve been sharing about it. If you’re looking to learn more about unleashing the “power” in PowerShell, this page is a great resource. Improved Typing Experience with Japanese and Chinese Input Method Editors (IMEs) : This build includes many improvements in this space – here are some of the highlights: Improved Chinese IME reliability. In particular, we fixed an issue where the IME might crash due to an incompletely downloaded or corrupted dictionary file Improved Conversion Accuracy for the Japanese IME . We also fixed various issues, in particular, when conversion was used mixed with prediction, and an UX issue when trying to change phrase segmentation. Improved resource usage when typing with the Japanese IME . In particular, we fixed an issue that could result in unexpected graphic glitches after using the IME for an extended period of time. Get Office (Beta): We’ve heard your feedback about the Get Office app, and today we’re happy to announce Get Office version 2.0 for Insiders in the Fast ring! (Well, technically, version 17.7614.2377.0). Whereas before Get Office was largely a collection of links to help you get started with Office, the new and improved app will help you explore and manage your Office experience. Easily discover and launch apps and see all your recent Office documents in one place! We still have the familiar help links, but we’ve redesigned the experience to make easier to find what you’re looking for. As you try out the new app, please log feedback – we’d love to hear your thoughts! To download this latest preview build, head over to Windows Update and click that “Check for Updates” button. Let us know what you think of these new features in the comments below. In this story stream:",

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nMicrosoft pushed a new Windows 10 Insider build today, 14971 , and as usual it brings a fair number of fixes and improvements to go with some new stuff. Here’s everything that’s been fixed up in build 14971, with one item that’s actually been removed this time around. \nStraight from the horse’s mouth : First introduced to Insiders in Build 14926, the experimental “Snooze” action on a tab in Microsoft Edge which provides you with a way to set a Cortana reminder on the website you are viewing is no longer available. Based on data we gathered and feedback we received, we decided to remove it from the product and re-evaluate the feature for a future release. The cursor will no longer be shown while inking – we believe this makes the experience feel even more like pen on paper. Try it out and let us know what you think! We’ve improved reliability when using the protractor and inking in Sketchpad. We’ve updated some of our desktop wizards (including “map a network drive” and “extract from zip”) to now be proportionally sized when moved across monitors. We fixed an issue where Magnifier’s keyboard shortcuts sometimes wouldn’t work on the Lock screen. We fixed an issue that could result in sometimes not being able to completely remove files in the Windows.old folder using Disk Cleanup. We have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a more secure experience in the Outlook Mail app. We fixed an issue where trying to shut down the PC while certain Device Manager dialog boxes were open would result in the PC being stuck at the “Restarting…” screen. We fixed an issue where, as closing multiple tabs with middle click in Microsoft Edge, the width of the tabs might change, resulting in potentially unexpectedly closing the wrong tab. We fixed an issue where the copy link option when right-clicking a hyperlink in Microsoft Edge wasn’t work. We fixed an issue where, if you changed the size of the Microsoft Edge window, and then closed the app by closing the final tab, the next time Microsoft Edge is launched it would once again be the default size, rather than retaining the preferred window size. We fixed an issue where pinned tabs in Microsoft Edge were not being restored. We’ve made a number of translation improvements, including for Chinese speakers fixing a translation error in the dialog that appears when installing multiple fonts at once, as well as one in Settings > System > Battery. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback – we’re listening! We fixed an issue where, if you already hand a notification expanded in the Action Center, clicking the chevron to expand a second notification would result in it expanding then immediately closing. We fixed an issue where preferred Start menu width might not be preserved after rebooting. \nThat’s all for this week. Go hit that update button and get build 14971 installed on your Fast Ring PC, and then let us know in the comments if you run across any fix that’s not on this list.",

      "title": "Microsoft Xbox One S Holiday TV Commercial Celebrates HDR Gaming",
      "text": " 41pm CST | by Luigi Lugmayr , in News | Holiday Gift Guide This story may contain affiliate links. The Xbox One S is available in tempting Black Friday deals. Now Microsoft supports retail channels with a new TV commercial for the Xbox One S. \nMicrosoft found a way to slam the Sony PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro. Sony is not offering a 4K Ultra HD drive in its new generation of consoles. Microsoft slogan for the Xbox One S is therefore \"The new Xbox One S is the only console with 4K Blu-ray, 4K video streaming, and HDR.\" Sony's argument is that 4K Ultra HD is not going to be a thing and everyone is going to stream 4K video. We believe Sony is a bit ahead of the time with that stance. \nWe see a lot of interest in 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray players and in deals on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray movies . \nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) makes games richer with more luminous colors and higher contrasts. Xbox One games like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 support HDR. With a higher contrast ratio between lights and darks, High Dynamic Range technology brings out the true visual depth of your games and 4K entertainment. \nWhile the Xbox One S is a bargain in Black Friday sales , selling for $249, a 4K TV with full HDR support is slamming the Holiday budget. The HDR support in PS4, PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro and Xbox One S spurs the sale of 4K TVs that support the latest HDR10 standard. There are 55-inch 4K HDR TV deals for under $1,000.

      "text": "by Paul Lilly   Cortana Adds Tracking Your To-Do Lists To Its Skills Resume In Windows 10 Microsoft has taught Cortana a new skill just in time for the holiday shopping season. It's the ability to create and manage lists, something most of use do throughout the year and especially during the holiday months. After all, there are grocery items to buy for the big feast and presents to pick up for the kids, and it's not like the daily responsibilities of work go away during this time of year. Cortana can help, provided she's your digital assistant of choice these days. If so, you can now have Cortana make lists and update them as needed in Windows 10 and through Cortana on your mobile device (Android 4.4 or later, iPhones with iOS 8.0 or later, and Windows 10 in the U.S.).\"Whether it’s planning a holiday meal, buying gifts, getting things done before you head out for vacation, or keeping track of who’s naughty or nice, you can use your voice or type to quickly create a new list, add to an existing list when inspiration strikes, and pull up your lists just when you need them on any device. Cortana will automatically start a Grocery, To Do, and Shopping list for you so it’s easy to get started,\" Microsoft says.We tried it out ourselves and it works as advertised. In addition, Cortana also works with Wunderlist, the popular to-do list app that Microsoft acquired last year, which allows you to tap into deeper list functionality. You just need to connect Cortana to your Wunderlist account and then you can do things like add due dates to your to-do list and created shared lists.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 9 minutes ago with 2 comments \nEarlier this year, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One S , the successor to its Xbox One console that launched in 2013. The Xbox One S is priced from $299 - but the next console in Microsoft's gaming portfolio will be even more capable, and it should come as no surprise that it will come at a higher price than its predecessor. \nThe Xbox One S features support for HDR and 4K video output, although it doesn't support 4K gaming. Instead, Microsoft will debut its 4K gaming support on its upcoming Project Scorpio console , which it announced alongside the One S in June. \nScorpio will also include VR support, and Microsoft has described it as the \"most powerful console ever built\", with an octa-core processor, and \"six teraflops of power\". The company has said that all first-party games released alongside Scorpio will \"natively render at 4K\" . \nGamers will, of course have to be prepared to pay for such fierce performance. Speaking with LevelUp.com, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said: \"Scorpio will be a premium console. It will cost more than [the Xbox One] S, obviously; that's how we are building it.\" \nHe added: \nWe have not announced the pricing yet, but I want to make sure that the investment we are putting into the product of Scorpio meets the demands of the higher-end consumer and that will be a higher price. \nSpencer has previously pointed out that Scorpio's performance will exceed that of Sony's recently-launched PlayStation 4 Pro , to the point that the gap in performance between the two consoles will be \"obvious\" . But as we've heard previously, Scorpio isn't intended to replace the Xbox One S. \nAs Spencer emphasized, Microsoft is aiming to offer \"at all the price points\" that consumers can reasonably expect. \"For us, when we think about Scorpio,\" he explained, \"it's for a higher-end customer who demands the most they can get out of a console, and we built a console to meet that demand.\" \nBut while the original Xbox One remains on sale now , and the Xbox One S will continue to be available when Project Scorpio launches towards the end of next year, Microsoft is staying tight-lipped for now on how much its new, more powerful console will actually cost. \nHow much do you think Microsoft will ask for Project Scorpio? Will it cost the same as the $399 PS4 Pro, or could Microsoft charge even more for it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio Reviews: Apple Fans Might Be 'Tempted to Switch Camps', Despite High Price",
      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio Reviews: Apple Fans Might Be 'Tempted to Switch Camps', Despite High Price Thursday November 17, 2016 10:53 am PST by Mitchel Broussard A few weeks after Microsoft unveiled the Surface Studio to the public at a media event in New York City, a few websites have begun publishing the first reviews for Microsoft's new desktop PC/tablet hybrid. During its announcement in October, the Surface Studio was revealed to have a 12.5mm thin touch screen, with a 28-inch PixelSense Display that packs in 13.5 million pixels. Microsoft said that there's \"no monitor like this on the planet.\" The first reviews of the Surface Studio are largely positive, with many reviewers enamored with the computer's large screen and slick design, as well as its purpose to fulfill and enhance productivity for creatives. However, in line with the unrest over the price of the new MacBook Pro s, most of the people who have been reviewing the Surface Studio for the past week admit the $3,000 price tag is one that prohibits casual users and sets an entry bar for serious power users only. Images via Engadget The Verge began by looking at the 28-inch display, which was described as \"truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used.\" Everything from plain text to videos were said to look great on the screen, and even the 3:2 aspect ratio for the desktop monitor produced better environments for reading and writing, according to the site. The Verge also had a freelance illustrator test out the Surface Studio, and they came away largely impressed, but hoped future iterations introduced a rotating display, more ergonomic stylus, and new input options for the Surface Dial accessory. Although a slight mention, one of the site's minor annoyances was the way the Surface Dial slipped down the screen slowly when not being cradled by the user's hand, even at the computer's lowest 20-degree angle. The Verge concluded its review comparing the Surface Studio to the current lineup and ecosystem of Apple products. The site said that while Microsoft's device won't be invading the homes of die-hard Apple fans just yet, the fact that the Surface Studio even hints at that possibility \"is remarkable.\" For that reason, the site admitted purchasing a $3,000 computer just for fun doodling tools in your spare time is illogical, but those Apple fans who could gain the most out of Microsoft's hardware \"might well be tempted to switch camps.\" Many creatives I’ve spoken to about the Surface Studio have said the same thing: why isn’t Apple doing this? Apple seems to be forcing creatives to choose an iPad Pro for touch and pen, but the powerful and professional apps just aren’t there yet on iOS, and it’s not clear if companies like Adobe are willing to rewrite their software to be just as useful on an iPad Pro. Microsoft has realized the potential in the market to reach out to creatives who feel abandoned by Apple, and it’s an influential crowd that could be swayed over by devices like the Surface Studio. The fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple’s line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it’s even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it’s for — and it’s largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps. Engadget called the Surface Studio \"the most interesting computer released this year,\" thanks in part to the fact that its zero gravity hinge gimmick \"is actually useful.\" The site tested the top-of-the-line $4,200 tier, which includes a 2.7GHz Core i7 6820HQ CPU, 32GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and 2TB HDD, and a NVIDIA GTX 980M graphics with 4GB of VRAM, and admitted \"it was one of the most powerful PCs I've ever tested.\" The Surface Studio is also a good-enough gaming alternative, although it isn't entirely up to the task of most high-end gaming PCs, with Engadget noting that the computer scored 20 percent lower than the Radeon RX 480 GPU, as an anecdotal comparison. The computer still managed to run a few games at playable speeds, including Overwatch (60 frames per second in 1080p with high settings) and Gears of War 4 (50 frames per second with medium settings). The Surface Studio is both familiar and new. It empowers us to work the way we always have, while also giving us entirely new modes of productivity. Personally, that's a philosophy I can get behind -- especially when compared with Apple's habit of pushing consumers down new roads that aren't necessarily improvements (hello, dongle life). But the Surface Studio's high price and lack of expandability could make it a tough sell for an already niche market, especially for people already devoted to their Wacom tablets. CNET also asked some creative professionals to try out the Surface Studio and got their opinions on the machine. Creative director Nick Cogan, who's helped to illustrate and design films like Ice Age and Rio , said that the Surface Studio was a \"great\" drawing tool that could stimulate workflow and ultimately be a nice main device for professional work after the initial learning curve. But, like CNET described in its review, Cogan wasn't sure if the hardware of the Surface Studio was enough of an excuse to get over the Windows-based software. The bigger challenge may be getting creative professionals to invest in such a high-end, high-price piece of gear, as many of them are creatures of habit, tied to familiar tools and hardware. As Cogan told us, \"I think the big barrier is going to be that it's Windows-based, and so many people in the creative fields are really already decades down using Macs.\" But, he adds, \"As a drawing tool, this is great, it's a lot of fun.\" If you can afford it, and your profession aligns with Microsoft's intent to catalyze passion and ingenuity within creatives, the review consensus on the Surface Studio is largely suggesting a purchase. Those who are interested can order the computer from Microsoft's online store , although following initial pre-orders the Surface Studio's shipping estimate has now been pushed back to early 2017. The cheapest model of Surface Studio includes an Intel Core i5 processor, 1TB hybrid drive, 8GB RAM, and a 2GB GPU for $2,999. That jumps up to $3,499 for an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB RAM, with the top-of-the-line model running for $4,199 with a 2TB hybrid drive, i7 processor, 32GB RAM, and 4GB GPU. The Surface Dial comes packaged-in for pre-order customers who order the computer before December 1, but after that date it will cost $99 sold separately.",

Keystrokes are sent back to the KeySweeper operator over the Internet via an optional GSM chip, or can be stored on a flash chip and delivered wirelessly when a secondary KeySweeper device comes within wireless range of the target KeySweeper. A web based tool allows live keystroke monitoring. KeySweeper has the capability to send SMS alerts upon certain keystrokes being typed, e.g. \"www.bank.com\". If KeySweeper is removed from AC power, it appears to shut off, however it continues to operate covertly using an internal battery that is automatically recharged upon reconnecting to AC power. http://samy.pl/keysweeper",

      "text": "  11:17 AM EST Provider Nurse Call Supports \"Single Sign-On\" through Microsoft® Active Directory NILES, Ill.   Provider Nurse Call Systems streamline alerting and communications between patients and their caregivers for a safer and more productive healthcare environment. Improving both administrators' and caregivers' workflows, Jeron is excited to announce that Provider Nurse Call now supports \"Single Sign-On\" with Microsoft's Active Directory. Through Active Directory, when a network user signs into their computer on the facility's Microsoft network, based on their privileges, they are automatically signed into the Provider LAN-Based software applications including PC Console Activity Display, Staff to Patient Assignment, and Activity Logging and Reporting.The integration of Provider Nurse Call to Microsoft Active Directory (AD) eliminates users managing several different sign-ons and passwords for their computer, the LAN itself, and Jeron Provider applications. With AD, once they are signed into their computer, they simply click on the link to the Provider software application and it is up and running. Active Directory integration also means that every user's sign-on and password comply with the facility's centralized security policies.For Network Administrators, Provider integration with AD greatly simplifies the administration of users by eliminating double-entry of users; active users are automatically synchronized from AD into the Provider LAN-based applications. Anytime a user is added or deleted from the facility's LAN, AD automatically updates the user's access to Provider applications.\"From Network Administrators through to individual users on the facility's LAN, Provider's integration to Active Directory saves everyone steps while supporting a secure network that's so critical in healthcare today,\" says Myles Cochran, Director of Marketing for Jeron.

      "title": "Windows 10 Creators Update Preview Build 14971 for PC arrives on the Fast ring, includes Paint 3D, removes Command Prompt",
      "text": "Tweet \nContinuing its weekly update schedule, Microsoft has rolled out another new Insider Preview build to the Fast ring. Build 14971 is only for PC this time around. Windows 10 Mobile users on the Slow ring can however, now upgrade to Build 14965 . \nThere won’t be a new Insider Preview build for either platform next week, due to Thanksgiving, so you’ll have to make do with this one, which offers some interesting additions, and also says goodbye to the Command Prompt. \nThe Creators Update focuses on 3D, and Build 14971 includes the Paint 3D Preview app. If you open Paint from the Start menu, it’s the preview that will appear. It’s only available in English for now, but other languages will be made available in due course. \nNext up, there’s the introduction of EPUB support in Microsoft Edge. If you already use Microsoft's browser as your default PDF viewer, you can now also use it to read unprotected ebooks. Edge lets you customize the reading experience by changing the font, text size and choosing a theme -- light, sepia, and dark. \nYou can search for words or phrases, use Cortana to define words, and bookmark your place to pick up where you left off. \nPowerShell celebrates its tenth anniversary this week and in recognition for this long service, gets promoted to become the default command shell in the new build, replacing Command Prompt. That move may not be to everyone’s liking, so the good news is you can -- for now -- opt out of the change. Go to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turn \"Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X\" to \"Off\". \nThe Get Office (Beta) app has been updated to version 2.0 to become a new hub . \nOther changes and improvements in this new build include: First introduced to Insiders in Build 14926, the experimental \"Snooze\" action on a tab in Microsoft Edge which provides you with a way to set a Cortana reminder on the website you are viewing is no longer available. Based on data Microsoft gathered and feedback it received, the company decided to remove it from the product and re-evaluate the feature for a future release. The cursor will no longer be shown while inking -- Microsoft believes this makes the experience feel even more like pen on paper. Improved reliability when using the protractor and inking in Sketchpad. Updated some of the desktop wizards (including \"map a network drive\" and \"extract from zip\") to now be proportionally sized when moved across monitors. Fixed an issue where Magnifier’s keyboard shortcuts sometimes wouldn’t work on the Lock screen. Fixed an issue that could result in sometimes not being able to completely remove files in the Windows.old folder using Disk Cleanup. Enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a more secure experience in the Outlook Mail app. Fixed an issue where trying to shut down the PC while certain Device Manager dialog boxes were open would result in the PC being stuck at the \"Restarting…\" screen. Fixed an issue where, as closing multiple tabs with middle click in Microsoft Edge, the width of the tabs might change, resulting in potentially unexpectedly closing the wrong tab. Fixed an issue where the copy link option when right-clicking a hyperlink in Microsoft Edge wasn’t working. Fixed an issue where, if you changed the size of the Microsoft Edge window, and then closed the app by closing the final tab, the next time Microsoft Edge is launched it would once again be the default size, rather than retaining the preferred window size. Fixed an issue where pinned tabs in Microsoft Edge were not being restored. Made a number of translation improvements, including for Chinese speakers fixing a translation error in the dialog that appears when installing multiple fonts at once, as well as one in Settings > System > Battery. Fixed an issue where, if you already had a notification expanded in the Action Center, clicking the chevron to expand a second notification would result in it expanding then immediately closing. Fixed an issue where preferred Start menu width might not be preserved after rebooting. \nKnown issues for PC include: Navigating to Settings > System > Battery will crash the Settings app. Using keyboard monitor hotkeys to adjust brightness won’t work as expected. Desired brightness change could be done via the Action Center or by going to Settings > System > Display. Apps such as Store, Photos, and People may launch on their own after your PC has been inactive for a period of time. To stop these apps from launching on their own, un-maximize the app before closing it. As it has previously announced, Microsoft is working on the Windows Holographic Shell that is going to be included in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. In today’s flight you will see the Windows Holographic First Run app. While you will be able to launch the app and walk through the first few screens, it won’t detect any hardware. This app and the Windows Holographic Shell is still under active development at Microsoft.",

      "text": "Share Tweet Share Share Skype \nEarlier this year at Build, it was announced that Vuforia , one of the world’s most widely used platforms for AR development, would support Microsoft HoloLens through its 275,000 developers. Vuforia introduced an important capability to HoloLens – the power to connect experiences to specific things in the environment. And just last month, we showcased our aspiration to empower a new wave of creativity, and our goal to enable that through 3D and mixed reality for everyone. Now, Vuforia is taking that one step further, and its SDK is now commercially available to the public. \nWe’ve continued to see the ways that Microsoft HoloLens is disrupting and transforming industries, enabling solutions that were previously nonexistent. When used in HoloLens, these 3D visualizations can easily be expanded and transported to actual size in any environment, providing a more immersive and realistic visualization experience. These types of experiences have the potential to reduce – or even eliminate – dependence on manuals used by technicians. \nCompanies are using Vuforia to inspire this new wave of technology. Hear what they have to say: “We see huge potential in the combination of object recognition and graphical overlay, especially when such information is fed to the HoloLens in real-time, for instance, in connection with maintenance or manufacturing lines.” Mads Troelsgaard, CEO, Unity Studios “We have leveraged Vuforia for HoloLens proof of concept projects and were able to achieve great precision. We were pleased how easy it is to setup and get up to speed. We had great success and expect to use it in future projects.” René Schulte, Director of Immersive Experiences , Valorem Consulting \nInterested in developing with Vuforia on HoloLens? Check out the Holographic Dev Center and the Build keynote for more details to get you started. We can’t wait to see what you create and are so excited you are on this journey with us! \n-Chris ",

The app which was built with Vuforia allowed the user to interact with a product catalog by utilizing the device’s camera and other features in Windows 10. For those unfamiliar, Vuforia allows developers to make augmented reality apps for devices such as Surface tablets and the HoloLens, and the Vuforia SDK is used by more than 275,000 developers.\nIn August the company is releasing Vuforia 6 SDK, which will allow developers to make augmented reality apps for the HoloLens and the Universal Windows Platform. In a blog post, the company stated:\nVuforia introduces an important capability to HoloLens – the ability to attach experiences to specific things in the environment. When combined with HoloLens native capabilities, AR experiences can be expanded and transported to actual size in any environment to provide a virtual showroom. When combined with VuMarks, this capability can be used for guided step-by-step instructions for products or machinery. These experiences have the potential to reduce or even eliminate dependence on cumbersome manuals used by technicians.\nCompanies are using Vuforia said:\n“We see huge potential in the combination of object recognition and graphical overlay, especially when such information is fed to the HoloLens in real-time, for instance, in connection with maintenance or manufacturing lines.” Mads Troelsgaard, CEO, Unity Studios “We have leveraged Vuforia for HoloLens proof of concept projects and were able to achieve great precision.

      "text": "Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member by  9:30 AM on November 17, 2016 \nLinux and Microsoft were, for years, fully at odds with each other. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer considered Linux a bigger threat to Microsoft than Apple , and fans of one have often not been fans of the other. That's changed in recent years, as Microsoft has taken a bigger role in the Open Source Software community and in contributions to the Linux ecosystem and community. Now the company is making its commitment to Linux and open source official by joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member . \nThe Linux Foundation outlined some of Microsoft's big contributions in a press release. In the past few years, Microsoft has opened up core parts of .NET, brought Canonical's Ubuntu to Windows 10, and partnered with organizations like Red Hat and SUSE. The company also contributes to open source projects like Node.js and the Open API initiative. \nSpeaking to TechCrunch , Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin describes Microsoft's past relationship with Linux, saying \"they weren't big fans.\" He acknowledges, too, that membership from a company like Microsoft is going to bring out skeptics. \"There is an anti-establishment sentiment in open source. That's natural,\" he says. \nWhile many PC users still hold a pretty negative view of the company, Zemlin insists the company has evolved. \"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,\" Zemlin writes in a prepared statement. \"The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions.\" \nAs a platinum-level member—a seat that costs $500,000—Microsoft sits alongside companies like IBM, Samsung, Cisco, and Intel. Microsoft's John Gossman, an architect on its Azure team, will take a seat on the Linux Foundation board of directors.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nAndy Patrizio is a freelance technology writer based in Orange County, California. He's written for a variety of publications, ranging from Tom's Guide to Wired to Dr. Dobbs Journal. Microsoft now runs one data center entirely on wind power Overall commitment to renewables makes Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming, facility completely green Network World | Nov 17, 2016 10:01 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Ethernet's Roadmap: David Chalupsky \nMicrosoft has a stated goal of using 50 percent renewable energy in its data centers across the U.S. by 2018, and it just took a big step forward in that plan, purchasing additional 237 megawatts of wind energy capacity. \nIn the process, this helps allow its Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center run entirely on wind power and brings the company’s total wind capacity to 500 megawatts across the U.S. \nMicrosoft has invested $750 million in its Wyoming data center, which stunned the state's governor, since Wyoming is basically about energy, agriculture and tourism. It's also a low-population state with a half-million people. \nBut it's strategically a good fit for Microsoft to serve the western region of the country. It's not seismically active; it's the fourth coolest state in the country, so the data center needs less cooling; and it has the lowest electricity prices in the U.S. at less than six cents per Kilowatt hour. + Also on Network World: America’s data centers are getting a lot more efficient + \nMicrosoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post that Microsoft’s data centers will get about 44 percent of their electricity from wind, solar and hydropower sources this year and will raise that to 50 percent in two years. Only about 20 megawatts comes from solar power, serving the Virginia data center. \nInterestingly, Microsoft has also partnered with Black Hills Energy to act as a backup of sorts to the energy supplier. Black Hills can use Microsoft’s data center as a secondary energy producer through its backup natural gas-powered generators when demand gets too high. The data center uses natural gas for energy, which is cheaper and cleaner than coal, and Black Hills doesn't need to build another power plant. \n\"This is a small step toward a future where other customer-sited resources may help make the grid more efficient, reliable and capable of integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar,\" Smith wrote.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio Review Roundup: Beauty And Innovation Paired With Outdated Internals",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Thursday, November 17, 2016 Microsoft Surface Studio Review Roundup: Beauty And Innovation Paired With Outdated Internals The takeaways from two separate keynotes from Apple and Microsoft last month couldn’t have been any more different. Microsoft unveiled the 28-inch Surface Studio all-in-one and wowed those in the tech community with its articulating display and Surface Dial input accessory. Apple, on the other hand, drew scorn for its new MacBook Pro family , which the press (and even those in the Mac community) felt missed the mark . The backlash was so strong, in fact, the even Apple’s Phil Schiller was somewhat surprised .\nAre we now living in a world where Microsoft is being seen as the innovator, while Apple is continually banging the “thinness at all costs” drum? Whatever the case, the engineering marvel known as the Surface Studio has been unleashed onto the tech press, and a few sites are beginning to give their thoughts on how it works in the real world. \nBut before we start, let’s give a brief rundown on what the Surface Studio has to offer: namely a 28-inch 4500x3000 resolution PixelSense display, Intel Core i5 or Core i7 Skylake processors, up to 32GB of RAM, 1TB or 2TB hybrid storage configurations (SSD + HDD), and your choice of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M or GTX 980M graphics. \nHere are some thoughts on the display, which seemed to wow everyone that laid eyes on it… \nThe Verge : The heart of the Surface Studio is its 28-inch PixelSense display. It’s stunning to look at and it’s truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used. It makes things feel oddly lifelike because you can’t see the pixels — text, videos, and pictures just look great on this thing… I love extra vertical space for reading and writing, even if it takes a little getting used to on a display of this size. The display is glossy and reflective, but I didn't find that too troublesome in my own office space. \nEngadget : Artists will likely appreciate the Surface Studio's ability to switch from SRGB and wider DCI-P3 color gamuts on the fly. Apple made a big deal about the iMac's support for the P3 gamut last year, and the same benefits apply here. Simply put, it'll let you view an even wider variety of colors. And since it's a standard backed by Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI), it's particularly helpful for editing digital video. Typical consumers will likely just notice that some photos and videos will appear much richer than before. \nDigital Trends : On balance, when all the pros and cons are tallied, the Studio has the best computer display we’ve ever seen. Its contrast is the best you’ll find without an OLED display, something that’s only available on laptops for now, and color performance is excellent. \nOn the Surface Dial , which gives creative types a new way to interact with apps… \nThe Verge : I prefer to use the Dial on top of the Surface Studio itself, but I did notice it doesn’t stick to the display very well. Even at the near-flat 20-degree drawing angle, the Dial gradually slipped down the display (perhaps because of oil marks left from using the touchscreen). I noticed it out of the corner of my eye when the radial menus kept bouncing down to keep up with the slipping dial, and it’s distracting and annoying. \nCNET : Like Apple's Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro, the Surface Dial works differently in different programs, which means there's a learning curve for each new program you try to use it with. The most basic level of consistent use is to give it a long press in the center, which will result in a small haptic buzz in the Dial and a radial menu appearing on screen. Turn the Dial to navigate whatever menu you're in, and give the Dial a quick press (shorter than the long press used to activate it) and it'll jump through different submenus. \nThe Surface Studio was too far along in development to adopt such modern niceties as Kaby Lake or NVIDIA’s powerful Pascal -based graphics cards, and that’s a shame. Given the $2,999 starting price of the Surface Studio, many of the reviewers wish they got a little bit more bang for the buck with regards to performance: \nDigital Trends : The Studio’s performance will prove adequate for any photo editing, digital art, or document work, but it might feel lackluster if you’re doing a lot of video editing. This all-in-one is built for work, but it’s not a top-tier workstation. \nThe Verge : On the model I was testing there’s a sixth-generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB Rapid Hybrid Drive, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics card inside. That’s actually some old tech for such a futuristic-looking PC. Microsoft has opted for last year's Intel and Nvidia chips, and its storage isn't all solid state. This is especially tough to swallow on the GPU front, because Nvidia's 2016 Pascal architecture is miles ahead of its predecessors. \nCNET : The new GeForce 1080 is more powerful than the old 980M, sure -- but the real advantage the Surface Studio misses out on is the ability to officially support virtual reality headsets. For a device targeted at visual artists, a category which could include 3D modelers or game programmers, that seems like a real missed opportunity… The Surface Studio model we tested is the high-end configuration with the Nvidia 980M graphics chip. While the specs don't meet the official guidelines for the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, some VR experiences may run, but your mileage may vary. \nIn the end, all of the reviewers came away with an overall excellent impression of the Surface Studio. Sure, it’s an expensive PC, but it has a lot to offer to its intended audience, which just so happens to be content creators instead of the general public. The Verge perhaps summed up the Surface Studio the most succinctly, writing: \nThe fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple’s line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it’s even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it’s for — and it’s largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps. \nIf you have the cash laying around to afford the Surface Studio and you can look past the graphics and storage deficiencies, it offers a one-of-a-kind experience that will likely leave you grinning ear-to-ear as you use it more.",

      "text": "0 stars Be the first to review! The Good The Surface Studio has a fantastic 28-inch screen with excellent color, mounted on smooth hinges that fold down to an artist-friendly angle. The excellent Surface Pen stylus returns and the new Surface Dial shows promise. Every model has good-to-great dedicated graphics hardware. The Bad Surface Studio is extremely expensive, and doesn't include the flashy Dial accessory by default. It skips newer graphics chips that support VR hardware. Support for the Dial is limited right now, and even compatible programs don't always use it in a practical way. A couple of front-mounted USB ports or a Thunderbolt connection would've been nice. The Bottom Line Microsoft's ambitious love letter to creative professionals is the touchscreen iMac of your dreams -- albeit crazy expensive and running Windows. \nVisit manufacturer site for details. 8.5 Overall ",

      "text": "Gwen Houston, Microsoft’s General Manager of Global Diversity and Inclusion. (Microsoft Photo.) Microsoft says women continued to decline as a total percentage of its global workforce during the past year, from 26.8 percent to 25.8 percent, but the trend was caused primarily by its decision last year to cut back its phone hardware business, impacting factories that employed a large number of women.\nOutside of those cutbacks, the company says it saw an increase of 0.4 percentage points in women as a percentage of its workforce, while women in technical roles increased 0.6 percentage points, and women in leadership roles increased by 0.6 points, as well.\n“Our representation numbers show modest progress and a deepening commitment to advancing the work we’re doing around (diversity and inclusion) at Microsoft,” said Gwen Houston, Microsoft’s general manager of Global Diversity and Inclusion , in an interview this morning.\n“While the 1 percent decline that we noted in women globally is certainly disappointing, it wasn’t altogether unexpected,” she added. “We believe we are at or very near the end of that decline as that business decision comes to an end. We take some optimism in the fact that we are starting to see some positive trend lines.”\nAmong the modest gains: Microsoft said the number African American/Black employees increased by 0.2 points, to 3.7 percent of the company’s workforce, while Hispanic/Latino representation increased by 0.1 percentage point, to 5.5 percent.\nMicrosoft also cited progress in improving the diversity of new hires. For example, among new employees, 6.6 percent were African American/Black and 7 percent were Hispanic/Latino. In technical jobs, 4 percent of new employees were African American/Black and 4.5 percent were Hispanic/Latino, the company said. In addition, women represented 27.7 percent of all new employees, about 2 percent more than the current representation of women at the company.\nThe company also touts the diversity of its board of directors, with women and ethnic minorities representing five of its 11 board positions .\nMicrosoft and other technology companies have increasingly been reporting their diversity numbers as part of a push to make the technology industry more inclusive. Among other initiatives, the company has tied the compensation of its senior leaders to their progress in improving diversity numbers as part of executive performance reviews.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio review",
      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio \nNo one knew what to make of Surface Pro when Microsoft launched the Surface line four years ago. It was an unprecedented move, and one that lacked an obvious end. The Surface Pro seemed built to nudge the design of Windows 2-in-1s in the right direction, but what came next? Would Surface really become part of Microsoft’s brand? \nThe answer, surprisingly, was yes. Instead of treating Surface as a side project, Microsoft went all-in, debuting three Surface Pro updates and the new Surface Book. Now the line-up has again grown with the Surface Studio, a system that, by its mere existence, proves Surface is here to stay. \nFrankly, the Studio is a system that’s of no consequence to most PC owners. While the Surface Pro and Book move 2-in-1 design forward in a way that’s applicable to everyone, the Studio’s intent is focused. It’s not even for professionals, as a group, but is instead built for creative professionals – artists, designers, animators, photographer, video editors, and so on. \nThat makes the Studio a niche. It’s not for everyone – if the design didn’t tell you that, the base price of $3,000, and as-tested price of $4,200, should make that clear. \nBut let’s be honest: You’ll end up wanting it anyway. Would you look at that? \nApple has enjoyed a stranglehold on high-end, all-in-one desktop design for years, maybe decades. Until now. The Surface Studio shrieks premium from the moment it’s taken out of the box, in a way even the Surface Pro and Book have never achieved. \nThe display, and its hinge, have a lot to do with this. Aside from its technical excellence, which we’ll address later, the massive 28-inch PixelSense touchscreen cuts an impressive profile. The 3:2 form factor means it’s closer to a square than most large displays, and strikes a nostalgic cord. This is how computer displays used to look before they all decided to emulate HDTVs, a move that not everyone thinks was beneficial. The screen also has slim bezels, and a very thin profile, both of which make the Studio look thoroughly modern. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nBehind the screen is Microsoft’s geeky “zero-gravity” hinge, a feature that the company seemed proud of at the unveiling keynote. While a hinge may not seem exciting, it’s rather important here, because the Studio’s touchscreen is meant to be used at a variety of angles. It might be left upright for typical desktop use, set at an angle for standing use, or leaned at a steep tilt for use as a virtual drafting table. \nDesign: Art Director’s take \nThe Studio screen tilts but doesn’t come close to lying flat. At first, that felt odd. But our Art Director told us it’s for the best, saying “the degree of tilt works, because you can’t really work with a flat table.” He also praised the hinge, saying it stayed in place while he used it, and felt as natural as a drafting table. \nThe hinge makes this possible by allowing movement with just one finger while also providing enough resistance to keep the screen in place when a user is writing. And it does exactly that. The entire screen can be moved from its steepest incline to bolt-straight with a fingertip, and back again. Yet it’s also stiff enough to keep in place while touching, or even drawing on, the screen. \nMove below the hinge, to the computer itself, and…there’s not much to say. Everything inhabits a small, elegant, non-descript base that’s about 10 inches wide, 9 inches deep, and a bit more than an inch tall. It’s subtle. Which is perhaps for the best, as it keeps attention focused on the Studio’s sweet, sweet pixels. Plenty of USB, and an SDcard too \nThough the base is small, it has room for four USB 3.0 ports, an Ethernet jack, a Mini-DisplayPort connection, a headphone jack, and a full-sized SDcard reader. The lack of USB Type-C support feels a bit old-fashioned, as it does on the recently updated Surface Book with Performance Base, but it’s good to see a card reader and plenty of USB ports available. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nWireless connectivity is the usual combination of 802.11ac with Bluetooth 4.0, but there is a bonus. The Studio has Xbox Wireless built in . While the Studio is not designed to be a gaming system, this will help if you want to sit back with an Xbox One controller and play a game, or connect to your Xbox One console. The best display we’ve seen yet \nThe Studio comes with a unique 28-inch PixelSense display with a resolution of 4,500 × 3,000. That works out to about 13.5 million pixels, which isn’t as many as Apple’s iMac with Retina, but quite a bit more than a 4K display, which has 8.2 million pixels. The Studio packs 193 pixels into every inch, while the Apple iMac with Retina crams in 220 pixels per inch. \nDisplay: Art Director’s take \nOur Art Director was in love with the display, saying he found it “incredibly clear, the best Windows display I’ve seen.” The high pixel density, combined with excellent color accuracy, makes the Studio eligible for color-critical work right out of the box. \nFrankly, it’s hard to see a difference in clarity. Fine text and detailed images can look aliased on close inspection, while they’ll look perfectly smooth on the Retina display. But you must be searching with a skeptical eye to notice. \nThere’s more to a display than pixel density, of course. And that’s where the Studio shines. Our testing recorded a maximum contrast ratio of 1,010:1, which is excellent for a monitor. Dell’s Ultrasharp P2715K monitor, with 5,120 × 2,880 resolution, had a contrast ratio of 620:1. Samsung’s U32D970Q , a favorite of ours, had a contrast ratio of just 460:1. \nMicrosoft hasn’t pulled any tricks to accomplish this. The display’s maximum brightness of 464 lux is higher than average, but its black levels are deep and inky, which gives images a realistic sense of depth. \nColor is great, too. The Studio hit 100 percent of sRGB, and 91 percent of AdobeRGB, while delivering a default color accuracy reading of 0.97. An error of less than 1 is generally unnoticeable to the human eye, so that’s impressive, even if it doesn’t quite beat the most accurate monitors we’ve tested, such as Samsung’s U32D970Q and HP’s DreamColor Z32x . The accuracy is backed up by a gamma reading of 2.2, which is dead-on ideal. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nAnd the Studio has a trick most monitors don’t. Users can switch between the sRGB and DCI-P3 color space with the tap of a button in the Windows 10 Action Center. We’d like to see even more color space options, but as it stands, it should prove a useful feature for Studio’s target audience. \nOn balance, when all the pros and cons are tallied, the Studio has the best computer display we’ve ever seen. Its contrast is the best you’ll find without an OLED display, something that’s only available on laptops for now, and color performance is excellent. \nEverything adds up to an outstanding experience. Drawing on the Studio looks natural and lifelike, with bold yet realistic colors. And while this PC isn’t designed for movies or gaming, its provides amazing detail to both. Civilization VI looked like a painting come alive. The speakers are there, just \nSpeakers are bundled into the Surface Studio. And as you might expect, they’re not great. They do the job you’d and can be quite loud at maximum volume. Yet a muddy quality predominates, and becomes worse as volume comes closer to maximum. Also, like every all-in-one sound system we’ve ever heard, stereo staging is a problem. There’s just not enough space between the speakers to generate convincing stereo sound. \nUsers who aren’t too discerning will be fine with what’s bundled here. Anyone who cares about audio quality will want headphones or external speakers. The Studio’s quad-core is a mobile chip, but still pretty quick \nThe base Surface Studio comes with an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. Our review unit, the most powerful model, arrived with a Core i7-6820HQ processor and 16GB of RAM. The processor model might cause geeks to raise an eyebrow, since it’s from Intel’s mobile lineup, rather than its desktop stable. \nIn our graph, we pit the Studio against a broad selection of possible alternatives ranging from the Surface Book , which might be used as a highly portable workstation, to Origin’s ridiculous Millennium with 10-core Intel processor , which is the bleeding edge of modern hardware. \nPerformance: Art Director’s take \nDay-to-day use seems to be the Studio’s forte. Our Art Director loved how it felt, saying “In Photoshop and Illustrator, it’s great. I like it better than systems I’ve used in the past.” He did note a weak spot in graphics power, though, saying “it’s in a weird spot in GPU performance, because it doesn’t quite fulfill high-end needs, but is also faster than what most users need.” \nAs you can see in the results, the Surface Studio came in at the lesser end of this spectrum. In Handbrake, for instance, it cranked through encoding a four minute, 20-second long 4K trailer in just over nine minutes. That’s not bad, and way quicker than the Surface Book. But it’s also a few minutes longer than the AVADirect Avant , a system we tested with a Core i7-6700K processor. \nWhat about Apple’s iMac with Retina? We did not review the 2015 refresh, but Geekbench 3 scores of that model are widely available. The base model, which has a Core i5-6500 processor, can reach a single-core score of around 4,000, and a multi-core score about 12,000. These numbers suggest that even the base level iMac with Retina can keep pace with our tricked-out Studio review unit. Apple has a slight edge. \nWhat should you make of this? Well, it depends on what you plan to do with your system. The Studio’s performance will prove adequate for any photo editing, digital art, or document work, but it might feel lackluster if you’re doing a lot of video editing. This all-in-one is built for work, but it’s not a top-tier workstation. A cutting-edge device with last year’s hard drive \nOur performance critique continues – and becomes more severe – with the hard drive. All Surface Studio models come with a hybrid drive which combines a mechanical disk (2TB, in our review unit) with a solid-state cache. The cache dynamically decides which data to store based on how the system is used. In theory, that makes the system as responsive as an SSD, without sacrificing storage capacity. \nOuch. As you can see, the hybrid drive just can’t keep up with solid state drives. The Origin Millennium was ten times quicker in read speeds. Even the Avant, which had a humble (by modern standards) SATA-connected SSD, was several times quicker than the Surface Studio. We can see this being an area of definite concern for certain users, as the drive’s modest performance could put a crimp on certain workloads. Video editing again seems a prime suspect, as 4K editing can task a drive’s write speeds. \nMore : Will Surface Pen work better with the Surface Studio? \nTo its credit, the hybrid drive usually did its job. Most apps loaded so quickly that passersby thought the Studio in fact had an SSD, and a fast one, at that. But our design team saw the bad side of it, and noted that some applications, like Adobe Premiere and After Effects, took a long time to load. That could become an annoyance if your work requires frequent use of numerous programs. The elder GTX 980M performs \nWhile the base Surface Studio comes with Nvidia GTX 965M graphics, our review unit had the upgrade to GTX 980M graphics. We panned the Studio at its reveal for the use of GTX 980M graphics, which are a generation behind the GTX 1080. \nFor reference, the AVA Direct Avant in the graph above had a GTX 980 Ti desktop video card. The Surface Book Performance Base, on the other hand, was equipped with the same GTX 965M found in the base model Studio. \nGamers will scoff at the Studio’s 3DMark score of 7,985, which is barely better than the new GTX 1050 Ti, a $140 add-in graphics card any desktop can fit. On the other hand, there are few comparable all-in-ones, with the exclusion of a few gaming-oriented systems like the Origin Omni. And Digital Storm Aura. \nThe next-quickest competitor is Apple’s iMac with Retina, but the Radeon chip it uses is quite old, and in past tests its Fire Strike score hovered around 6,100. The GTX 980M, elder though it may be, is impressive hardware in this category. Dialing it in \nDesktops rarely ship with interesting peripherals, but the Studio is obviously an exception. It made waves not only because of its huge, beautiful touchscreen but also because of the Dial, which promises a new form of tactile input that works alongside touch or Pen input. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nThe Dial looks and feels like you’d expect. Its closest analog is the knob on old stereos, or most modern receivers. It’s chunky and, thanks to haptic feedback, can provide a degree of discrete “click-click-click” feel as you rotate it or tap it. \nWhile it can be used anywhere within Bluetooth range of the Studio, its standout feature is how it works with the screen. When placed there, a radial menu appears around the dial, providing access to custom functions. In a paint app, for example, it can offer an easy way to shift through a color palette. With an audio or video editor, it can be used to warp back and forth on the editing timeline. \nDial: Art Director’s take \nOur Art Director didn’t share Microsoft’s enthusiasm about the dial. He said “it’s cool, but seems kind of like a novelty,” because of minimal app support. The Dial also, at times, became a distraction. “In a way, the dial feels like it takes you away from the screen,” concluding that he’d “probably set it to the side, most of the time.” \nYou might be thinking – doesn’t a scroll wheel already do this? Yes, to a degree. But the Dial is designed to work with the Pen. A designer sketching out a new project won’t have easy access to the mouse, or the scroll wheel, but the Dial can be placed in reach. \nAnd it offers customization. Developers can adapt their program to it, making useful tools accessible. Or, if the Dial is used in Windows or outside a supported app, it summons a variety of options ranging from volume, to screen brightness, to apps. These functions can be changed however you desire in Dial’s settings. \nThe Dial is a lot of fun to use, but app support is limited, and that may prove to be the biggest problem. It can’t do much unless developers get on board. It’s also a $100 add-on (pre-orders get it for free), adding even more to the price of this already expensive PC. What else is in the box? \nWhile the Dial is an add-on, the Studio does come with a keyboard, mouse, and Surface Pen. \nThen Pen is the same as found with the Surface Pro and Book. We’re familiar with it, and have come to like its design. Some DT staffers find it a bit too chunky, but most have no complaint, or have more severe complaints about other stylus options. It feels responsive when paired with the Studio, and it attaches magnetically to the flanks of the screen when it’s not being used. \nMore : Everything you need to know before pre-ordering the Surface Studio \nThe keyboard and mouse, while basic, do the job asked of them. Most people should find them comfortable to use. You’ll find few options on either of them, so you will need to pick up a third-party peripheral if, say, you need five buttons on your mouse. But the Studio isn’t really about mouse use, and we think most users will find the bundled option is adequate. Microsoft Surface Studio Compared To",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft’s Cortana personal digital assistant offers a nice set of functionalities today. She provides a machine-intelligence-backed voice response system for searches, roots through email to offer up suggestions for upcoming events and package deliveries, and ties systems together with reminders that can be set on one device and show up everywhere. \nCortana is also largely a back-end system, meaning that adding features and functionality to the personal assistant is as easy as flipping a switch on Microsoft servers. This is particularly helpful as holidays and other important events roll around, and a new list skill is being rolled out just in time for the upcoming holiday season, as Microsoft lets us know via a Windows blog post. \nMore: Cortana wants to get to know you better to improve her interactivity \nGiven that December brings a number of holidays that involve gift-giving worldwide, of which Christmas is just one, PC users around the globe are likely already cleaning up their shopping lists. Now, Cortana is hoping to make the task of managing the hectic process of matching loved ones, business associates, teachers, and others with their wish lists just a little bit easier. \nStarting today, you can simply ask Cortana to make a new list and she’ll respond accordingly. Once a list has been created, you can ask Cortana to add an item and she’ll do so, and opening a list is just a “Hey Cortana” away. Because Cortana runs on iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices, she’ll also keep your lists synced and up to date no matter which of them you’re using. \nFor even more complex lists, Cortana also works with Microsoft’s Wunderlist task manager. Connect Cortana to your Wunderlist account, and you can use Cortana to create tasks in that app for even more list-management functionality. \nYou can give the new Cortana list skill a try by saying, “Hey Cortana, create a holiday list.” Stay tuned to the Microsoft blog for more holiday fun, as the company is known for using Cortana as the conduit for adding some personality to Windows 10 as holidays roll around.

      "title": "Microsoft releases new Windows 10 preview with EPUB support in Edge, Paint 3D, and PowerShell default",
      "text": "Microsoft today released a new Windows 10 preview for PCs. This is the third build ahead of the company’s Windows 10 Creators Update , coming in “early 2017,” and it brings EPUB support in Microsoft Edge, Paint 3D included, PowerShell taking Command Prompt’s default spot, improved with Japanese and Chinese Input Method Editors (IMEs), and a better Get Office app.\nWindows 10 is a service , meaning it was built in a very different way than its predecessors so it can be regularly updated with not just fixes but new features too. While Microsoft has released many such updates to date, the Creative Update will be a major one and follows the Windows 10 Anniversary Update , released in August 2016.\n\nFirst up, Edge now supports the EPUB file format so you can read any unprotected e-book in the file format just like you can with PDFs. While reading EPUB files, Edge lets you change the font, text size, and choose between three themes (light, sepia, and dark). You can also leave bookmarks, use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser, search for words or phrases, and use Cortana to define specific words.\nInsiders have been able to download a preview of Paint 3D , which will eventually ship with the Creators Update, for a while now. Starting with this build, the Paint 3D app is now included as part of Windows 10. Opening Paint from Start will now take you to Paint 3D, which is currently only available in English (support for other languages is “coming soon).\nAlso in this build, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer, replacing the Command Prompt in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. To opt out of the WIN + X change, open Settings, then Personalization, then Taskbar, and turn “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X” to “Off.”\nHere are the IME updates:\nImproved Chinese IME reliability, including fixing an issue where the IME might crash due to an incompletely downloaded or corrupted dictionary file Improved Conversion Accuracy for the Japanese IME, including fixing various issues such as when conversion was used mixed with prediction and an UX issue when trying to change phrase segmentation Improved resource usage when typing with the Japanese IME, including fixing an issue that could result in unexpected graphic glitches after using the IME for an extended period of time Last but not least, the Get Office app is no longer a collection of links to help you get started with Office. Instead, the app now helps you discover and launch apps, as well as see all your recent Office documents in one place.\n\nThe desktop build includes the following improvements and bug fixes:\nThe experimental “Snooze” action on a tab in Microsoft Edge which provides you with a way to set a Cortana reminder on the website you are viewing is no longer available. Based on data gathered and feedback received, Microsoft decided to remove it from the product and re-evaluate the feature for a future release. The cursor will no longer be shown while inking – we believe this makes the experience feel even more like pen on paper. Try it out and let us know what you think! Improved reliability when using the protractor and inking in Sketchpad. Update some desktop wizards (including “map a network drive” and “extract from zip”) to now be proportionally sized when moved across monitors. Fixed an issue where Magnifier’s keyboard shortcuts sometimes wouldn’t work on the Lock screen. Fixed an issue that could result in sometimes not being able to completely remove files in the Windows.old folder using Disk Cleanup. We have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a more secure experience in the Outlook Mail app. Fixed an issue where trying to shut down the PC while certain Device Manager dialog boxes were open would result in the PC being stuck at the “Restarting…” screen. Fixed an issue where, as closing multiple tabs with middle click in Microsoft Edge, the width of the tabs might change, resulting in potentially unexpectedly closing the wrong tab. Fixed an issue where the copy link option when right-clicking a hyperlink in Microsoft Edge wasn’t work. Fixed an issue where, if you changed the size of the Microsoft Edge window, and then closed the app by closing the final tab, the next time Microsoft Edge is launched it would once again be the default size, rather than retaining the preferred window size. Fixed an issue where pinned tabs in Microsoft Edge were not being restored. We’ve made a number of translation improvements, including for Chinese speakers fixing a translation error in the dialog that appears when installing multiple fonts at once, as well as one in Settings > System > Battery. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback Fixed an issue where, if you already hand a notification expanded in the Action Center, clicking the chevron to expand a second notification would result in it expanding then immediately closing. Fixed an issue where preferred Start menu width might not be preserved after rebooting. Today’s update bumps the Windows 10 build number for PCs from 14965 (made available to testers on November 9) to build 14971.\nThis build has four known issues:\nNavigating to Settings > System > Battery will crash the Settings app. Using keyboard monitor hotkeys to adjust brightness won’t work as expected. Desired brightness change could be done via the Action Center or by going to Settings > System > Display. Apps such as Store, Photos, and People may launch on their own after your PC has been inactive for a period of time. To stop these apps from launching on their own, un-maximize the app before closing it. The Windows Holographic First Run app can be launched but won’t detect any hardware. This app and the Windows Holographic Shell is still under active development. If you’re OK with the above and want to get build 14971 now, head to PC Settings, select “Update and recovery,” then “Preview builds,” and then click the “Check Now” button.\n",

      "title": "Azure Stack Portable – The Enterprise Cloud (in a Briefcase)",
      "text": "2016 State of The Cloud \nAzure Stack is Microsoft’s enterprise cloud technology that allows organizations to run Microsoft Azure on their own premise. During the early adopter testing phase, I needed an Azure Stack host that I could take between my office (by day) and home (on weekends), or to take to client sites to demonstrate. So I created a portable version of Azure Stack by building a 14-core / 10-terabyte cloud in a briefcase! \nFor those who need a background on Azure Stack, please see a couple articles I wrote on Azure Stack describing the technology in more detail, as well as the business use cases of who is lining up to buy Azure Stack. My initial article back in February 2016 covers some early experiences, and then a October 2016 article that updated some more recent work on Azure Stack. \nSo back to this Portable Azure Stack cloud… My first testing of Azure Stack back in 2015 involved a typical 100-pound, 4U rack mounted server that I had in a rack in one of our datacenters. Many of the bare metal build cycles of working with Azure Stack involved hands-on at the server console since after all, Azure Stack is the foundation of a datacenter infrastructure (compute, storage, networking, VMs, fabric, etc). So I found many hours sitting with a coat on freezing in the datacenter working at the console of the server. Once Azure Stack was running, I was able to remote into the server and do all other management functions from anywhere. \nHowever when you’re demonstrating Azure Stack and talking about how Azure Stack can be placed in an enterprise’s own datacenter, that it is effectively Microsoft’s scalable Azure cloud that you host on your own, when you remote into an Azure Stack environment, it’s not very exciting to see. You get an Azure console screen that looks 100% like Azure’s public cloud console screen, so the effect of talking about this on-premise Azure just didn’t have any visual impact. \nI wanted to bring Azure Stack into the conference room of our clients (that are Hosters, Finance orgs, Healthcare orgs, high-security military and government orgs) and show them Azure in their own facilities. But lugging around that 100-pound 4U rack server wasn’t too feasible, and so Azure Stack Portable was born. \nI tried to find a laptop that was big enough to run Azure Stack, however to get a “real” Azure Stack host with more than 12-cores, more than 128gb of RAM, and at least 5 physical hard drives proved impossible. And while I tried to do nested virtualization and tweak dynamic memory to make the thing work on less, while I was able to get the thing to boot, the performance to run dozens of tenants, SQL apps, Web apps, a variety of virtual machine systems, cheating the cloud of resources only killed performance. \nSo I pursued building an Azure Stack configuration out of components (motherboard, DIMM memory, power supply, etc) and instead of putting it in a large tower or desktop case, I measured all of the components and got the whole thing to fit in a briefcase! \nHere's a picture of the Azure Stack server all folded up, next to my 13\" MacBook for size comparisons... \nThis Azure Stack Portable has: an Intel 14-Core Processor 1 SSD TB Boot Drive 8 SSD TB Data Drives a 14” USB-powered LCD Display 90-watt Power Supply \nI’m able to run all of the various Azure Stack scenarios on this system with lightening fast performance that includes having 20-30 tenant VMs running at the same time, running KeyVault security, a couple VPN Gateways for test tenants to access their Azure Stack resources, Azure SQL, Azure AppService, the works! \nInternal view with the LCD display mounted on one side of the briefcase, Intel NUC WiFi router to the left, Motherboard in the middle (big silver thing is the passive heat sink on top of the massive processor), power supply to the right, hard drives are mounted toward the front of the case (you can see a cage to the left front that houses 4 of the drives, the other drives are under the black \"ledge\" I put in there), and on top of that ledge thing is a 2-way video/keyboard switch box (for the NUC / Azure Stack) and I place the keyboard and mouse on top of the ledge when I pack the thing up to go... \nEverything folds up into an 11-pound briefcase with a single wall plug. In my configuration, I also put in an Intel NUC (a small 1”x3”x3” brick computer) that has a WiFi adapter and Ethernet adapter on it. This was needed because Azure Stack assumes its IP range remains the same every time I turn it off and on, however when I connect to various WiFi connections as I move the Azure Stack Portable around, I’d get a different host server IP address and Internet gateway address. So this WiFi router solves the problem by establishing internet connectivity anywhere, but keeps the same 11.1.1.x IP address range for my Azure Stack’s external connection. \nFor the configuration, I bought all the parts from newegg.com and amazon.com and pieced the system together: SuperMicro MBD-X10SRI-F Server Motherboard LGA 2011 R3 (NewEgg # N82E16813182928, US$275) Intel Xeon E5-2660 V4 2.0 GHz LGA 2011 105W BX80660E52660V4 Server Processor (NewEgg # N82E16819117634, US$1500) SuperMicro SNK-P0048PS 2U Passive CPU Heatsink for LGA2011 (NewEgg # 9SIA1UH3H72684, US$23) And then I have 256gb of RAM (8 x 32gb DDR4 DIMMs), 1 boot drive (Samsung 850 EVO 1TB 2.5” SSD SATA 3 MZ-75E1T0B/AM) plus 8 data drives (same 1TB SSD drives) @ US$300ea GEChic 1303H 13.3\" Portable Display (HDMI, VGA, USB-Powered) (Amazon.com @ US$300) Plus power supply (with SATA cable splitters for power), keyboard, mouse, case, fans \nThis motherboard has been good with plenty of SATA connectors for hard drives, built-in VGA video, built-in speaker, so everything that the basics are needed. The motherboard supports a 20-core Intel processor and up to 512GB of RAM, but if you’ve ever priced out the cost of those components right now, it would have tripled my budget (which by the way, this whole setup as configured cost ~US$4,000) \nIts been really nice to take my Azure Stack home on weekends to do rebuilds or test bare metal stuff, and bring into the office and take to client sites to demo Azure Stack... Thing boots up and stabilizes in about 8 minutes, so as long as I can get into a conference room and power the thing on, get WiFi off the router, I'll have the thing running within 8-10 minutes. Pretty slick! \nA bit of a geek moment for those who enjoy fiddling with bare metal hardware as well as have a foot in the scalable enterprise cloud world of today!

She and colleague Heath Terry spoke with over a dozen chief technology officers, they write, gauging feedback about Microsoft, and about Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google in cloud, both of which are covered by Terry.\nThe overarching theme is that cloud is still very young but will disrupt overall IT spending in a very big way in the next four years. They see public cloud spending rising from $32 billion this year to $137 billion in 2020. That’s not including traditional software license revenue that Microsoft sells that moves to the cloud.\nOver that time, “we believe the public cloud market will continue to disrupt multiple industries, including servers, storage, networking, infrastructure software, data center construction, and data center outsourcing,” areas that amount to $500 billion in spending now and will be worth $650 billion in 2020.",

      "text": "Microsoft really has changed, Linux Foundation chief says Jim Zemlin welcomes Microsoft to the open-source consortium U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 17, 2016 10:30 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nScott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's Cloud & Enterprise division, greets Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim Zemlin on stage at the Microsoft Connect conference in New York City on November 16, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank 2016 State of The Cloud \nMicrosoft made a splash in the tech industry on Wednesday when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. While the move felt like a welcome extension of the tech giant's open source strategy to some, others saw it as a threat to Linux. \nMicrosoft's addition to the foundation was a positive step for the open-source community overall, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said in an interview. In his view, adding Microsoft as a foundation member is an important move to further the Linux Foundation's mission, \"which is to create the greatest shared technology asset in history.\" \n\"I think there is a burden on the broader open-source community — again, I think that there's a healthy anti-establishment sensibility — but there's the act of being the anti-movement, the rebel movement, and there's the act of being the mainstream movement. And to be in the mainstream does require broadening your tent and bringing as many people into that tent as possible.\" MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: Linux: Best desktop distros for newbies \nThe two organizations have been working together for a while. The first public partnership between the foundation and Microsoft appeared last year, when they announced a certification for running Linux on Azure. \nBut Microsoft has been helping out the foundation in other ways, Zemlin said. Microsoft engineers have contributed to the popular Node.js project, and the company is lending its security expertise to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a project aimed at helping to secure key open-source tools. \nWhen asked whether Microsoft was joining the Linux Foundation to destroy the open source operating system, as some commenters have mused online, Zemlin said he's \"just not a big conspiracy theorist.\" It would be rather difficult for Microsoft to kill Linux at this stage, he said, and Microsoft was already following through on a commitment to open-source software. \n\"First of all, when you join the Linux Foundation, you're obligated to support the mission of our organization, which is to support the growth of Linux and open source,\" he said. \"And Microsoft has not only committed to doing that as a part of our organization, but I've got to tell you, they're pretty much already doing it.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first rodeo as a member of an open-source group. The company is also a member of the Apache Software Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation. Microsoft has also been opening up its own products: It released .NET, PowerShell, and other tools under open-source licenses. GitHub revealed it is the company with the largest external contributor base for projects it has released. \nTo be fair, the company is paying US$500,000 for its membership, but Zemlin doesn't seem like the sort of person who would put aside potential issues with Microsoft for a big chunk of cash. He was one of the foundation's leading voices speaking out against the tech titan's past actions. \nMicrosoft is facing competitive pressures to engage with open source, thanks to the interest of its customers, as well as the changing times in computing. And as Zemlin pointed out, there's no way Microsoft alone can carry the day when it comes to building the software people need. \n\"In a world where things are in the cloud, everybody has a computer, there is too much software to be written for even Microsoft, with all their engineers, to write it on their own,\" he said. \"It ain't gonna happen.\" To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream .

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio Reviews: Apple Fans Might Be 'Tempted to Switch Camps', Despite High Price",
      "text": "A few weeks after Microsoft unveiled the Surface Studio to the public at a media event in New York City , a few websites have begun publishing the first reviews for Microsoft's new desktop PC/tablet hybrid. During its announcement in October, the Surface Studio was revealed to have a 12.5mm thin touch screen, with a 28-inch PixelSense Display that packs in 13.5 million pixels. Microsoft said that there's \"no monitor like this on the planet.\"\n\nThe first reviews of the Surface Studio are largely positive, with many reviewers enamored with the computer's large screen and slick design, as well as its purpose to fulfill and enhance productivity for creatives. However, in line with the unrest over the price of the new MacBook Pros, most of the people who have been reviewing the Surface Studio for the past week admit the $3,000 price tag is one that prohibits casual users and sets an entry bar for serious power users only.\nImages via Engadget\n\nThe Verge began by looking at the 28-inch display, which was described as \"truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used.\" Everything from plain text to videos were said to look great on the screen, and even the 3:2 aspect ratio for the desktop monitor produced better environments for reading and writing, according to the site.\n\nThe Verge also had a freelance illustrator test out the Surface Studio, and they came away largely impressed, but hoped future iterations introduced a rotating display, more ergonomic stylus, and new input options for the Surface Dial accessory. Although a slight mention, one of the site's minor annoyances was the way the Surface Dial slipped down the screen slowly when not being cradled by the user's hand, even at the computer's lowest 20-degree angle.\nThe Verge concluded its review comparing the Surface Studio to the current lineup and ecosystem of Apple products. The site said that while Microsoft's device won't be invading the homes of die-hard Apple fans just yet, the fact that the Surface Studio even hints at that possibility \"is remarkable.\" For that reason, the site admitted purchasing a $3,000 computer just for fun doodling tools in your spare time is illogical, but those Apple fans who could gain the most out of Microsoft's hardware \"might well be tempted to switch camps.\"Many creatives I’ve spoken to about the Surface Studio have said the same thing: why isn’t Apple doing this? Apple seems to be forcing creatives to choose an iPad Pro for touch and pen, but the powerful and professional apps just aren’t there yet on iOS, and it’s not clear if companies like Adobe are willing to rewrite their software to be just as useful on an iPad Pro. Microsoft has realized the potential in the market to reach out to creatives who feel abandoned by Apple, and it’s an influential crowd that could be swayed over by devices like the Surface Studio.\n\nThe fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple’s line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it’s even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it’s for — and it’s largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps.\n\n\nEngadget called the Surface Studio \"the most interesting computer released this year,\" thanks in part to the fact that its zero gravity hinge gimmick \"is actually useful.\" The site tested the top-of-the-line $4,200 tier, which includes a 2.7GHz Core i7 6820HQ CPU, 32GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and 2TB HDD, and a NVIDIA GTX 980M graphics with 4GB of VRAM, and admitted \"it was one of the most powerful PCs I've ever tested.\"\nThe Surface Studio is also a good-enough gaming alternative, although it isn't entirely up to the task of most high-end gaming PCs, with Engadget noting that the computer scored 20 percent lower than the Radeon RX 480 GPU, as an anecdotal comparison. The computer still managed to run a few games at playable speeds, including Overwatch (60 frames per second in 1080p with high settings) and Gears of War 4 (50 frames per second with medium settings).The Surface Studio is both familiar and new. It empowers us to work the way we always have, while also giving us entirely new modes of productivity. Personally, that's a philosophy I can get behind -- especially when compared with Apple's habit of pushing consumers down new roads that aren't necessarily improvements (hello, dongle life). But the Surface Studio's high price and lack of expandability could make it a tough sell for an already niche market, especially for people already devoted to their Wacom tablets.\n\nCNET also asked some creative professionals to try out the Surface Studio and got their opinions on the machine. Creative director Nick Cogan, who's helped to illustrate and design films like Ice Age and Rio, said that the Surface Studio was a \"great\" drawing tool that could stimulate workflow and ultimately be a nice main device for professional work after the initial learning curve. But, like CNET described in its review, Cogan wasn't sure if the hardware of the Surface Studio was enough of an excuse to get over the Windows-based software.The bigger challenge may be getting creative professionals to invest in such a high-end, high-price piece of gear, as many of them are creatures of habit, tied to familiar tools and hardware. As Cogan told us, \"I think the big barrier is going to be that it's Windows-based, and so many people in the creative fields are really already decades down using Macs.\" But, he adds, \"As a drawing tool, this is great, it's a lot of fun.\"\n\nIf you can afford it, and your profession aligns with Microsoft's intent to catalyze passion and ingenuity within creatives, the review consensus on the Surface Studio is largely suggesting a purchase. Those who are interested can order the computer from Microsoft's online store, although following initial pre-orders the Surface Studio's shipping estimate has now been pushed back to early 2017.\n\nThe cheapest model of Surface Studio includes an Intel Core i5 processor, 1TB hybrid drive, 8GB RAM, and a 2GB GPU for $2,999. That jumps up to $3,499 for an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB RAM, with the top-of-the-line model running for $4,199 with a 2TB hybrid drive, i7 processor, 32GB RAM, and 4GB GPU. The Surface Dial comes packaged-in for pre-order customers who order the computer before December 1, but after that date it will cost $99 sold separately.Tags: Microsoft, Microsoft Surface Studio\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "4 shares \nMicrosoft announced the Surface Studio and Dial last month as definitive proof that desktop computers still have ample room to innovate. From the excellent launch trailer to my hands-on demo, it was hard not be impressed. \nBut truth is, the best thing about the Surface Studio may not be made by Microsoft at all. \nWith the initial hype worn out, it’s easy to pick the Studio apart. It starts at $3,000. It uses last year’s CPUs and last year’s mobile GPUs. Storage is a slow hybrid SSD/HDD. There are no USB-C (let alone Thunderbolt 3) ports. The display can’t be used as an external monitor or dock. The Pen isn’t tilt sensitive. The Dial is a separate accessory. \nDid I mention it starts at $3,000? \nOf course, the price reflects more than just the specs; it’s indicative of the design and cohesiveness of the system. The Studio is unlike any computer on the market, and that uniqueness will cost you. \nThat innovation-at-a-premium approach is decidedly Apple-like. But then I remembered: This is Microsoft, the Studio is a Windows PC, and Windows means options. \nMuch like it did with tablets and laptops, Microsoft is going to make the convertible desktop a thing. Of course, not to the degree we’re now seeing it with portable computers – the desktop is well past peak popularity – but you can bet you’ll see all-in-ones with crazy form factors and accessories show up all over the place in the next few years. Dell’s already gone ahead and teased one . Envisioned in 2014, now catching the audience's eye at #adobeMAX : https://t.co/xaRg0NAYFT Join us at #CES2017 for the official announcement! pic.twitter.com/vpBHzSFhXS \n— Dell (@Dell) November 2, 2016 \nPoint is, if the Studio is too expensive, someone is going to make a PC with similar features for cheaper. If you want one that can handle high-end gaming, someone will make one of those too. No PC will be perfect, but you’ll have plenty to choose from. \nAnd that’s exactly what Microsoft wants. It collaborated with hardware partners on at least some Surface clones and laptops, and all signs suggest it will do the same now with desktops. \nSo while Microsoft may have a taken a few leaves from Apple’s book over the past few years, it’s doing so without abandoning the core value that has always differentiated Windows from Mac: choice.",

The app, created by Microsoft, uses a smartphone camera to adjust colors in images and correct for colorblindness. Color Binoculars has settings for the various kinds of colorblindness, and it can correct for each of them. For instance, one of the most common types of colorblindness is red/green colorblindness, in which people have trouble distinguishing between those two colors. Color Binoculars will brighten reds and darken greens to make them more easily identifiable. Further, it will alter hues along these same line, turning red berries among green leaves pink to make them stand out more.",

      "text": "microsoft joins linux foundation platium member More Spectral-Design/Shutterstock\nMicrosoft has gone through a number of massive changes since it began transitioning from the Windows company to the “cloud-first, mobile-first” productivity solutions company. For one thing, it has gone cross-platform with its applications, supporting iOS and Android along with Windows. For another, it has embraced open source in a way that would have been inconceivable just a few years ago.\nOne beneficiary of Microsoft newfound respect for open source software has been Linux, which for the longest time was considered an almost evil movement that went against Microsoft commitment to proprietary software. Now, Microsoft provides significant support for Linux and on Wednesday, the company announced it joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, Ars Technica reports .\nMore: Cortana, machine intelligence, and cross-platform take the lead at Build 2016\nMicrosoft’s support for Linux is not quite as robust in terms of its productivity solutions — for example, there is no Office 365 for Linux as of yet. Instead, Microsoft aimed more at supporting developers and organizations that use Linux. One example is building a Linux subsystem into Windows 10 that was officially introduced at Microsoft’s Build 2016 event. Another example is supporting SQL Server for Linux and the Docker open source container platform.\nBy joining the Linux Foundation, Microsoft can hope to meet head-on some of the skepticism that has surrounded its recent support of Linux. As Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, says, “Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.” It is likely that taking a more active role in the Linux community will demonstrate Microsoft’s commitment to open source in a way that merely offering software that works with it can accomplish.\nIn a Microsoft blog post announcing the move, Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie said, “We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry’s shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice. By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we’re helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.”\nClearly, the company recognizes the importance of open source software generally, and Linux specifically, to developers. Highly visible actions like joining the Linux Foundation should work hand in hand with efforts closer to the ground such as improving Hyper-V support for Linux to convince the community Microsoft is serious in its new approach to open source. It is now obvious that being a fan of Microsoft no longer means being anti-Linux.\nLenovo issues a new Yoga 2-in-1 BIOS enabling Linux following conspiracy accusations Linux 4.8 kernel will support newer hardware, including your Microsoft Surface 3 Microsoft PowerShell now available to users on Linux and Mac OS X systems",

      "text": "SEE: Security awareness and training policy The past \nIn 2004, Microsoft acquired GIANT Anti-Spyware and began to transform it into a Microsoft product. After a lengthy beta cycle that included the interim name of Microsoft AntiSpyware, the company released the final product in 2006 as Windows Defender—an anti-spyware tool for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 ( Figure C ). Figure C When Windows Defender first came out, it provided anti-spyware protection for Windows XP. \nWhen Windows Vista was released in 2007, Windows Defender was built into the operating system, thus providing a native anti-spyware tool. But you still needed a separate antivirus program to complete your protection. Windows Defender was integrated into the Security Center in the Spyware Protection section by default, as shown in Figure D . Figure D In Windows Vista, Windows Defender was built right into the operating system. \nOf course, Windows Defender was also built into Windows 7. However, Microsoft was cognizant of the fact that while having a native anti-spyware tool was a big plus, it wasn't enough to protect the operating system from all the types of malicious programs lurking on the internet. \nSoon after Windows 7 hit the streets, the company released Microsoft Security Essentials ( Figure E ) as a separate, free download. Microsoft Security Essentials was a much more powerful security tool that provided protection against all sorts of malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and rootkits. When installed in Windows Vista or Windows 7, Microsoft Security Essentials disabled Windows Defender and took over all malware protection duties. Figure E Microsoft Security Essentials protected against various kinds of malicious software. \nWhen Windows 8 was released in 2012, it also included a tool called Windows Defender, but in that iteration, Microsoft endowed the tool with the same malicious software protection system found in Microsoft Security Essentials. Thus Windows 8 was the first version of Windows to provide full malicious software protection right out of the box. (If you are interested in this bit of history, you can watch Jason Garms, who was the group program manager of the Windows 8 reliability and security team, present the first demo of Windows Defender and its related technologies in Windows 8 .) SEE Windows 10: Microsoft faces Russian probe over claim it pushes Windows Defender on users The present \nWhen Windows 10 was released in 2015, it essentially included the same Windows Defender found in Windows 8 ( Figure F )—except that Windows Defender settings are now integrated into Windows 10's Settings. Other features in the most current version of Windows 10 include the ability to use behavioral analysis to detect malware that changes its appearance to evade signature-based scans. Figure F Windows Defender in Windows 10. \nAnother feature in Windows 10's Windows Defender is the Cloud Protection system, along with the Automatic Sample Submission feature, which allows Windows Defender to submit data about malware found on your machine to Microsoft's Malware Protection Center. This allows Microsoft to stay on top of new malware and continually refine Windows Defender's protection capabilities. \nBecause some malicious software can be difficult to remove while Windows is running, Windows Defender has an Offline mode that will restart your PC and perform a full scan before the GUI loads. \nWindows Defender can even help out if you are not using it as your main antivirus software. When you install a third-party antivirus package, Windows Defender will step aside; however, it will then display an additional setting called Limited Periodic Scanning. If you enable Limited Periodic Scanning, Windows Defender will periodically run when you aren't using your system and when your main antivirus software isn't performing a scan. It will then scan your system for any malware that your main antivirus software might have missed. Stay on top of the latest Microsoft developments.

      "text": "Microsoft To Tie Executive Bonuses to Company Diversity Goals Dina Bass November 17, 2016 — 3:00 PM EST Percentage of women drops for second year on phone exit ‘Very modest’ gains in percentage of racial minorities \nMicrosoft Corp. will tie executive bonuses to workforce diversity goals after the company saw a second consecutive year of declines in the percentage of women employees, owing to its exit from the phone handset market. \nThe percentage of women working at Microsoft fell to 25.8 percent from 26.8 percent of the company’s workforce as of Sept. 30, largely because the Nokia handset factories that Microsoft divested employed a larger number of women, said Gwen Houston, the company’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. Houston said she’s encouraged by an increase in women in technical and leadership positions, as well as in recent hiring trends. \nGwen Houston Source: Microsoft \nThe percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees saw “very modest gains” of 0.2 percent to 3.7 percent of Microsoft’s total workforce and 0.1 percent to 5.5 percent of employees, respectively, Houston said. \n“The modest gains for people of color -- those are so slight I really want to see them improve,” she said. “That’s an area of focus that I am really committed to.” \nWhile the total numbers need improvement, Houston said new hires of women and racial minorities has increased. Women represented 27.7 percent of new hires this year and 21.7 percent of those hired for technical jobs. Of the new employees, 6.6 percent were African American/Black and 7 percent were Hispanic/Latino. Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

He is expected later Thursday to detail a plan to make diversity goals one of the factors in whether senior executives get their full annual bonuses, Houston said. In addition to training for managers, Nadella talks about the diversity work at each of his monthly question-and-answer sessions with employees, Houston said.\n“Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” she said. “That’s what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.” \nTo boost hiring of women and minorities, the company has added human resources workers with experience in that area, and Nadella funded the tripling of an internship program called Explorer for college freshman and sophomores interested in technology, Houston said. The company is also running focus groups in several U.S. cities with underrepresented groups to ask participants what would motivate them to choose careers in tech. The results will be used to improve advertising and recruiting campaigns. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. ",

      "text": "Microsoft has offered concessions to European Union antitrust regulators related to its proposed $26.2 billion acquisition of professional social networking firm LinkedIn, the European Commission said Wednesday without providing details.\nThe offer of concessions comes after EU competition officer Margrethe Vestager expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week, Reuters reported.\nThe Commission is expected to rule on the deal by Dec. 6 after gathering feedback from rivals and customers. It could accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.\nMicrosoft declined to comment, Reuters said. The planned LinkedIn deal would be the software giant's largest acquisition ever.\nCritics have suggested the acquisition could hurt innovation and reduce competition, with some also expressing concern about data privacy issues.\nUnder the planned deal, LinkedIn would keep its name and independence, with Jeff Weiner continuing as CEO.\nLinkedIn was founded in 2003 and went public in 2011. This year, it aired its first-ever TV ad during the Oscar broadcast on ABC.\nRead more: Microsoft Buying LinkedIn for $26.2B",
