      "text": "Yahoo Finance is tracking the stocks you’re following, based on your Yahoo Finance ticker searches.\nCVS ( CVS ) – The company reported sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates and cut its profit outlook for the year. CVS says it expects to see slowing prescription growth in the market overall as fewer people fill their prescriptions.\nHertz Global Holdings ( HTZ ) – The stock is sinking after posting lower-than-expected third-quarter results and cutting its outlook for the year due to weakness in its car-rental business. Hertz reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 on revenue of $2.54 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.73 on revenue of $2.59 billion. The company separated its car rental and equipment rental businesses in June.\nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) – Citigroup ( C ) is turning more bearish on Goldman, downgrading the bank’s rating to neutral from buy. The investment firm cited the pricing in of higher rates and the risk of a possible surprise outcome in the US election as reasons for the downgrade.\nTesla ( TSLA ) – The electric car maker has acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering for an undisclosed amount. The German engineering firm specialized in automated manufacturing processes.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals ( VRX ) – The Canadian drug maker’s third-quarter sales dropped 11% as its non-GAAP earnings plunged 36%. Valeant’s quarterly adjusted profit of $1.55 per share missed analysts’ expectations, weighed down by faltering sales of some of its treatments. The company also cut its full-year profit and revenue forecasts.\nToyota ( TM ) – The Japanese automaker reported US passenger-car sales fell 9% in its recent quarter as its net profit fell 36% from a year earlier. Toyota’s sales were dragged down my American car buyer’s shift to buy trucks and Sport-utility vehicles.",

      "text": "Getty Images People walk past the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. Major banks have formally told clients to expect volatile currency markets in the aftermath of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, with the gap between buying and selling prices that determines the cost of trading expected to widen sharply if Donald Trump were to win.\n\nThe warnings issued by the electronic trading platforms run by the market's largest player Citigroup and rivals Barclays and Goldman Sachs , seen by clients of the banks, have over the past two years become standard 'red flags' ahead of big political and economic set-pieces. \nBut issued broadly for the first time since Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June, they are also a measure of the scale of risks being attached to Tuesday's vote. \nBanks have forecast falls of up to 5 percent in the dollar's value against the yen if Trump were to win and a bounce of 1-2 percent for the greenback on a victory for Hillary Clinton . \nA number of retail currency trading platforms have also already raised margins clients must hold against open currency bets for fear of sharper moves in the dollar and Mexican peso. One Goldman Sachs client said the bank told clients on Monday it would not accept new stop loss orders on the peso until further notice. \nCiti and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. \nBarclays said: \"Barclays is always available for clients during macro events, providing extra staffing in London, New York and Singapore ensuring 24 hour coverage to monitor markets and handle client trades throughout US election night.\" \nThe head of trading with one large London-based investor, a client of Barclays and Citi, said both had issued formal warnings in line with standard procedure since the sudden and dramatic surge in the Swiss franc in January of last year. \n\"It is very polite and seems like just a box-ticking exercise really: as you are probably aware markets may be more volatile, expect thinner liquidity and wider spreads. It has clearly become the legal norm to do this,\" the head of trading said. \nA second client of several of the larger banks confirmed he had seen such warnings. \n\"On the Citi system they are just a pop-up. On Barclays it is an email,\" a second source said. \"Similarly to the action we saw ahead of Brexit, Goldman also told us they would not accept stop loss orders on the peso as of 3 p.m. yesterday.\"",

Bush the victory over Al Gore. \n\"I'm not discounting the possibility that there's some type of irregularity that delays an announcement before the [Wednesday] market open in Asia, [London] and possibly New York,\" she said.\n\nWhatever the outcome, Fordham said she expects to see heavy trading in the 48 hours after election.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

A Russian wouldn’t comprehend blind faith in a single institution.  //usat.ly/2fC9mjg   Join the Nation's Conversation To   A financial lesson from Russia: Expect the worst and don't whine Nicholas Clements, Special for USA TODAY 5:03   People enjoy a snowball battle in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Feb. 28. No matter how bad things get, Russians manage to carry on. (Photo: ANATOLY MALTSEV, EPA) \nBuckle up, folks. After all the election drama, we could be in for a wild ride. With the specter of market mayhem and a world of economic a social change ahead, investors, savers, spenders, retirees and the rest of us certainly have a right to feel uneasy. However, as bad as things seem, a look at what others in the world have gone through can put your fears into perspective. \nConsider Russia. With its reliance on oil production, Russia has been hit hard, with its economy sent into freefall. Despite the collapse, protests from the Russian people remain muted. Contrary to popular belief, Russians are not blindly loyal to Vladimir Putin. Instead, they expect crises to happen and handle them extraordinarily well. \nI lived and worked in Russia from 2005-2008. My tenure began with the emerging market boom and ended with the global financial crisis. I witnessed the unique response of the Russian people in 2008. I was in Moscow in 2014 when the ruble collapsed, and they were at it again. To better prepare for the next crisis, here is what I learned from the Russians: \n1. Remember: No organization is too big to collapse. If you are a 40-year-old Russian, you will have witnessed the collapse of your country, the Soviet Union. In 1998 the Russian banking system collapsed and in 2008 the global financial system almost collapsed. My Russian friends still recall with humor when U.S. mortgage executives traveled to Russia in the 1990s, lecturing on how to build a mortgage system. What struck them was the absolute conviction that nothing could go wrong. In 2008, many Americans were shocked when pillars of the banking system collapsed. Russians just expected it to happen eventually. 4 Brexit-inspired financial survival tips to thrive after election \n2. Because everything will collapse eventually, diversify. Many of my Citi colleagues kept the majority of their retirement savings in company stock and lost most of it in 2008. A Russian wouldn’t comprehend blind faith in a single institution. Because nothing is too big to collapse, you need to diversify. People regularly criticize Russians for moving money out of their country into dollars and pounds. For Russians, this is just diversification. \n3. Avoid building a large fixed cost base. Borrowing money means that you have optimism in the future. Taking out a mortgage means you have faith that you will be able to make monthly payments for thirty years. Russians have limited optimism. I was in the business of lending to Russians, and it wasn’t easy. They regularly live with their parents until they have enough cash to buy a home. They happily spend money when they have it. But when times get tough, they can live on close to nothing. Investors shouldn't fear Election Day (or make any big moves) \n4. When a crisis hits, adjust rapidly. And don’t whine. Russians have a strong memory of World War II, when more than 20 million died. The sacrifice of cutting expenses during a business cycle pales in comparison. And they cut quickly. Overseas vacations are replaced with Sochi. Foreign produce is replaced with local fare. \nWhen you lower your expectations, you are less disappointed when things go wrong. Although I hope we don’t fully embrace Russian realism, we could all learn about adaptation from the country that survived Stalin but considers devaluation a minor inconvenience. \nNick Clements is the co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com , a price-comparison and financial education website.

Customers can use the app to dispute damaged items, returned goods or duplicate charges, among others. Once the dispute is submitted, they will be notified via the app that Citi is taking action, the status of the case and what to expect next. Citi has also extended the app to allow customers to increase their credit limit, view recurring charges and enrol for paperless statements. Filed by Christopher Brown   11:31   12:27",

      "text": "Citi and Deutsche Bank Join Neptune to Simplify Bond Transactions Citi and Deutsche Bank Join Neptune to Simplify Bond Transactions The addition of the banks is a key step in expanding the reach of the network across EMEA, US and 0 Photo: Bloomberg \nNeptune, an open standards network utility for the fixed income market, announced today that it has added Citi and Deutsche Bank to its expanding network. \nThe FM London Summit is almost here. Register today! Pool of Bond Dealers \nThe Neptune network, which launched earlier this year, provides a venue for dealers to share information with investors on the bonds that they are looking to buy and sell, making it easier for investors to execute bond transactions. \nA total of 17 bond dealers are already connected to the network which provides information in real-time on over 11,500 different bond securities with over $100 billion in gross notional across 20 different denominations, including $30 billion is US liquidity. This is generated from over 17,000 pre trade real-time AXE indications in the system on a daily basis. \nGrant Wilson, CEO of Neptune Networks commented, “The addition of Citi and Deutsche Bank, both market leaders in bonds, to the Neptune network, is an important step forward in the development of our open-access, non-discriminatory network that links bond market participants and makes the markets more efficient”. Stakes \nCiti and Deutsche Bank are both taking stakes in Neptune, and joining the Neptune Board and are both due to start providing their data to the network shortly. \nWilson added, “Adding two market leaders such as Citi and Deutsche Bank to the already strong Neptune board, comprised of Sell-side and Buy-side, is an important step to expand the reach and scope of the Neptune pre-trade data network both locally, in EMEA, and more broadly in other key regions such as the US and Asia”. \nNeptune is a not-for-profit technology utility that was set up in 2015 to increase and improve the quality of information available to corporate bond market participants, and thereby strengthen liquidity. The data is provided to the network using an open standard which means it is cheap for users to connect to the network, and the data is easy to integrate with order management systems. New Functionality \nNeptune also released new Watch List functionality to the in-house Neptune desktop earlier this month. The desktop provides the quickest route to new clients for access to the network. The Watch List allows users to focus solely on their instruments of interest, accelerating identification and matching of sources for their required assets. \nNeptune remains focused on enabling asset managers to use their preferred method of visualizing the pre-trade data including in-house OMS, third-party OMS vendors or a direct FIX connection as it continues to build its membership of the network.

      "text": " 00 AM EST Citi Unveils Global Digital Wallet: Citi Pay Today, Citibank announced the launch of Citi Pay, a new digital wallet that will provide Citi customers with a simple and fast option for online, in-app and in-store payment needs. \nToday, Citibank announced the launch of Citi Pay, a new digital wallet that will provide Citi customers with a simple and fast option for online, in-app and in-store payment needs. \n“Whether it is online, on a phone, or at a store, we want Citi customers to have seamless, convenient and fast payment options wherever they go,” said Barry Rodrigues, Head of Global Digital Payments at Citi. “With more than 100 million customers in the fastest-growing cities in 19 countries, Citi is uniquely positioned to accelerate payment innovation on a global scale. With Citi Pay, we are offering our customers flexibility wherever and whenever they choose to make purchases.” \nCiti Pay will be made available to Citi customers for online and in-app purchases. As a digital extension of their current card relationship, Citi customers will be able to make online and in-app purchases using the same Citibank online user ID and password that they currently use to manage their existing online relationship with Citi. Citi is partnering with Mastercard ® to leverage its digital payment service, Masterpass ® , to enable the online and in-app transactions. This will allow Citi customers to use Citi Pay at hundreds of thousands of merchants across 33 countries at launch. \nFor Android users, the digital wallet also enables Citi cardholders to make in-store purchases by tapping their Android mobile devices at any NFC-enabled point-of-sale terminal. \nLater this year, Citi Pay will roll out to Citi customers in Singapore, Australia and Mexico with tap and pay capabilities. Citi Pay will also launch in the U.S. in early 2017, with online, in-app and tap and pay capabilities. Further Citi Pay launches in additional markets will follow. \nCiti Pay is the latest digital payments announcement from the bank. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi joined Early Warning’s clearXchange ® network, which will enable Citi’s online and mobile banking customers to send or receive real-time person-to-person (P2P) payments to or from customers of participating network banks. Also in 2016, Citi enabled Samsung Pay for its card members in Singapore and Australia. \nAbout Citi \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi .

      "text": "GET.com Travel How To Redeem Citi ThankYou Points For KrisFlyer Miles On Singapore Airlines How To Redeem Citi ThankYou Points For KrisFlyer Miles On Singapore Airlines \nHave you got Citi ThankYou Points from either Citi Prestige ® Card , Citi ThankYou Premier or Citi Chairman? If you are someone who's always up for traveling the world , and want to do it on a premium airline, you could consider redeeming your Citi ThankYou Points for free flights on the much-admired Singapore Airlines and its partner Star Alliance airlines. While other Citicards may reward cardholders with ThankYou Points, not all ThankYou Points earned can be used for Points Transfer. \nIf you're aiming for free flights, or at least use your ThankYou Points to offset your travel costs at Citi's participating frequent flyer or hotel loyalty programs, a Points Transfer will be essential.   explain how you can redeem your Citi ThankYou Points for KrisFlyer Miles on Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines' North America Destinations \nSingapore Airlines' destinations in the U.S. include New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , and Houston. \nSingapore Airlines is part of the Star Alliance network which consists of United, Air Canada, Lufthansa, Asiana Airlines, ANA, Singapore Airlines and many others. This network covers more than 1,300 travel destinations globally across 192 countries. It allows international travelers to travel to more destinations than they could have with the existence of codeshare partners in the Star Alliance network. \nBesides allowing travelers like you and me to get to plenty more wondrous cities and countries in the world, Star Alliance members also get to enjoy perks such as award flight redemptions, upgrade redemption awards, priority check-in and priority boarding, where available. Signing Up For A KrisFlyer Account \nYou'll need to have a valid KrisFlyer account. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for a KrisFlyer account for free on Singapore Airlines' website. \nDo ensure that your KrisFlyer account is active once your membership starts as it'll be closed after 18 months of inactivity. Also, your KrisFlyer account will be closed after 39 months from the date of your last recorded account activity. Converting Your Citi ThankYou Points To KrisFlyer Miles \nScreenshot of the Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer program on Citi's ThankYou Rewards page. \n1 Citi ThankYou Point = 1 KrisFlyer Mile \nThis 1:1 transfer value makes it easy for you to see how many KrisFlyer Miles your ThankYou Points are worth. \nYou have to transfer at least 1,000 ThankYou Points for each transfer request, and each transfer has to be done in incremental value of 1,000 ThankYou Points. \nWith KrisFlyer Miles in your KrisFlyer account, you can redeem for both Singapore Airlines flights as well as Star Alliance airlines' flights through the Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer program. \nBecause Singapore Airlines is a member of the Star Alliance, your KrisFlyer Miles can take you to over 1,000 destinations across 170 countries on different tiers of award flights. If you like, you can also use your KrisFlyer Miles to upgrade your seats on Singapore Airlines, SilkAir and other airline partners. How To Redeem Citi ThankYou Points For KrisFlyer Miles \nEverything can be done online, and you need to convert your ThankYou Points into KrisFlyer Miles if you're looking to fly on Singapore Airlines or redeem for Star Alliance flights directly from the KrisFlyer Program you're enrolled in. \nOf course, you must first have a Citi account and a KrisFlyer account online. \nGo to Citi's ThankYou Rewards website and click on Sign On . \nCiti's ThankYou website \nGo to the Travel tab and you'll see Points Transfer . \nThen, select your travel loyalty program which you'd like to transfer your ThankYou Points to. In this case, select Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer if you want to redeem your ThankYou Points for KrisFlyer Miles. \nKey in the number of ThankYou Points you want to transfer, then accept the T&Cs and confirm your Points Transfer request. \nBear in mind that you have to transfer your ThankYou Points in increments of 1,000 and that the minimum number of ThankYou Points you can transfer is set at 1,000. The maximum number of ThankYou Points that you can transfer for each Points Transfer request is capped at 500,000. \nAllow for up to 14 days for the converted ThankYou Points to be reflected as Miles in your KrisFlyer account. Where Can Your Miles Take You? \nSingapore Airlines has a distinct award chart for travel on Singapore Airlines and travel on their Star Alliance partners. \nLooking to explore East Asia? You'll need 155,000 KrisFlyer Miles to redeem for a round-trip Business Saver award on Singapore Airlines if you're traveling from the West Coast in the U.S. to Japan or South Korea. A round-trip Economy Saver award to the said destination will require 65,000 KrisFlyer Miles. \nIf you're intending to travel to Australia (Perth and Darwin) from the East Coast or Houston, a round-trip Suites/First Saver award will cost you 250,000 KrisFlyer Miles. A round-trip Economy Saver award will require 105,000 KrisFlyer Miles. \n150,000 KrisFlyer Miles will take you on a round-trip Economy Standard trip to Singapore on Singapore Airlines if you're flying from the East Coast or Houston. A round-trip Business Standard trip to Singapore will require 270,000 KrisFlyer Miles. Redeeming KrisFlyer Miles For Saver Or Standard Award Tickets \nWhen you redeem your KrisFlyer Miles online, you'll get a 15% discount on the usual number of miles required when redeeming your award tickets for Singapore Airlines (and SilkAir) destinations on Singapore Airlines' website. Star Alliance awards are not eligible for the 15% discount though. \nTo search for KrisFlyer award availability, just go to the Singapore Airlines' website, log in to your KrisFlyer account, and search directly from the homepage. Key in your desired dates, route and class of service to see what's available. Other Important Things To Take Note Of \nCiti ThankYou Points aren't created equal. \nOnly cardholders of Citi Prestige ® Card , Citi ThankYou Premier and Citi Chairman can do a Points Transfer to convert their qualifying and available ThankYou Points to participating travel loyalty programs such as Hilton HHonors, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer, Virgin America Elevate, Asia Miles and many others. \nAt the time of writing, Points Transfer does not come with a fee, so you can transfer your ThankYou points to your frequent flyer program at no additional charge. \nThere's no such limit to how many times you can transfer your ThankYou Points using Points Transfer to other participating travel loyalty programs such as Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer. But if you're transferring your ThankYou Points to your Qantas Frequent Flyer or Virgin Atlantic Flying Club loyalty program, you're limited to only 1 Points Transfer request per 24-hour period. \nOnce your ThankYou Points are converted into KrisFlyer Miles and credited into your KrisFlyer account, they'll only be valid for 3 years from the date they were credited. \nTaxes, fees, and fuel surcharges still apply even if you've redeemed your KrisFlyer Miles for complimentary Singapore Airlines award flights. \nYou can call the Citi ThankYou Service Center Hotline at 1-800-842-6596 (i.e. 1800-THANKYOU) if you prefer to speak to someone on the phone.

This is generated from over 17,000 pre-trade real-time AXE indications in the system on a daily basis. \nThis month Neptune also released new Watch List functionality allowing users to focus solely on their instruments of interest, accelerating identification and matching required assets. \n(Reporting By Laura Benitez; editing by Alex Chambers) Next In Financials ",

      "text": "Citibank Reveals its Own Digital Wallet, Citi Pay Citibank Reveals its Own Digital Wallet, Citi Pay The new service will pit Citi Pay against digital wallets from Apple, Google and Samsung. 0 Photo: Bloomberg \nCitibank today said it will soon launch its own competitor to JPMorgan’s Chase Pay which will allow consumers to pay retailers using their smartphones in stores. \nDon’t miss your last chance to sign up for the FM London Summit. Register here! \nThe new smartphone-based payment system, dubbed Citi Pay, was built to rival the mobile wallet apps already offered by Apple, Google, Samsung and others. \nCitibank is the latest banking giant that try to benefit from the prevalence of smartphones, which many now believe it will one day be consumers’ preferred way to pay for everything. \nThe bank has decided to introduce its own branded wallet sometime before the end of this year in Singapore, Australia and Mexico. Citi Pay will also launch in the US in early 2017, equipped with online, in-app and tap and pay capabilities. \nWhile the new offering apparently makes Citibank one of a series of companies trying to become the go-to payment technologies, JPMorgan Chase & Co has the bragging rights as the first America’s top-tier bank to come out with a branded digital wallet. \nBoth lenders consider their offerings as a digital extension of current card relationship, which pit against digital wallets from Apple, Google and Samsung in vying to replace the swipe of a payment card with the tap of a phone. \nThe new Citi Pay announced Wednesday is based on MasterCard Inc.’s MasterPass platform, making the wallet available at a massive number of merchants across 33 countries at launch. \nCitigroup said that by enrolling in its wallet service, the bank’s customers will be able to make online at MasterPass-accepting merchants using the same online user ID and password that they currently use to manage their existing banking relationship \nCommenting on the new product, Barry Rodrigues, head of global digital payments at Citi said: “Whether it is online, on a phone, or at a store, we want Citi customers to have seamless, convenient and fast payment options wherever they go, With more than 100 million customers in the fastest-growing cities in 19 countries, Citi is uniquely positioned to accelerate payment innovation on a global scale.” Got a news tip?

      "text": "Blog This \nToday, Citi announced the launch of a new global API Developer Hub (developer.citi.com) to rapidly connect with developers and enable them to build innovative client solutions faster than ever before. The global developer platform is one of the most comprehensive to date in the financial services industry. \nThe release of Citi APIs marks the evolution of Citi’s technology to open architecture, which will facilitate collaboration and partnerships with FinTech companies and consumer brands across the globe to benefit customers. Through the global API Developer Hub, Citi will grant developers access to APIs across eight usage categories, including account management, peer to peer payments, money transfer to institutions, Citi rewards, investment purchases and account authorization. Additional categories will be added over time. \n“Citi’s Global Developer Hub advances our open-innovation approach to delivering cutting edge solutions and enabling new streams of value for clients, partners and developers,” said Stephen Bird, CEO, Global Consumer Banking at Citi. “The rapid pace of technological change demands transformation from the inside out and the outside in. By creating a collaborative ecosystem of leading brands and developers, we will be able to offer a complete suite of products, services and experiences to meet our clients’ financial needs today and in the future.” \nSopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said, “We are delighted that Citi Singapore is playing a leading role in developing and launching this global API initiative during the Singapore FinTech Festival which is held from 14-18 November 2016. This will encourage open collaborations with the FinTech community and potentially deliver better financial services for customers, as well as re-affirm Citi’s thought leadership in shaping the future of financial services.” \nCiti has already teamed up with several leading companies, including Mastercard, Virgin Money and Wonder, that are leveraging Citi API’s to develop innovative customer solutions. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi’s Pay with Points API started providing Citi ThankYou® Rewards members with an eligible Citi credit card the option to use points to cover all or part of their purchases with a statement credit when using their card to make purchases on BestBuy.com and in the Wonder App. In October, 1800Flowers.com was added as ThankYou Rewards’ latest Pay with Points participant. \n\"The Virgin Money and Citi partnership continues to go from strength to strength,” said Greg Boyle, CEO, Virgin Australia. “A key priority is the delivery of a new dedicated Virgin Money mobile app which will leverage Citi's APIs for credit card functionality to deliver a fantastic experience for our customers. Citi's support via their APIs is critical to ensuring we meet the digital needs of our customers today and will allow ongoing innovation into the future.\" \nIn Singapore, Citi has partnered with honestbee, one of Asia’s fastest growing online concierge and delivery services, to allow their customers to apply for a Citi Cash Back card on honestbee’s website and mobile app. Launching in December, this integrated experience for customers is made possible using Citi’s API technology, allowing a seamless card application process via Citi’s merchant partners’ sites. \nThe Global Developer Hub, developed by Citi FinTech and Citi teams across Asia, North America and Mexico, is the latest in a series of Citi innovations, from pioneering the ATM to introducing the first banking app for Apple Watch. In 2014, Citi launched a global hackathon and accelerator called the Citi Mobile Challenge which traveled to Latin America, the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, with participation from thousands of developers across more than 100 countries. In 2015, Citi FinTech was created as a new unit within Citi’s Global Consumer Bank, charged with accelerating speed to market with next generation mobile banking capabilities. \nThe global API Developer Hub launched today. Developers are invited to register their interest at developer.citi.com where they will be given tools to connect in a development sandbox, enabling them to test their ideas. \nAbout Citi \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi .

      "text": "Mumbai: Private sector lender RBL Bank Ltd (formerly Ratnakar Bank) is in talks to hire Vincent Valladares, the head of Citibank’s commercial banking division in the Middle East, to lead its commercial banking operations in India, two people with direct knowledge of the development said.\nIf hired, Valladares would replace Sandeep Thapliyal, who left RBL and joined Avendus Finance Pvt. Ltd, the non-banking financial arm of Avendus Capital, as managing director and chief executive officer last week, said one of the people, both of whom declined to be named.\nValladares joined Citi in 1997 as business planning manager and was managing director at Citi India before he shifted to Dubai in 2013. \nAn RBL spokesperson declined to comment, while emails sent to a Citi spokesperson and Valladares on Tuesday did not elicit any response.\nRBL’s Rs1,211 crore initial public offering (IPO) in August was oversubscribed 70 times—the highest overall subscription among IPOs of private sector banks. \nRBL was the country’s first private sector bank to go public in last 10 years. The last was Yes Bank Ltd, which raised Rs315 crore in July 2005. State-owned Punjab and Sind Bank Ltd raised Rs480 crore through an IPO in 2010.\nRBL is backed by private equity funds such as Faering Capital India Evolving Fund, PremjiInvest, Aditya Birla Private Equity Trust and ChrysCapital.\nA number of domestic banks have of late been hiring senior executives from multinational banks. For instance, state-owned Bank of Baroda this week hired Ratnesh Kumar as managing director and chief executive of its investment banking subsidiary BOB Capital Markets Ltd. Kumar, was earlier managing director, head of cash equities and chief executive officer at Standard Chartered Securities in India.\nSeveral struggling foreign banks have either shut down certain divisions or reduced staff in the last couple of years, leading to the exit of a number of senior executives.\nLast month, South Africa’s FirstRand Bank decided to shut its retail and SME lending business in India. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc wound up its corporate, retail and institutional operations in India in May, while UK-based Barclays Plc is shutting down its cash equities division in India. In 2015, Standard Chartered Plc also shut its equities business in India.",

      "text": "  The Donald lifts the dollar: Timing the target on EUR/USD - Citi Thu 10 Nov 2016 19:56:27 GMT Author: share CitiFX on EUR/USD technical analysis: \nA backdrop that is positive for growth and inflation should have a feedback loop into Fixed Income that results in higher yields. This should also serve as a boost on an interest rate differential basis and we would therefore see the potential dynamics we outlined in the introduction as USD positive, particularly against EUR and JPY. \nThe long term chart of EURUSD also shows similarities with the late 1990s. Then, we fell to an interim low of 1.0433 in August 1997 before entering a multi-month consolidation. That low was retested 21 months later in May 1999 and the subsequent break below there saw a resumption of the downtrend. \nThis cycle we posted an interim low at almost the exact same level (1.0458) in March 2015 after which EURUSD entered a multi-month consolidation. \nA similar dynamic would suggest we could be re-testing the low by December 2016 and a subsequent break below there could signal the resumption of the downtrend. \nInterest rate differentials continue to move in favor of the USD, a dynamic we expect to continue. This further supports our bearish bias for EURUSD. For bank trade ideas, check out eFX Plus . LON ; About Us \nAll the biggest trading floors in the world have screens locked on ForexLive™.

      "text": "Financial giant Citi has set up an open platform giving software developers and financial technology (fintech) firms a \"sandbox\" in which to test their solutions.\nThe Global API Developer Portal was launched by Citi yesterday, as the global bank seeks greater efficiency in its collaboration with external innovators. API, or application programming interface, is a toolset that allows a user to test how a new solution or application works within a bigger system.\nIn Citi's case, a portal user can gain access to the bank's APIs in areas including account management, peer-to-peer payments, money transfer to institutions, Citi rewards, investment purchases and account authorisation.\n\"The rapid pace of technological change demands transformation from the inside out and the outside in,\" Citi global consumer banking chief executive Stephen Bird said yesterday when announcing the portal.\nPrior to yesterday's launch, Citi's API had already helped Singapore online concierge and delivery firm honestbee to develop a feature that allows clients to apply for the Citi Cash Back card on honestbee's website and phone application.\nA wider use of APIs has been highlighted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a key part of the nation's fintech agenda, as it means development of new innovation can be more nimble and better integrated into existing banking systems.\n\"This will encourage open collaborations with the fintech community and potentially deliver better financial services for customers,\" said MAS chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty yesterday.\nOther banks have also made progress on this front.\nOCBC launched an open API platform in May, while UOB started using API in 2014, reflecting the tech competition heating up across the industry.\n  'Citi launches portal to test fintech solutions'.

      "text": "Tweet \nCiti Salutes, Citigroup’s firm-wide initiative to support the veterans’ community led by Citi Community Development, joined with FIU today and announced a university-based career and talent development program that will provide the university’s student veterans with the necessary tools to successfully transition into civilian careers. \nThe FIU Student Veterans Career and Talent Development Program, supported by Citi and developed by FIU, seeks to support student veterans as they pursue their degrees and prepare for meaningful employment after graduation by maximizing exposure to an increased and diverse collection of core resources and personnel. The program’s training initiatives will begin in January 2017. A key component of the program is the use of prescriptive analytics to reveal alignments between student veterans’ military experience and possible career paths and civilian jobs. The program will also create an Employer Institute to introduce new employers to the benefits of hiring veterans and to further develop existing onboarding and training for employers who have active veterans hiring programs. \nTo accomplish this, Citi and FIU are launching a three-pronged approach that focuses on educating veterans, enhancing programs for professors and potential employers. Veterans: Assist veterans by translating skills and expertise they have developed in the military to a variety of desirable civilian positions; Faculty: Build on efforts to educate faculty on best practices in effective instruction to support student veterans’ learning; Employers: Continue to inform employers about the characteristics and qualities that veterans possess that make them desirable employees. \nOver 1,100 active military and veterans are enrolled at FIU, and Miami-Dade County is home to more than 52,000 veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. \n“We are proud of the dedication, service and sacrifice of our students who are in the military or are military veterans,” said FIU President Mark B. Rosenberg. “Through this win-win partnership with Citi Salutes we will enhance workforce preparation for these valuable members of the FIU family and increase their career opportunities. We cannot wait for this new chapter of our longstanding relationship with Citigroup, which has been supporting student success at FIU for more than 30 years.” \nThe FIU Student Veterans Career and Talent Development Program was announced Wednesday at the FIU Veterans Day Celebration Breakfast. This program is an expansion of a pilot project that took place in the spring with a two-day “career boot-camp” for students that included leadership and public-speaking skills, as well as translating military experience into workplace skills. \n“At Citi, we are committed to supporting transitioning service members and their families,” said Ruth Christopherson, Senior Vice President of Citi Community Development and Citi Salutes and retired Colonel, South Dakota Air National Guard. “We are proud to collaborate with FIU on a program that closely aligns with Citi Salutes’ commitment to providing veterans with the resources they need to build long lasting careers and stable financial futures.” If you're new here, you may want to subscribe to our newsletter .

Citi Pay will also launch in the US in early 2017, with online, in-app and tap and pay capabilities. Launches in new markets will follow, the bank adds. \nLast month, Citi became the latest to join Early Warning’s bank-led digital payments network ClearXChange , allowing customers to send or receive real-time P2P payments to or from users of participating financial institutions.",

      "text": "Tweet Published: 4:00   \nSINGAPORE – Banking giant Citi yesterday unveiled a new global application programming interface (API) portal to enable developers to build innovative client solutions at a faster pace. \nThe release of the Citi APIs marks the evolution of its technology to open architecture, to facilitate collaboration and partnerships with fintech companies and consumer brands to benefit customers, the bank said. Through the global developer portal, Citi will give developers access to APIs across six usage categories: Account management, peer-to-peer payments, money transfer to institutions, Citi rewards, investment purchases and account authorisation. Additional categories will be added over time, it said. \nAPIs provide developers with standard commands so they do not have to write the code from scratch. \n“At Citi, we are focused on making banking easier for our customers by leveraging digitisation, mobile technology and innovation. Our open architecture approach is supported by the launch of APIs as a key enabler for the rapid and dynamic deployment of services and capabilities that will allow us to be increasingly relevant to our customers and target markets across Asia-Pacific. The API developer portal enables the further acceleration of offering our banking services in all areas of our customers’ digital lives and ecosystems,” said Mr Francisco Aristeguieta, CEO of Citi Asia-Pacific. \nMr Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said: “This will encourage open collaborations with the fintech community and potentially deliver better financial services for customers.” \nGlobally, Citi has teamed up with several leading companies, including Mastercard, Virgin Money and Wonder. In Singapore, Citi has partnered with online concierge and delivery-services firm honestbee to allow customers to apply for a Citi Cash Back card on honestbee’s website and mobile app. The service will be launched next month. \nDevelopers can register their interest at developer.citi.com, where they will be given tools to connect in a development sandbox, enabling them to put their ideas into practice.",

      "text": "By Samantha Hurst \nCiti announced on Thursday the launch of its new global API Developer Hub . The high profile banking brand revealed the hub was created as a way to connect with developers and enable them to build innovative client solutions. \nCiti reported that through the global API Developer Hub, it will grant developers access to APIs across eight usage categories, which includes account management, peer to peer payments, money transfer to institutions, Citi rewards, investment purchases and account authorization. Sharing details about the hub, Stephen Bird, CEO of global consumer banking at Citi, stated: \n“Citi’s Global Developer Hub advances our open-innovation approach to delivering cutting edge solutions and enabling new streams of value for clients, partners and developers. The rapid pace of technological change demands transformation from the inside out and the outside in. By creating a collaborative ecosystem of leading brands and developers, we will be able to offer a complete suite of products, services and experiences to meet our clients’ financial needs today and in the future.” \nSopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, also added: \n“We are delighted that Citi Singapore is playing a leading role in developing and launching this global API initiative during the Singapore FinTech Festival which is held from 14-18 November 2016. This will encourage open collaborations with the FinTech community and potentially deliver better financial services for customers, as well as re-affirm Citi’s thought leadership in shaping the future of financial services.” \nThe global API Developer Hub is now open and developers are invited to register their interest.

      "text": "  Citi Opens APIs to Third-Party Fintech Developers What Will Banking Look Like in Five Years? \nCitigroup has made some of its application program interfaces available for third-party developers. \nThe API Developer Hub launched Thursday to foster collaboration and partnerships between fintech companies and consumer brands. Such portals allow developers to build their own financial services applications and client solutions that easily connect to Citi. Mastercard, Virgin Money and others are already leveraging Citi APIs to create customer solutions. \n“The rapid pace of technological change demands transformation from the inside out and the outside in,” said Stephen Bird, chief executive of global consumer banking, in a news release. “By creating a collaborative ecosystem of leading brands and developers, we will be able to offer a complete suite of products, services and experiences to meet our clients’ financial needs today and in the future.” \nAPIs allow software programs to connect and share data with each other more easily. By using an open API, companies can build and design programs on top of an interface and save time, money and other resources. \nFor example, Citi customers can now pay for all or part of their purchases on BestBuy.com and 1800flowers.com because those companies have integrated Citi’s Pay with Points API. \nRegistered developers operating in the new hub receive tools to connect in a development sandbox and test their ideas. \nThere are four APIs currently available to developers: one that allows Citi customers to access their account summaries; an authorization API that gives customers secure access to their account data for more streamlined transactions; one that approves access to shared Citi customer profile information for deeper engagement; and the Pay with Points API, which allows an app to accept a customer's Citi rewards points to pay for their purchases. \nThe hub is open to developers in North America, Singapore and Australia.",

      "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESSWIRE)-- Today, Citibank announced the launch of Citi Pay, a new digital wallet that will provide Citi customers with a simple and fast option for online, in-app and in-store payment needs. \n“Whether it is online, on a phone, or at a store, we want Citi customers to have seamless, convenient and fast payment options wherever they go,” said Barry Rodrigues, Head of Global Digital Payments at Citi. “With more than 100 million customers in the fastest-growing cities in 19 countries, Citi is uniquely positioned to accelerate payment innovation on a global scale. With Citi Pay, we are offering our customers flexibility wherever and whenever they choose to make purchases.” \nCiti Pay will be made available to Citi customers for online and in-app purchases. As a digital extension of their current card relationship, Citi customers will be able to make online and in-app purchases using the same Citibank online user ID and password that they currently use to manage their existing online relationship with Citi. Citi is partnering with Mastercard ® to leverage its digital payment service, Masterpass ® , to enable the online and in-app transactions. This will allow Citi customers to use Citi Pay at hundreds of thousands of merchants across 33 countries at launch. \nFor Android users, the digital wallet also enables Citi cardholders to make in-store purchases by tapping their Android mobile devices at any NFC-enabled point-of-sale terminal. \nLater this year, Citi Pay will roll out to Citi customers in Singapore, Australia and Mexico with tap and pay capabilities. Citi Pay will also launch in the U.S. in early 2017, with online, in-app and tap and pay capabilities. Further Citi Pay launches in additional markets will follow. \nCiti Pay is the latest digital payments announcement from the bank. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi joined Early Warning’s clearXchange ® network, which will enable Citi’s online and mobile banking customers to send or receive real-time person-to-person (P2P) payments to or from customers of participating network banks.

      "text": "Blog This \nToday, Citi announced the launch of a new global API Developer Portal (developer.citi.com) to rapidly connect with developers and enable them to build innovative client solutions faster than ever before. The global developer platform is one of the most comprehensive to date in the financial services industry. \nThe release of Citi APIs marks the evolution of Citi’s technology to open architecture to facilitate collaboration and partnerships with FinTech companies and consumer brands across the globe to benefit customers. Through the global developer portal, Citi will grant developers access to APIs across six usage categories, including account management, peer to peer payments, money transfer to institutions, Citi rewards, investment purchases and account authorization. Additional categories will be added over time. \n“Citi’s Global Developer Portal advances our open innovation approach to delivering cutting edge solutions and enabling new streams of value for clients, partners and developers,” said Stephen Bird, CEO, Global Consumer Banking at Citi. “The rapid pace of technological change demands transformation from the inside out and the outside in. By creating a collaborative ecosystem of leading brands and developers, we will be able to offer a complete suite of products, services and experiences to meet our clients’ financial needs today and in the future.” \n“At Citi we are focused on making banking easier for our customers by leveraging digitization, mobile technology and innovation. Our open architecture approach is supported by the launch of APIs as a key enabler for the rapid and dynamic deployment of services and capabilities that will allow us to be increasingly relevant to our customers. The API developer portal enables the further acceleration of offering our banking services in all areas of our customers’ digital lives and ecosystems,” said Angel Ng, Country Business Manager, Hong Kong, Citibank Global Consumer Banking. \nCiti has teamed up with several leading companies, including Mastercard, Virgin Money and Wonder. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi’s Pay with Points API started providing Citi ThankYou® Rewards members with an eligible Citi credit card the option to use points to cover all or part of their purchases with a statement credit when using their card to make purchases on BestBuy.com and in the Wonder App. \nIn Singapore, Citi has partnered with honestbee, one of Asia’s fastest growing online concierge and delivery services, to allow their customers to apply for a Citi Cash Back card on honestbee’s website and mobile app. Launching in December, this integrated experience for customers is made possible using Citi’s API technology, allowing a seamless card application process via Citi’s merchant partners’ sites. \nThe Global Developer Portal, developed by Citi FinTech and Citi teams across Asia, North America and Mexico, is the latest in a series of Citi innovations, from pioneering the ATM to introducing the first banking app for Apple Watch. In 2014, Citi launched a global hackathon and accelerator called the Citi Mobile Challenge which traveled to Latin America, the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, with participation from thousands of developers across more than 100 countries. In 2015, Citi FinTech was created as a new unit within Citi’s Global Consumer Bank, charged with accelerating speed to market with next generation mobile banking capabilities. \nThe Global API Developer Portal launched today.

(Photo: Provided photo) \nCocoa Beach built a 25-point lead, saw it cut to a touchdown and then scored the final 30 points on Thursday in a postseason football bowl game against Citi Christian Academy of Miami. \nDavid Demeter scored five touchdowns in the 55-18 win, rushing for 258 yards on 28 attempts to complete the year. \nThe Minutemen capped a 63-yard opening drive with a 4-yard David Demeter touchdown run. His 42-yard punt return late in the first period set up his own 5-yard ground score early in the second, making it 25-0. His long scoring run of the night was a 79-yarder in the fourth. Regional playoffs: Coaches hope teams are peaking \nQuarterback Mitchell Machock threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to David Aumuller, one of eight completions for 137 yards. He also ran in an 18-yarder, while Evan Hoke connected on a 29-yard field goal. \nAfter a 42-yard Demeter punt return late in the first quarter set up his own second-quarter 5-yard touchdown, Cocoa Beach's lead was 25-0 with two minutes to play until halftime. A score by the home Heat on a fake punt keyed a brief comeback, and when Citi Christian returned the second-half kickoff for a score, it was 25-18. \nSkyler Hester and Ryan Tsarnas both intercepted Citi Christian passes, and Cocoa Beach forced a safety for the game's final points.",

Android users will also be able to make contactless NFC-based payments in-store at eligible terminals. Citi’s move follows similar wallets from other banks, including Capital One and Wells Fargo. The wallet will launch later this year in Australia, Mexico, and Singapore, and in the US in early 2017. \nThe bank could capitalize on consumer trust and convenience to facilitate adoption. The new product fragments an ecosystem already struggling with adoption issues, which could eschew users. \nBut Citi Pay helps eliminate friction for online purchasing, which might push Android customers to then test the wallet they’re using online in the store. Even more, 75% of customers trust their banks most to provide mobile wallets, which could help Citi Pay pick up users who might be fearful of security issues from competitors. \nCiti Pay may be part of a broader strategy to more effectively engage consumers through digital channels. Citi has been adding mobile banking features quickly. The bank has signed on with bank-owned digital peer-to-peer (P2P) service Zelle. And Citi recently launched the ability to initiate credit card disputes from its mobile banking app. Like these functionalities, Citi Pay could help drive up mobile banking engagement and tie customers more closely to Citi over third-party services. That could help the firm increase lifetime customer value. In itself, wallet adoption could help increase spending on Citi cards, which could lift revenue. But even more, mobile banking customers tend to consume more banking products and have considerably lower attrition rates. That means that Citi could channel this engagement into a cross-selling opportunity and capitalize on customers that turn to the bank on a more regular basis. \nMobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. \nEvan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.

      "text": "Friday, November 11, 2016 8:30PM IST (3:00PM GMT) Citi Launches Global API Developer Hub to Enable Open Banking Citi Joins with Developers and Leading Consumer Brands to Fuel Innovation New York, United States Today, Citi announced the launch of a new global API Developer Hub (developer.citi.com) to rapidly connect with developers and enable them to build innovative client solutions faster than ever before. The global developer platform is one of the most comprehensive to date in the financial services industry. The release of Citi APIs marks the evolution of Citi’s technology to open architecture, which will facilitate collaboration and partnerships with FinTech companies and consumer brands across the globe to benefit customers. Through the global API Developer Hub, Citi will grant developers access to APIs across eight usage categories, including account management, peer to peer payments, money transfer to institutions, Citi rewards, investment purchases and account authorization. Additional categories will be added over time. “Citi’s Global Developer Hub advances our open-innovation approach to delivering cutting edge solutions and enabling new streams of value for clients, partners and developers,” said Stephen Bird, CEO, Global Consumer Banking at Citi. “The rapid pace of technological change demands transformation from the inside out and the outside in. By creating a collaborative ecosystem of leading brands and developers, we will be able to offer a complete suite of products, services and experiences to meet our clients’ financial needs today and in the future.” Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said, “We are delighted that Citi Singapore is playing a leading role in developing and launching this global API initiative during the Singapore FinTech Festival which is held from 14-18 November 2016. This will encourage open collaborations with the FinTech community and potentially deliver better financial services for customers, as well as re-affirm Citi’s thought leadership in shaping the future of financial services.” Citi has already teamed up with several leading companies, including Mastercard, Virgin Money and Wonder, that are leveraging Citi API’s to develop innovative customer solutions. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi’s Pay with Points API started providing Citi ThankYou® Rewards members with an eligible Citi credit card the option to use points to cover all or part of their purchases with a statement credit when using their card to make purchases on BestBuy.com and in the Wonder App. In October, 1800Flowers.com was added as ThankYou Rewards’ latest Pay with Points participant. \"The Virgin Money and Citi partnership continues to go from strength to strength,” said Greg Boyle, CEO, Virgin Australia. “A key priority is the delivery of a new dedicated Virgin Money mobile app which will leverage Citi's APIs for credit card functionality to deliver a fantastic experience for our customers. Citi's support via their APIs is critical to ensuring we meet the digital needs of our customers today and will allow ongoing innovation into the future.\" In Singapore, Citi has partnered with honestbee, one of Asia’s fastest growing online concierge and delivery services, to allow their customers to apply for a Citi Cash Back card on honestbee’s website and mobile app. Launching in December, this integrated experience for customers is made possible using Citi’s API technology, allowing a seamless card application process via Citi’s merchant partners’ sites. The Global Developer Hub, developed by Citi FinTech and Citi teams across Asia, North America and Mexico, is the latest in a series of Citi innovations, from pioneering the ATM to introducing the first banking app for Apple Watch. In 2014, Citi launched a global hackathon and accelerator called the Citi Mobile Challenge which traveled to Latin America, the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, with participation from thousands of developers across more than 100 countries. In 2015, Citi FinTech was created as a new unit within Citi’s Global Consumer Bank, charged with accelerating speed to market with next generation mobile banking capabilities. The global API Developer Hub launched today. Developers are invited to register their interest at developer.citi.com where they will be given tools to connect in a development sandbox, enabling them to test their ideas. About Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.

This will encourage open collaborations with the FinTech community and potentially deliver better financial services for customers, as well as re-affirm Citi’s thought leadership in shaping the future of financial services.” Citi has already teamed up with several leading companies, including Mastercard, Virgin Money and Wonder, that are leveraging Citi API’s to develop innovative customer solutions. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi’s Pay with Points API started providing Citi ThankYou® Rewards members with an eligible Citi credit card the option to use points to cover all or part of their purchases with a statement credit when using their card to make purchases on BestBuy.com and in the Wonder App. In October, 1800Flowers.com was added as ThankYou Rewards’ latest Pay with Points participant. \"The Virgin Money and Citi partnership continues to go from strength to strength,” said Greg Boyle, CEO, Virgin Australia. “A key priority is the delivery of a new dedicated Virgin Money mobile app which will leverage Citi's APIs for credit card functionality to deliver a fantastic experience for our customers. Citi's support via their APIs is critical to ensuring we meet the digital needs of our customers today and will allow ongoing innovation into the future.\" In Singapore, Citi has partnered with honestbee, one of Asia’s fastest growing online concierge and delivery services, to allow their customers to apply for a Citi Cash Back card on honestbee’s website and mobile app. Launching in December, this integrated experience for customers is made possible using Citi’s API technology, allowing a seamless card application process via Citi’s merchant partners’ sites. The Global Developer Hub, developed by Citi FinTech and Citi teams across Asia, North America and Mexico, is the latest in a series of Citi innovations, from pioneering the ATM to introducing the first banking app for Apple Watch. In 2014, Citi launched a global hackathon and accelerator called the Citi Mobile Challenge which traveled to Latin America, the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, with participation from thousands of developers across more than 100 countries. In 2015, Citi FinTech was created as a new unit within Citi’s Global Consumer Bank, charged with accelerating speed to market with next generation mobile banking capabilities. The global API Developer Hub launched today. Developers are invited to register their interest at developer.citi.com where they will be given tools to connect in a development sandbox, enabling them to test their ideas. *About Citi* Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.

      "text": "print \nBI Intelligence \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Payments Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nLater this year, Citi will launch Citi Pay, its own proprietary mobile wallet that will allow its customers to make online, in-app, and in-store payments. \nIn partnership with Masterpass, all customers will be able to make online and in-app purchases at “thousands” of merchant partners in 33 countries. Android users will also be able to make contactless NFC-based payments in-store at eligible terminals. Citi’s move follows similar wallets from other banks, including Capital One and Wells Fargo. The wallet will launch later this year in Australia, Mexico, and Singapore, and in the US in early 2017. \nThe bank could capitalize on consumer trust and convenience to facilitate adoption. The new product fragments an ecosystem already struggling with adoption issues, which could eschew users. \nBut Citi Pay helps eliminate friction for online purchasing, which might push Android customers to then test the wallet they’re using online in the store. Even more, 75% of customers trust their banks most to provide mobile wallets, which could help Citi Pay pick up users who might be fearful of security issues from competitors. \nCiti Pay may be part of a broader strategy to more effectively engage consumers through digital channels. Citi has been adding mobile banking features quickly. The bank has signed on with bank-owned digital peer-to-peer (P2P) service Zelle. And Citi recently launched the ability to initiate credit card disputes from its mobile banking app. Like these functionalities, Citi Pay could help drive up mobile banking engagement and tie customers more closely to Citi over third-party services. That could help the firm increase lifetime customer value. In itself, wallet adoption could help increase spending on Citi cards, which could lift revenue. But even more, mobile banking customers tend to consume more banking products and have considerably lower attrition rates. That means that Citi could channel this engagement into a cross-selling opportunity and capitalize on customers that turn to the bank on a more regular basis. \nMobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. \nEvan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Addresses the key barriers that are preventing mobile in-store payments from taking off.

We do not yet know the run rate impact going forward, but we think a worst case scenario would be a ~€6M headwind (€1.5M x 4) to FY17 (-20%) with a more conservative projection in the €2.8M range (Q3 Y/Y declines in UK+Germany of ~€700K x 4). We roughly split the difference and lowered our FY17 revenue estimate from €28.4 to €24.9M (~13%). We lowered OpEx ~6% Y/Y to €12.7M which results in net loss per share of -€0.83.",

      "text": "Government & Policy Florida voters split in straw poll about testing Frankenflies in Zika fight Citizens in Key Haven, where the trial would take place, voted against it. The county Key Haven is in, however, came down in favor of testing genetically modified mosquitoes. 11:57 AM Share \nVoters in one Florida county were at odds on a ballot referendum Tuesday about whether to allow the first trial of “Frankenflies”— mosquitoes genetically engineered to reduce populations of the species that spreads Zika. \nThat species, the Aedes aegypti, lives in homes and is difficult to root out with insecticides. In addition to Zika, they spread yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya. \nIn Key Haven, the town where the trial could be staged, more than 65 percent of voters rejected the plan. In Monroe County, which encompasses Key Haven, more than 57 percent of voters said yes to it. \nThe ballot measure, sometimes referred to as a “straw poll,” is non-binding. A final decision on the question will be made by the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District Board, which is scheduled to meet Nov. 19 to discuss the poll results as well as the results of five other surveys the county has conducted. \nThe outcome of these deliberations could encourage further exploration of the technology, which its manufacturer and charity benefactors describe as a silver bullet to curbing mosquito-borne illnesses, but detractors say is an expensive and risky business opportunity. \nElection 2016 reader survey results: ✓ 100 things insiders said about Trump's healthcare plans \n“While we did not win over every community in the Keys, Oxitec appreciates the support received from the community and is prepared to take the next steps with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control Board,” said CEO Hadyn Parry in a statement. Oxitec, the company that developed the “Frankenflies,” is owned by Intrexon Corporation, a biotechnology firm with a portfolio focused on synthetic biology. \nIf the trial moves forward, the British-based company’s mosquitoes would be released three times a week over the small peninsula. Key Haven is home to just 1,000 residences and a single gas station. The native mosquito population is insulated by seawater and the island’s main highway, making for a perfect trial location, the company said. \nIf the trial goes as planned, those mosquitoes will breed with native females, the ones that bite. Both the genetically engineered insects and their offspring carry a fatal gene, and die quickly. Over time, the population will thin out. \n“We’re very happy with the results,” Mosquito Control Board Chairman Phil Goodman said of the Monroe County vote. He thought Key Haven voters got bad information about the safety of the trial and anticipates the board will choose to go forward, but find another site in the county. \nBut the referendum has implications beyond this tiny section of the Florida Keys. Miami-Dade County, Florida’s most populous county, has been watching closely and is considering using the genetically modified mosquitoes as well. But the small enclave of Key Haven is a vastly different place than the bustling tourist destination of Miami-Dade, home to 2.7 million people. \nA company representative said he could not discuss pricing until the product is sold commercially — as opposed to in a trial period. But in the past, Oxitec has charged based on number of people benefiting from the technology’s use. In Brazil, the tab ran $7.50 per resident. Company officials, however, have told Monroe County that its costs will not be more than it already budgets to control Aedes in the lower keys — about $1.2 million annually, Goodman said. \nTrial skeptics raise additional red flags. For instance, since the genetically engineered mosquitoes do not by design produce offspring, the company would have to continually pump them into the environment. \n“If you want to implement a male sterilization program, there are other ways to do that,” said Durland Fish, a Yale University professor of microbial diseases as well as forestry and environmental studies, who questions the plan. “This is a business opportunity. This is expensive. And you can’t stop doing it.” \nSome vocal Monroe residents have raised environmental concerns and even circulated an online petition. \nThe Food and Drug Administration determined in August that the trial would have “no significant impact” on the environment, paving the way for the mosquitoes’ release. And the World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization have tentatively recommended expanding trials, with the caveat that more clinical data is needed. \nBut it may not be so straightforward, said Fish. Eliminating Aedes from one ecosystem could lead to a reinvasion, or an invasion of another disease-carrying species, like Aedes albopictus, he added. \nLuke Alphey, who engineered the mosquitoes and cofounded Oxitec, has a very different view. “Part of the motivation for this research was using modern genetics to provide the striking benefits of this kind of approach [sterilizing mosquitoes],” including the avoidance of insecticides and being able to target a specific species without harming others. \nThis article originally appeared on Kaiser Health News , a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of 3-D printer maker Voxeljet ( VJET ) are down 15 cents, or 3.6%, at $3.95, after the company yesterday afternoon warned its Q4 revenue will rise only 4%, to €4.9 million, below consensus for €5 million, and its net loss will be 95 Euro cents per share, well above the 39 cents that had been expected.\nCEO Ingo Ederer remarked that “regarding short term business, we continue to operate in a complex economic environment with lower than anticipated customer adoption rates.”\nPeers 3D Systems ( DDD ), Stsratasys ( SSYS ) and ExOne ( XONE ) are rising sharply today, an indicator the Street views Voxeljet’s problems as largely “company-specific.”\nThe stock has gotten some ratings cuts today, including a downgrade to Sell from Neutral by Citigroup ’s Kenneth Wong , who also cut his price target to $3.50 from $5, citing the prospect that “shares could sell off in the range of the potential reduction in FY17 street revenue (~10-20%).”\nOf particular concern is that “the typically steadier services business” was the “source of weakness” in the quarter, he writes, “vs the lumpier printer segment.”\nIt’s not yet clear how low revenue will decline going forward, he writes:\nWe expect management will reduce OpEx (SGA: €9-9.5M, R&D: €4- 5M) to offset the lower revenue trajectory. We do not yet know the run rate impact going forward, but we think a worst case scenario would be a ~€6M headwind (€1.5M x 4) to FY17 (-20%) with a more conservative projection in the €2.8M range (Q3 Y/Y declines in UK+Germany of ~€700K x 4). We roughly split the difference and lowered our FY17 revenue estimate from €28.4 to €24.9M (~13%). We lowered OpEx ~6% Y/Y to €12.7M which results in net loss per share of -€0.83.",

      "text": "Market  43am EST Handlowy CEO says not aware of any plans for Citi to exit Poland \nWARSAW, Nov 14 (Reuters) - \n* The chief executive officer of Poland's Bank Handlowy said on Monday he had heard of no plans by its owner Citigroup to reduce its presence in Poland. \n* Some foreign banking groups have decided to exit Poland, where the government wants to increase local ownership of the country's banks, leading to market speculation that others such as Citi could follow. \n* \"I have not received such signals. I've been hearing for 10 years about (a) Handlowy sale and have to admit that this speculation has calmed down,\" Slawomir Sikora told a news conference following the bank's results. \n* Handlowy's website says Citi has a 75-pct stake in Handlowy \n* Poland has already bought back GE Money's Polish arm this year and plans to buy the second-largest lender Pekao from UniCredit, as well as Raiffeisen's Polish arm.

      "text": "0 Comment The Global Covenant Of Mayors For Climate & Energy Announces The Collective Impact Of Cities To Move The Paris Agreement From Commitment To Action ...At COP22, Local Leaders Showcase Their Commitment To Accelerating Global Progress On Climate Change...Report Demonstrates That Cities Must Be At The Forefront Of Global Climate Investments By William Nana Yaw Beeko, Online Editor, Reporting From Marrakech, Morocco \nMarrakech, November 14, 2016 – Today, during the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakech, local leaders from 7,100 cities announced the collective impact of their actions to accelerate world progress on meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement and stressed the importance of expanding access to city-climate finance. \nBy taking bold action and tracking their progress transparently, the cities of the soon-to-be Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy -- a coalition created by the Compact of Mayors and EU Covenant of Mayors -- are demonstrating what can be accomplished when cities are empowered and supported to reduce emissions, build resilience and work collaboratively. \nCities already account for more than 70% of global energy-related GHG emissions and with urbanization on the rise, it is projected that nearly 66 percent of the world’s population will live in cities by 2050, making cities the epicenter of climate solutions. \nThrough their commitments to the EU Covenant of Mayors and the Compact of Mayors, local leaders are working to build low-carbon resilient cities of the future. They take robust action on climate mitigation and adaptation through sectors such as buildings, transportation, waste and energy -- improving the quality life for their communities while working to achieve a carbon neutral world. \nOverall, the potential of the 596 commitments made by Compact cities are equivalent to reductions of nearly one billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2030 or 11.6 billion cumulative tons between 2010 and 2030. This represents 26% of what we know is possible globally through direct city action through action by these cities alone. \nBased on the over 6000 formal commitments the cities of the EU’s Covenant of Mayors are projected to have an overall estimated reduction of 240 Mt CO2e i.e. 27% by 2020 . These emissions reductions from Covenant cities may represent approximately 31% of the overall EU28 GHG emission reduction target by 2020 compared to 2005. With a reduction of 23% achieved already in 2014, the Covenant cities are well on pace to reach this goal. [1] \nThe aggregate numbers released by the EU Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors demonstrate the power of cities to contribute to national climate targets--but cities can do even more when they are supported. The reports further demonstrate the importance of improving city-level climate financial access to unlock the potential for city action in areas such as sustainable infrastructure. \nMichael R. Bloomberg, UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change: \"COP21 gave cities a voice in international climate talks for the first time, and that was a big reason for the summit's success. Now, COP22 is a chance to build on that momentum and give cities resources to speed their work.Cities must play a key role for the world to meet the goals set in Paris - and as this report shows, the growing Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy is helping to lead the way.\" \nMarošŠefčovič, Vice President of the European Commission: “When we look at the impact of city climate action around the world, we can only draw one conclusion: cities are crucial partners in the world's fight against climate change. Cities of the Covenant of Mayors have already achieved an overall reduction of 23% in emissions and, more than ever before, they want to continue on this path. That's why we must build local capacity and strengthenpartnerships across all levels of government, not only in Europe, but at the global scale. That's why we need the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy: to empowercities to take bolder steps in this fight, tochallenge other cities to do the same, and to ensure that leaders from around the world recognize the significance of cities on achieving global climate goals.\" \nMayor Paes of Rio de Janeiro, C40 Cities Chair: “Mayors from around the world are making bold commitments to fight climate and tracking their progress transparently through the Global Covenant of Mayors. We are delivering results but our work is just beginning—here at COP22, I am relaunching the C40 Call for Action on Municipal Infrastructure Finance which outlines 6 key actions that national governments and financial institutions can take to support cities in accessing finance to deliver on their ambitions for a climate-safe world.” \nMpho Parks Tau, President of United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and former Mayor of Johannesburg: “While the steps we take in local communities around the world are vital to the future of our cities, they are also vital to the future of our planet. Cities are stronger when we work together -- the aggregate impact of commitments made through the EU Global Covenant of Mayors and the Compact of Mayors continues to grow and as an expanded coalition of over 7,000 cities under the Global Covenant of Mayors our impact will be even greater. We call on the international community to support our efforts and recognised them as official contributions to reaching the Paris Agreement.” \nThe merger between the Compact of Mayors and the EU Covenant of Mayors in January 2017 will form the largest and first-of-its-kind coalition of cities committed to fighting climate change, and will also transform what is possible from the ground up. The Global Covenant of Mayors will increase the tools and opportunities for cities to reduce emissions while increasing climate resiliency and access to clean energy. \nThis coalition aims to advance investments in local sustainability efforts in all sectors, and scale up local action to meet the global challenge of climate change. Cities that set carbon reduction targets and implement changes are the necessary forces propelling the world towards reaching the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. \nThrough the Global Covenant of Mayors, cities will share a common vision under a single global framework. They will commit to set, measure and be accountablefor achieving their climate goals, ultimately leading to coherent, quantifiable results of their impact on reducing global greenhouse emissions. By informing cities of the next steps beyond ratification, the world can achieve carbon neutrality in this century. \nTo learn more about the aggregate impact of the Covenant of Mayors , click here , for the Compact of Mayors, click here , and to explore the full Global Covenant of Mayors brief, click here . \nAbout the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy \nThe Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy formally brings together the Compact of Mayors and the EU Covenant of Mayors, the world’s two primary initiatives of cities to assist cities and local governments in their transition to a low-carbon economy, and demonstrate their global impact. Led by UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, Michael R. Bloomberg, and European Commission Vice President, MarošŠefčovič, the coalition comprises more than 7,100 cities across 6 continents and 119 countries, representing over 600 million people or 8% of the global population. \nAbout the Compact of Mayors The Compact of Mayors is a global coalition of mayors and city officials pledging to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change, and to track their progress transparently. The Compact was launched in September of 2014 by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, Michael R. Bloomberg. \nThe Compact was activated under the leadership of the global city networks — C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)— and with support from UN-Habitat, the UN’s lead agency on urban issues. \nAbout the EU Covenant of Mayors Created in 2008 to implement the EU's 2020 climate and energy targets, the Covenant of Mayors has firm commitments of over 6800 cities in 58 countries resulting in Action Plans with an investment of over €110 billion. In 2015, Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete has launched the integrated Covenant of Mayors incorporating also adaptation to climate change and extending it to the 2030 timeframe. \nCovenant signatories voluntarily pledge action to support implementation of the European Union 40% greenhouse gas-reduction target by 2030 and the adoption of a joint approach to tackling mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The EU Covenant of Mayors is funded by the European Commission and currently operated by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR), Climate Alliance, Energy Cities, EUROCITIES and the European Federation of Agencies and regions for Energy.",

      "text": "Best Near-Term Price Gains Ahead For: Biotechnology Developers Stocks (Seeking Alpha) \nCiti’s Yigal Nochomovitz believes the “opportunity set” for Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc (NASDAQ: RARE )'s pipeline is fully valued in the mid-$60s. \nNochomovitz downgraded the rating on the company from Neutral to Sell, while lowering the price target from $66 to $64. MAA Withdrawn \n“We had always viewed the EU conditional filing for Ace-ER as risky given the small and exploratory Ph2 lacking a primary endpoint. The withdrawal of the MAA following a CHMP hearing earlier this week confirms this risk,” the analyst mentioned. \nUltragenynx Pharma had announced the withdrawal of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Ace-ER in the EU on November 11. \nNochomovitz now awaits the Phase 3 data, which is expected in H2:17, to re-evaluate the Ace-ER opportunity. \nHowever, the stock appreciated 4.24 percent on November 11, following the company reporting the withdrawal of the MAA. BLA Filing \nOn the other hand, management recently completed a meeting with the FDA regarding KRN23, where the FDA indicated that Ultragenyx Pharma did not need to complete the ongoing Phase 3 pediatric trial in order to file the BLA. \nHowever, it is still unclear whether the company would need to complete the Phase 3 trial for filing, due to which Ultragenyx Pharma now intends to file the BLA for KRN23 in H2:17. \nAt last check, Ultragenyx was down 3.66 percent at $79.06.

      "text": "Chico's at 52-week high on post-election confidence (Seeking Alpha) \nIn a note released Monday, Citi said it is turning more bullish on the specialty retail and department store universe following Donald Trump's election victory. The firm's logic? The likelihood of tax reform provides a bump that many of the retailers in its universe needed, as consumers may be left with more money in their pockets to spend. \nAccordingly, the firm upgraded its ratings on four retail stocks in its coverage universe. USD Strength To Help U.S.-Focused Retailers \nAnalyst Paul Lejuez said he is generally more constructive on the retailers having a higher percentage of sales generated in the United States, given the likelihood of the dollar strengthening. The analyst also said he looked at EPS sensitivity to comps, short interest, EBIT margins and valuation multiples to cherry pick stocks from within its overall more bullish stance. 4 In Focus Citi's preference for Boot Barn Holdings Inc (NYSE: BOOT ) stems from the fact that oil prices/rig count is stabilizing, its customer base is red state, its exposure is purely to the United States, short interest is high and valuation is attractive. The firm recommends buying Chico's FAS, Inc. (NYSE: CHS ) due to its depressed EBIT margin, the operational improvements in the work in the company, upward bias to sales, nearly 100 percent U.S. exposure, customer base turning more confident and attractive risk/reward. Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS ) is also deemed a buy by Citi, as its exposure is purely to the United States, short interest is high, customer base is more confident, valuation is attractive and sales/earnings have upside potential. To L Brands Inc (NYSE: LB ), Citi is attracted by its attractive long-term growth opportunity, with its two dominant brands, namely Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, high percentage of U.S. revenue and attractive valuation. \nHowever, Citi remains less constructive on more defensive off-price retailers Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROST ) and TJX Companies Inc (NYSE: TJX ), as these have high multiples. However, the firm still views their businesses as great. Rating Changes: Boot Barn: Upgraded to Buy from Neutral; price target upped to $19 from $12. Chico's FAS: Upgraded to Buy from Neutral; upped to $16 from $13. Kohl's: Upgraded to Buy from Neutral; upped to $64 from $50. L Brands: Upgraded to Buy from Neutral; upped to $84 from $74. At Last Check Boot Barn was up 1.64 percent at $15.51. Chico's FAS shares were up 8.39 percent at $14.85. Kohl's was up 7.42 percent at $57.17. L Brands was up 2.03 percent at $70.57. Ross was up 1.18 percent at $64.39. TJX was flat at $75.41.

Top-ranked analyst Paul Lejuez of Citigroup on Monday upgraded a group of specialty retailers that could benefit from a boost in discretionary income thanks to lower taxes proposed by President-elect Donald Trump. \n\n\"We cannot ignore the likelihood that tax reform (both personal and corporate) provides a bump that many of our retailers need. Whether on the right side of the Trump win or not, with tax reform consumers are likely to find more money in their pockets (creating a rising tide),\" wrote Lejuez in a note to clients. \nLejuez's picks have a 15 percent one-year average return with a 66 percent success rate, according to analyst ranking service TipRanks, placing him in the top 5 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry. \nIn the next 12 months, he thinks shares of four specialty retailers could each see their stocks rise by at least 17 percent.",

You can always call Citi and ask. They make do it with terms you want... Or, for that matter, call several lenders. You may have some special BT offer available. Some people (not me) get surprisingly good offers from Chase and Barclaycard, too.   Re: New Credit line with Citi... Post by Tubpbs » Sun Oct 09, 2016 7:37 pm Agreed. I usually have one pending from Citi or BoA at most times. They're not really good offers, but they're BT offers. I don't need one, but I assume you could negotiate better terms or at least try.

I've also had good over-the-phone service with them as well.I've never had any big issues with them.

So the other night I took advantage of a 21 month B/T offer with Citi on the Diamond Preferred Card. I read Citi was one of the better (and longest) for B/Ts, and they have good customer service. After I pay it off I could see it as part of the rotation.Any Citi members have any tales, good or bad, to share? Their customer service isn't top of the line at all, in my opinion anyways. Sure there will be a rep you can chat with 24/7 but those reps aren't knowledgeable in the slightest. One time one of their reps told me contactless was being phased out. Another made a mistake of accidentally copying and pasting directions a supervisor was giving them for a basic question. Trust me, Citi's reps are idiots and they all speak heavily accented English which you can barely understand. I just product changed to the Diamond card though, it seems ok if it's a backup card after the initial BT offer. Joined: Tue Dec 03, 2013 1:53 pm Location: Dallas Re: New Credit line with Citi... Post by daniel2304 » Mon Nov 14, 2016 10:02 am I have been with Citi for 2 more years and this morning I decided to close all my accounts with them just over a late fee charged of $25. They have horrible representatives (both chat and call). I found out that I missed the payment due date just one day, and I chatted with them to explain. The first rep told me to make a payment and when I have the payment confirmation number, contact them back to ask for a waiver. Ok, I made the payment right that time. I even offered her the payment confirmation number, but she said I needed to wait for it posted. Contact back later. Sure.This morning, I chatted with them again to request the waiver. They told me it was declined. I told them to look at the previous chat and see what I was promised. He said unfortunately. He told me to call their 800 number and I called. Wait for more than 30 minutes on the line and they said no. I said this was my first time ever I have made a late payment. It was not my intention, it was a slip out of my mind. And my bill management app did not alert me. He said bank errors is not a good reason for this waiver. I said could you consider this was the first time and waive it? He said unfortunately. Well, unfortunately on my part as well!!P/S: Please spare me from all the blame it was my fault or something like that. Everyone makes mistakes here and there, but the way they treated customer by going around, tell them to do this and didn't honor their promise was the main reason for me to cut my business with them. All my posts are my opinions. All my posts mentioned \"you\" are merely for discussion-purpose only. No advice is given in any post at any time. It is also impossible for me to put effort to verify every statement that anyone has given.

I read your PS, but still feel it's necessary to mention that this is in no way their fault and they have no obligation to do anything. It's not that big of a deal really. Closing your accounts in a huff could potentially set you backwards on credit scoring etc. Not worth it. Just don't use the cards if you don't want...I'd just relax and think it over when you're calm if I were in your shoes.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Citibank Launches Challenge to Apple and Google With Citi Pay \nCiti is the latest company to enter the mobile wallet wars, which is dominated by Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal , Samsung Pay, and others. \nOn Thursday, the finance titan c unveiled Citi Pay, a new mobile wallet for Android phone users. The concept is similar to Android Pay, Google’s googl mobile payments service, in that customers load Citibank credit card and debit card information onto an Android app. \nShoppers can then use that app to make in-store purchases at any merchant equipped with point-of-sale registers supporting near-field communication (NFC) technology, which enables frictionless payments between smartphones and registers. Users place their phones near the registers’ sensors for payments instead of swiping a card. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nCustomers can also use Citibank online login and password information to make online purchases and in-app purchases. Citi is also partnering with Mastercard ma to allow Citi Pay customers to use the platform as a payment method with hundreds of thousands of online merchants across 33 countries at launch. \nCiti Pay won’t launch in the United States until early 2017, but it will roll out later this year to customers in Singapore, Australia, and Mexico. \nCiti isn’t the first financial institution to take aim at the mobile wallet. Chase Bank ccf debuted its own mobile wallet in 2015. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo wfc launched a similar mobile wallet. \nBanks, like Apple aapl and Google, are hoping to connect with their customers where they are spending the most time: on their smartphones. Citibank even has a financial technology innovations group, called Citi FinTech, which is comprised of 40 employees from various parts of Citi and poached from tech companies such as Amazon and PayPal.",

      "text": "twitter TWEET More \n​Citi is removing cash from its Australian bank branches, because it is no longer worth offering a service that is used by less than one in twenty customers. \nAs consumers embrace digital banking and the role of cash dwindles, the US bank said its six Australian retail branches would remove cash handling services, because of falling demand from customers who instead manage their money digitally. Citi's six branches in Australia will no longer hold cash. Photo: Tanya Lake \nWhile Citi is a small force in domestic retail banking, the move is a sign of how banks are being forced to reinvent branches in the face of a boom in digital transactions on mobile and contactless payments. \nIt came as UBS analysts even floated the idea of phasing out high-value Australian bank notes altogether, a change it said would lower crime, boost tax collections and strengthen the banks' deposit holdings. Citi said more than 95 per cent of its transactions occur outside branches. Photo: Daniel Acker \nCiti's head of retail banking Janine Copelin said less than 4 per cent of the bank's customers had made cash transactions through a branch in the last year. \n​\"This move to cashless branches reflects Citi's commitment to digital banking and we are investing in the channels our customers prefer to use,\" she said. Advertisement \n\"There is no plan to close our branches. While the number of customers visiting our branches to access cash handling services has fallen, the branch network remains an important component of how we serve our high-net worth customers.\" \nCustomers could still make cash deposits through Australia Post's network, she said, while the bank also allows deposits at National Australia Bank branches for deposit and mortgage customers. \nCiti said more than 95 per cent of its transactions occur outside branches. \nReserve Bank data also confirms the decline in cash use. Cash was used in 78 per cent of payments worth less than $10 in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, down from 95 per cent in 2007. \nAnother indication of declining cash use is the fall in the number of ATM transactions, which fell by 6.6 per cent last financial year. \nEven though cash is being used less for payments, however, the total value of $100 bank notes on issue continues to climb. \nA separate report from UBS analyst Jontahan Mott this week said there were three times as many Australian $100 notes on issue as there were $5 notes. After India last week said it would take the highest value notes out of circulation , Mr Mott said removing large denomination notes would be \"good for the economy and good for the banks.\" \nEconomic benefits would include a reduction in crime, higher tax revenue from fewer cash transactions and lower rates of welfare fraud, he said. He estimated phasing out $100 bills would raise household deposits by 4 per cent if they were put into bank deposits. \nWhile Citi is believed to be the first bank in Australia to remove cash from its branches, other lenders have transformed branches in other ways. \nANZ, for instance, opened its first branch without tellers in Bondi this year. Instead, the branch is staffed by other bank workers who specialise in areas such as home lending, or helping customers with digital banking. Advertisement",
