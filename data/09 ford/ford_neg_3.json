      "text": "Honda, Toyota, Ford, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford \nIf the Subaru Outback is the leader of a cult, as Dan Neil wrote in the Wall Street Journal \nSubaru of America reported an all-time monthly record of 18,008 Outback sales in October 2016, smashing the nameplate’ \nSUV/crossover sales across America grew just 2 percent in October. Yet in spite of the market’s slowdown, limited supply, and an abbreviated sales month, Outback volume jumped 22 percent, year-over-year.Subaru’s rapid American rise is built on the steady growth of its high-riding models: the Outback, Forester, and Crosstrek. Outback sales have grown by two-thirds over the last five years. The Forester, Subaru’s best-selling model so far this year, is on track for a fourth consecutive record sales year. The Crosstrek now outsells the combined efforts of the car on which it’ \nWith those three models producing nearly three-quarters of Subaru’s U.S. volume, the brand has already produced 76,000 more sales through the first ten months of 2016 than in all of 2013. In fact, the Crosstrek, Forester, and Outback have already generated 31,000 more sales through the first ten months of 2016 than the whole Subaru brand p \nYet plans to improve Subaru’s U.S. production footprint have by no means fully taken hold. “We will add over 100,000 [units] to U.S. capacity for next year,” a Subaru spokesperson told TTAC earlier this fall . Subaru had more vehicles to sell this October than last — a 23-day supply heading into October 2016; only 15 days heading into October 2015, according to Automotive News . The industry as a whole currently has a two-month supply of new vehicles.As a result of Subaru’s limited supply, incentives remain at an industry low. says Subaru spent just $1,130 on incentives per vehicle in October 2016, up significantly from $695 per vehicle in October 2015, up modestly from $1,088 per vehicle in September of this year. \nBut Subaru’s incentive spend this October was still 68-percent lower than the industry average. TrueCar reports that Subaru’s incentive spending as a percentage of Subaru’s average transaction price was just 3.8 percent in October 2016, again the lowest in the industry, and 64 percent below the industry average. Subarus average transaction price jumped 6 percent, year-over-year, to $29,356 in October 2016, 12 percent below the industry average, a reflection of a lineup that lacks a three-row utility vehicle. \nAs for the Outback, specifically, Subaru’s current flagship was responsible for one-third of the brand’s total U.S. volume in October. Year-over-year, Outback sales have increased in nine consecutive months. The 18,008-unit total achieved in October was fully 6 percent better than the Outback’s previous record set just one month earlier (the previous record stood for eight months) and positioned the Outback . \nThe Outback ranks 12th among utility vehicles — unless you consider it a wagon with a lot — so far this year. \nSounds mainstream to me. \n[Images: Subaru] \nTimothy Cain is the founder of GoodCarBadCar.net , which obsesses over the free and frequent publication of U.S. and Canadian auto sales figures.

      "text": "Prior to SEMA, we saw enderings of an interesting mashup between a Ford Mustang GT and a Ford GT. The car debuted at the show in the flesh. It is called the GTT , and it's the creation of the Corona, California, shop Zero to 60 Designs. There's more Mustang than GT here because the car started as a Mustang. However, we find the look to be interesting and well integrated.\nThe lawyers from the Blue Oval brand have reportedly been paying attention to the GTT. According to Motor1 , the lawyers met with the Zero to 60 Designs team and have hashed out a naming plan for the car that is reminiscent of what Singer and Porsche have with the 911. It can't be called the Ford Mustang GTT.\nIt's now called the Zero to 60 Designs GTT. There is no mention of Ford or Mustang, and the original Mustang GT rear badging has been updated so that it no longer uses Ford designs.\nWe have to applaud Ford for not outright putting a stop to this unique machine. The design actually looks pretty cool, and we hope to see a GTT on the street down the road.",

      "text": "( google map )   This is a propane injection setup that came off a 390 Ford v8 that last ran a few years ago judging from the inspection sticker. It's a model e regulator and a 225 mixer, both from Impco, along with some miscellaneous hosed and the air cleaner lid components (called the horn I believe) so you can run an air cleaner on top. I don't know much about propane injection and do not have a cheap source for it nearby, so cool as this stuff is I'm just gonna pass it on to someone who can use it! $60 obo takes it all. Will trade for a clean 55 gallon barrel with removable lid, Jerry cans, hunting stuff, archery stuff, ammo, tools, or other interesting stuff. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5843119099",

Instead of going to a museum to see one, you get to see it in action,” said Rich Largent, with the EAA. “That’s just thrilling to us.” \nThe plane was rare to begin with. Built by Ford, in 1929, only 199 were manufactured. 8 are still flying. \nIt’s considered the great-granddaddy in aviation history when it comes to passenger airlines. \n“By the early '30s, 1932, 1933, this airplane could no longer pay for itself by carrying nine passengers,” Largent explained. “It could pay for itself by moving cargo and things like that.\" \nThe airplane will be available for rides on Saturday and Sunday. It will be $75 for adults and $50 for those 17 and under. \nCopyright 2016 WECT . All rights reserved. Trending Stories Trending Stories More>> ",

      "text": "A Naperville veteran who's getting a free house built for his family now has another reason to be thankful.\nArmy Spc. Tony Chobanov got a free car on Veterans Day from Bob Rohrman Schaumburg Ford , giving his family their own set of wheels for the first time in more than a year.\nChobanov, 32, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury from serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. He's struggled to adjust since returning in 2008, and his family's finances are a constant challenge.\nBut now, thanks to one of several suburban dealerships run by Army veteran Rohrman, a car payment won't add to the burden.\nThe dealership handed over the keys to a 2016 Ford C Max, a hybrid that usually sells for at least $24,000. Chobanov, his wife, Abbey, and their three kids left with all fees paid and a full tank of gas for the drive back to the home they're renting in Naperville.\nThe family won't be living there for long, however, because an Arlington Heights-based nonprofit called A Soldier's Journey Home is building them a house on a 1.3-acre lot in Spring Grove. The house, on a quiet, semirural lot where Chobanov should encounter fewer stressors to trigger his anxiety, is expected to be complete by June.\nRelated Article \nNaperville veteran given a new house as he confronts PTSD   Get articles sent to your inbox.

      "text": "November 11, 2016 — American / Truck & 4x4 / Under $20k | 2 Comments Emperor High-Top Camper: 1970 Ford E-200 \nThis 1970 Ford E-200 van is equipped with a period Emperor high-top camper conversion likely fitted from new. Repainted in its original shade of green, the van is claimed to be solid, good running and smooth driving. Powered by a 302ci V8 backed by an automatic transmission, it should go down the road easily, as both brakes and steering are power assisted. Furthermore, the interior is clean with new laminate, as well as many of the comforts of home–A/C being one notable exception. Find it here on eBay in Palm Springs, California with reserve not met. \nDebuting in 1961, the Falcon-based E-series first came in snub-nose van or forward-control truck form. Redesigned as a larger vehicle for 1968 and fitted with F-series suspension components replacing the Falcon bits, these vans remain some of the coolest looking domestics built. Displaying period correct details and repainted in its original color, this one could be great for camping out at next year’s big race events. \nWe dig this pistachio shade of green, and the above angle shows what looks like nice bodywork underneath. An RV-style awning is a significant plus, and curtains appear like they could be original–they’re definitely era-appropriate regardless of their age. Blackwall tires are described as nice, and look perfect mounted on white steelies with caps. \nDescribed as clean, the interior looks better than expected, and we dig the exposed linkage for the column-mounted automatic shifter. Gauges and lights reportedly work properly, while plastic surfaces appear worn-in rather than abused. The only area of concern is said to be the drivers seat, which is probably pretty torn up under an ill-fitting circa 1990 parts store cover. \nThe passenger seat looks excellent, and while there are drilled holes in the doghouse, everything else looks pretty good. A new laminate floor has been installed in what’s described as a “comfortable and roomy” rear area, though unfortunately no good photos are provided. Equipped with a gas stove, sink, refrigerator, bathroom, numerous electrical outlets and a TV, the lack of cooling beyond open windows could be a deal-breaker for some, though A/C wouldn’t be impossible to retrofit. \nBuried underneath the hood and doghouse is a 302ci V8 backed by a 3-speed automatic. Power steering and brakes are desirable options, and while it’s nearly impossible to see anything here, the van is said to be a good runner. Related Stories",

      "text": "2016 Ford Explorer Platinum Preview A DriveWays Review... Share By Frank A. Aukofer \nLos Angeles, Calif.—Remember when buying any new vehicle was all about getting a good deal? That’s still true in many cases but now a whole bunch of customers actually want to spend more money on some vehicles, which is the reason for the 2016 Ford Explorer Platinum. \nFord unveiled the new mid-size crossover utility vehicle here at the annual Los Angeles Auto Show, saying among other things that it has the most premium, highest quality interior ever offered on a Ford vehicle. \nAnd why not? According to Matt Zuehlk, the Explorer brand manager, 90% of buyers of the existing Explorer Sport model order the most expensive options packages available. “It’s a strong signal customers are ready for Platinum,” he said. \nMoreover, buyers in China, which now is the biggest new vehicle market in the world, are gravitating big time toward car based crossover utility vehicles, according to Jim Farley, Ford’s executive vice president. He said buyers there wanted the best and had the money afford it. Also, CUV sales in Europe are up 72% since 2008, he said. \nThe Platinum Explorer now tops the lineup above the Base, XLT, Limited and Sport models. Though it has not usually been regarded in the same company with expensive premium makes, Ford says its research shows that 20% of its Explorer customers previously owned a luxury vehicle. \nThe Explorer dates back to 1991, when it made its debut as a truck-based sport utility vehicle (SUV) competing with the likes of the Jeep Grand Cherokee , Toyota 4Runner and Nissan Pathfinder . It soon became the most successful of the genre and, in its best year in 2000, topped more than 445,000 sales. This year, sales are on a pace for 180,000, Farley said. More than seven million have been sold in all. \nIn recent years, along with others of its kind, the Explorer abandoned its SUV truck underpinnings and morphed into a car-based crossover. Crossovers now have become the SUV-like vehicle of choice with the pure SUVs still preferred by buyers who haul big loads or tow heavy trailers. \nIn essence, the plush new Explorer Platinum is a tall people mover with seven-passenger seating, a sophisticated all wheel drive system, up high driving position and virtually every amenity a buyer would find on a high line luxury car. \nSome items, standard or available: Full safety equipment, including adaptive cruise control, collision warning with brake support, lane keeping assist, blind spot warning and cross traffic alert. An interior decked out with fine leather and stitching, real satin finished ash wood and brushed aluminum trim. Power folding third row seats that can be arranged in four ways with the touch of buttons. Tailgate that opens with a wave of a foot under the rear bumper (pioneered on Ford’s own compact Escape CUV). Automatic parking, both parallel and perpendicular. All terrain settings for the four wheel drive, similar to the sophisticated system used on vehicles from Land Rover, once owned by Ford. Front and rear wide angle cameras with washers. \nOn the Platinum and Sport models, a standard 365 hp V6 EcoBoost engine delivers 350 lb-ft of torque through a six speed automatic transmission with a manual shift mode. EcoBoost is Ford’s moniker for turbocharging, which delivers high torque and improved fuel economy. \nThe standard engine in base, XLT and Limited models is a 290 hp, 3.5-liter standard V6. For 2016, the optional engine is Ford’s new 270 hp, 2.3-liter EcoBoost, which already is being installed in the Mustang sports car. On the Explorer, it replaces the previous 2.0-liter EcoBoost. \nThe Explorer goes on sale next year. Final horsepower and fuel economy ratings have not yet been certified. Prices have not been finalized. \nDisclosure: Review samples were provided by the manufacturer. For more information, please see our Ethics Policy .",

      "text": "2015 Ford F-150 XLT 4x4 SuperCrew A DriveWays Review... By Frank A. Aukofer About.com Rating \nYou have to lose weight and gain weight to become stronger and more efficient. That, in essence, is what the 2015 Ford F-150 pickup truck is all about. \nHighly anticipated in the motoring world, the new F-150 is the first full size pickup to be built almost entirely of aluminum. There are chunks of high strength steel—the box frame and the firewall between the engine and passenger compartments—but the body and the cargo bed are crafted of what Ford describes as “military grade” aluminum. \nIn pickup terms, it is a coup. Ford says it has wrung 700 pounds out of the F-150, which has been the best selling vehicle of any kind for 32 years, and the best selling pickup for 37 years. \nBecause truckers classify their trucks by gross vehicle weight, that weight loss translated directly into a weight gain: additional cargo carrying capability, to as much as 3,300 pounds. That’s an eye opener considering the F-150 is classified as a half-ton , or 1,000 pounds. \nGross vehicle weight rating ( GVWR ) is the total of the truck’s curb weight and its cargo capacity, or payload. Lose pounds out of the curb weight and you can add it to the payload and stick to a target GVWR. \nFor example, the 2015 F-150 XLT SuperCrew 4X4 model reviewed here had a curb weight of 4,806 pounds and a maximum payload of 2,160 pounds, or more than a ton. \nThat compares to the 2014 steel bodied F-150 SuperCrew 4X4 model, which weighed 5,731 pounds with a payload of 1,560 pounds. Numbers don’t compare exactly because of equipment differences. \nFor 2015, Ford also added an engine, to a total of four. The new one is a 325 horsepower, 2.7-liter V6 EcoBoost , which is Ford’s way of saying it is turbocharged. It delivers 375 lb.-ft. of torque, or low rpm twisting force, which is essential for towing or hauling heavy loads. On the tested four-wheel drive SLT, the towing capability was rated at 8,400 pounds. \nIt also exhibited strong acceleration without a load, thanks to the quick shifting and unobtrusive six-speed automatic transmission. \nGiven the lighter weight and the added efficiency of the EcoBoost engine, Ford says fuel economy improved by up to 20% over previous models. Fuel consumption numbers awaited certification, so the estimate here is that the 2.7-liter XLT should get an EPA city/highway/combined rating of about 19/26/22 mpg. \nBut these big pickups don’t come cheap. With the aluminum body and many additional features, including such items as stop-start technology on the 2.7-liter models, adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning, prices on the 2015 models have increased between $395 and $3,055, depending on the model and additional standard equipment. \nThe tested XLT had a base price of $40,620, including the $1,195 destination charge. It rose to $49,770 with options that included Ford’s SYNC and MyFord Touch connectivity, navigation, rear view camera, remote starting, power sliding rear window, dual sunroof, blind spot warning, a plastic bed liner and a medium trailer tow package. \nNotable options were Ford’s tailgate access, which consists of a drop down step and an assist handle, along with fold out steps on the flanks to access the cargo box from the sides. \nThe upholstery was a sturdy cloth that covered roomy and comfortable seating for five. Even the center rear passenger, with a flat floor and plenty of knee- and headroom, gets an adequate though slightly less accommodating seat. Other models get leather or a mix of leather and vinyl upholstery. \nOne shortcoming was that this $49,770 truck did not come equipped with automatic climate control, which to this reviewer would be way preferable to the dual pane sunroof. \nThe lower weight aluminum body translates directly into a lighter though solid feel and better handling on the highway. This is, after all, a giant pickup truck, so no one should expect it to attack curving roads like a sports sedan. But the tested F-150 held a confident line as long as it was not pushed too aggressively. \nThe jouncing ride on rough roads will be familiar to pickup aficionados but the F-150’s was supple and controlled. Suspension system modifications improved the ride and largely eliminated the tendency, without a load, for the rear wheels to skip around corners under acceleration. \nAll pickup manufacturers in the U.S. build capable full size trucks. Ford’s new aluminum F-150, for now, has lapped the field. \nSpecifications Model: 2015 Ford F-150 XLT 4X4 SuperCrew four door pickup truck. Engine: 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6, 325 horsepower, 375 lb.-ft. torque. Transmission: Six speed automatic with four wheel drive. Overall length: 19 feet 4 inches. EPA passenger volume: 136 cubic feet. Weight: 4,806 pounds.",

Fair shape per KellyBB (minor exterior dings, interior isn't perfect, tires may not match, may need mechanical work, etc.), valued just over $3K per KBB. It has been used as our dump hauling/farm truck the last 10 years and has just under 92K miles. Has electric trailer brakes, tow ready or camper ready (bed electrical connector and bed stabilizer bar). It runs (I just made a trip to the dump) but it needs brake work and engine work - that's why it is 1K under KBB - sold as is.

      "text": "More from Grace Macaluso, Windsor Star Published on: November 11, 2016 | Last Updated: November 11, 2016 6:59 PM EST \nBill Grady, who may have an opportunity to return to his Ford job, sits with his children William, 6, left, and Maya, 9 on November 9, 2016. Nick Brancaccio / Windsor Star Share Adjust Comment Print \nBill Grady is entering his 10 th year as a laid off Ford worker – a milestone that could dash any hope of returning to a job at one of the automaker’s two engine plants in Windsor. \n“One day, I hope to get back in,” said Grady. “But, I don’t think there are any new jobs coming anytime soon.” \nOne of 280 laid off Ford workers, Grady worries that the automaker’s plan to invest $613 million in its Windsor operations will begin long after his recall rights are due to expire next fall. That means if there are any new job openings, Grady, who spent a decade at Ford before getting laid off in 2008, would have to apply as a new hire, starting at the bottom of a 10-year pay grid and seniority list. \nThe investment is part of a new four-year contract, covering about 6,700 Ford workers, including 1,400 at two engine plants in Windsor. Chris Taylor, president of Unifor Local 200, which represents hourly workers at the Essex Engine and Windsor Engine plants, estimated that the new contract will create or preserve 500 jobs. \n“I would expect anybody who is still on layoff with recall rights will be recalled, and for those who’ve lost recall rights, we have an agreement with Ford that they will hire these people as new hires,” he said. \nHiring opportunities are expected to stem from a $400 million engine program slated to be launched at Ford’s Annex site sometime in late 2018 or 2019 and technology upgrades expected to be fully implemented at Essex Engine for the 2018 model year. \nFor Grady, 41, returning to Ford as a new hire creates a dilemma. On the one hand, he could look forward to earning higher wages and superior benefits as a Ford employee. But, he would be giving up his seniority at his current job, which pays about $15 an hour less than the maximum hourly rate at the automaker. \n“I’d have to start from scratch, no seniority, no pension plan,” he said. “So, I’d be taking a chance.” \nUnder the new, four-year contract, new hires remain on a 10-pay grid, but receive annual pay hikes in each year. The new deal also moves new hires from a hybrid defined benefits/contribution pension plan to a straight defined contribution plan. \nMaintaining the 10-year grow-in created a wedge between the Windsor local and Unifor’s Oakville union, which had been pressing the national leadership to secure a shorter pay grid for new hires, who make up about 2,200 of the 5,000 hourly workers at Ford’s vehicle assembly plant there. \nBut, securing investment was Unifor’s top priority in the recent round of bargaining with Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler. While, the union extracted about $1.5 billion in new spending at Detroit Three plants deemed to be at risk of closure, it was only in Windsor that it scored a “home run,” in the form of a new product. \n“It’s really a huge victory for the community of Windsor,” Unifor national president Jerry Dias said following a ratification meeting Sunday for members of Local 200. “It’s about giving people who’ve been laid off for so many years opportunities. We really hit a home run in 2016 bargaining.” \nBut Tony Faria, auto industry analyst at the University of Windsor, said the investment —while “impressive” — does little more than maintain the current level of Ford jobs and production. \n“I don’t know if it was a home run,” said Faria. “It’s in the extra-base-hit category. They did fine. I’m impressed that Jerry Dias got pretty much everything he intended to get out of this contract. But, it seems like it’s more or less maintaining jobs. There’s not going to be a significant change — more saved jobs than created.” \nThe new seven-litre engine will replace the 6.8 litre, V10 engine currently assembled by about 600 workers at the Windsor Engine plant. While the new engine will power such vehicles as Ford’s F-series super duty trucks, the annual production is expected to total about 75,000 units, said Joe McCabe, president of AutoForecast Solutions. “You would need to double production to see a significant increase in employment.” ",

      "text": "18 min ago ( … ) \nThe expectation that something dramatic might have changed at St. Louis University between the rash of transfers, implementation of a new system and influx of coaching energy was extinguished quickly. \nTravis Ford's coaching debut was at first undone by Ball State's inability to miss a 3-pointer. But SLU's 85-64 loss at Chaifetz Arena on Friday night ultimately was the result of a litany of carryover problems that will require more time to solve. \nThe Cardinals jumped to a 13-2 lead on the strength of a trio of immediate 3s and continued the long-range onslaught throughout, finishing 12 for 20 beyond the arc. \nSLU's offense wasn't up to the challenge to cut into the deficit. The Billikens shot 36 percent, had 16 turnovers, missed 10 free throws and were outrebounded 38-34. \nSLU showed signs of life in the second half by maintaining the deficit for a short while, but Ball State's experience wore on Ford's short roster, which includes remnants of last season's 11-21 team along with three freshmen. \nThe Billikens figured to be a jump shooting team but made 4 of 16 3-pointers after struggling against Greenville College in an exhibition game. Mike Crawford, who is still working his way into shape after a preseason injury, missed all six of his attempts after going 0-for-6 against Greenville. \nDavell Roby led the Billikens with 14 points and Reggie Agbeko overcame a slow start to score 12 with 10 rebounds. \nFord was full of fire most of the first half, and despite a monumental 43-19 halftime deficit he engaged the officials in an animated discussion as he left the floor, getting in one last word before walking through the tunnel. \nHe had just experienced a 20-minute blast of what transpired many times last season. The Billikens shot 24 percent, had 11 turnovers and made 5 of 13 free throws in the first half. Yes, Ford knew his team would struggle to score but maybe not to that extent. \nBall State, on the other hand, did not. The Cardinals opened with a flurry of 3-pointers to take a 13-2 lead after four minutes. They made 9 of 12 in the half from beyond the arc, including a 3-for-3 performance by Frank House, who made 19 percent of his 3s the previous three years. \nThe Billikens had long gaps without field goals, including one stretch of nearly seven minutes. Their free-throw shooting generated gasps from the crowd and a sarcastic round of applause when one went in after a string of misses. \nAll the while, the five Cardinals were dropping 3s that piled onto SLU's mounting woes. When Tahjai Teague, Kyle Mallers and Tayler Persons connected in a two-minute stretch late in the half, the Billikens had been staggered. \nStu Durando",

      "title": "Layton man could go to jail for building garage in backyard |",
      "text": "LAYTON — For decades, Chad Rackham dreamed of restoring a 1955 Ford pickup truck. But without a workspace to do so, the Layton man's dream was put on hold until he decided to build a detached garage in his backyard.\nNow, city officials have filed criminal charges against him for building it.\n“I approached the city, got the paperwork, paid the fee,” said Rackham, 58.\nAccording to Rackham, he followed all the city’s legal requests step by step.\n“I asked them exactly what to do,” he said.\nRackham said he was told the structure had to be constructed at least 20 feet from the curb. But it wasn’t until after he had already started building that city code enforcement notified him that the structure must be 20 feet from the property line, not the curb, because his house was on a corner lot.\nThat difference of 13 feet could land him in jail.\nLayton spokesman Steve Garside said the city sent Rackham a notice by mail to stop construction until the building could be brought up to code or it would have to be removed or relocated to meet the proper setback requirements outlined in the ordinance.\n“I went to the city manager’s office and asked if I could appeal. They said there was no appeals process and the variance board decision is final,” Rackham said.\nRackham then went to the city court to request an appeal.\n“The city court told me I had to go to the district court, and they kept bouncing me around. No one would accept my request to appeal this decision,” he said.\nRackham continued to build the structure. It was a hard decision to finish the building without approval, he said, because he was trying to do the right thing and follow all the city codes.\nBut Rackham said he was met with roadblocks and a “ridiculous” lack of communication along the way.\n“It was really frustrating,” he said.\nRackham said he feels like he’s being singled out.\n“I’ve seen similar structures around the city that don’t appear to meet the city code, yet they are not being punished,” he said.\nIn August, the Layton City Attorney’s Office filed three misdemeanor charges against Rackham for violation of city ordinance, building without a permit and violation of a stop-work order.\n“I just don’t understand,” Rackham said. “There have been no complaints. It’s not a hazard.  No one will return my calls.”\nThe charges against Rackham carry fines up to $1,000 and a maximum of 90 days in jail.\n“I’m being treated like a common criminal,” he said. “I’m a veteran, retired from the Air Force and the Army. I’m a postal worker. I have lived here since 1999 and have not had a scar on my record. Now I could go to jail?”\nRackham said Mayor Bob Stevenson has been accommodating, but many other city employees have not.\n“It’s my passion,” Rackham said, reiterating he just wanted to build a space to restore his favorite Ford, but he says he never thought his dream could turn into such a nightmare.\nStevenson could not be reached for comment Thursday.\nRackham pleaded not guilty to the charges against him in 2nd District Court on Oct. 4. His next hearing is scheduled for January.",

      "text": "Ford Bronco Development has Begun in Australia: Report Prototypes reportedly spotted at Ford's proving ground By: Erick Ayapana November 11, 2016 \nT he rumored Ford Bronco is allegedly being built in the U.S., but apparently development of the off-roader has already begun across the Pacific. \nAccording to Australia-based Motoring , Ford’s engineering center in Australia is hard at work developing the new Bronco, which rumors suggest could go into production by 2020. The Bronco is expected to ride on Ford’s T6 platform underpinning a number of products including the Ranger pickup truck, another model expected to make a return to America. \nThe report says that Ford’s Australian research center led the development of the T6 chassis, so it makes sense that the team would take on the Bronco project. Test mules of the next-gen Ranger and Bronco have allegedly been caught roaming in and around Ford’s proving ground in southern Australia. \n\nFord stopped selling the Bronco in the U.S. back in 1996, but speculation about the SUV’s comeback have gained steam in the past few years. Last month a Chairman at the United Automobile Workers inadvertently slipped information when he said the Ranger and Bronco are returning to the U.S. and will be built at Ford’s Michigan Assembly plant. \nHis comments are in line with a Ford and UAW contract detailing the addition of two new products at the Michigan Assembly plant in 2018 and 2020. Given that timeline, the new Bronco should arrive a few years after the debut of the next-generation Jeep Wrangler, which will arrive with significant updates including new engines and a pickup truck variant.",

(AP) — A newly released report says a dangerous chemical has again been detected at a Superfund site in New Jersey where Ford Motor Co. dumped paint sludge decades ago. The Record reports ( http://bit.ly/2g2gEzl ) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says 1,4-dioxane was detected at the Ringwood Superfund site in August. The amount and location are similar to those found earlier this year. The EPA says the chemical, which is believed to cause cancer, was found in concentrations above the state's groundwater standard. A small amount was also detected offsite at a Ringwood State Park pond. The report released on Thursday says there were no detections downstream toward the Wanaque Reservoir. Most Read ",

As a prep at Archer High School in Lawrenceville, Ga., Ford earned All-Region 8- honors after averaging 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.2 blocks as a senior. \n“I’m looking forward to using this season to get stronger and improve my game,” Ford explained. “I talked it over with the coaches and we all agreed that this would be the best decision for me and my future. The coaches think I have a lot of potential and this redshirt year will be good for me. I will still travel to all the road games and now my role is to be the best scout team player I can be and get my teammates ready for games.” \nA walk-on from Oak Park, Ill., Ballard led Fenwick High School to a mark of 28-3 and the Chicago Catholic League title in 2015-16. As a senior, the shooting guard ranked second on the Friars averaging 10.3 points per game, while grabbing 4.2 rebounds per game and shooting 39 percent from 3-point range.

Dealer Selection Receive your free dealer pricing information by completing your contact information! \nRandy Pobst is used to taking high-performance cars to their very limits on the race track, but for the latest episode of “The Racing Line,” he steps out of his comfort zone and into the world of off-road racing. \nPobst visits the Ford Performance Racing School in Tooele, Utah, for some off-road racing instruction. The school, located at the former Miller Motorsports complex, features a dirt course complete with humps, bumps, and berms all ready to be launched off at speed. Pobst first straps into a first-generation Ford SVT Raptor and tries applying his road racing experience to the very different dirt course. The instructor, BFGoodrich pro driver John Williams, watches and notes where and how he can improve. With this new knowledge, Pobst adjusts his lines and starts hanging the tail out more. He’s rewarded with bigger, faster jumps and a lot more dust kicked up behind him. \nNext, Pobst gets the chance to apply everything he’s learned in a fully race-prepped Pro Lite trophy truck . Going from the Raptor to the race truck is a big transition, as it has similar power but weighs half as much. It also has a shorter wheelbase and narrower track width, which gives it different handling characteristics. See how Pobst does playing in the dirt on the latest episode of “The Racing Line.” Related Posts",

      "text": "LAYTON — For decades, Chad Rackham dreamed of restoring a 1955 Ford pickup truck. But without a workspace to do so, the Layton man's dream was put on hold until he decided to build a detached garage in his backyard.\nNow, city officials have filed criminal charges against him for building it.\n“I approached the city, got the paperwork, paid the fee,” said Rackham, 58.\nAccording to Rackham, he followed all the city’s legal requests step by step.\n“I asked them exactly what to do,” he said.\nRackham said he was told the structure had to be constructed at least 20 feet from the curb. But it wasn’t until after he had already started building that city code enforcement notified him that the structure must be 20 feet from the property line, not the curb, because his house was on a corner lot.\nThat difference of 13 feet could land him in jail.\nLayton spokesman Steve Garside said the city sent Rackham a notice by mail to stop construction until the building could be brought up to code or it would have to be removed or relocated to meet the proper setback requirements outlined in the ordinance.\n“I went to the city manager’s office and asked if I could appeal. They said there was no appeals process and the variance board decision is final,” Rackham said.\nRackham then went to the city court to request an appeal.\n“The city court told me I had to go to the district court, and they kept bouncing me around. No one would accept my request to appeal this decision,” he said.\nRackham continued to build the structure. It was a hard decision to finish the building without approval, he said, because he was trying to do the right thing and follow all the city codes.\nBut Rackham said he was met with roadblocks and a “ridiculous” lack of communication along the way.\n“It was really frustrating,” he said.\nRackham said he feels like he’s being singled out.\n“I’ve seen similar structures around the city that don’t appear to meet the city code, yet they are not being punished,” he said.\nIn August, the Layton City Attorney’s Office filed three misdemeanor charges against Rackham for violation of city ordinance, building without a permit and violation of a stop-work order.\n“I just don’t understand,” Rackham said. “There have been no complaints. It’s not a hazard.  No one will return my calls.”\nThe charges against Rackham carry fines up to $1,000 and a maximum of 90 days in jail.\n“I’m being treated like a common criminal,” he said. “I’m a veteran, retired from the Air Force and the Army. I’m a postal worker. I have lived here since 1999 and have not had a scar on my record. Now I could go to jail?”\nRackham said Mayor Bob Stevenson has been accommodating, but many other city employees have not.\n“It’s my passion,” Rackham said, reiterating he just wanted to build a space to restore his favorite Ford, but he says he never thought his dream could turn into such a nightmare.\nStevenson could not be reached for comment Thursday.\nRackham pleaded not guilty to the charges against him in 2nd District Court on Oct. 4. His next hearing is scheduled for January.",

      "text": "Ford's Epic Overdubs Include Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Might Ruin Childhood 12 Nov 2016, 11:53 UTC · / Home / News / Car Profile My childhood is already ruined by the realization that playing with toy cars didn't turn me into a D1 legend. But hey, I at least know a lot about Dragon Ball Z and a bit about Sailor Moon so that I can present to you this comedic set from Ford. They are called Overdubs , and as the name suggests, the makers of these videos just took popular cartoon scenes that we (presumably) all remember and added Ford products in there. Let's get Sailor Moon out of the way. Usagi is well known for gazing at the stars and sighing a lot while thinking of Tuxedo Mask. Chicks dig a guy with a big top hat, I tell you. But both her and Luna the magical cat are made to talk about the new Ford Fusion, and how the mid-life updates have made it \"the most stylish car I've ever seen.\" And then, we have the scenes from Dragon Ball Z. My favorite is how they too the first fusion of Goten and Trunks into Gotenks, and made it into a promo for the Fusion sedan ... obviously. Everybody is gathered on top of Kami's Floating Island in the sky, trying to figure out how to defeat Majin Boo. The fusion between the two little Saiyans is supposed to produce the strongest warrior there is. They get absorbed, and Goku has to eventually save the say, but that's not the point. What is the point? That everybody knows what the fusion dance looks like and recognize the iconic dragon. You gather all the balls, summon the dragon and he grants you your wishes, including bringing the dead back to life - that's kind of how Dragon Ball started. But this is Polunga, the bigger dragon on Planet Namek. He works a lot differently than Shenron on earth, so the Z-fighters have an entire episode of sitting around, having an inter-planetary discussion about who to bring back.

      "text": "Put down the 10-K filings and the stock screeners. It's time to take a break from the traditional methods of generating investment ideas. Instead, let the crowd do it for you.\nFrom hedge funds to individual investors, scores of market participants are turning to social media to figure out which stocks are worth watching. It's a concept that's known as \"crowdsourcing,\" and it uses the masses to identify emerging trends in the market.\nCrowdsourcing has long been a popular tool for the advertising industry, but it also makes a lot of sense as an investment tool. After all, the market is completely driven by the supply and demand, so it can be valuable to see what names are trending among the crowd.\nWhile some fund managers are already trying to leverage social media resources like Twitter to find algorithmic trading opportunities, for most investors, crowdsourcing works best as a starting point for investors who want a starting point in their analysis.\nSo, today, we'll leverage the power of the crowd to take a look at some of the most active stocks on the market...\niShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF\nNearest Resistance: $36 Nearest Support: $33 Catalyst: Technical Setup Leading off our list of the week's most actively-traded issues is the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( EEM ) . This $27 billion exchange-traded fund has been a powerhouse in 2016, rallying more than 20% from its lows back in January through today - but that doesn't mean you should buy it now. This week, EEM violated the uptrend that's been in place for most of the year, opening up significant downside risk at this point. $33 looks like the next meaningful support level on the way down from here, but investors should avoid buying EEM until this big emerging markets ETF can start establishing some higher highs and lows again.",

      "text": "A \nSAO PAULO: The Brazilian unit of Ford Motor Co plans to resume 24-hour production at its Camaçari, Bahia, plant, in a sign of optimism with Brazil's economic recovery, O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper said on Saturday. \nAbout 400 workers who have been suspended since March, when Ford paralyzed the unit's third shift, will return to the production lines, Estado said. \nLyle Watters, Ford's chief executive for South America, told Estado that Camaçari's third shift will resume in February, with expectations that sales and exports will grow next year, albeit modestly. \n\"Despite the challenging macroeconomic scenario, the introduction of the third shift is a sign of Ford's stronger performance,\" Watters told Estado. \nSpokespeople for Ford in São Paulo could not be immediately reached for comment. \n(Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Leslie Adler) - Reuters",

      "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian unit of Ford Motor Co <F.N> plans to resume 24-hour production at its Camaçari, Bahia, plant, in a sign of optimism with Brazil's economic recovery, O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper said on Saturday. About 400 workers who have been suspended since March, when Ford paralyzed the unit's third shift, will return to the production lines, Estado said.\nLyle Watters, Ford's chief executive for South America, told Estado that Camaçari's third shift will resume in February, with expectations that sales and exports will grow next year, albeit modestly.\n\"Despite the challenging macroeconomic scenario, the introduction of the third shift is a sign of Ford's stronger performance,\" Watters told Estado.\nSpokespeople for Ford in São Paulo could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Leslie Adler)",
