      "text": "Technology Microsoft Adds Xbox One VR Gaming, Netflix 4K Support to Windows 10 The Xbox One streaming to Oculus Rift app lands Dec. 12, while support for 4K content from Netflix is available now 11/23/2016 02:21:00 PM Eastern By Chris Tribbey \nMicrosoft has announced that Xbox One game streaming for Windows 10 PCs using the Oculus Rift virtual reality system will be available on Dec. 12 via a new free app, allowing owners of the console and Rift to stream games like Gears of War 4 , Halo 5: Guardians and Forza Horizon 3 . \nMicrosoft added that it will support more games — including legacy Xbox 360 titles — for the Rift in 2017. The app works by connecting the PC with a home network that also has an Xbox One connected. Rift owners are then asked to choose between several VR environments to get started. \n“Rift works natively with Windows 10, which makes it easy to set up, jump in and have an incredible VR gaming experience,” the company said in a statement. “Combined with DirectX 12 technology that unlocks the full capabilities of new Windows 10 graphics hardware, made-for-VR games on Windows 10 will have the fastest frame rates and top performance. \nMeanwhile, Microsoft also announced that Windows 10 PCs can now handle Netflix 4K content, with Windows 10 users also receiving some exclusive Netflix 4K content, including Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , premiering Nov. 25.

      "text": "Photo: Dreamworks \nEach month, several films and TV shows leave Netflix's catalogue. We provide a list of departing titles so you can watch them before they're gone forever (or are just available on a different site). For more comprehensive coverage of the best titles available on Netflix and elsewhere, check out Vulture's What to Stream Now hub , which is updated throughout the month. \nKnockin' the suburbs : American Beauty (1999)\nRemember the days when the chief argument against an Oscar Best Picture winner was over the validity of its artistic message, and not merely the fact that Hollywood rewarded yet another movie about Hollywood? American Beauty dug a hole underneath the white upper-middle class and stuck a stick of dynamite in it, leaving the rest of us to pick up the shrapnel. It's often crude and inelegant, but there is real anger in the script, direction, and performances by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, and that anger hit bourgeoisie America where it hurt the most: their immaculately manicured front lawns. Leaving December 1. \nCan you dig it? Holes (2003)\nThe rare adaptation of a beloved children's book that doesn't try to condescend to its audience, Andrew Davis's take on the Louis Sachar novel about juvenile delinquents digging for desert treasure tells a sophisticated, mature story without resorting to fart jokes and pop-culture references. A bonus: You'll see legitimately great performances from Shia LaBeouf and Jon Voight. Leaving December 5 .\nMungiu madness : Beyond the Hills (2012)\nIn between his groundbreaking hit 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and this year's high-profile Graduation , Romanian New Wave auteur Cristian Mungiu directed this 2012 drama about two orphan girls in an Orthodox convent. Though it won Best Screenplay and Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, Beyond the Hills never made the splash with American audiences its predecessor did. Rectify that by watching this masterwork from one of the finest directors working today.

It's way too short for our liking, but manages to nail both the Zelda series and the dark tone of Majora in fewer than five minutes.\nHopefully you're watching this, Nintendo. Animation has come a long way since the days of this .\nFeel free to weep as you watch this dude surprise his wife with a car\nComedian Michael Che talks 'sh-t you can't say' in new Netflix special\nDon't do these things at the office unless you hate your co-workers\nYou probably shouldn't follow Stephen Colbert's turkey cooking advice",

Ahead of the release of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” WWD chatted with costume designer Brenda Maben to learn more about her work on the upcoming series. \nMaben spoke while vacationing in the U.K. She was touring Portchester Castle at the time —“It’s a genuine castle with a moat, but it doesn’t have any water in it, so I was a little disappointed.” She couldn’t divulge any details on the “major, fun things” that unravel in the upcoming reboot — the Netflix gods want that to be a total surprise — but she did reveal gems like how it felt to be reunited with the cast members, as well as the significance of Rory Gilmore’s Jamah handbag, which had originally been commissioned by the Patient Safety Movement for Hillary Clinton . \nWhat was it like returning to the show? \nKind of great because I got to reunite with all the actors, which I absolutely adore. The story continued and everyone was really curious about what was gonna happen, how it was gonna happen and you know, did the characters’ lives change drastically while we were gone or not. So a lot of questions got answered and a couple of surprises, and it was just a great experience. \nHad you kept in touch with the cast members? \nYes, off and on, a couple of them. We were like a family. That’s the only way I can describe it. When we came back for the show, it was as if we had never left. Their same shorthand speaking was still there, the understanding of what each person was trying to convey to the other person. It was like family. We picked up where we left off. I’ve heard of other shows getting back together and it’s a little awkwardness, a little not as smooth. This one was really smooth. All of the actors — or at least the majority of them — have gone on to do other things and bigger things. For example, Melissa McCarthy. It was as if I had seen her the day before. It was one big happy fest. \nHow have the main characters’ styles changed? \nI would say that they are a lot more mature. They’ve evolved quite naturally like any person would in a business that’s doing well. Rory maybe progressed a little more only because she’s now a working adult from college and, of course, you’re going to change your clothing a little bit because you’re in the workforce. \nWhat’s the story behind Rory’s bag? Jamah designer Nancy Gale told us that it was commissioned by the Patient Safety Movement for Hillary Clinton . \nHer work bag, yeah, it’s Jamah. I don’t know if Hillary Clinton, like, actually wore it. I know Bill Clinton has one, also. I’ve never seen Hillary with it in print, so I can’t say, ‘Oh yeah, she wears it all the time’ because I don’t really know Hillary Clinton. But that wasn’t the reason why [I chose it]. The reason why I chose the bag was because I liked the way it looked. I felt that that particular bag would relay what I wanted to say and what I felt Rory would have, given that she’s been to Europe, she’s been on jobs, she’s in the workforce now. When you start a new job or you’re just starting off, especially Rory coming from the standpoint of her grandparents, you buy one good bag. You buy a quality bag and that bag will last you for a really long time. The bag is made in America, and that was the other thing that really attracted me to it — plus, it was blue. It’s a great bag. I wish I had that bag. Jamah designer Nancy Gale and Bill Clinton. Bob Ortiz / WWD Jamah designer Nancy Gale and Bill Clinton. Jamah designer Nancy Gale and Bill Clinton. (Bob Ortiz / WWD) \nThe other thing is that after the show was over, Alexis [Bledel] had agreed to sign the inside of the bag and give it back to Jamah — because we rented it, actually — so that they could auction it off. The proceeds of the auction go to this organization called Ambition. I do a lot of volunteer work with them and their high school kids that are learning how to be successful in the world and learning how to do whatever it is they want to. I’m part of the mentoring program. I volunteer my time whenever I can. I just thought that was a good ending to that bag, to be able to help the kids. If you want to learn anything about Ambition, you can go online. It’s ambition.org. I could talk to you for hours about how great it is, and the mentors are amazing. They’re all professionals in their specific fields and they take precious time out of their day and show up to the school early in the morning and talk to the kids in their class and give them advice about so many things, like how to set up a banking account, how to save money, things like that. So that was the other part of the bag because I think Rory would have done that, too. \n(Jamah designer Nancy Gale said in a separate interview that Patient Safety had commissioned her to design bags for Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Gale has yet to see pictures of the Clintons with the bags, and she said one probable reason for this could be the government’s policies on gifts. “Even though Patient Safety commissioned me, they gave [the bags] as a gift to [the Clintons],” Gale said. “So with the government, the gifting stipulations are so strong. I do know [Hillary Clinton] got them because she sent me a letter, and I know Bill has them because I handed them to Bill.”) \nSomething we’ve gleaned from the trailers is that Lorelai Gilmore is in the middle of a midlife crisis. How did that translate to her clothes? \nI think it was more of a verbal statement as opposed to being one that showed up via the A still from Netflix’s ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ Saeed Adyani / Netflix A still from Netflix’s ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ A still from Netflix’s ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ (Saeed Adyani / Netflix) \nclothing. She didn’t do anything super wacky. \nThere has been so much anticipation around the show’s return. Did that — \nDid that make me nervous? Yeah. \nDid the anticipation make you feel any sort of pressure to go all out with the costumes? \nNo, no. I’m all about the character and I wanted to stay true to the character more than anything else. All the choices were made solely on the natural progression of each character. Some characters stayed the same basically because that’s who they are. Through life, I know you have at least one friend or one person that you knew in college that 10 years later, you see that person and yeah, they have on different clothes, but they’re basically kind of the same. Maybe a little different color, but it’s still ‘Oh yeah, that’s so and so.’ I kinda felt that that was important to keep that continuity going. \nAnything else that you’d like to add? \nIt’s really great. I can’t wait to see it all finished. I’m excited, too. I’m coming home to make sure I watch it on my personal television. \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” is out Friday, Nov. 25 via Netflix.

      "text": "This is how Amy Sherman-Palladino pitched “Gilmore Girls” to Netflix, and OMG it’s perfect How do you revive a television show that’s been off the air for nine years? The short answer is you don’t. But, if you’re Amy Sherman-Palladino and want to head back to Stars Hollow, you find a way to convince Netflix to let you make a Gilmore Girls revival — even if it means you, yourself, have to act out scenes from your planned revival. That’s one way to really WOW them.\nIn an interview with TVLine , Daniel Palladino ( Gilmore Girls executive producer, and husband of ASP), explain how they went in to a meeting with Netflix and convinced them to bring Lorelai and Rory back to life. From the sound of it, it was no easy task, but their commitment to the show clearly won Netflix over.\nThe two actually pitched to three different networks (Netflix, included) and didn’t just go in with an outline for the revival, but rather roughly 85% of it already planned out.\n“Amy and I would perform certain key dialogue moments — especially comedic ones where describing them just wouldn’t do it justice — with a performance,” he explains to TVLine. “Otherwise, over the course of the hour it would’ve gotten very dull. There were whole monologues of Lorelai’s that Amy would perform. I would sometimes play Lorelai, too. And sometimes we would recite dialogue back and forth. And sometimes we would stand. That’s how we always pitch things — with a lot of dialogue and a lot of performance.” While this sounds like an unruly Town Hall meeting, it’s ultimately what convinced Netflix to give them the green light, even without a full commitment from the cast.\n“We talked to the principal four — Lauren [Graham], Alexis [Bledel], Scott [Patterson]and Kelly [Bishop],” Palladino continues. “And we asked them, ‘If we were to do this, would you do it?’ If one of them said they absolutely wouldn’t do it, we would not have proceeded.” All this hard work and intense preparation paid off because GUESS WHAT? GILMORE GIRLS COMES BACK IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS!!!!\nThe post This is how Amy Sherman-Palladino pitched “Gilmore Girls” to Netflix, and OMG it’s perfect appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Netflix has announced some major casting for its Lost in Space revival, and it's only the Queen of Indies herself - Parker Posey! Deadline reports that Posey will play Dr Smith in the revival, scheduled to premiere in 2018. If you didn't know, Lost in Space is a cult sixties TV series that chronicles the adventures of the Robinson family who get (wait for it) lost in space after their ship gets sabotaged, and they must find a way to survive and figure out a way home. Dr Smith was the saboteur in question, which means that a) we are getting a gender-swapped villain (yay!) and b) Parker Posey is playing the villain, double yay! The series is set to be 10 episodes long, and was ordered back in June. At the time, Netflix vice president Cindy Holland said: \"The original series so deftly captured both drama and comedy, and that made it very appealing to a broad audience. \"The current creative team's reimagining of the series for Netflix is sure to appeal to both fans who fondly remember the original and to create a new generation of enthusiasts around the world.\" Lost in Space was remade in film version in 1998, and despite starring Matt LeBlanc and Gary Oldman, it did not deftly capture drama or comedy, nor did it appeal to a broad audience or those fondly remembering the original. In order to get this version right, Netflix has hired the writers of Dracula Untold and Gods of Egypt. Oh dear... entertainment and tech news? @digitalspy Twitter account and you're all set.",

      "text": "This is how Amy Sherman-Palladino pitched “Gilmore Girls” to Netflix, and OMG it’s perfect Rachel Paige More How do you revive a television show that’s been off the air for nine years? The short answer is you don’t. But, if you’re Amy Sherman-Palladino and want to head back to Stars Hollow, you find a way to convince Netflix to let you make a Gilmore Girls revival — even if it means you, yourself, have to act out scenes from your planned revival. That’s one way to really WOW them. In an interview with TVLine , Daniel Palladino ( Gilmore Girls executive producer, and husband of ASP), explain how they went in to a meeting with Netflix and convinced them to bring Lorelai and Rory back to life. From the sound of it, it was no easy task, but their commitment to the show clearly won Netflix over. The two actually pitched to three different networks (Netflix, included) and didn’t just go in with an outline for the revival, but rather roughly 85% of it already planned out. “Amy and I would perform certain key dialogue moments — especially comedic ones where describing them just wouldn’t do it justice — with a performance,” he explains to TVLine. “Otherwise, over the course of the hour it would’ve gotten very dull. There were whole monologues of Lorelai’s that Amy would perform. I would sometimes play Lorelai, too. And sometimes we would recite dialogue back and forth. And sometimes we would stand. That’s how we always pitch things — with a lot of dialogue and a lot of performance.” While this sounds like an unruly Town Hall meeting, it’s ultimately what convinced Netflix to give them the green light, even without a full commitment from the cast. “We talked to the principal four — Lauren [Graham], Alexis [Bledel], Scott [Patterson]and Kelly [Bishop],” Palladino continues. “And we asked them, ‘If we were to do this, would you do it?’ If one of them said they absolutely wouldn’t do it, we would not have proceeded.” All this hard work and intense preparation paid off because GUESS WHAT? GILMORE GIRLS COMES BACK IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS!!!!",

      "text": "November 1, 2016 Aspen Laugh Fest 2017 to welcome Whitney Cummings, Margaret Cho, Kevin Nealon “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in a release. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.”\nHis last special, “Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth,” was released in 2004 and directed by Stan Lathan, who will direct all the new Netflix specials. \nChappelle, considered one of the greatest active stand-up comics, famously began performing as a teenager in Washington, D.C. He became a masterful comic, recorded several stand-up specials and landed various movie roles, including a part in the 1998 movie “Half Baked,” a cult favorite that he co-wrote. \nBut he catapulted to fame in the early 2000s with his wildly popular sketch comedy show, “Chappelle’s Show.” The Comedy Central series was marked by Chappelle’s unabashed and biting approach to joking about race and racism. But as the show took off, he became more uncomfortable with how the public was receiving his work. \nChappelle reportedly walked away from a $50 million deal to film a third and fourth season, and his departure to South Africa fueled rumors about his well-being. He told Time in 2005 that he had gone overseas for solitude and quiet. \nHe also explained his decision to walk away from the show in 2006, telling Oprah, “I was doing sketches that were funny, but socially irresponsible. I felt like I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed. It’s like you’re being flooded with things, and you don’t pay attention to things like your ethics.” Chappelle has been absent from the small screen since, but he has been performing. If you wanted to see his new material, you had to see it live. \nAnd he has been prolific, too. In April 2007, he set a record for the longest performance at Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, with a six-hour, seven-minute set. (The previous record was nearly four hours shorter, set by Dane Cook.) Months later, Chappelle broke his record with another marathon set. \nAlthough elusive, he became known for dropping into comedy clubs and performing unannounced sets. But the popularity of “Chappelle’s Show” continued to plague him, as reports emerged of audience members interrupting his performances by yelling quotes from the Comedy Central show. During a 2013 comedy festival performance in Hartford, Conn., audience members heckled him, yelling, “I’m Rick James.” \nThat prompted the comedian to stop and declare that he didn’t need to tell any more jokes, he just had to be on stage for the time stipulated by his contract. Some audience members then began booing. “You’re booing yourself,” Chappelle told them. “I want you to go home and look in the mirror and say ‘Boo.’ Remember, that’s how I feel about you.” \nIt seems that his audiences have calmed down since. Chappelle performed 10 consecutive shows at Radio City Music Hall in 2014. \nAccording to Netflix, Chappelle has performed more than 500 concerts in the past three years. \nThe deal with Chappelle continues Netflix’s dominance over highly anticipated comedic releases. The streaming service will also put out two new specials from Chris Rock, after an eight-year absence. Rock will record one of those specials in 2017, following a world tour. \nThe streaming service’s deal with Rock reportedly reached $40 million, according to Variety.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story LOS ANGELES \nStars Hollow has been quiet for almost a decade. No quick exchange of witty banter. No late-night mother-daughter chats. No rants about cell phones in the diner. \nAfter seven seasons and 154 episodes of watching the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore unfold among family and friends, “Gilmore Girls” came to an end. Fans wept. \nThe voices are back on Netflix in the four-part series “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” The story is told through 90-minute chapters – each spanning one season: winter, spring, summer, fall. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel headline the returning cast that features some very familiar faces to fans of the show. \nIt’s been almost a decade but Graham and Bledel found it easy to slip back into their mother-daughter world. \n“It was literally like no time had passed. It was not difficult. It was easy. It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. I mean, there was no sense of having to resuscitate something. It was just like it was meant to continue,” Graham says.  ; \nOne reason it was so easy to return was that conversations about “Gilmore Girls” never stopped, despite the cast going off to do other roles. That’s why both actors signed on to reprise their roles even before scripts had been written. \nIt didn’t hurt that those scripts would be penned by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino . The energetic writer and producer, along with her husband Dan Palladino, had left the series before the start of the seventh, and final, season. \nOne conversation with the fast-talking Sherman-Palladino and it’s obvious the rapid fire conversations on the series are of her making. Bledel says slipping back into playing Rory was a breeze because Sherman-Palladino’s writing gives an actor all the information they need to play the role. \nA simple question to Sherman-Palladino about returning to the sets on the Warner Bros. lot ignites a verbal barrage. \n“ (expletive deleted), they changed our Stars Hollow. They got a deal on brown paint. I’ve never seen so much brown paint in my entire life. I’m like, ‘Who the (expletive deleted) doesn’t want some color in your town?’ There wasn’t any red. There wasn’t any yellow,” Sherman-Palladino says. “There wasn’t a posy. There was still the sidewalks that we put in. They’re cracked. So we had to go back in and zhoosh up Stars Hollow. We had to rebuild all the sets. I just remember the day that Scott (Patterson) walked into Luke’s Diner for the first time, because it wasn’t Luke’s Diner. It’s the ‘Pretty Little Liars’ are lying in there constantly now. So we had to get the lies out and put the diner back in.” \nBledel had a few conversations over the years away from Stars Hollow where Sherman-Palladino told here that she still loved the characters and wanted to explore stories with them. \nThe actor knows “The Gilmore Girls” is Sherman-Palladino’s vision. The only thing Bledel wanted to make sure happened in the new episodes was a reveal that all of the hard work Rory had gone through in those 154 episodes had paid off. \nBledel is coy when she talks about where her character’s love life has gone. She does say that all of her ex-boyfriends make an appearance. \nFor years, both Graham and Bledel have had people approach them lamenting the loss of the program. A major reason for the feeling of loss was the relationship the Gilmore mom and daughter had. \n“More people than I would have ever thought said it was the same relationship they have with their mother or daughter,” Graham says. “I would think, ‘Wow, you must be really cool.’ I think people see themselves in the characters more than they don’t. That probably has to do at least in part with us being here. Some of those daughters are now mothers and the cycle begins again.” \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life 12:01 a.m. Friday, Netflix ",

      "text": "Parker Posey (seen here in the TV series \"Frankenstein\") will play Dr. Smith in a \"Lost in Space\" remake for Netflix.\nPhoto by USA Cable Network Fans of the 1960s sci-fi TV series \" Lost in Space \" remember Dr. Zachary Smith as the easily-annoyed and sometimes sinister psychologist and environmental expert.\nViewers were often wary of the snide personality, lazy demeanor and general lack of ethics of Dr. Smith, who was played expertly by Jonathan Harris. He was the kind of character you love to hate. After all, it's his fault the Robinson family's spaceship flew off course and stranded them in the first place.\nOn Tuesday, entertainment site Deadline Hollywood announced that the role of Dr. Smith has been gender-flipped and will now be played by none other than indie-movie icon Parker Posey in a remake of the series set to air on Netflix in 2018.\nPosey has made a lifelong career playing quirky, eccentric and sometimes annoying characters in such films as \"Party Girl,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Best in Show,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"A Mighty Wind,\" \"The House of Yes\" and more recently, \"Mascots.\"\nPosey will join Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as parents Maureen and John Robinson -- and Maxwell Jenkins and Taylor Russell as their children, Will and Judy.\nThe original show ran for three seasons from 1965 to 1968 on CBS. (Editors note: CNET is owned by CBS.)\nThe \"Lost in Space\" reboot from Legendary and Netflix will run 10 one-hour episodes that will follow the adventures of the Robinson family as they are stranded light-years from home.\n ",

Photo by USA Cable Network \nFans of the 1960s sci-fi TV series \" Lost in Space \" remember Dr. Zachary Smith as the easily-annoyed and sometimes sinister psychologist and environmental expert. \nViewers were often wary of the snide personality, lazy demeanor and general lack of ethics of Dr. Smith, who was played expertly by Jonathan Harris. He was the kind of character you love to hate. After all, it's his fault the Robinson family's spaceship flew off course and stranded them in the first place. \nOn Tuesday, entertainment site Deadline Hollywood announced that the role of Dr. Smith has been gender-flipped and will now be played by none other than indie-movie icon Parker Posey in a remake of the series set to air on Netflix in 2018. Related stories Remake of '60s series 'Lost in Space' coming \nPosey has made a lifelong career playing quirky, eccentric and sometimes annoying characters in such films as \"Party Girl,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Best in Show,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"A Mighty Wind,\" \"The House of Yes\" and more recently, \"Mascots.\" \nPosey will join Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as parents Maureen and John Robinson -- and Maxwell Jenkins and Taylor Russell as their children, Will and Judy. \nThe original show ran for three seasons from 1965 to 1968 on CBS. (Editors note: CNET is owned by CBS.) \nThe \"Lost in Space\" reboot from Legendary and Netflix will run 10 one-hour episodes that will follow the adventures of the Robinson family as they are stranded light-years from home.

      "text": "\nNetflix rebooted \" Gilmore Girls \" and We. Are. Here. For. It. \nAre you? \n\" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ,\" premieres this Friday, November 25, on Netflix. The fast-talking, pop-culture referential mother-and-daughter are a lot to handle, and if you haven't sat through the show's seven seasons, you're going to need a primer before jumping into the new mini-series. \nIf you have seen the show, you either love it (and probably signed at least one petition to revive the series somewhere at some point), or you think the characters talk way too fast and that \"no one could possibly be that smart and witty\" or knowledgeable about movies . \nRegardless of whether or not you've seen an episode, you probably recognize the show. And in either case, this post is for those who didn't just spend the last week marathoning all seven seasons of love, life, heartache and coffee. (But if you want to do that before watching the new season, no one's stopping you.) \nIf you know nothing and want to know (nearly) everything, then this warning can be ignored. But if you're still working through the series, beware there are spoilers ahead. Must-know info \nLet's catch up real quick: The original \" Gilmore Girls \" (no, they're not sisters) aired on television from 2000-2007 and focused on a mother-daughter duo. Yes, they have the same name. Yes, the mom is young -- she gave birth when she was 16. The two begin the series living in a charmingly quirky small town in Connecticut named Stars Hollow (which is modeled after a real-life small town ). Both Lorelais are beautiful, blue-eyed voracious readers and movie buffs who enjoy verbose conversations over coffee (or any food, really) and peppered with smart pop-culture references. \nThere are a lot of characters so here's a quick rundown (sans boyfriends) (actually sans a lot of people but we had to cut the list somewhere). Lorelei Gilmore (played by Lauren Graham): A coffee-loving, fast-talking, street-smart, movie buff entrepreneur with a fondness for food and baseball-cap-and-plaid-wearing diner owners. Lorelei \"Rory\" Gilmore (Alexis Bledel): A coffee-loving, fast-talking, book-smart, movie buff with dreams of becoming a hard-hitting journalist; to avoid confusion, she goes by Rory. Richard and Emily Gilmore (Edward Hermann, Kelly Bishop): Lorelei's rich parents who have a sticky relationship with their \"hippie\" daughter, but think Rory is a perfect princess (usually). Luke Danes (Scott Patterson): Local disgruntled diner-owner who falls in love with Lorelei (the mom). Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe): Rory's somewhat-estranged father who appears whenever things are going just too well for the Gilmore ladies. April Nardini (Vanessa Marano): The daughter Luke never knew he had, she appears in Stars Hollow in season six and causes a whole mess of problems. Paris Geller (Liza Weil): Rory's high school nemesis turned college roommate-slash-best friend is quick with the insults . Lane Kim (Keiko Agena): Rory's kick-ass, audiophile best friend from Stars Hollow. Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy): A kooky chef and Lorelei's best friend. 35 Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' revival looks even better than we imagined Best of the rest \nNow that you've got the basics down, here are the top things you should know. Luke and Lorelai sitting in a tree... maybe? \nLuke is the curmudgeonly owner of the town's corner cafe/meeting place, and for the first four seasons he and Lorelai are the epitome of \"Will they or won't they?\" They've been on and off since season five but the series ended on a high note for the pair. Early trailers for the revival have hinted at trouble in paradise, and the news that Christopher will appear in the revival could throw a wrench in their relationship. \nEpisodes to watch: \" Written in the Stars\" (Season 5, episode 3): Their first official date proves just how long we've all been pining for this relationship. Also, \"New and Improved Lorelai\" (S6E1), which is where they truly start planning their future. \nHello, nurse! Photo by Netflix Team Dean, Team Jess, or Team Logan? \nRory really knows how to pick 'em, boyfriends that is. (We only covered her important boyfriends, because who counts Marty?) (Poor Marty.) (Marty was the worst! Epitome of \"friend-zone\" victim.) Everyone has a favorite and the best news is they're all back (with a vengeance?!?). No matter which ex you side with, we can all agree on one thing: #TeamRory will always endure. \nDean Forester, played by Jared Padalecki (\" Supernatural \"), is the tall, handsome, gentle giant with a heart of gold. He's the first boy Rory meets in the pilot episode and he quickly becomes her first boyfriend, first love and first for a lot of firsts. \nJess Mariano, played by \" This is Us \" star Milo Ventimiglia, is her second important boyfriend. Obviously we're biased because we're #TeamJess. He's the super-literate bad boy of the bunch, but the truth is Jess challenges Rory mentally, something Dean never could. Yes, he has communication issues and needs to grow up, but what 17-year-old with daddy issues doesn't? \n#TeamJess all the way. Photo by Netflix \nLogan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry of \" The Good Wife \"). Even his name screams #firstworldproblems. OK, so it's cute that he calls her Ace, but less cute when he cheats on Rory and lets his father crush her journalist dreams. He's smart and provokes Rory in great ways (\"You climb up here with me it's one less moment you haven't lived.\"), but he's quite difficult and unlike Jess he doesn't seem to want to grow up for Rory. In the series finale, he proposed to Rory but she eschews the engagement for life as an independent woman . \nEpisodes to watch: \nDean: \"Raincoats & Recipes\" (S4E22): Sure, it's kind of nice when he builds her a car. But this ep, where they have sex for the first time, is arguably one of the most important in the entire series. \nJess: Prepare for heartbreak. The one where we meet this mysterious bad boy (S2E5), or the one where he tells her he loves her and runs away (S4E13), or the one where he comes back to ask Rory to run away with him but she just stares him down and says no (S4E21). Or! The one where she sees him read from his novel (S6E18) or the one where he gets so sad that she's using him to make Logan mad and talks her back into being a grown up. Sigh. Jess is great and deserves better. OK, OK if I have to pick just one I say \"The Bracebridge Dinner\" (S2E10). No, wait! \"Loralei's Graduation Day\" (S2E21) when Rory ditches school (gasp!) to head to NYC and spend the day with Jess. Ugh, I don't know, all 30-something of them, I guess. \nLogan: \"Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant\" (S5E6): Rory really gets an introduction to Logan and the Life & Death Brigade. (And if you keep watching the next ep, we won't tell anyone.) \nRichard Gilmore's presence looms large even in the revival. Photo by Robert Voets/Netflix R.I.P. Richard Gilmore \nRichard Gilmore was the kind, wise, dapper AF father/grandfather you wish you had. Edward Hermann, the actor who played the Gilmore patriarch (Lorelai's father/Rory's grandfather) passed away in 2014 . Based on the trailer , the show is working this immeasurable loss into the narrative of the mini-series. His absence will be sorely felt , so make sure to keep a box of tissues handy. \nEpisodes to watch: \"Kill Me Now\" (S1E3): Our first outing with Richard and Rory proves just how important the patriarch's influence on the youngest Gilmore has been and will always be. And \"Wedding Bell Blues\" (S5E13), the series' 100th episode, for a glimpse at the inner workings of a devoted Gilmore family. Those last four words \nThe genius behind \"Gilmore Girls\", creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, was not involved during the last season (season 7), resulting in a lackluster finale that left many fans unsatisfied. Many years ago, Sherman-Palladino, who makes a triumphant return as showrunner in the Netflix revival, shared the fact that she knew the exact four words the series would've ended on, but she's kept them top-secret. Now that she's getting a second chance to end the series on her terms, some fans are frothing at the mouth to fast-forward to the end to hear what those last four words will be. \nEpisode to watch: The pilot episode. The first four(ish) words were \"Please, Luke. Please, please (please).\" We're hoping for something more along the lines of \"I love you Jess,\" (not just because he's the only boyfriend Rory *never* said it to) but whatever, Luke is a pretty good constant too. That's definitely not all \nBut it is probably more than most people make it through. (We're not obsessed, but growing up at almost the same speed as Rory doesn't make it easy to avoid.)

      "text": "5 hours ago Netflix Black Mirror had hits and misses in its double-size transition to Netflix for Season 3, but few stood out so much as the ‘80s-tinged, and oddly-optimistic “San Junipero.” Black Mirror isn’t the type for direct sequels, however connected its stories might be , but the episode’s director weighs in on another potential visit to “San Junipero.” \nYou’re warned of full spoilers for Black Mirror Season 3 from here on out, but suffice to say, “San Junipero” broke some new ground for the ominous technology parable, and not just in spotlighting an interracial same-sex couple (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis ). The extra-long outing also notably featured a rare happy ending for the series, allowing Kelly and Yorkie to literally ride off into their virtual reality sunset, scored by Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven Is a Place on Earth.” \nThat said, it’s exactly that tone of ending that makes director Owen Harris nervous about returning to that particular story, telling The Hollywood Reporter : \n[A sequel would] be nice wouldn’t it? It’d be fun to do a San Junipero sequel. But you have to remember that if there is a sequel, Charlie Brooker will be writing it. He’ll go all Black Mirror on it and he might not want to do two happy endings! \nThen again, there’s always the possibility that a return to “San Junipero” could shy away from Yorkie and Kelly altogether, and instead explore some of the darker aspects of that particular reality: \nBut whether we make one, I don’t know. I would love to. If you think about it, once you buy into San Junipero it’s this big world and we got a little taste of it when she goes off into the Quagmire, where she tries to find Kelly and bumps into Wes, and that’s very dark place. That was a sort of splinter of Black Mirror. So there is always a dark side lurking. There’s probably lots of ground you could cover by that or a parallel San Junipero, wherever that might be. \nHarris also clarified that he won’t return for Season 4 over schedule conflicts (thus far, only Jodie Foster has been confirmed to direct ), but with six more episodes on the way, is it worth returning to show either side of “San Junipero” again? Will the episode go down as one of the series’ only optimistic endings? ",

      "text": "Courtesy of Rai Fiction Dustin Hofmann and Richard Madden star in 'Medici: Masters of Florence.' The streaming giant adds multiple international territories for the Italian-set period drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Richard Madden, which will bow Dec. 9 in the U.S. \nNetflix is mad for the Medici. \nThe streaming giant has picked up new Italian-set drama Medici: Masters of Florence for multiple international territories following its successful bow in Italy. \nNetflix will carry Medici in the U.K., Ireland, Canada and India, with the series to premiere domestically Dec. 9 in the U.S. Medici will bow in the U.K. in the spring. Netflix did not comment on the timing of the rollout in other territories. \nThe eight-part drama, shot in English, stars Dustin Hoffman and Game of Thrones actor Richard Madden as members of the Medici family, the Italian bankers who turned a small family business into a financial empire and went on to fund the greatest artists of the Renaissance. \nProduced by Frank Spotnitz and Nicholas Meyer, Medici premiered in Italy earlier this year, where it smashed viewing records with an average of almost 7 million viewers and a 27 percent share for the series. The show also notched major numbers online, with more than 1.6 million views on RaiPlay, the VOD platform of Italian public broadcaster RAI. Produced by Lux Vide, Big Light Productions, Wild Bunch TV and RAI Fiction, Medici has already been greenlighted for a second season. \nWild Bunch TV, which is handling worldwide sales for the series, said it had closed for more than 30 territories and expects to announce further deals in the coming weeks.",

      "text": "By Liam Mathews, Hosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back.\nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017.\nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth .\nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"\nNetflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nDave Chappelle\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "\nNetflix rebooted \" Gilmore Girls \" and We. Are. Here. For. It. \nAre you? \n\" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ,\" premieres this Friday, November 25, on Netflix. The fast-talking, pop-culture referential mother-and-daughter are a lot to handle, and if you haven't sat through the show's seven seasons, you're going to need a primer before jumping into the new mini-series. \nIf you have seen the show, you either love it (and probably signed at least one petition to revive the series somewhere at some point), or you think the characters talk way too fast and that \"no one could possibly be that smart and witty\" or knowledgeable about movies . \nRegardless of whether or not you've seen an episode, you probably recognize the show. And in either case, this post is for those who didn't just spend the last week marathoning all seven seasons of love, life, heartache and coffee. (But if you want to do that before watching the new season, no one's stopping you.) \nIf you know nothing and want to know (nearly) everything, then this warning can be ignored. But if you're still working through the series, beware there are spoilers ahead. Must-know info \nLet's catch up real quick: The original \" Gilmore Girls \" (no, they're not sisters) aired on television from 2000-2007 and focused on a mother-daughter duo. Yes, they have the same name. Yes, the mom is young -- she gave birth when she was 16. The two begin the series living in a charmingly quirky small town in Connecticut named Stars Hollow (which is modeled after a real-life small town ). Both Lorelais are beautiful, blue-eyed voracious readers and movie buffs who enjoy verbose conversations over coffee (or any food, really) and peppered with smart pop-culture references. \nThere are a lot of characters so here's a quick rundown (sans boyfriends) (actually sans a lot of people but we had to cut the list somewhere). Lorelei Gilmore (played by Lauren Graham): A coffee-loving, fast-talking, street-smart, movie buff entrepreneur with a fondness for food and baseball-cap-and-plaid-wearing diner owners. Lorelei \"Rory\" Gilmore (Alexis Bledel): A coffee-loving, fast-talking, book-smart, movie buff with dreams of becoming a hard-hitting journalist; to avoid confusion, she goes by Rory. Richard and Emily Gilmore (Edward Hermann, Kelly Bishop): Lorelei's rich parents who have a sticky relationship with their \"hippie\" daughter, but think Rory is a perfect princess (usually). Luke Danes (Scott Patterson): Local disgruntled diner-owner who falls in love with Lorelei (the mom). Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe): Rory's somewhat-estranged father who appears whenever things are going just too well for the Gilmore ladies. April Nardini (Vanessa Marano): The daughter Luke never knew he had, she appears in Stars Hollow in season six and causes a whole mess of problems. Paris Geller (Liza Weil): Rory's high school nemesis turned college roommate-slash-best friend is quick with the insults . Lane Kim (Keiko Agena): Rory's kick-ass, audiophile best friend from Stars Hollow. Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy): A kooky chef and Lorelei's best friend. 35 Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' revival looks even better than we imagined Best of the rest \nNow that you've got the basics down, here are the top things you should know. Luke and Lorelai sitting in a tree... maybe? \nLuke is the curmudgeonly owner of the town's corner cafe/meeting place, and for the first four seasons he and Lorelai are the epitome of \"Will they or won't they?\" They've been on and off since season five but the series ended on a high note for the pair. Early trailers for the revival have hinted at trouble in paradise, and the news that Christopher will appear in the revival could throw a wrench in their relationship. \nEpisodes to watch: \" Written in the Stars\" (Season 5, episode 3): Their first official date proves just how long we've all been pining for this relationship. Also, \"New and Improved Lorelai\" (S6E1), which is where they truly start planning their future. \nHello, nurse! Photo by Netflix Team Dean, Team Jess, or Team Logan? \nRory really knows how to pick 'em, boyfriends that is. (We only covered her important boyfriends, because who counts Marty?) (Poor Marty.) (Marty was the worst! Epitome of \"friend-zone\" victim.) Everyone has a favorite and the best news is they're all back (with a vengeance?!?). No matter which ex you side with, we can all agree on one thing: #TeamRory will always endure. \nDean Forester, played by Jared Padalecki (\" Supernatural \"), is the tall, handsome, gentle giant with a heart of gold. He's the first boy Rory meets in the pilot episode and he quickly becomes her first boyfriend, first love and first for a lot of firsts. \nJess Mariano, played by \" This is Us \" star Milo Ventimiglia, is her second important boyfriend. Obviously we're biased because we're #TeamJess. He's the super-literate bad boy of the bunch, but the truth is Jess challenges Rory mentally, something Dean never could. Yes, he has communication issues and needs to grow up, but what 17-year-old with daddy issues doesn't? \n#TeamJess all the way. Photo by Netflix \nLogan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry of \" The Good Wife \"). Even his name screams #firstworldproblems. OK, so it's cute that he calls her Ace, but less cute when he cheats on Rory and lets his father crush her journalist dreams. He's smart and provokes Rory in great ways (\"You climb up here with me it's one less moment you haven't lived.\"), but he's quite difficult and unlike Jess he doesn't seem to want to grow up for Rory. In the series finale, he proposed to Rory but she eschews the engagement for life as an independent woman . \nEpisodes to watch: \nDean: \"Raincoats & Recipes\" (S4E22): Sure, it's kind of nice when he builds her a car. But this ep, where they have sex for the first time, is arguably one of the most important in the entire series. \nJess: Prepare for heartbreak. The one where we meet this mysterious bad boy (S2E5), or the one where he tells her he loves her and runs away (S4E13), or the one where he comes back to ask Rory to run away with him but she just stares him down and says no (S4E21). Or! The one where she sees him read from his novel (S6E18) or the one where he gets so sad that she's using him to make Logan mad and talks her back into being a grown up. Sigh. Jess is great and deserves better. OK, OK if I have to pick just one I say \"The Bracebridge Dinner\" (S2E10). No, wait! \"Loralei's Graduation Day\" (S2E21) when Rory ditches school (gasp!) to head to NYC and spend the day with Jess. Ugh, I don't know, all 30-something of them, I guess. \nLogan: \"Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant\" (S5E6): Rory really gets an introduction to Logan and the Life & Death Brigade. (And if you keep watching the next ep, we won't tell anyone.) \nRichard Gilmore's presence looms large even in the revival. Photo by Robert Voets/Netflix R.I.P. Richard Gilmore \nRichard Gilmore was the kind, wise, dapper AF father/grandfather you wish you had. Edward Hermann, the actor who played the Gilmore patriarch (Lorelai's father/Rory's grandfather) passed away in 2014 . Based on the trailer , the show is working this immeasurable loss into the narrative of the mini-series. His absence will be sorely felt , so make sure to keep a box of tissues handy. \nEpisodes to watch: \"Kill Me Now\" (S1E3): Our first outing with Richard and Rory proves just how important the patriarch's influence on the youngest Gilmore has been and will always be. And \"Wedding Bell Blues\" (S5E13), the series' 100th episode, for a glimpse at the inner workings of a devoted Gilmore family. Those last four words \nThe genius behind \"Gilmore Girls\", creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, was not involved during the last season (season 7), resulting in a lackluster finale that left many fans unsatisfied. Many years ago, Sherman-Palladino, who makes a triumphant return as showrunner in the Netflix revival, shared the fact that she knew the exact four words the series would've ended on, but she's kept them top-secret. Now that she's getting a second chance to end the series on her terms, some fans are frothing at the mouth to fast-forward to the end to hear what those last four words will be. \nEpisode to watch: The pilot episode. The first four(ish) words were \"Please, Luke. Please, please (please).\" We're hoping for something more along the lines of \"I love you Jess,\" (not just because he's the only boyfriend Rory *never* said it to) but whatever, Luke is a pretty good constant too. That's definitely not all \nBut it is probably more than most people make it through. (We're not obsessed, but growing up at almost the same speed as Rory doesn't make it easy to avoid.)

      "text": "\nParker Posey (seen here in the TV series \"Frankenstein\") will play Dr. Smith in a \"Lost in Space\" remake for Netflix. Photo by USA Cable Network \nFans of the 1960s sci-fi TV series \" Lost in Space \" remember Dr. Zachary Smith as the easily-annoyed and sometimes sinister psychologist and environmental expert. \nViewers were often wary of the snide personality, lazy demeanor and general lack of ethics of Dr. Smith, who was played expertly by Jonathan Harris. He was the kind of character you love to hate. After all, it's his fault the Robinson family's spaceship flew off course and stranded them in the first place. \nOn Tuesday, entertainment site Deadline Hollywood announced that the role of Dr. Smith has been gender-flipped and will now be played by none other than indie-movie icon Parker Posey in a remake of the series set to air on Netflix in 2018. Related stories Remake of '60s series 'Lost in Space' coming \nPosey has made a lifelong career playing quirky, eccentric and sometimes annoying characters in such films as \"Party Girl,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Best in Show,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"A Mighty Wind,\" \"The House of Yes\" and more recently, \"Mascots.\" \nPosey will join Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as parents Maureen and John Robinson -- and Maxwell Jenkins and Taylor Russell as their children, Will and Judy. \nThe original show ran for three seasons from 1965 to 1968 on CBS. (Editors note: CNET is owned by CBS.) \nThe \"Lost in Space\" reboot from Legendary and Netflix will run 10 one-hour episodes that will follow the adventures of the Robinson family as they are stranded light-years from home.

It’s completely improvised. \n“This is not a show for the faint of heart,” he says in the clip. “It’s not even a show for people who don’t have hearts.” It is a show for those who like Watts’ offbeat, surreal, musical brand of comedy — the kind he previously showcased as the original bandleader on both the Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast and TV show (he now plays that role on The Late Late Show With James Corden ). \nWatch the trailer, premiering exclusively here, above, and see its key art below.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nExpect to see an iconic villain to look very different when Netflix’s Lost in Space remake premieres in 2018. The role of Dr. Smith has been gender-swapped and an actress will take over the part played by Jonathan Harris in the 1965 sci-fi series of the same name. Parker Posey is set to fill the role, reports Deadline . \nLike the original, Netflix’s Lost in Space will center on the Robinson family as they find themselves stranded in space and dealing with dangerous threats, a new environment, and their own personal issues. As Dr. Smith, Posey will likely be up to no good. Harris’ version of the character was known for double-dealing, attempts at sabotage, and dropping harsh quips. \nMore: What’s new on Netflix and what’s leaving in December 2016 \nDr. Smith has appeared in multiple Lost in Space successors since CBS canceled the original. In fact, Harris voiced an animated version of the character in a 1970s cartoon spinoff that failed to take off and Gary Oldman later played the villain in the 1998 film adaptation of the series. This will be the first time we will see the character as a woman, so we’re excited to see what other surprises the Netflix series has in store. \nIt is still unclear how closely the Netflix version of Lost in Space will follow the original, but we expect Posey to bring her own spin to the character. The actress has proven versatile over the years and her long resume includes roles such as You’ve Got Mail , Superman Returns , and Café Society , among many others. She has big shoes to fill, though; Harris managed to turn what was supposed to be a temporary character into a long-standing one with his portrayal. \nPosey’s co-stars will include House of Cards star Molly Parker, Black Sails ‘ Toby Stephens, Taylor Russell, and Maxwell Jenkins as members of the Robinson family. The series is being written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, and is set to debut on Netflix with 10 one-hour episodes in 2018.

      "title": "Find the Best Thanksgiving Movies with Netflix's Secret Tool",
      "text": "Find the Best Thanksgiving Movies with Netflix's Secret Tool Binge on more than just turkey. Thanksgiving November 23, 2016 T hanksgiving is a time when people come together and binge. We eat a bunch of turkey, drink a lot of wine, and when the festivities are over, there’s a good chance we’ll settle in to stream more videos than anyone should ever watch. The hard part is figuring out which movies are worth playing in the background while the family argues politics and which are more likely to elicit complaints. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to search. The unofficial Netflix online global search tool (UNoGS) can separate the wheat from the chaff, by searching through the available libraries of every major country’s unique Netflix page. Different countries often have different offerings — most of the time, you’re restricted to viewing things in your country, but there are ways around the system. Besides helping you explore Deep Netflix and handle the post-election blues , UNoGS will also surface the best movies to binge once you’ve finished stuffing your gizzard. Here’s how. Don’t get too specific with your search. UNoGS allows you to search movies based on their title, description, and cast. Searching for “Thanksgiving” doesn’t return a whole lot, and the movies it does surface are only tangentially related to the celebration of gratitude. “Holiday,” on the other hand, has a bunch of results. Most of them are about Christmas, but let’s be honest, at this point Thanksgiving is basically just a marker for when it’s acceptable to kick off the winter holiday season after Halloween. Include the whole family with descriptive audio or subtitles. Thanksgiving brings many generations together, so it’s best not to forget someone’s limitations. With UNoGS you can choose to filter results based on their available languages or subtitles. These include descriptive audio, which is useful for the visually impaired, and many subtitles can let anyone with hearing problems know about any relevant sounds happening in the movie. Grandpa might not hear well, but that doesn’t mean he can’t #netflixandnap. Don’t forget about the children, either. Of course, older generations aren’t the only ones that congregate for the holidays. Many people will also bring their children, and unless you want to explain any “no-no words” or naughty bits to the next generation, you’re better off using the genre selection tool to highlight children’s movies. Bonus points for getting rid of all the unbearable videos by using the ratings tool to exclude anything that IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Netflix have deemed unworthy. Stick with the classics Thanksgiving is all about tradition. Chances are that in addition to the holiday staples — turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes — your family also makes the same dishes each year. Support the comfort of experiencing the same thing each year by making sure UNoGS only includes movies released in a certain year. There’s nothing wrong with Forrest Gump or The Princess Bride — why not include them in your marathon streaming session to appease everyone? Celebrate the golden age of television. Whether you’re hosting everyone or visiting someone else, you probably won’t have to worry about needing to leave in the middle of watching a movie. TV doesn’t have that guarantee: Episodes are short, but seasons are long, and binge-watching is all about getting through multiple episodes in a row. If everyone is okay with sitting for a while, use those same ratings tools and set the type to “series” to share the best television in history with your loved ones.",

      "text": "1 of 2 Sure, you've got mashed 'taters for Thanksgiving, and probably for a few days after. But if you want some of them French-fried 'taters a la Sling Blade on the Netflix, you're running out of time. MMMM- hmmm .\nThat movie, featuring a mentally challenged adult man fascinatingly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton , has an impressive 96 percent \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Your writer highly recommends it, but stream it before it vanishes at the end of November. Bonus: See if you can find the original short, called Some Call It a Sling Blade featuring Thornton with J.T. Walsh and Molly Ringwald , who did not appear in the full-length feature. Thornton wrote the short, and the full-length adapted screenplay that the short pitched to Hollywood. He took home an Oscar for his writing and a nomination for his acting.\nAs Karl might say: \"Aight, den\" ... on to a couple more highlights from December's comings and goings in Netflix's video treasure trove (full list below):\nLove Kevin Spacey ? You'll cringe with his character in American Beauty ( 88 percent Fresh ) but hurry because it's gone Dec. 1. If you're into extreme sports, athletes who take incredible risks and/or need a good cry before the end of the month, might we suggest McConkey , a critically acclaimed documentary on extreme sports pioneer Shane McConkey. Try to figure out who's on top in \"Top Gun\" before it runs out of fuel on Dec. 1.\nWith the family all home to argue about the election, you might consider The In-Laws a good distraction from the inevitable. Think again . This isn't the 1979 version starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin . There's never enough Falk and Arkin – ever. The remake does have Albert Brooks, so there's that. After Dec. 1, you won't have to worry about it any more – on Netflix, anyway.\nIf you just KNOW the government is hiding something really big via coded messages known only to the Illuminati, you have until Dec. 14 to find out – that's when The Da Vinci Code disappears like so much invisible continental congressional ink.\nDon't fret the losses ... a lot of cool new stuff is being added starting Dec. 1, including TOGA!!!! – National Lampoon's Animal House . And you'll be able to Netflix and Chill with Bob Ross to a greater degree than ever before ... featuring a collection of the big-haired painter's best, plus more than a few happy little trees starting bright and early Dec. 1.\nA slew of Netflix Originals are being added as well in December. Top of that list to watch with your Facebook-fake-news-sharing uncle is Barry , a biopic about Barack Obama that arrives on Dec. 16. Perhaps not. Possible alternatives from the newly arriving list include The Way of the Dragon , the awesome 1972 kung fu flick that features Bruce Lee denuding Chuck Norris ' chest of hair before dispatching him ... or perhaps Hitler: A Career ? Both arrive on Dec. 1. There's always America's biggest patriot beating up bad dudes in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War – arriving as a big present from Netflix on Christmas Day. Maybe just put your uncle on a filter and play it safe with My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic: Season 6 , arriving Dec. 20.\nHere's the full rundown:\nDeparting Netflix in December 2016 December 1 50 First Dates (2004) American Beauty (1999) Black Ops: Series 2 Camp Takota (2014) Carmen Jones (1954) Cats & Dogs (2001) Curious George: Swings Into Spring (2013) Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) Event Horizon (1997) Frequencies (2013) McConkey Medora (2013) Monkey Business (1952) Myth Hunters: Series 1 Myth Hunters: Series 2 Neil Young : Heart of Gold (2006) Paycheck (2003) Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (2008) River of No Return (1954) Sling Blade (1996) Thor: Hammer of the Gods (2009) The Great War Diary: Season 1 The In-Laws (2003) The Out-of-Towners (1999) Top Gun (1986) Valley of the Dolls (1967) World Trade Center (2006)\nDecember 2 Legends of the Knight (2013) The Red Baron (2008)\nDecember 3 The Best of Me (2014)\nDecember 5 Holes (2003)\nDecember 14 The Da Vinci Code (2006)\nDecember 15 High Profits: Season 1 World War II in Colour (2009)\nDecember 16 Beyond the Hills (2012)\nDecember 22 Dark Skies (2013)\nDecember 26 Just Friends (2005)\nDecember 27 Spy Kids (2001)\nDecember 31 Hercules: The Legendary Journeys: Seasons 1-6\nArriving on Netflix in December 2016 December 1 Always (1989) Angels in the Snow (2015) Beverly Hills Cop (1984) Beyond Bollywood (2014) Black Snake Moan (2007) Chill with Bob Ross: Collection (1990) Compulsion (1959) D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994) David Blaine : Street Magic (1997) Dreamland (2010) For the Love of Spock (2016) Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce: Season 2 (2015) Glory Daze: The Life and Time of Michael Alig (2016) Harry and the Hendersons (1987) Hitler: A Career (1977) Holiday Engagement (2011) Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989) House of Wax (2006) Hannibal (2001) Merli: Season 1 – NETFLIX ORIGINAL Merry Kissmas (2015) National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) Picture Perfect (1997) Rainbow Time (2016) Rodeo & Juliet (2015) Swept Under (2016) Switchback (1997) The Angry Birds Movie (2016) The Crucible (1996) The Little Rascals (1994) The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) The Rock (1996) The Spirit of Christmas (2015) The Way of the Dragon (1972) Toys (1992) Uncle Nick (2015) Waking Life (2001) We're Back!

      "text": "By Liam Mathews, Hosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back.\nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017.\nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth .\nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"\nNetflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nDave Chappelle\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Word came out yesterday that Parker Posey had joined Netflix’s upcoming remake of Lost in Space . When I heard that, I tried to picture her as Maureen Robinson, a role played before by June Lockhart and Mimi Rogers … and I just couldn’t see it.\nThen I looked deeper into the report and saw that she was cast as Dr. Smith, a role previously played by Jonathan Harris and Gary Oldman … and that seemed perfect casting to me. She has the ability to do an evil smile that I could totally see as Dr. Smith… they’ll have to change the first name of Zachary though, but it’s not like anyone called him that.\nThe initial report came from Deadline , stating that Irwin Allen’s 1965 cult scifi hit was aimed for a 2018 premiere. Already cast in the series are Toby Stephens (Black Sails), Molly Parker (House of Cards), Taylor Russell (Falling Skies), and Max Jenkins (Sense 8).",

      "title": "Captain America: Civil War Joins Fuller House Season 2 On Netflix In December",
      "text": "As we all know from following Bleeding Cool’s extensive ongoing coverage of Fuller Hous e, that show is returning to Netflix for a second season on December 9th. The sobering drama sees the cast of 80s sitcom Full House (minus the Olsen twins) return to their San Francisco home to try to raise children after D.J. Tanner’s firefighter husband is tragically killed, leaving D.J. a widower and her children fatherless. Naturally, hilarity ensues.\nBut as Netflix has released their lineup for December, some more big news – not as big as Fuller House Season 2, mind you, but big nonetheless – has also hit the web. It seems that Captain America: Civil War will debut on the streaming service on Christmas Day, celebrating the birth of the baby Jesus with big budget superhero vs. superhero action, just as the Lord intended!\nRecently, the Hollywood rumor mill has been churning out unsubstantiated rumors that Disney is interested in purchasing Netflix, and this kind of collaboration will probably encourage rumormongers in that regard.\nSome other movies and shows hitting Netflix in December that I personally enjoy include documentaries Honey I Shrunk The Kids and Harry and the Hendersons , My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Season 6, D2: The Mighty Ducks , National Lampoon’s Animal House , Beverly Hills Cop , and psychological thriller Chill With Bob Ross .

      "text": "Good Trip, Bad Trip: 10 Of The Best Drugs Movies On Netflix (December 2016) November 23, 2016 at 10:44AM By Karly Rayner @KarlyR Posted by Karly Rayner @KarlyR Moviepilot's celebrity savant. \nLove them or hate them, #drugs are the centerpoint of a big 'ole wrap of awesome movies that anyone from the hardline straight edger to the Snoop Dogg-level stoner can love... and loads of them are available at your streaming pleasure on Netflix. \nFrom the hard-hitting dramas that gut punch you with the tragedy of the drug trade to hilarious weed-fueled romps, #Netflix has a wide variety of movies that might just blow your perception of controlled substances right out the window. The Best Movies On Netflix You Must Watch The Netflix Hardhitters \nThe movies below are definitely not feel-good Sunday afternoon Netflix viewing and you'll probably want to refrain from rolling up a blunt — if it's legal in your state, of course — to take in these epics that showcase the dark side of drug use. \nCheck out the best drug movies on Netflix below. 10. Drugs Inc \nIf you've ever wondered just how drugs are so harmful to society, this documentary follows the entire supply chain to show just how many peoples' lives are disrupted before the illicit substance ends up in the hands of the user themselves. 9. Enter the Void \nWho Does It Star? Nathaniel Brown, Paz De La Huerta, Cyril Roy and Olly Alexander \nAfter an American drug dealer who has emigrated to Tokyo to ply his trade is betrayed by his so-called 'best friend' and killed in a police raid we are treated to an unsettling psychedelic voyage through the afterlife. \nWith some seriously unsettling camera angles (including one vagina's-eye view that you might want to avoid watching with your parents) and a tale of a lost soul seeking some sort of resurrection, Enter The Void is a nightmarish journey that echoes a bad trip. 8. Trainspotting \nWho Does It Star? Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle and Kelly Macdonald \nOne of the most iconic drug movies of all time, Trainspotting 's uncompromisingly dark look at heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland attempts to drag viewers into the filthy, sweaty bowels of addiction. \nEwan McGregor's character Mark Renton realizes that drugs are destroying his life and chooses to flee the bad influences and temptations that surround him by fleeing to London where he truly learns that you cannot run away from your problems. 7. City Of God \nWho Does It Star? Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino, Phellipe Haagensen, Douglas Silva and Jonathan Haagensen. \nHands down one of the most powerful movies about drugs I have ever watched, City Of God explores the all-consuming influence of the drug trade in the favelas of Rio De Janeiro on the people who live there, whether they want to be involved or not. \nFollowing two poor youngsters whose lives become intertwined despite choosing entirely different paths, City Of God holds no punches in the way it depicts how poverty fuels desperation in 1970s Brazil. \nFeaturing an amateur photographer named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) who documents the violence drugs have stirred up in his neighborhood and José 'Zé' Pequeno (Leandro Firmino), an ambitious drug dealer who will stop at nothing to drum up his fame, this movie really puts a personal spin on the term 'turf war.' 6. Zulu \nWho Does it Star? Orlando Bloom, Forest Whitaker, Conrad Kemp, Inge Beckmann and Tinarie van Wyk Loots \nFollowing the investigation of the savage murder of a young white woman in South Africa, the plot of Zulu becomes more and more sinister as officers investigate a dangerous new street drug named 'tik.' \nAlong with the murder, tik seems to be connected with the disappearance of black street children and as the dedicated officers dig into the sordid case, the drug turns out to be more evil than they could possible imagine. Funtime Netflix Romps 5. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back \nWho Does It Star? Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Ben Affleck, Jeff Anderson and Shannon Elizabeth. \nAfter being introduced as the enigmatic wall-leaning pot dealers in Kevin Smith's Clerks , Jay and Silent Bob finally get their turn in the spotlight in this hilarious stoner comedy about big corporations fucking over the little guy. \nJay and Silent Bob are initially thrilled to learn that a Bluntman and Chronic movie, based on the blazed antics of their comic book counterparts, is being made but the mood swiftly changes when they realize they will get none of the royalties. \nWith a well-justified \"if we can't have it, nobody can\" attitude the pair go about sabotaging the movie in any way they can think of with results that bring the lols all the way. 4. Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke \nWho Does It Star? Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, Strother Martin and Edie Adams. \nCheech & Chong's Up In Smoke might be the granddaddy of stoner comedy, but that doesn't mean it's too old to get on the Netflix bandwagon! \nThis buddy comedy sees Anthony Stoner (Tommy Chong) doing a runner from his uptight parents and hitting the road to do what he loves best, smoking da 'erb and playing drums. \nHe eventually meets his big stoner soulmate in the form of Pedro de Pacas (Cheech Martin) and the pair undergo trials including an arrest, deportation to Tijuana and smoking dog shit (yes, really) to compete in a rock band contest with an unforgettable song. 3. High Road \nWho Does It Star? James Pumphrey, Abby Elliott, Dylan O'Brien, Lizzy Caplan and Rich Fulcher. \nHigh Road follows a young dude who is spreading himself thin between his three passions. His band, his girlfriend and dealing weed. Sadly for Glen \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald (James Pumphrey), he is apparently not so great at the dealing part and he ends up attempting to escape arrest after a drug bust with unexpected consequences. \nAn improvised comedy, High Road was praised for its innovative style at the 2011 Newport Beach Film Festival and won an honor for Outstanding Achievement in Filmmaking. The rest is Netflix history! 2. Growing Op \nWho Does It Star? Steven Yaffee, Jon Cor, Wallace Langham, Rosanna Arquette and Katie Boland. A hilarious Canadian indie comedy that also happens to be available on American Netflix, Growing Op follows a home-schooled teen who meets the girl of his dreams... who also happens to be a wildly popular alumni of the local high school. \nThe son of marijuana-growing hippies with a penchant for hugs, rainbows and butterflies that's a little too much for him to handle, Quinn (Steven Yaffee) soon realizes that maybe his off-the-wall family might just be the sanest people in the suburbs... 1. Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas \nWho Does it Star: Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin and Gary Busey. \nConstantly oscillating between the nightmarish and the euphoric effects of a whole suitcase full of drugs, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is probably the first flick that pops into your head when you think \"drug movie.\" \nWith one of the performances of Johnny Depp's career and Hunter S. Thompson's helter-skelter storytelling keeping the breakneck pace, this surreal and jolting journey through casinos and opulent hotels is a cult classic everyone should see. \nIf you love Netflix, check out some of their finest serial killer movies , disturbing horrors or pure classics . \nWhat is your favorite drug-related movie on Netflix?

      "text": "9 Best Disney Movies On Netflix in December 2016: Keeping The Magic Alive November 23, 2016 at 09:03AM By Varia Fedko-Blake @varia Staff Writer at Moviepilot! [email protected] \nLogging onto #Netflix these days, viewers are spoiled for choice when it comes to picking a film to chill out to. Yet, while there is an abundance of romance features , horror flicks , documentaries and action movies to dip into, why not consider taking it easy with some of the best Disney choices on offer? \nFrom nostalgia-filled animation movies, to more recent House of Mouse offerings, here are the best Disney movies on Netflix right now: 9. Fantasia \nRelease: 1940 \nA timeless Disney classic, Fantasia continues to inspire and wow audiences of all ages to this day. Comprised of eight segments, all set to the music of a different composer, the movie remains one of the most stunning examples of the studio's early animations. \nFun Fact: Ever since 1940, when it was released, complaints from parents have flooded in over the 'Night on Bald Mountain' sequence, deemed far too terrifying for kids. 8. The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh \nRelease: 1977 \nStep back in time into your own childhood or introduce your kids to one of the most beloved characters of all time with The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. With Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger at his side, follow the bumbling bear as he battles with bees in his relentless pursuit of a trove of honey. Comical and heartwarming in every way. \nFun Fact: Tigger's trademark \"Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\" giggle was totally improvised by Paul Winchell, as well as his famous \"TTFN: Ta-Ta For Now!\" line. 7. Tarzan \nRelease: 1999 \nWith The Legend of Tarzan recently hitting cinemas , why not relive all the action surrounding our favorite gorilla-raised man with Disney animated adaptation of the 1999 blockbuster on Netflix. \nFun Fact: Pro skateboarder Tony Hawk was the inspiration for how Tarzan's body moved when he slid down trees and logs. 6. The Emperor's New Groove \nRelease: 2000 \nJohn Goodman, David Spade and Eartha Kitt star in the sassy Disney animation The Emperor's New Groove . Currently streaming on Netflix, it's a dramatic story about an arrogant Emperor who is transformed into a llama by devious diva Yzma. Yep, it's as hilarious as it sounds. \nFun Fact: Yzma wears a lot of purple, a color often associated with madness and royalty. 5. Lilo & Stitch \nRelease: 2002 \nWhen a young Hawaiian girl adopts a bizarre looking pet, nobody is prepared for the critter to actually be a extra-terrestrial fugitive. Very different to many of the animated offerings being churned out by the House of Mouse in recent decades, it's a whirlwind adventure that explores serious family issues, as well as what true friendship really means. \nFun Fact: Many of the aliens in the movie are actually inspired by other Disney characters such as Piglet and Tigger. 4. Robin Hood \nRelease: 1973 \nIt's no wonder that 1973's Robin Hood continues to be a favorite amongst many. The colorful feature is based on one of the most prominent heroes in English folklore, with Disney valiantly presenting a fox as our Nottingham heroic archer. He's joined by a slew of human-like animal sidekicks who create a story that continues to warm the heart over 30 years on. \nFun Fact: This was the first film in Disney's animated line-up that had anthropomorphic animals without any human characters at all. 3. Brother Bear \nRelease: 2003 \nJoaquin Phoenix stars in Disney's Brother Bear , a 2003 release that is now available on Netflix. The focus is on a little Inuit boy called Kenai, who embarks on a journey to unleash revenge on a bear for killing his brother. Tracking it down, he ruthlessly kills it, only to anger the Spirits and be transformed into one himself as punishment. \nFun Fact: Many of the characters in the movie are actually named after real places in Alaska, where the story is set. For example, Kenai is named after the Kenai Peninsula. 2. High School Musical \nRelease: 2006 \nA TV movie that allowed a relatively unknown Zac Efron to break free into the dizzying heights of Hollywood stardom, High School Musical continues to be one of the most successful productions to come from the Disney Channel. So, before HSM 4 signals a start of something new , why not kick back on Netflix and relive what all the fuss was about back in 2006? \nFun Fact: Zac Efron's singing voice was actually that of Drew Seeley, who tested for the role of Troy. Seeley sang the entirety of \"Get'cha Head in the Game\" and the reprise of \"What I've Been Looking For.\" Efron only sings the first four lines of \"Start of Something New\" and the first sentence of \"Breaking Free.\" Why? All because Efron's voice was far too low for that of a tenor and he struggled to match with the other vocals. 1. Chicken Little \nRelease: 2005 \nChicken Little was Disney's first venture into non-Pixar CGI and is an adorable little story suitable for grade-schoolers and all ages upwards. Although the plotline is slightly ridiculous (essentially about a piece of sky falling on a young chicken!), and the animation will undoubtedly provide a barrel of laughs. \nFun Fact: Chicken Little was originally meant to be a girl. \nWhich Disney movie will you be watching on Netflix next?

As Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) beefs up its Marvel content, Amazon.com is using the debut of The Grand Tour , an unofficial spinoff of the BBC hit Top Gear to put Prime streaming in 200 territories, wrote host Jeremy Clarkson in a tweet. \nEarlier this year, Netflix announced an expansion into 130 new countries around the world, which put the company almost everywhere except China. In funding a big footprint for The Grand Tour , Amazon is effectively challenging Netflix in every territory that matters. Should investors be concerned? Yes and no. \nLet's start with potential problems. International growth is important to Netflix, and not just because it reduces the per-unit cost of expensive originals such as House of Cards and The Crown . The company is also investing in developing local-language originals in a variety of countries. Current series in production include the Brazilian thriller 3% , which debuts this week. French political drama Marseille reached viewers in May and has since been renewed, while Japanese drama Hibana (Spark) launched in June. \nNetflix hasn't yet ordered a second season of Hibana , but the company's massive commitment to original content increases the odds in its favor. Nevertheless, investing in foreign-language originals isn't cheap, and increasing competition won't make it easier to recoup costs. \nSo what's the good news? International growth has been strong. Total streaming revenue from overseas territories jumped 65% in the third quarter. Paid memberships in those countries rose 54% over the same period while monthly revenue per paid member rose from $7.20 to $7.73 in foreign markets, an important wrinkle. \nNetflix's international growth isn't just the byproduct of being in more places with global content. It's also a byproduct of having tailored content available for audiences who are willing to pay up to see it. Amazon's expanding presence could upset that dynamic -- but the only way to know will be to keep a close eye on those metrics. \n  Netflix   Netflix   \nTim Beyers owns shares of Netflix.

      "title": "Netflix's Lost In Space Reboot Just Cast Dr. Smith, And It's An Unexpected Choice",
      "text": "By Nick Venable 20 minutes ago \nThe streaming world is going to hard hard on some science fiction in the coming years, with the biggest of the genre projects coming next year in CBS All Access' Star Trek: Discovery . The year after that, fans of the classic '60s series Lost in Space will get to see a modernized reboot coming to Netflix . Currently in the pre-production stage, Lost in Space is keeping the casting train rolling, and now we know the quasi-villainous and problem-causing Dr. Smith will get a gender switch for new audiences, as actress Parker Posey has been cast. \nUnfortunately, learning that Parker Posey will don futuristic duds for Netflix's Lost in Space doesn't give us much context on how close to Jonathan Harris' original Zachary Smith she will get, as Deadline had no other information to offer. In the initial series, created by Irwin Allen, the Robinson family is chosen to travel to a distant planet for colonization efforts, and Dr. Smith was a double agent who sabotaged their trip, getting trapped on board in the process. He got less evil as seasons passed, though he was still a nuisance throughout. \nWhile I'll acknowledge that some people are always going to complain whenever a change like a gender swap is made, only good things can come from getting Parker Posey into the Lost in Space remake. She's superb and unique in pretty much everything she's done, whether it's a hilarious comedy or a gripping dramatic thriller. She can play the hardcore dominator or the distressed damsel. Having that kind of range should definitely help when it comes to playing Dr. Smith, whose new iteration will likely be just such a genre-crossing half-foe. \nAudiences are getting as much of Parker Posey's work as ever, too, as the actress has been really busy in the past couple of years. On the small screen, she's appeared on episodes of Portlandia and Drunk History , and was a regular in the third season of the period drama Granite Flats . On the feature side of things, Posey was already a familiar face on Netflix with frequent collaborator Christopher Guest's latest comedy Mascots , as well as Woody Allen's latest film, Café Society . She'll later be seen in the star-studded heist comedy The Brits are Coming . \nRe-created by Matt Sazama and Buck Sharpless, of Dracula Untold and Gods of Egypt fame, this new Lost in Space will hopefully keep the casting going strong in the near future. At this point, four of the Robinson family members have been cast, with Black Sails ' Toby Stephens as John, House of Cards ' Molly Parker as Maureen, Falling Skies ' Taylor Russell as Judy and Sense8 's Maxwell Jenkins as Will. As in \"Danger, Will Robinson,\" which will surely be the catchphrase all the kids will be saying in a few years. \nWe are still a long way away from getting to see Lost in Space , which will see its 10-episode first season hit Netflix at some point in 2018. Lots of TV is coming before then, though, and you can find it all with our fall premiere schedule and our midseason premiere schedule .  ",

      "text": "Listen \nThe attorney for Steven Avery , whose case was featured in the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer , announced Wednesday a judge will allow scientific testing to proceed in his case. \nAvery’s attorney, Kathleen Zellner said on Twitter, “Our judge just signed stipulation and order for the scientific testing to proceed in Steven Avery case.” \nZellner also noted the attorney general was working with them to allow the testing. Our judge just signed stipulation and order for the scientific testing to proceed in Steven Avery case. AG worked w/us. #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 23, 2016 \nA few minutes later, she issued another tweet quoting the subject of the Making a Murderer documentary as saying, “it will be a Happy Thanksgiving after all.” Judge just entered order for scientific testing to proceed. Steven Avery says \"it will be a Happy Thanksgiving after all.\" #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 23, 2016 \nLast Friday, a federal appeals court in Chicago blocked the release of Brendan Dassey , Avery’s nephew, who was convicted of murder in 2007 for the killing of Teresa Halbach “pending the outcome of the appeal,” but the court did not explain its reasoning. \nA U.S. magistrate judge in August ruled the guilty verdict returned by a trial jury in 2007 against Dassey, now 27, was based on a coerced confession he gave as a 16-year-old with a learning disability. \nDassey and Avery were convicted in separate trials of killing Halbach, a freelance photographer, at Avery’s home and scrap yard in 2005. Her charred remains were found in an incineration barrel and a burn pit on Avery’s property, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Milwaukee. \nWATCH: Appeals court blocks ‘Making a Murderer’ subject Brendan Dassey’s release from prison \nDassey, then 17, was found guilty of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse. Avery was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon. Both were sentenced to life in prison. \nThe case was the subject of the 10-part documentary Making a Murderer , which questioned the handling of the investigation and the motives of Manitowoc County law enforcement officials. \nThe documentary, which first went into production 10 years ago, recounted how Avery was convicted of an earlier, unrelated rape and sent to prison in 1985, serving 18 years before DNA evidence exonerated him and he was released. \nAvery filed a $36 million federal lawsuit against the county, its former sheriff and district attorney in 2004. A year later, he and Dassey were accused of killing Halbach. \nThe Emmy-nominated documentary suggested that authorities planted evidence against both defendants, a claim rejected by the current sheriff. \nWith files from Reuters ",

      "text": "lost in space reboot parker posey flickr More Arnold Gatilao/Flickr\nExpect to see an iconic villain to look very different when Netflix’s Lost in Space remake premieres in 2018. The role of Dr. Smith has been gender-swapped and an actress will take over the part played by Jonathan Harris in the 1965 sci-fi series of the same name. Parker Posey is set to fill the role, reports Deadline .\nLike the original, Netflix’s Lost in Space will center on the Robinson family as they find themselves stranded in space and dealing with dangerous threats, a new environment, and their own personal issues. As Dr. Smith, Posey will likely be up to no good. Harris’ version of the character was known for double-dealing, attempts at sabotage, and dropping harsh quips.\nMore: What’s new on Netflix and what’s leaving in December 2016\nDr. Smith has appeared in multiple Lost in Space successors since CBS canceled the original. In fact, Harris voiced an animated version of the character in a 1970s cartoon spinoff that failed to take off and Gary Oldman later played the villain in the 1998 film adaptation of the series. This will be the first time we will see the character as a woman, so we’re excited to see what other surprises the Netflix series has in store.\nIt is still unclear how closely the Netflix version of Lost in Space will follow the original, but we expect Posey to bring her own spin to the character. The actress has proven versatile over the years and her long resume includes roles such as You’ve Got Mail , Superman Returns , and Café Society , among many others. She has big shoes to fill, though; Harris managed to turn what was supposed to be a temporary character into a long-standing one with his portrayal.\nPosey’s co-stars will include House of Cards star Molly Parker, Black Sails ‘ Toby Stephens, Taylor Russell, and Maxwell Jenkins as members of the Robinson family. The series is being written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, and is set to debut on Netflix with 10 one-hour episodes in 2018.\nCreative differences prompt another director to leave 'The Flash' movie 'Mass Effect: Andromeda' creative director spills the beans on the game's family ties Dwayne Johnson's 'Jumanji' sequel adds 'Doctor Who' actress Karen Gillan",

      "text": "Local Trekkie fans behold as Star Trek: Discovery is on its way to your Netflix screens soon, and there is already a captain to possibly fly the starship – Tan Sri Michelle Yeoh. This will be the first Star Trek series since 2005, when Star Trek Enterprise ended its run. Nicholas Meyer, the Discovery consulting producer who previously directed Star Trek II and Star Trek VI , confirmed Yeoh's involvement in a ComingSoon interview. \"I know Michelle Yeoh is in it,\" he revealed. While showrunner turned executive producer Bryan Fuller previously confirmed that the series will focus on a female lieutenant commander, a part from promising to show diversity – with at least one gay character, and both familiar and new alien races. According to Deadline , sources close to the production says that Yeoh has been casted as Captain Han Bo and her starfleet is the Shenzhou – not the Discovery − but is set to play a big role in Discovery‘s first season. Variety sources on the other hand say she is “absolutely not the lead, and that role is still open”. “Our insiders say while casting has been underway, CBS has been looking for a younger, African-American or Latina actress. The network is not seeking a huge star and would prefer a fresh face for the part.” Previous speculation pointed towards Angela Basset and Rosario Dawson, both of whom Fuller had previously praised. CBS that will premiere the first episode in May 2017 has however declined to comment on any casting inquiries. When asked about her stint on the show during the Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) yesterday, the Ipoh-born simply replied: \"Well, I think CBS will make their own announcement. ... But we all grew up with the 'Star Trek' generation, so of course I'm a big fan.\" The 54-year-old actress is best known for her roles in Tomorrow Never Dies , Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Memoirs of a Geisha . -mD",

November 23, 2016 @ 7:34 PM By Ryan Gajewski \nGet ready to follow where they lead, just like the good ol' days! The highly anticipated Gilmore Girls revival is about to launch on Netflix, and the show's fans are basically counting down the minutes until Rory Gilmore ( Alexis Bledel ), Lorelai Gilmore ( Lauren Graham ) and the rest of the Stars Hollow gang return for new episodes. PHOTOS: Gilmore Girls Cast: Then and Now \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Lif e consists of four 90-minute episodes, each focused on a different season of the year. All four installments are available for streaming on Netflix Friday, November 25, at 12:01 a.m. PT. This means you now have a valid reason to skip the crowded malls on Black Friday. \nOther notable returnees include Scott Patterson (Luke), Liza Weil (Paris), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Melissa McCarthy (Sookie), Keiko Agena (Lane), Sean Gunn (Kirk), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), David Sutcliffe (Christopher) and Danny Strong (Doyle). Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nBledel, 35, previously told Us Weekly that viewers will find out where Rory stands with each of her three main paramours from the beloved series that signed off in May 2007 after seven seasons. Indeed, much debate continues to percolate (coffee pun!) among fans regarding whether she is best matched with hometown hunk Dean Forester ( Jared Padalecki ), erudite bad boy Jess Mariano ( Milo Ventimiglia ) or Yale alum Logan Huntzberger ( Matt Czuchry ). All three guys will appear in the update, although one might not get quite as much screen time as the other two. You May Also Like",

The production is still on Broadway, but much of the original cast members have left the show. (Charles Sykes, Invision) \nIt’s kind of remarkable that in the wake of Donald Trump’s upset presidential victory, the thing people have found most upsetting is how the vice president-elect was treated at a performance of the Broadway smash “Hamilton.” Depending on who you talk to, this was either the single greatest moment of speaking truth to power ever witnessed, or it was a travesty of monumental proportions that must be avenged via presidential Twitter. Both positions seem pretty extreme to me, so I thought it appropriate to stake out some middle ground here. \nFrom my perspective, this really wasn’t that big a deal one way or the other. \nIn the first place, the speech in question wasn’t particularly nasty. When actor Brandon Victor Dixon began to speak to Mike Pence, a handful of boos were heard in the crowd. \n“There’s nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen,” he said. “There’s nothing to boo here. We’re all here sharing a story of love.” \nApparently, there had been a smattering of boos and a number of cheers when Pence took his seat before the show began, so the fact that Dixon would go out of his way to silence post-show booing shows that the cast message was intended to be both delivered and received respectfully. \nAs for the content of the message, it was short and sweet. The whole thing took just over a minute. It contained one pointed sentence, where Dixon described the “Hamilton” cast as “alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.” But everything before that was kind, and everything that followed was hopeful that Pence would “uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.” That’s a welcome message of unity to a deeply divided nation. \nFor his part, Pence was entirely appropriate in his response. He later praised the performance, welcomed the message and insisted that he wasn’t at all offended, before or after the show. \n“You know, when we arrived, we heard — we heard a few boos. We heard some cheers,” Pence told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday . “And I nudged my kids and reminded them that's what freedom sounds like.” \nWell played, Mr. Vice President-elect. Well played. \nIt was President-elect Donald Trump who tweeted this molehill into a mountain. Trump insisted that his vice presidential choice had been “harassed” and that the cast had been “very rude” and that the production was “very overrated.” His indignation was well out of proportion to the actual offense, which led to a number of commenters panicking that this represented some kind of horrible threat against freedom of speech and the rights of artists to express themselves. \nBut that’s nonsense, too. It’s important to remember that the First Amendment also applies to the president-elect. We’re not used to Twitter-happy presidents with thin skins, but if this is the worst thing Trump does, then we’re going to be fine. Sure, the president-elect’s tweets were tacky, but, in fairness, so was the lecturing of an audience member. One can debate which one was in poorer taste, but neither instance represents any threat to freedom, democracy or legitimate theater. \nPerhaps the best thing from the fallout of this silliness is the burgeoning #BoycottHamilton movement. I really hope that catches on, as it may mean I can get my hands on tickets before Trump’s term is out. close <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> <figure> <img src=\"http://cdn2.newsok.biz/cache/r960-a49eb8e2ed50328e6ab69898c82e2ee1.jpg\" alt=\"Photo - In this Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, file photo, Leslie Odom Jr., left, Phillipa Soo, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Christopher Jackson appear at the curtain call following the opening night performance of \"Hamilton\" at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York.

How to know if your child is ready for that first phone Amy Iverson, Deseret News   9:45   × Cell phones will be at the top of many kids' wish lists for Christmas. Parents need to consider some important traits in their children to decide if they're ready for the mobile world. (AdobeStock) \nIf you have a tween in your home, no doubt they are begging for a phone for Christmas. Or maybe you have been able to hold off and have an actual teenager under your roof without a mobile device right now. I have no doubt a phone is on the top of their wish list, too. \nYou’re not even immune from this if your children are all still in elementary school. In its 2016 Digital Trends Study , research firm Influence Central figured out that age 10 is the average age a child now gets that first phone. Just for comparison, the most popular Christmas gift when I was 10 was a Cabbage Patch Kid for less than $30. \nThere are definitely positives to parents getting their child a cellphone. Immediate communication at any time, anywhere can set minds at ease. And tracking capabilities on most devices make it much easier for moms and dads to keep tabs on their teens. \nMany children could see a big advantage in learning skills by having access to educational apps and websites. Other kids may benefit from the social aspect a phone provides. These days, the only way teenagers know what’s happening in their friend world is via texting and social media. Picking up the phone and actually calling one of their buddies is as foreign to today’s teens as a cassette tape. \nBy now, parents should also be well aware of the many negatives that could come with kids having access to the world at their fingertips. There is no question that gadgets can be a distraction from important things like chores and homework. Plus, there is always the possibility that a smart phone could expose children to sexting, online bullying and sexual predators. \nSo how can you know if your child is ready for a device that likely costs several hundred dollars and puts the world — the good and the bad — in his or her back pocket? There is no magical age when a kid will have the level of responsibility or maturity needed for phone ownership. As in most parenting issues, moms and dads need to take each child’s cell hone readiness on a case-by-case basis. But there is an essential list of considerations for anyone thinking about helping their child take this big digital step. \nIndependence — The main factor in deciding when I would buy phones for my oldest children was whether or not they were ever somewhere without me or my husband? And for my twins, their schedules basically took them from home, to school and back home when we would then run them around to afternoon activities. It wasn’t until they were about 12 years old that they would stay after school for extracurriculars. At that point, they needed a way to contact me for various reasons, but mostly to let me know when practice was finished so I could pick them up. After taking into consideration the list that follows, we bought the twins iPhones when they were about 12-and-a-half. My 10-year old does not yet have a cell phone. \nResponsibility — Think about how well your children take care of their current possessions. Do they consistently lose things like backpacks and retainers? Are they able to keep track of their favorite sweatshirt? If the answer is no to these questions, your child may not be ready to be responsible for a $500 phone. But, you could start by purchasing a less expensive dumb phone option as an introduction to mobile life. \nSelf-control — Take note of whether your children are able to put aside current distractions to get things done. Do they go to sleep when it’s bedtime, or stay up reading until late into the night? Do they get their homework done on time, or get distracted by the television? These questions are a good indicator of how they might act with a cell phone — the ultimate distraction. \nRespect — Notice whether your children are paying attention to teachers at school or church. Does your child follow rules like \"no gum in class\"? If not, you may want to consider waiting a while. Kids need to be able to follow simple rules before they have to face the biggest temptation ever, to stare at a phone instead of paying attention to people and things that should be more important. \nOf course, parents can always decide that while their children aren’t perfect in any of these considerations, that the kid is progressing and therefore is ready for a chance. And moms and dads need to remember they can always buy the phone, but then make a contract with their kids about usage, and set restrictions to help keep them safe.

      "text": "Gaming Netflix's 4K restrictions could affect PS4 Pro owners Netflix's 4K restrictions on PC users could eventually affect PS4 Pro users, possibly putting 4K streaming at a slow drip-feed Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: A A \nYesterday we reported on Netflix's audacious requirements for streaming 4K video on PC : 4K streaming will be exclusive to PCs rocking a new Intel Kaby Lake i7 CPU and are only available on Microsoft's Edge browser. These restrictions will likely have an effect on gamers who own Sony's new PS4 Pro, and here's how. \nSo why did Netflix create these restrictions? It's rather simple: bandwidth. 4K video streaming takes a lot of bandwidth, and by requiring Kaby Lake CPUs for 4K streaming, the company significantly reduced the bandwidth by making 4K streaming less accessible to the mainstream market. But what about PS4 Pro owners? \nSony's new PlayStation 4 Pro is all about 4K: it rocks a new highly-customized Polaris GPU built specifically for gaming on 4K HDR TVs. But it's missing something very important: a 4K UHD Blu-ray player. Sony's PS4 Pro doesn't have a 4K Blu-ray player, and the company is instead forcing gamers to stream 4K content online via its own overpriced ULTRA 4K service , and signing deals with partners like Netflix. Even though its missing a huge important piece, the PS4 Pro has sold quite well so far , indicating the system will soon hit mainstream success. \n\"Our feeling is that while physical media continues to be a big part of the games business, we see a trend on video towards streaming. Certainly with our user base, it's the second biggest use case for people's time on the system so we place more emphasis on that area,\" Sony Interactive Entertainment President Andrew House told The Guardian . \nRead Also: Here's why Sony nixed PS4 Pro's 4K Blu-ray player \nBut wait a minute...Netflix has given a clear signal that it's not ready for total mainstream users to stream 4K video, at least not on most of today's PCs and laptops. \nDespite these policies against everyday PC users, 4K UHD video streaming is currently available on the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S. \nSo this begs to question what kind of precedence Netflix will continue to give to PlayStation 4 Pro owners now and into the future, and whether or not Sony's deal with Netflix for its 4K content will see the company play favorites with the console versus everyday mainstream users. We could even see the Xbox One S eventually being put on the back burner along with most PC and laptop owners. \nOr maybe Netflix is testing the waters using Xbox One S and PlayStation 4 Pro consoles? If you're wanting to stream 4K UHD Netflix content, your most likely solution is to pick up one of these systems for a combined experience as they double as games systems, or just pick up a Roku if your net's strong enough. \nBear in mind you'll need at least a 25megabit connection for smooth playback, and to pay the $11.99 UHD monthly plan. \nIt'll be interesting to see how this plays out, and if Netflix starts throttling bandwidth on certain consoles if too many consumers buy them for 4K streaming.

Deadline is reporting that none other than Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski from Superman Returns and Marlene Strange from Boston Legal ) has been tapped to step into the robot-antagonizing, work-avoiding, and very central character’s shoes (played in the original series by Jonathan Harris ).\nBeing helmed by Charmed’s Zack Estrin as showrunner would bode well for the right tone for the series, but at the same time the story will be by the writing duo of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless , who have created such lukewarm fare as The Last Witch Hunter and Gods of Egypt .\nThe rest of the castaways – notably the Robinson family have already been announced as Toby Stephens as John Robinson, Molly Parker as Maureen Robinson, Taylor Russell as Judy Robinson, and Maxwell Jenkins as Will Robinson.",

      "text": "By Taylor Ferber 5 hours ago \nSaying goodbye to things on Netflix is just like saying goodbye to your high school graduating class. You have every intention of seeing these people again in the future, but it's like, will you actually? That may be pretty unlikely. Thus, it's a sad parting of ways. Cozying up to your TV — whether it be Netflix and chill with a significant other or with a box of pizza (how I like to do it) — is the only worthwhile winter activity in my book. And from the outbreak of creepy clowns to the presidential election, everyone could use a breather from the chaos of 2016 before ringing in the new year. This year has been hard enough, don't let Netflix opportunities pass you by . \nWith the incoming of amazing streaming options (ahem, Gilmore Girls revival), there are also selections leaving the network in December 2016 . Some are classics, others are fluffy comedies, and there's even some tearjerkers to really set the mood for the entire month ahead. So grab as many snacks as possible and get ready to Netflix harder than you ever have before, in order to catch these shows and movies before they leave the streaming service next month. Leaving Dec. 1 50 First Dates (2004) [Embed] \nThis sweet story takes place in the beautiful land of Hawaii, and if it doesn't have what it takes to warm your cold winter heart, I don't know what does. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore rekindle their epic on-screen chemistry in a comedy that will make you laugh and cry every damn time. American Beauty (1999) [Embed] \nThis '90s cult classic about a bored middle-aged man, who becomes obsessed with his daughter's teenage friend, is a must-see. Thank god for House of Cards , or I'd be having Kevin Spacey withdrawals. Black Ops: Series 2 (2014) [Embed] \nThis gripping TV mini-series reenacts operations which were held by special forces, with the use of real-life footage and people who were part of them. It gets intense, so I'd recommend a drink or two with this one. Camp Takota (2014) [Embed] \nGrace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart make their way to big screen in a story about summer camp. Because who doesn't love a good camp story? When Elise (Helbig) ditches the real world to return to camp as a counselor, she finds herself bonding with estranged friends to save the camp's future. Perfect to give you the summer dose you need. Carmen Jones (1954) [Embed] \nThis '54 flick is a modern version of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen with an African-American cast. In the musical-turned-film, a solider (Harry Belafonte) falls for the charming Carmen Jones (Dorothy Dandridge) unbeknownst to him that their love would lead him to quite the adventure and crime of passion. Cats & Dogs (2001) [Embed] \nThis light-hearted flick depicts the ongoing suburbia battle between house pets: cats and dogs. The animals talk as they fight for the top and it never gets old. Who doesn't want to watch an hour and 25 minutes of cute puppies and cats speaking human talk behind their backs? I mean, c'mon. Curious George: Swings Into Spring (2013) [Embed] \nIn this adorable animation, Curious George is on the mission to cheer up his homesick friend Hundley. His remedy is a dosage of spring, which most people could use right now. It's a good choice if you're spending holiday time with young siblings or family members. Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood (1996) [Embed] \nAn early display of Shawn and Marlon Wayans' hilarious antics, Don't Be a Menace tells the story of Ashtray (Shawn Wayans), who's forced to live with him family in a bad LA neighborhood. If you feel like kicking it old school with some laughs, this one is for you. Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) [Embed] \nCate Blanchett shines in her role as Queen Elizabeth I in this historical drama. Between the layered plot, intricate costumes, set details, and Blanchett's line delivery, this is one worth catching. Event Horizon (1997) [Embed] \nSam Neill and Laurence Fishburne star in this chilling sci-fi flick about a spacecraft team which has to revisit a ship that reappears after it had gone missing. But the ship isn't the same upon its return, and needless to say, some terrifying happenings go down. Frequencies (2013) [Embed] \nThis independent British film introduces an idea of what happens when love meets science. Super smart, interesting, and endearing at the same time, check this out for a romance unlike the majority of the others out there. McConkey (2013) [Embed] \nThis documentary follows extreme skier Shane McConkey in an uplifting story from his childhood to his career as a professional freeskier. The close-up shots of his tricks on the mountains are enough to give you an adrenaline rush like you're there. Peak winter vibes. (See what I did there?) Medora (2013) [Embed] \nIn this inspiring sports documentary, an Indiana high school basketball team becomes a symbol of hope when its members refuse to let their reputation fall along with the town. Monkey Business (1952) [Embed] \nOld Hollywood darlings Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe star in this comedy about a chemist's (Grant) anti-aging formula gone wrong when a loose chimpanzee gets it hands on it. The effects are so reverse-aging, causing Grant's character to act like a teenager and make shameless passes at the secretary (Monroe). Oh, the good ol' days. Myth Hunters: Series 1 & 2 (2012-2013) [Embed] \nThis fascinating docu-series shows modern attempts at solving mind-boggling mysteries of history. Some include stories surrounding figures and objects including Hitler, the Holy Grail, King Solomon, and pirate treasure. Neil Young: Heart of Gold (2006) [Embed] \nNeil Young fans, rejoice. This 2006 documentary, or \"rockumentary,\" is shot over two nights during the artist's performance at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. The film includes interviews with Young and his band, first-time performances of songs, and acoustic renditions of the classics. Paycheck (2003) [Embed] \nBen Affleck stars in this sci-fi thriller as an engineer who unknowingly takes on a fatal mission, one he assumed would be a walk in the park, but leaves him being chased by government agencies. Uma Thurman and Aaron Eckhart also star in this gripping mystery. Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (2008) [Embed] \nIf you're spending holiday time with little ones or just feel like being a kid, throw this big-hearted flick on and get to some of the adult options later. Think Pirates of the Caribbean , just no booze, no Johnny Depp, and certainly no epic sword fights. River Of No Return (1954) [Embed] \nBefore it's too late, you have some prime opportunities to get your Marilyn Monroe on. In this '50s western, Monroe's character finds herself in the open with two other men on the hunt for revenge and salvation, all while trying to remain as civil as possible. Sling Blade (1996) [Embed] \nBilly Bob Thornton shines in this '90s drama. He plays a mentally-disabled man who's released from a mental hospital after 20 years, and finds himself on the mission to save his friend from a poor living situation. Thornton also wrote and directed the film, and his performance is truly one for the books. Thor: Hammer of the Gods (2009) [Embed] \nBefore there was Chris Hemsworth, there was Zachery Ty Bryan. Not to be confused with the 2011 hit, this movie chronicles Thor and his people on the quest to build their own kingdom, with deadly forces along the way. The Great War Diary: Season 1 (2014) [Embed] \nThis documentary tells the story of WWI through the eyes of those who lived it, primarily based on their unpublished journals and diaries. The In-Laws (2003) [Embed] \nIn this action movie, Albert Brooks' character is dragged into a top-secret government mission when he learns his daughter's (Lindsay Sloane) fiancé's (Ryan Reynolds) father (Michael Douglas) is in the CIA. Because newlywed life and in-laws aren't scary enough. The Out-Of-Towners (1999) [Embed] \nBig-screen vets Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin star in this comedy remake about a couple on an interesting venture through New York City for a job interview. Top Gun (1986) [Embed] \nI mean, this is a classic. If you're unsure of the true meaning of \"Take My Breath Away,\" Iceman, or Maverick, you need to watch immediately. Young Tom Cruise will win you over as the cocky naval aviator who tries to win the affections of his flight instructor, played by Kelly McGillis. Nostalgia is always a good idea. Valley Of The Dolls (1967) [Embed] \nBased on the best-selling novel of the same name, this drama tells the story of three young women and their rollercoaster lives, from their careers in show business to tumultuous love lives. World Trade Center (2006) [Embed] \nThis drama, based on the events of Sept. 11, tells the story of two Port Authority officers stuck in the rubble of the terrorist attack aftermath, as they trying to help others escape. The all-star cast includes Nicolas Cage, Maria Bello, Michael Peña, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Stephen Dorff, and Michael Shannon. Leaving Dec. 2 Legends of the Knight (2013) [Embed] \nThis documentary showcases the power of Batman's story, and the positive effect it's had on people and families from different walks of life all around the world. The Red Baron (2008) [Embed] \nThis biopic is based on German national hero and WWI vet Manfred Von Richthofen, who was nicknamed the Red Baron. Leaving Dec. 3 The Best of Me (2014) [Embed] \nIf you're a sucker for Nicholas Sparks movies, this one is for you, my friend. James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan star in this film about two high school sweethearts reunited after 20 years, unbeknownst to them that there are serious threats working against their rekindled flame. Also, it features Marsden. Need I say more? Leaving Dec. 5 Holes (2003) [Embed] \nShia LeBeouf stars in this film based on the book every '90s kid read at least once in their lifetime. After spending their days digging away at a detention camp under the commands of the warden, Stanley (LeBeouf) and his friends are determined to figure out why. Leaving Dec. 14 The Da Vinci Code (2006) [Embed] \nTom Hanks and Audrey Tautou star in the first installment of Ron Howard's franchise based on the globally-recognized Dan Brown novels. A murder in the Louvre leads Hanks and Tautou's characters to a thrilling hunt based on clues in iconic paintings which challenge the fundamentals of Christianity. It's a total must-see and worth the entire two hours and 30 minutes of watch time. Leaving Dec. 15 High Profits: Season 1 (2015) [Embed] \nThis 8-episode CNN miniseries tells the story of a young Colorado couple who envisions building a marijuana empire. World War II In Colour (2009) [Embed] \nRobert Powell narrates some of the most significant events from WWII in this 13-episode TV miniseries — all in color. Leaving Dec. 16 Beyond The Hills (2012) [Embed] \nAfter growing up in an orphanage and building a friendship together, two young girls part ways in different countries to set the course of their lives. Leaving Dec. 22 Dark Skies (2013) [Embed] \nKeri Russell and Josh Hamilton star in this thriller as suburbia parents, who fight to protect their family once it's targeted by mysterious, unidentified forces. Leaving Dec. 26 Just Fr i ends (2005) [Embed] \nYour holiday season may or not may be complete without watching this hilarious film with Ryan Reynolds and Anna Farris. On the quest to win over his big-time high school crush, a Hollywood hot shot (played by Reynolds) finds himself in a series of unfortunate events in his New Jersey hometown with an eccentric pop singer (Farris) attached to his hip. As much as it'll make you laugh out loud, it'll also give you the feels. Leaving Dec. 27 Spy Kids (2001) [Embed] \nA classic for any '90s kid, this one is worth the watch just for a good blast from the past. A young set of siblings take on the role of spies to save their parents (who are ex-spies) from the bad guy, and kick total butt in the process. Leaving Dec. 31 Hercules: The Legendary Journeys: Season 1-6 (1995-1999) [Embed] \nHercules (Kevin Sorbo) — half-man, half-god — roams the mortal world fighting evil after his family is killed by his step-mother. You have six seasons, so start your marathoning now. \nYou'll have a busy next few weeks, but they will also be glorious. \nImage: Buena Vista Pictures Distribution Must Reads ",

      "text": "If there's any episode of Gilmore Girls you should watch before sitting down to binge Netflix's revival on Friday it's the appropriately-titled series finale , \"Bon Voyage.\"\nIt's been nearly 10 years since it first aired, but soon, fans will learn what the Stars Hollow residents have been up to since we last saw them. Four 90-minute episodes will be available for streaming as part of the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life reboot.\nWhile you'll likely remember the larger plot lines, like Luke and Lorelai sharing a kiss and Rory landing a job reporting on Senator Barack Obama's campaign trail, here are 12 things you might've forgotten from the season seven finale. Because, who knows, one of these moments might just be a key plot point in the revival.\n1. One of Rory's favorite journalists, Christiane Amanpour, showed up at the Dragonfly Inn Christiane Amanpour at the Dragonfly Source: Netflix Amanpour, who randomly was staying at Lorelai's inn, gives Rory journalism advice, her card and tells her to stay in touch.\n2. Rory moves back home and plans a rollercoaster trip with Lorelai After Rory doesn't get the fellowship she wanted with the New York Times , she and her mom make summer plans to travel the east coast riding rollercoasters.\n3. Lorelai says she's over Luke and believes they are finally done Lorelai comforts Rory about her breakup with Logan, telling her she will eventually feel better. This prompts Rory to ask her, \"do you feel better about Luke?\"\n\"I need someone who can show me how he feels,\" Lorelai responds. \"He can't do that ... We're better off as friends.\"\n4. Rory lands a last-minute job on Senator Obama's campaign trail Rory got a job! Source: Giphy After meeting the person who runs the online magazine she had been writing pieces for, Rory tells her mom and grandparents she has to leave in three days because she was offered, and quickly accepted, a position.\n5. Lorelai has to cancel Rory's graduation reenactment Many residents of Stars Hollow (think: Babette, Miss Patty, Kirk, etc.) were upset that there weren't enough tickets for them to attend Rory's graduation from Yale. To make up for it, Lorelai had planned a reenactment party that due to Rory's new job had to be cancelled.\n6. Rory doesn't understand why her mom is calm about her leaving After being confused by Lorelai's seemingly relaxed attitude, Rory asks her why she is OK with her leaving. \"It's too soon,\" Lorelai responds. \"If I stop to think about you leaving now, I'm going to fall apart. We still have time left.\"\n7. Luke works with Sookie to plan a surprise going away party for Rory Luke sewing a tent Source: Netflix At dark, the town sets up the square for the party before Babette tells Luke it is going to pour the next day. Instead of canceling the entire event, Luke spends the entire night sewing together tarps and table cloths to make a tent.\n8. Richard tells Lorelai he is proud of her. In perhaps one of the more tearjerking moments of the finale, Richard tells Lorelai that the party isn't entirely for Rory, but a testament to her and the home she has created for Rory. \"It takes a remarkable person to inspire all of this,\" he tells her.\n9. Taylor gives one hell of a speech Or a \"unique tribute\" as Rory called it: \"We are gathered here on this glorious spring day, pregnant with pride and anticipation, preparing to birth you from our collective womb, fully gestated and nourished. And so we breathe deep, and, with these last, painful contractions, we push you out into the world, spank your bottom, and wipe the amniotic fluid from your eyes as you issue your first independent breath.\"\n10. Emily wants to loan Lorelai money for a spa to continue Friday night dinners Emily thinks since Rory is gone, Lorelai is going to stop coming for their weekly dinners.\n\"Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner,\" Lorelai responds. \"Oh, so our Friday night dinners are going to continue then?\" Emily asks. \"Well, we might as well,\" Lorelai says. \"I've kind of gotten used to it.\n11. Lorelai finds out Luke was responsible for the party Lorelai and Luke kiss Source: Netflix She thanks him and he says, \"I just like to see you happy.\" And then they kiss.\n12. The series ends at Luke's True Gilmore Girls fans will realize the show ended and started with the girls drinking coffee at the exact same table at Luke's Diner.",

      "text": "When Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits Netflix Nov. 25, fans of the series will have a serious question on their hands: How should they watch the four new 90-minute specials?\nNetflix has built its business model on the value of the binge-watch — so it's natural to assume many a Gilmore Girls fan who has been waiting nearly a decade for these new episodes to tear through them once they hit the streaming service. But in reviews of the series published so far, opinions seem to vary.\nSource: YouTube For example, Variety 's TV critic Maureen Ryan writes in her overall positive review that watching too much A Year in the Life in one sitting is unadvised:\nThe 'Gilmore Girls' we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times — and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised — but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring. ... Here's a recipe for enjoying this new edition of 'Gilmore Girls': Get a blanket and a mug of cocoa, and watch 30 or maybe 40 minutes at a time. It'll still be there, waiting for you, next time you need a distinctive and idiosyncratic blast from the past, one that makes the transition to the present fairly seamlessly. In other words, don't binge on this comfort food. Her argument for a slow consumption, she continues, is that A Year in the Life can be a healing salve. \"In these difficult and uncertain times , why not make it last?\" she asks.\nBut in her review for Vulture , Jen Chaney says the series is uniquely suited for bingeing:\nFans of Stars Hollow, the Connecticut town where 'Gilmore Girls' is set, proved they're just as voracious as fans of 'Star Wars.' They have been counting the hours until Nov. 25, the post-Thanksgiving date that Netflix set for the 'Year in the Life' premiere, enabling viewers to settle in for a binge-watch the same way that Rory and Lorelai would: with a mountain of leftovers spread out in front of them. (Also, probably a couple of pizzas and at least one box of Chinese food.) This tracks with USA Today 's own watch guide, which assumes viewers are bingeing and instructs them on the best Gilmore -related foods and entertainments to bring along.\nSo the answer to the question seems to come down to a difference in preference. Is the more comforting thing to immerse yourself in the world of Stars Hollow for six straight hours, or to come back to it over and over again over the course of time? Different viewers are going to answer that question in different ways, and the personal response is the key.\nOne last thought to consider: Gilmore Girls is an immensely rewatchable series. The first watch of A Year in the Life will almost certainly not be the last; creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is an expert at layering the show's world so that repeat visits feel welcoming and warm. So a binge-watch is not the end of one's journey with A Year in the Life — in fact, it's just the beginning.",

      "text": "Seven reasons the Gilmore Girls revival is everything we needed from 2016 Netflix will be dropping four new episodes of Gilmore Girls on November 25th. \nImage Credits: YouTube/ Gilmore Life \nSixteen years since the very first episode of the hit series Gilmore Girls aired, the show will finally make its long-awaited return to the screen. \nIn case you haven’t heard, Netflix will be dropping four new episodes on November 25th and its safe to say that fans cannot wait for the premier of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life any longer . \nThe series, which last aired in 2007, introduced fans to Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, Rory, together in a small, quirky town called Stars Hollow. \nHere are seven reasons 2016 would’ve been better off if we’d had the Gilmore Girls in our lives: Teenage drama television shows were the best when the show first aired \nShows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer , The O.C. , 7th Heaven and of course, Gilmore Girls were everything. Now fans have the chance to watch it all over again and reminisce . Fans were obsessed with Gilmore Girls – and they still are. They totally freaked when Netflix also released season one to seven during the month of October. \n2. Stars Hollow will always be home \nThe fictional small town in Connecticut is both quirky and charming. The NY Times calls it a “civic formula that has proved elusive for fans who have sought a real-life version to move to”. Sean Gunn, who plays Kirk, also commented and said Stars Hollow is “an idealized version of the way a small town could function.” \nThe town’s focal point is a picture – perfect square featuring a gazebo, surrounded by streets lined up with family-owned businesses, an old-fashioned soda shop, a cozy inn and of course Luke’s Diner where Lorelai would get her coffee fix on a daily basis. \n3. Speaking of Luke’s Diner … \nNetflix transformed 200 coffee shops across the country to look like Luke’s diner from the show. The pop-ups almost looked exactly like the real deal.

The characters are totally relatable \nGilmore Girls features some dynamic characters. Rory, who’s kind of a nerd (she made reading cool), Lorelai, a single mother who raised her daughter away from her conservative parents, the eccentric best friend, Sookie and of course all of their love interests. \n4. Lorelai, need we say more? \nIn the revival you’ll able to see Lorelai in all her colorful, and not at all conventional glory… again! \n5. Lorelai and Rory made the best pop culture references \n6. Fans might finally get some closure. \nThe feel of the show was mainly due to the creative minds of its creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino. The 7th season didn’t, according to various reports, end on the right note because the duo walked away before the final season after negotiations with Warner Bros. Studios went awry. Hopefully, the revival will give fans some closure. \n7. Everyone gets a second chance at dreaming about the perfect mother-daughter relationship. TAGS",

      "text": "Photo: Netflix \nAs Brendan Dassey had his murder conviction overturned only for his release from prison to be upheld , his uncle and fellow Making a Murderer subject Steven Avery is also seeing some movement in his own appeal. Both Avery and Dassey were convicted of the same crime, the 2005 murder of Teresa Hallbach. Now, according to The Wrap , a judge has ordered new testing of the evidence used to convict Avery. The ruling follows a motion filed in August that sought testing said not to exist during the time of Avery's original trial. The evidence in question reportedly predominantly comes from Halbach's vehicle and includes blood flakes from the floor of the vehicle, bloodstains from the driver’s and passenger’s seats, a swab from the car’s ignition area, and a bloodstain swab from the rear passenger door. Avery's attorney Kathleen Zellner shared Avery's reaction to the news, tweeting: \"Judge just entered order for scientific testing to proceed. Steven Avery says 'it will be a Happy Thanksgiving after all.' # MakingAMurderer .\"\nJudge just entered order for scientific testing to proceed.

      "text": "Hollywood loves to recast and reboot, sometimes for better, often for worse. In the following case, the prospect seems promising. From Deadline :\nParker Posey has joined the cast of Lost In Space , Netflix ’s remake of sci-fi master Irwin Allen’s 1965 cult TV classic, from Legendary TV.\nSlated for a 2018 premiere, the new Lost In Space takes its cues from the original CBS series, revolving around the Robinson family, which is forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, the Robinsons find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and their own personal demons. Posey will play Dr. Smith.\nSmith was played by Jonathan Harris in the original series, and by Gary Oldman in the 1998 feature film. As gender swaps go, this one seems justified. First, there's nothing about the Smith character which demands it be masculine. Second, and more importantly, Posey has a track record delivering the goods in this kind of role. Scheming, manipulative, and wholly self-centered is where Posey works best. She'll be a natural for Dr. Smith.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/24/parker-posey-will-play-gender-flipped-dr-smith-in-netflixs-lost-in-space-reboot/",

      "text": "Comment Logo for Netflix's ''Daredevil'' series. Wikimedia Commons/Marvel Studios \nDaredevil might not be one of the comic book characters with superpowers that are able to save the world on a grand scale, but he certainly has an interesting life and story that has gripped the imagination of the masses. In fact, Matt Murdock’s life after he lost his sight has been an interesting one in the comic books as well as on the silver screen, and Netflix’s Daredevil series has made it to two seasons already. The second season saw an expansion of different characters from the Marvel universe, including Frank Castle who is known as the Punisher, and Elektra Natchios, who used to be his old flame. Matt managed to do battle on various fronts -- physically and emotionally, in the second season of Daredevil on Netflix, emerging victorious but not without cost. So, what else can we expect from Daredevil Season 3 when it rolls around? \nAfter all, there has been a bunch of cliffhangers left over from Season 2 of Daredevil, which means that there is plenty of potential for a third season to happen. Surely fans would clamor for a third season since so many things remain unresolved. It will take some time before the Man without Fear makes a return on his own Netflix series, as there are other Netflix series that will have to run the gauntlet, so to speak, before that, such as Iron Fist, Luke Cage Season 2, The Punisher, and The Defenders, among others. \nWhile nothing official has been revealed concerning Daredevil Season 3 to date, it does not take a genius to come up with some predictions as to how the third season will shape up, given the cliffhangers of Season 2. While The Hand’s diabolical plot might be no more, their overall objective remains unknown to us viewers, including the mystery of the really, really huge pit. \nThe Kingpin aka Wilson Fisk remains behind bars at the moment, but this does not mean he has lost any of his authority or powers -- he is the new kingpin in prison, and from there, he will continue to plot for Matt Murdock’s fall. Season 3 would also be a prime opportunity to introduce more villains from the Daredevil canon. \nAs to when Daredevil Season 3 will be aired, that also remains pretty much in the dark, and speculations are certainly rife. The third season of Daredevil was officially renewed by Netflix during Comic-Con in July this year, and assuming Netflix decides to follow the form book, then the show would most probably make a return to our TV screens some time in March or April next year, or perhaps in summer. The spanner in the works would be Charlie Cox stating not too long ago that The Defenders miniseries, also on Netflix, will begin shooting some time at the end of 2016, with Daredevil being one of the heroes that will make an appearance in the miniseries. Hence, it would not be surprising to see 2018 or later as to when Daredevil makes another appearance. Well, we will simply have to wait and see for the entire Marvel universe Netflix series to pan out eventually. ",

      "title": "Streaming video service Hooq will now go toe-to-toe with Netflix in Singapore",
      "text": "\nStreaming video service Hooq is finally launching in Singapore, the company announced today. The Singaporean startup is opening up its video streaming and downloading platform to consumers in its home market almost two years after launch, during which time it hit four other countries in Southeast and South Asia.\nThe service has so far been available in the Philippines, Thailand, India, and Indonesia.\nHooq hopes its locally tailored content will appeal to Singaporeans. Hooq CEO Peter Bithos tells Tech in Asia that Singaporean customers are quite sophisticated when it comes to online services, so the company wanted to make sure its offering was of a high enough quality before launching it in the city-state.\nIn addition, the Singtel-owned company has kept working on its tech to improve streaming quality and speed. Features like the option to download content for offline viewing will be available here as well.\nLike most of its competitors, the service its subscription-based. The monthly fee in Singapore will be S$8.98 (US$6.20). Netflix’s monthly subscription fee starts at S$10.98 (US$7.70).\nHooq will be widely available to consumers, but the company will also partner with Singtel to offer its service to the telco customers through data bundles.\nPeter says the service has over 3 million registered users across its markets, adding “hundreds” of them every month.\nChasing screen time So far, Hooq had been operating in markets with little or no competition from global players like Netflix (which changed when Netflix did a global blow-out launch ). Iflix , part of the Catcha Group, has been competing with Hooq in Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. It’s also available in Malaysia, where Hooq hasn’t landed yet. In India, there are a number of local streaming services.\nHooq’s major competitor in Singapore is Netflix, which has both money and a lot of international content deals – not to mention a growing number of high-profile original productions. Amazon’s Prime Video service, home to its own original shows like Transparent and this month’s The Grand Tour , is expected to reach these shores in the near future.\nSee: How Patrick Grove plans to run circles around Netflix \nWhen asked about Hooq and Iflix , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had told Tech in Asia he wasn’t too concerned because he didn’t think people would stick with just one service, pointing to Prime Video and HBO Go in the US. “It turns out people will pay for both if both have great content,” he said.\nUsers in Singapore can also choose among other regional options like Hong Kong-based Viu , which specializes in Korean and Japanese content, and Taiwan-based Catchplay that focuses on film. Rival telco Starhub has its own streaming service called Starhub Go .\nThat said, the greatest hurdle for all of them is likely to be an indifferent audience, whose response to streaming providers has been lackluster , according to local consultancy Media Partners Asia.\nThe greatest hurdle for all streaming services is likely to be an indifferent audience. Peter feels that Hooq’s edge in the market is going to be the depth of its catalogue and the way it’s put together to attract the local viewer. Besides the requisite films and shows from the US, Hooq has a lot of local content for Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Indonesian audiences. It’s also started its own original productions with local shows like On The Job: The Series in the Philippines.\nIts relationship with Warner Bros and Sony Pictures (both companies own a minority stake in Hooq) has helped it secure some exclusive deals for the region, like the Supergirl TV show. The service currently features over 35,000 hours of content.\nPeter appears confident about the local player advantage in Singapore, which will help Hooq with marketing and beefing up original productions in the region. “Local is a battleground on which we’ll go toe to toe with anyone,” he says.\nThe company hopes to focus on more regional markets next, like Malaysia and Vietnam, and perhaps the Middle East.\nConverted from Singapore dollars.

      "text": "Daniel Tiger and friends have a new neighborhood\nAmazon and Netflix may be doubling down on their commitment to children's programming, but Twin Cities Public Television is still very much in the game.\nTPT, based in St. Paul, announced Wednesday the upcoming launch of a new channel dedicated solely to repeats of PBS favorites, including \"Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,\" \"Dinosaur Train\" and \"Wild Kratts.\"\nThe 24/7 channel, set to hit the air on Jan. 18, will be anchored at the 2.4 digital channel now occupied by around-the-clock weather. TPT will move that service to 2.5. Cable viewers will have to check with their specific providers on where to find the new station -- or can go to pbskids.org, where Minnesotans will be directed to a livestream of the channel.\nAccording to TPT, PBS stations reach more kids age 2 to 5, more moms with children under 6 and more children from low-income families than any other kids TV network.\nOlder Post 'It never felt negative': Twin Cities actor saw same 'Hamilton' show as Pence Newer Post Minnesotans are in love with the new film 'Loving'",

      "text": "51 minutes ago 8:47 AM © Netflix 24 November 2016 9:38 AM Shares Within the space of five seconds and a chime of a familiar a capella choir, it's as if we never left Stars Hollow. But we can't quite believe it's been nine years, and the quirky town has never looked better. Netflix's A Year in the Life four-part revival is a treasure trove for all die-hard Gilmore Girls fans who have missed the fast-paced dialogue and pop-culture references of the titular mother-and-daughter duo. \"Haven't done that in a while,\" says Lorelai after a particularly huge sentence. \"Felt good,\" replies Rory. You bet it does. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Pretty much every character you loved (or hated) is back in some way or another. The script is as fresh and slick as ever, and it is somehow both nostalgic yet fits right into the TV landscape of 2016. © Netflix But time has kept on ticking all these years – the folks of Stars Hollow have been there this whole time while Rory has been off trying to make it big in journalism. And she's discovered that life isn't quite as easy as she hoped. That's what Gilmore Girls has always been about. Things may seem all rosy and hippy-dippy, but behind all the chit-chat are moments of pathos. Rory is stuck in a career rut and a crappy relationship and is behaving in an un-Rory-like way because of it. Lorelai is worried about her personal and professional life. It wouldn't be Gilmore Girls without a dose of worrying in paradise. It's clear that the revival is mainly intended for this show's loyal audience, even those who stayed with its dodgy final season that didn't include creator and writer Amy Sherman-Palladino. For returning fans, these four episodes are like a cosy hug in a mug. (And pretty much anyone who's been through 2016 is in need of one.) © Netflix But if you're a newbie there's still plenty to enjoy. Okay, most of the storylines probably won't make much sense without seven years of investment, but its general themes of nostalgia, longing, loss and parent-child issues will surely hit home with anyone. One could argue that the revival treads familiar ground, but surely that's what revivals are all about? It needs to follow on as if the series never left. If they tried to do something completely different you'd feel shortchanged after all these years. The ghosts of that cold and miserable seventh season have been put to rest, and Gilmore Girls has been handed the send-off it truly deserved. With Netflix at the helm, we've been truly spoiled with what are essentially four lovely movies all at once. If that seems a tad daunting even for a die-hard GG fan, we recommend streaming a traditional episode length at a time – it won't downgrade your enjoyment. And as a plus, it will make it last longer. Boom. Will this be the final ever trip to Stars Hollow? Who knows? But whenever the Gilmore Girls lead, we'll follow. ",

      "text": "If you watched ‘For Grace’ on Netflix, this will give you all the feels Chef Curtis Duffy \nChef Curtis Duffy (Glenn McManus) Morgan Olsen ” that debuted on Netflix earlier this year. It chronicles Chicago chef Curtis Duffy’s journey to open Grace , his Michelin three-star restaurant located in the West Loop. If you haven't seen it, I’ll give you a pass to return to this article later, and I’d encourage you to give the award-winning doc by Chicago filmmakers Kevin Pang and Mark Helenowski a spin. (Trust that you needn’t be a foodie to enjoy this flick.)\nNow that we’re all on the same page, here’s something that should make you smile. Earlier this week, Duffy was inducted into the Escoffier School of Culinary Arts’ hall of fame, Disciples d’Escoffier. And while the honor sounds very high-brow and supremely cheffy, you should know this: The renowned culinary school, which has a focus on farm-to-table fare, also announced a partnership with Duffy to inspire budding chefs through presentations given in home economics classes in Chicago high schools. Additionally, they revealed a $25,000 scholarship program in the chef’s name. \nBut Duffy wasn’t the only inductee that night. Along with Robert and Sonat Birnecker, the founders and owners of Koval Distillery, Duffy’s former grade school teacher Ruth Snider was also inducted into the culinary hall of fame for her outstanding work as an educator. This brings us back to the movie. Escoffier inductees in the kitchen of Grace Glenn McManus \nJeremy Wheaton, President of Triumph Education Group; Curtis Duffy; Michael Escoffier; and Ruth Snyder. \nJeremy Wheaton, President of Triumph Education Group; Curtis Duffy; Michael Escoffier; and Ruth Snyder. (Glenn McManus) \nDuffy got his first taste of cooking in a mandatory sixth grade home economics class under Snider's thoughtful instruction. At the time, he was rebellious and angsty, dealing with problems at home behind the scenes. But Snider saw potential. Duffy took the class again in seventh grade and for a third time in eighth grade, when it was no longer required. The two remained close, and when Duffy’s parents died in a tragic murder-suicide, Snider offered a support system. Since then, the two have remained lifelong friends. \nEarlier this week, as Duffy and Snider stood at the back of his famed restaurant receiving their awards and being inducted into the culinary hall of fame, it was a humble reminder that it’s not always about the names on a chef's resume, something we tend to weigh quite heavily in the food world. And though Sinder will never take an ounce of credit for Duffy's success (really, she was a little uncertain about being inducted that night), we should never discount the power of early education and the willingness of teachers to go above and beyond for their students. \nTo learn more about Duffy, Snider and the rise of Grace, check out Kevin Pang's story for the Chicago Tribune.

      "text": "0 0 \nAfter a long and tiring run, Microsoft finally retired Internet Explorer from the PC browser game and replaced it with the new and fresh Microsoft Edge. While Microsoft Edge does have its strong points such as security, where it has been deemed superior to all competitors by experts in the field, the browser has still been found lacking overall. This has led people to lean on more consecrated browser solutions such as Firefox, Opera, and everyone’s favorite, Google Chrome. \nFor this reason, Microsoft has taken its browser marketing into the 4K spectrum. The tech icon partnered with Netflix to provide 4K quality content for Netflix subscribers. Actually, Netlfix will be providing all the 4K content, as long as you have a Netflix subscription and use Microsoft Edge as your browser. It has been specified that 4K is only available on Netflix for Edge users, making it an exclusive feature. \nNetflix users will also have to meet hardware requirements. Even though they are eligible through using Netflix on Edge, they cannot use the 4K feature if they don’t have the specs to run it. The 4K technology requires the latest i7 generation chipset and a display that supports it. \nIn hopes of luring in more customers, Microsoft has also launched a couple of subtle attacks at Google Chrome saying that users will benefit from a longer battery life on their device by using Microsoft Edge instead of Google’s browsing solution. \nWhether or not Microsoft finds success with this 4K campaign is to be seen as Edge continues to trail in market share. Currently, the Internet Explorer replacement holds no more than 5.26% of market shares, meaning that people aren’t nearly as impressed by security as much as they are by pretty much any other aspect that makes for a good browser. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

This guy came up to us and said, “What are you looking at?”.\nMatt Smith was held at gunpoint while filming The Crown in South Africa (Picture: Mike Marsland/WireImage) ‘We were drunk. We said, “Nothing, mate. No worries.” He was like, “I’ll f**king shoot you, bru!” He had a gun!’\nAdding another twist to the tale, Matt revealed how he decided to leave the bar to get with his friend to get away, but seek safety as far away as perhaps they should have.\n‘Really, stupidly, we just went to the bar across the street,’ Matt added. ‘I don’t know why we didn’t just leave altogether.\n\n‘He came up to the window, and went [tap, tap, tap], no word of a lie, he had a Crocodile Dundee knife in his hand. A bouncer came up and was like, “Get out of here!”’\nBlimey. You don’t get that with Downton Abbey, eh?\n\nDespite being held at gunpoint, Matt explained how he had a pretty wonderful time playing Prince Philip, who is renowned for breaking the mould when it comes to royal occasions.\n‘He’s quite a liberating character to play because, in the royal family, he gets to speak his mind and no one else does,’ Matt added. ‘Everyone else is bound by this sort of strange protocol.’\nYou can stream the entire first season of The Crown on Netflix now.\nMORE: Matt Smith asked Prince William advice on playing Prince Philip in Netflix’s The Crown \nMORE: Matt Smith and Claire Foy have already been given the boot from The Crown ",

EST November 23, 2016 In this July 18, 2015 file photo, comedian Dave Chappelle speaks at the RUSH Philanthropic Arts Foundation's Art for Life Benefit in New York. (Photo: Scott Roth, AP) (Photo: Associated Press) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nThree new Dave Chappelle specials are coming to Netflix in 2017. \nEarlier this month, the comedian made his return to TV, hosting Saturday Night Live on Nov. 12. On Monday, Netflix announced the release of three new specials with Chappelle, with premiere dates yet to be announced. \nFor the first special, Chappelle will reunite with director/producer Stan Lathan, who led the comedian's past hits, Killin’ Them Softly (HBO) and For What It's Worth (Showtime), for an original stand-up special exclusively on Netflix. \nThe second two concert specials, also directed by Lathan, represent Chappelle’s first concert specials in 12 years, containing previously-unseen footage from two shows at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium, and will be released simultaneously by Netflix. \nThe three Netflix projects are Chappelle's first TV specials since For What It’s Worth aired in 2004. Since his controversial departure from Chappelle's Show in 2005, the comedian has resumed touring, performing over 500 concerts since 2013. His recent SNL hosting stint earned the show its highest ratings in three years. \n",

      "text": "Blue Jay Is a Heartbreaking New Romance With Sarah Paulson, and It's Coming to Netflix November 23, 2016 by Shannon Vestal Robson 52 Shares \nAmerican Horror Story just wrapped up season six, with series veteran Sarah Paulson back in the cast , but like every season, with blood, gore, and other atrocities, and some of us just didn't have the energy (or the stomach). It's a shame, since stars like Paulson are extraordinary actors, which is why her film at the Toronto International Film Festival was on my must-see list. \nBlue Jay stars Paulson and Mark Duplass, who also wrote the film, as high school sweethearts who run into each other after 20 years or so. I'm grateful I caught a screening of the movie, because it was one of my favorites of the festival. Though it's resolutely unflashy and the kind of indie only your film buff friends might have heard about, it should be on your must-see list too, because it's a heartbreaking, worthwhile romance — and, fulfilling the ultimate needs of convenience, it'll be on Netflix on Dec. 6. \nTwo caveats: Paulson and Duplass are nearly the only actors in the film, and it's in black and white. The heavily dialogue-based movie may not be for those with short attention spans, but if you ever watched and enjoyed the Before Sunrise series, you will love this. As Jim and Amanda, Paulson and Duplass spend one whole day together after bumping into each other in their hometown, and as they walk, talk, and stop by their old haunts, we learn more and more about their past relationship. While Jim and Amanda have unresolved issues that are specific to them as a couple, anyone who has ever been in love or had a past relationship haunt them like a ghost will relate. And like me, you may end up sobbing a bucket of tears by the end of the movie. \nIt's a welcome respite to Paulson's intense TV endeavors, but her acting is more stunning than ever. You'll have a chance to check out Blue Jay for yourself when the movie hits Netflix on Dec.6. Watch the trailer now:",

      "text": "Netflix PC Gets 4K Support, But Don't Get Too Excited Yet 24 November 2016, 6:48 am EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Netflix will finally be available to stream in 4K for PC owners, that is if the PC has an Intel Kaby Lake processor and a 4K display. For those without the compatible hardware, they can stick to 1080p streaming for now. ( Netflix ) Advertisement For quite some time now, Smart 4K TVs have been enjoying a host of 4K content offered by Netflix from its expansive library, and PCs can now join the move forward. Netflix, in partnership with Microsoft, opened up 4K video streaming to PCs on Monday, though the computer needs to be a fairly recent one in order to hop on the 4K bandwagon. Netflix 4K For PC Requirements As per Microsoft's requirements , if the machine is neither powered by a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor nor boasting a 4K display, then forget the whole 4K thing, because the computer won't be supported. Also, 4K streaming will only be available on Windows 10 using Microsoft's own browser, Edge. Sorry, MacBooks . These very demanding requirements only make for a small pool of PC owners able to stream 4K content from Netflix. If one's machine, like say, the Lenovo yoga 910 , has compatible hardware corresponding to Netflix's requirements, then the user may go ahead and try it for himself. For the rest of us sans Kaby Lake processors or 4K displays, we'll make do with Netflix's 1080p streaming cap for now. Additionally, as part of the partnership, compatible PCs will be able to stream Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ahead of everyone else, so fans of the series can gawk at Stars Hollow in all its Ultra HD glory. Another thing that would be nice is for Netflix to finally support offline playback once and for all, though that isn't likely to happen any time soon, especially in the United States. Why Is 4K Streaming On PC Restricted To Kaby Lake PCs? It's easy to see why Netflix would limit 4K streaming functionality for seventh-gen Intel PCs since Kaby Lake processors have 10-bit HEVC decoding that enables 4K playback on computers. It's also important to note that Netflix's content is protected by DRM and uses Microsoft PlayReady 3.0, which is available exclusively on Windows 10 and Edge. This is the reason why PCs needed to run Edge in order to stream 1080p content on Netflix, with other browsers maxing out at 720p. If Netflix's 4k Streaming option for PC escapes you at the moment because you don't have any expensive gaming laptops or 2-in-1s lying around, you can always buy the Chromecast Ultra or the Amazon Fire TV and watch 4K content on your TV using these devices instead. \nDo you have a compatible laptop or desktop computer that'll support 4K streaming on Netflix? Do you think Netflix should at least look into expanding the functionality to older laptops with older Intel processors? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!  ",

      "text": "  Why ‘Gilmore GIrls’ may continue after new Netflix series Herb Scribner,   × Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (2016) (Netflix) \nFans of the TV show “Gilmore Girls” are already excited that the show’s revival miniseries “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” airs this week. \nBut this Netflix-only series may not be the end of Lorelai and Rori. \nThe two actresses who play the main characters revealed as much in an interview with Metro, saying they’re refusing to rule out another round of episodes. \n“It’s hard to say,” Lauren Graham, who plays Lorelai, told Metro. “I love it so much that I would just want to do what’s best for the show. I think what we’ve done was such a great piece, this miniseries to me was incredibly gratifying.” \nShe also said that the show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, always planned for the show to fit a “Sherlock” style show, where the plot moves throughout time and doesn’t stay stuck to one constant story model. \n“Amy always had the Sherlock model in mind,” Graham said, according to Metro. “Some years it’s three, some years it’s one, some years they go back in time. So perhaps we need to go back in time? I don’t know, it’s hard to say.” \nBut there may be some more evidence out there that “A Year in the Life” won’t be the end. \nThe show’s creator always intended on finishing the show with four final words that were to be spoken at the end of the series finale.

      "title": "Why you're ignoring your family to watch 'Gilmore Girls'",
      "text": "When Netflix announced that the release date for the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival would be Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving, one fact became clear: Many relatives will be ignored during this holiday.\nThe most-anticipated show of the year will land on Netflix at 2:01 a.m. CT on Friday, Nov. 25, and it's not a stretch to say that quite a few people will wake up the next morning and immediately start streaming the series, which is four 90-minute episodes. Sorry, parents who need help cleaning the kitchen or cousins who want to go Black Friday shopping -- \"Gilmore Girls\" is top priority.\nIf you need help explaining to your family why you're barricading yourself in your room on Friday, and potentially into the weekend, here's a guide, with questions from the perspective of a non-\"Gilmore Girls\" viewer:\nQ. Why is the Internet melting down over this revival? Don't old TV shows come back all the time these days?\nA. Fair point! But \"Gilmore Girls\" is still a pretty big deal. The show went off-air in 2007 after the seventh and final season, but the ending was a huge disappointment for fans. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, executive producer Dan Palladino, walked away after the sixth season when they couldn't come to a financial agreement with the studio. It was complicated.\nQ. Why is that a big deal?\nA. Not to get too cliché here, but the Palladinos were the heart and soul of the series. \"Gilmore Girls\" is known (and loved) for its rapid-fire, whip-smart dialogue filled with pop-culture references, and it takes a very specific person to carry that voice.\n\"It's horrifying. It's like a freaking nightmare,\" Sherman-Palladino said in response to passing off the show to a new executive producer for the final season. Yet that's what happened -- and it was too obvious in the seventh season that new people were in charge. The dialogue dragged, storylines were nonsense, and a beloved series limped away to the disappointment of a fiercely loyal fan base.\nAnyway, the Palladinos are back in charge of the revival. This is very exciting closure for fans, because now they'll be able to see the end of the series the way the creator originally intended. Also, for years, Sherman-Palladino has teased that she's always known what the last four words of the show would be; the mystery surrounding the final line has reached almost mythical status. Mythical!\nQ. So what's the show about again?\nA. I would be shocked that you asked that, except as my friend Nick recently put it, \"Sure, I know the Gilmore girls. Lisa Gilmore and Juanita Gilmore. One's a mom, one's a girl, something something Yale.\"\nUh, close. \"Gilmore Girls\" is about the adventures of Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel), a quirky mother-daughter duo who are best friends. They live in a small, dreamy New England town. Lorelai got pregnant when she was 16, which caused a lifelong rift with her wealthy, traditional parents, and she ran away from home once Rory was born. The series starts as Rory is 16 and gets into a fancy private school, and Lorelai is forced to ask her parents for money for Rory's tuition. They say yes, but as a condition, her mother (Kelly Bishop) insists that they come to dinner every Friday night. And so the generational drama begins. (And yes, Rory eventually goes to Yale.)\nQ. Why are people still so excited about a show that ended almost 10 years ago?\nA. I could write a book about why \"Gilmore Girls\" is so magical, but in practical terms, the show got a second life a couple years ago when Netflix made all seven seasons available. The enormous response showed Netflix executives that they should probably capitalize on this momentum (there's basically a cottage industry of \"Gilmore Girls\" memorabilia, GIFs, quizzes and thinkpieces) and order up a revival.\nQ. Can I watch it if I've never seen the show before?\nA. The revival is almost 100 percent fan service, full of inside jokes and callbacks to the original show. But if you want to spend time with your family member who is ignoring you, go for it! You just might not understand anything -- and you might not want to interrupt with questions.\nGet articles sent to your inbox.

SelectTV may be a less known option, but it actually offers significantly more content than the usual suspects. For that reason alone, I thought it was definitely worth checking out. \nAs advertised, SelectTV delivers a massive library of TV shows, movies, live channels, and more—over 300,000 + TV episodes and 200,000 movies, to be exact. I appreciate that fact that it’s all available through the same interface, which means no more switching between windows or having to enter different passwords to watch what I want. \nWhat's especially unique is that SelectTV also includes a Pay Per View service, which isn't usually an option with streaming services. This comes in handy for watching big fights and new movie releases. Plus, SelectTV connects to home TVs via Chromecast or an HDMI cable. \nIf you love entertainment variety and enjoy not paying cable companies an arm and a leg, you owe it to yourself to check out this service. In fact, for a limited time, you’ll also get a free HD antenna from SelectTV post-purchase if you buy a one year ($24) or three year ($49) subscription . \n",

      "text": "TORONTO - Netflix makes \"substantial\" investments in film and TV productions in Canada and should not face regulation, argues the streaming company in a submission to Canadian Heritage's public consultation on homegrown content in a digital world.\nThe submission, filed Thursday, comes two years after Netflix suggested to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that its service did not fall under the Broadcasting Act since it is not a conventional broadcaster.\n\"We want to continue to invest in content in Canada in the way we have, which means continuing to spend money but not under a system that's similar to the Canadian broadcasters, where there's regulation and paying into the (Canada Media) Fund,\" Elizabeth Bradley, vice president of content at Netflix, said in a phone interview.\n\"We've been doing significant investments on our own and will continue and honestly (it) will only grow significantly over the next couple of years. But regulation is not helping to encourage that for us.\"\nIf Netflix was under the Broadcasting Act it would be required to make certain financial commitments to Canadian content, which some producers feel it should.\n\"They're coasting off the system that existed before and the one thing that's certain is that you can't very (well) support a system where half of the system is required to contribute and half the system is not,\" said Denis McGrath, a Toronto TV writer and producer who also filed a submission during the consultation process.\n\"They'll do several of their original shows but at the same time, most of what's driving that content library and why people are subscribing is stuff that was made under the old system. And a lot of the networks in the States are struggling with, 'This is our competition now and they are sort of in a sense eating our lunch and making it harder for us to do what they do.'\"\nStill, some other producers back Netflix, noting its investments in Canada have helped boost the quality and reach of content here.\n\"Our partnership with Netflix on both 'Alias Grace' and 'Anne' has allowed two remarkable Canadian adaptations to be realized with higher budgets than would otherwise have been possible,\" Sally Catto, general manager of programming for CBC Television, said in a statement.\n\"Anne\" is an upcoming retelling of \"Anne of Green Gables\" and will screen simultaneously on CBC-TV in Canada and on Netflix internationally.\nThe upcoming \"Alias Grace\" miniseries based on the Margaret Atwood novel and written by Sarah Polley will also be broadcast on CBC in Canada and stream on Netflix elsewhere.\n\"For me with 'Alias Grace' — and I know I speak for Sarah Polley as well — it's been a great relationship,\" said producer Noreen Halpern.\n\"This is not a small show. It's a show that, to be done properly, needed a significant budget and we found a great partner in Netflix.\"\nNetflix says in 2016 alone it's commissioned hundreds of millions of dollars of original programming produced in Canada. It's also made \"dozens of commitments in 2016 for Netflix original movies and TV series that will be produced in Canada.\"\nIts other co-commissions with Canadian producers and broadcasters include \"Travelers,\" \"Frontier\" and \"Degrassi: Next Class.\"\nMcGrath said while Netflix may make content and contribute to the economy here, it's still hurting Canadian networks that have obligations to contribute to the cultural funding that creates Canuck shows.\n\"(Netflix) have no presence here, they have no employees here, they take tons of money out of the country in subscription fees and they don't even pay HST,\" he said.\n\"So if you were to take this out of the context of an argument about film and television, I would make the case that what we're talking about here is industrial dumping. We have laws against stuff like this.\"\n ",

      "text": "\nThese days, we benefit from having a plethora of TV streaming options, but SelectTV had never been on my radar. SelectTV may be a less known option, but it actually offers significantly more content than the usual suspects. For that reason alone, I thought it was definitely worth checking out. \nAs advertised, SelectTV delivers a massive library of TV shows, movies, live channels, and more—over 300,000 + TV episodes and 200,000 movies, to be exact. I appreciate that fact that it’s all available through the same interface, which means no more switching between windows or having to enter different passwords to watch what I want. \nWhat's especially unique is that SelectTV also includes a Pay Per View service, which isn't usually an option with streaming services. This comes in handy for watching big fights and new movie releases. Plus, SelectTV connects to home TVs via Chromecast or an HDMI cable. \nIf you love entertainment variety and enjoy not paying cable companies an arm and a leg, you owe it to yourself to check out this service. In fact, for a limited time, you’ll also get a free HD antenna from SelectTV post-purchase if you buy a one year ($24) or three year ($49) subscription . \n",

      "text": "Culture Seven Shows, Films to Stream This Thanksgiving Weekend on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Post-turkey watching could include the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls\" reboot, Rocky movies or comedy specials from Michael Che and Patton Oswalt. By Stav Ziv On 11/24/16 at 12:10 PM Close Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Official Trailer) \nAh, it’s here: the annual four-day weekend that includes a whole lot of family and copious amounts of food. Whether you’re excited to see your relatives or terrified of the polarized political debates that will be hard to stomach—especially this year—some screen time is likely in order. And if you want to avoid spending hours watching professional and/or college football just as badly as you want to hide from discussions with an uncle about Donald Trump, there are plenty of recently added films and shows on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu to keep you occupied and sane. \nLet out some frustration vicariously through Rocky Balboa’s boxing gloves with five Rocky films and Creed ; escape the real world and opt to see it through the lenses of top photographers with Tales by Light ; or spend six glorious hours with old (fictional) friends from Stars Hollow with Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> \nHere are some suggestions for streaming this weekend: Rocky and most of the sequels (Amazon, November 1) \nThere are plenty of Rocky movies, including the original and sequels II through V, now available on Amazon for nearly eight hours of viewing. That should be enough for the duration of even the severest of food comas. Tales by Light (Netflix, November 11) \nExit real life and travel all over the world without leaving your couch to see people, nature and animals from the perspective of top world photographers. Scott & Bailey : Season 5 (Hulu, November 15) \nThe most recent, and reportedly the last, season of this British detective show has joined the previous four on Hulu. It follows two female detectives, Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) and Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones), who work for the Syndicate Nine Major Incident Team of the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police. Patton Oswalt: Tragedy Plus Comedy Equals Time (Hulu and Amazon, November 17) \nHere’s the first of two standup comedy suggestions for this weekend. Can you really have too much humor two and a half weeks after the presidential election and as you prepare to eat turkey with a side of salty political discourse? (No.) Creed (Amazon, November 19) \nFor those who’ve watched all five Rocky films and still want more, there’s Creed , starring Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, a young boxer who seeks advice and training from retired champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Stallone was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his reprisal in the Rocky role, among other nominations and wins for both him and Jordan. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Netflix, November 25) \nDuh. Lorelai, Rory and the whole gang are back in this highly anticipated reboot of the Gilmore Girls series, which aired from 2000 to 2007. \nRelated: Why ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ will be bingeworthy Michael Che Matters (Netflix, November 25) \nEase the political- and familial-tension hangover with a comedy special from Michael Che coming out on Friday. It’s still political and familial and tense, but at least it comes with laughs. \nRead more from Newsweek.com:",

      "text": "For most pop culture savants who are also Netflix subscribers, Nov. 25 is a special day, considering it's when we'll be treated to the highly anticipated return of G ilmore Girls . The revival series is an ideal post-Thanksgiving binge-watch for fans who want to be swept away to Stars Hollow and forget about all the horrible things that are happening in the real world.\nBut if you want something more on the nose, you might want to try 3%. The first Netflix original to be named after a percentage point (it's pretty weird), the series has an interesting post-apocalyptic premise: Only 3% of the Earth's population is allowed to go to the \"better side\" of the world, known as the Offshore. The remaining people will live in unsparing poverty.\nIt appears teenagers are given equal opportunity to make it to the Offshore, but must face a grueling set of obstacles to get there. It looks like an entertaining mix of Battle Royale and City of God , the latter of which makes sense considering 3% is also set in Brazil (and thus, is in Portuguese). When can Netflix users check it out?\nSource: Netflix US & Canada/YouTube Like Gilmore Girls, 3% arrives on Friday, and probably the earliest you'd be able to watch the series is 3 a.m. Eastern. This is based on the previous release times for other Netflix series, like The Crown and Orange Is the New Black , and this appears to be so Netflix users on the West Coast can start their binge at midnight.\nThat means East Coast watchers who are seriously anxious to check out 3% can stay up until 3 a.m. to watch the show. Or, if you're stuffed full of turkey and pass out beforehand, it'll be waiting for you in the morning.\nHow do you watch it? You go on Netflix if you're already a subscriber and press play — you can do this, you're smart — which can also work when hooked to the TV or Netflix's mobile app. Or, if you're not yet a Netflix user, you can sign up and get the first month free. It's not hard. Seriously, things could be worse: You could be forced to fight other reasonably handsome teenagers in post-apocalyptic Brazil to live in a shiny utopia.\nSource: Netflix US & Canada/YouTube",

      "text": "Netflix 4K Requires Windows 10 and Kaby Lake Processor Netflix 4K Requires Windows 10 and Kaby Lake Processor Posted by Scott Aguirre | Thu, Nov 24, 2016 - 7:22 AM \nNetflix and Microsoft announced PC owners will now be able to stream Netflix in 4K due to the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 DRM (digital rights management). To do so, Netflix 4K Requires Windows 10 and Kaby Lake Processor as well as a 4K display monitor/TV. \n\nIf you have both Windows 10 and a Kaby Lake Processor, next you will need to have Netflix’s Premium subscription plan in order to receive quality in Ultra HD. Both Basic and Standard subscriptions fall short of meeting the requirement to stream in Ultra HD. If you already have a Netflix account, you can easily upgrade your subscription plan for $12 dollars a month. \nBenefits of upgrading to the Netflix premium plan: 1 Free month of subscription HD available Capable of four active viewers per account at once Accessible through laptop, TV, phone, and tablet Unlimited movies and TV shows \nNetflix can be canceled and downgraded at anytime. \nStreaming in 4K also requires a broadband connection capable of 25Mbps or higher. Due to the requirement of having PlayReady 3.0, it is also required to have the Windows 10 Anniversary update installed as well. \n\n\n\nRunning an older operating system unfortunately will not meet the necessary requirement to streame in 4K quality on PC. An Intel Kaby Lake seventh gen processor also is required to allow your hardware to be capable of 10-bit HEVC encoding. The Windows 10 Netflix app available also does not provide enough support to stream in full 4K content. The Microsoft Edge browser will need to be the source to access Netflix. Sorry Google Chrome. \nA more in depth read on the Intel Kaby Lake Processor architecture details can be viewed on a previous post here . \n\n\nOnce you have all you need, be sure to adjust the playback settings to ‘High’ to recieve the best video quality your pc is capable up to 3 GB per hour for HD and 7 GB per hour for Ultra HD",

      "text": "Close Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Official Trailer) Ah, it’s here: the annual four-day weekend that includes a whole lot of family and copious amounts of food. Whether you’re excited to see your relatives or terrified of the polarized political debates that will be hard to stomach—especially this year—some screen time is likely in order. And if you want to avoid spending hours watching professional and/or college football just as badly as you want to hide from discussions with an uncle about Donald Trump, there are plenty of recently added films and shows on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu to keep you occupied and sane.\nLet out some frustration vicariously through Rocky Balboa’s boxing gloves with five Rocky films and Creed ; escape the real world and opt to see it through the lenses of top photographers with Tales by Light ; or spend six glorious hours with old (fictional) friends from Stars Hollow with Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .\nSign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. Your browser does not support iframes.\nHere are some suggestions for streaming this weekend:\nRocky and most of the sequels (Amazon, November 1) There are plenty of Rocky movies, including the original and sequels II through V, now available on Amazon for nearly eight hours of viewing. That should be enough for the duration of even the severest of food comas.\nTales by Light (Netflix, November 11) Exit real life and travel all over the world without leaving your couch to see people, nature and animals from the perspective of top world photographers.\nScott & Bailey : Season 5 (Hulu, November 15) The most recent, and reportedly the last, season of this British detective show has joined the previous four on Hulu. It follows two female detectives, Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) and Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones), who work for the Syndicate Nine Major Incident Team of the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police.\nPatton Oswalt: Tragedy Plus Comedy Equals Time (Hulu and Amazon, November 17) Here’s the first of two standup comedy suggestions for this weekend. Can you really have too much humor two and a half weeks after the presidential election and as you prepare to eat turkey with a side of salty political discourse? (No.)\nCreed (Amazon, November 19) For those who’ve watched all five Rocky films and still want more, there’s Creed , starring Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, a young boxer who seeks advice and training from retired champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Stallone was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his reprisal in the Rocky role, among other nominations and wins for both him and Jordan.\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Netflix, November 25) Duh. Lorelai, Rory and the whole gang are back in this highly anticipated reboot of the Gilmore Girls series, which aired from 2000 to 2007.\nRelated: Why ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ will be bingeworthy\nMichael Che Matters (Netflix, November 25) Ease the political- and familial-tension hangover with a comedy special from Michael Che coming out on Friday. It’s still political and familial and tense, but at least it comes with laughs.\nRead more from Newsweek.com:\n- Netflix: What’s coming and going in November\n- ‘Good Girls Revolt’: The feminist legacy of a Newsweek lawsuit\n- Rocky’s final round\n- Netflix releases first ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ trailer, and it’s gloriously nostalgic\nTry Newsweek: Subscription offers Share Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Like us on Google Plus Follow us on LinkedIn Share with Whatsapp More reddit Pinterest Tumblr Comments",

      "text": "  What Time Does ‘Gilmore Girls’ Start on Netflix? Published Updated 12:34 pm EST, November 24, 2016 1 Comment By Lauren Weigle 5k Share Tweet Follow \nThe revival series Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life is set to be released at 3:00 a.m. Eastern time and midnight Pacific time on Friday, November 25, 2016 (technically, tonight). If that is too late for you to stay awake, you can watch it all at your convenience, just beware of spoilers. Click here to watch the new season once it begins on Netflix. \nNetflix’s official synopsis of the series reads: \nSet nearly a decade after the finale of the original series, this revival follows Lorelai, Rory and Emily Gilmore through four seasons of change. \nOver the course of the mini-series, minus actor Edward Hermann who passed away in 2014, all of the men in Rory Gilmore’s life will return – Logan, Jess and Dean. And, all of the delightfully odd characters from the original television series are back as well. Even actress Melissa McCarthy has come back. \nWhen it comes to the overall storyline, show-runner Amy Sheridan-Pallidino told Entertainment Weekly , that Grandpa Richard Gilmore’s death will carry throughout the series. \nActress Kelly Bishop, who plays Richard’s wife Emily, recalled found memories of having Hermann on set, telling EW : \nIt’s sad without my darling Edward Herrmann. We used to do our crossword puzzle together in the makeup trailer. If we had a short day and were feeling festive or belligerent, we’d go across the street and have a martini together. \nScott Patterson, who plays Luke Danes on the show, added: \n[Herrmann’s death] left a big void, but Amy honored it beautifully. He’s throughout … these stories. It’s a wonderful homage to him as a person and to his character as well. It’s nice to have him around. \nAs for what to expect from the mini-series revival in terms of where the characters are in their lives on the show, Palladino told USA Today : \nIt had been enough time that all the stories seemed clear, where they would be, what they would be grappling with. If we had done it earlier, it might have been too soon. \nActress Lauren Graham also stated: \nIt’s been exactly like the old show and then completely new and different. Just a little grown up … That wonderful, fun language that’s so playful. We get to play a million different little characters within the character. It’s just been an overwhelmingly happy experience. I have been weirdly and inappropriately emotional the whole time. \nSo, now that you know what to expect and what time the show will be released, get ready for a year of the Gilmore Girls . And, though the series is set to be released at 3:00 a.m., Netflix has been known to surprise viewers with slightly early releases. So, you never know if it could come out a couple hours earlier. But, most likely, the show will premiere as scheduled.",

With the premiere of Netflix’s “ Gilmore Girls : A Year In The Life” coming Friday ( read our review here ), the original series is essentially comfort food for the mind, chock-full of intelligence and sharp-tongued wit. \nFor those who have yet to watch the original and need a crash course, here are the best episodes from each season to get you started. \nNote: This is not a favorites list — these are the episodes that best represent the series as a whole. \nSeason 1, Episodes 1 & 2 — “ Pilot”&“The Lorelais’ First Day at Chilton” \nThough technically two episodes, it’s imperative to watch the first two episodes in succession to grasp the show’s true grit. Set in the fictional Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, the series follows single mother, Lorelai, and her 16-year-old daughter, Rory. Though comforting and honest, the series moves at a lightening-fast pace — within the first three minutes of the pilot, the duo manages to reference Macy Gray, Jack Kerouac and RuPaul over coffee. \nSeason 2, Episode 4 — “The Road Trip to Harvard” \nA fan favorite, “The Road Trip To Harvard” offers a rare glimpse at Lorelai’s vulnerable side. After Lorelai cancels her engagement a few days shy of the wedding, the Gilmore duo embark on an impromptu road trip through New England, most notably to Harvard University. Though fans were heartbroken when Lorelai broke it off with the handsomely bookish Max Medina, fans were mostly excited at the prospect of Lorelai finally sealing the deal with rugged diner-owner Luke. \nSeason 3, Episode 22 — “ Those Are Strings, Pinocchio” \nGraduation episodes are generally landmarks in TV series. The third season finale, “Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,” marked the end of an era for both the Gilmores and fans, as Rory graduates from high school as valedictorian and heads to Yale. With fans worried as to how the duo would be affected by Rory leaving home, the episode’s final scene encapsulates their tight-knit relationship thus far. \nSeason 4, Episode 22 — “Raincoats and Recipes” \nThroughout Season 4, fans get their first glimpse of Rory’s rough transition into adulthood, most evident in the season finale “Raincoats and Recipes.” After losing her virginity to her now-married high school sweetheart, the mother-daughter duo’s relationship takes a hit as Lorelai tries to make Rory understand the severity of her actions. \nSeason 5, Episode 7 — “You Jump, I Jump, Jack” \nIn arguably “Girlmore Girls” most creative episode, Rory shadows one of Yale’s most elite and private secret societies for a college newspaper assignment. Not only is the episode sheer fun from the very beginning, but viewers finally see Logan, the spoiled, rich kid sailing his way through Yale, as more than just a brat. Even so, Rory and Logan’s flirtation depends faster than you can say “ In omnia paratus .” \nSeason 6, Episode 9 — “The Prodigal Daughter Returns” \nThe end of Season 5 and first half of Season 6 was a painful time for the Gilmore clan, specifically Rory. After Rory gets arrested for stealing a yacht (yeah…), she drops out of Yale and moves in with her grandparents, infuriating Lorelai. With Lorelai and Rory not speaking for the first half of the season, their reunion in “The Prodigal Daughter Returns” will have you passing the tissues in one of the most tender moments of the series. \nSeason 7, Episode 22 — “ Bon Voyage” \nLet’s be real — Season 7 was a mess. With Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino no longer on board as showrunners and writers, the final season left many fans with a bad taste in their mouth, as nothing ended the way it was supposed to. Regardless, the series finale “Bon Voyage” does offer some closure, most notably Lorelai’s long-awaited reconciliation with Luke. However, you might as well wait for the revival to experience the show’s true ending. \n“ Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life ” premieres Friday, Nov. 25 at 12:01 a.m. on Netflix. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Parker Posey joins Netflix's upcoming 'Lost in Space' reboot UPI News Service, 11/24/2016 \nParker Posey has signed on to star in Netflix's upcoming reboot of the classic sci-fi series, \"Lost in Space.\" \nADVERTISEMENT According to Deadline, Posey will be taking on the role of Dr. Smith, who was originally portrayed by Jonathan Harris in the television series and then by Gary Oldman in the 1998 film adaptation. \nNetflix's take will borrow from the original CBS series, which ran for 83 episodes from 1965 to 1968 and follows the Robinson family, stranded in space light years away from their intended destination. \nNotably, Dr. Smith is responsible for getting the Robinsons and their crew stranded and was presented as a villain early on in the show before being toned down and made into a more light-hearted character. \nPosey joins a cast that includes Molly Parker as Maureen Robinson, Taylor Russell as Judy Robinson and child actor Max Jenkins as Will Robinson. \nThis is the second Netflix project for Posey. She appeared in the streaming network's comedy film \"Mascots\" that premiered on Oct. 13.",

      "text": "Last Call: Titles leaving Netflix in December 2016 by Ryan Painter \nNetflix logo. (MGN) A A \n( KUTV ) It's just about time to say say?nara to a handful of tiles as Netflix cycles into December. Though, to be completely honest, the selection of films leaving the streaming service isn't all that devastating. Nonetheless, here are five films that you might want to consider watching before they disappear. \n50 First Dates \nFor some of us \"50 First Dates\" is a the film where 311 butchered The Cure 's \"Lovesong.\" For others it is the reason we had to suffer through 2014's \" Blended .\" Then there are the people, which there are many, who simply adore this romantic comedy about a woman with short-term memory loss starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore . \nEvent Horizon \nDirector Paul W.S. Anderson might be best known for his \" Resident Evil \" films, but for my money his best movie is still \"Event Horizon.\" The film, which as been accurately compared to Clive Barker 's \" Hellraiser \" if it were set in space, has a fairly notorious backstory in that Anderson was given far less time to shoot and edit the film than typically mandated by the Directors Guild of America. The director's original cut ran 130 minutes, whereas the theatrical release had been trimmed back to 95 minutes. Anderson has acknowledged that his first cut was by no means his final cut, but horror fans have often wondered what the excised footage might have added to a film that is brimming with unfulfilled potential. \nSling Blade \nWhile watching \" Bad Santa 2 \" a few nights ago I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to go back and watch \"Sling Blade\" now that Billy Bob Thornton has become a \"known commodity.\" \"Sling Blade\" is a dark film that deals with themes of abuse and self-sacrifice. it was adapted, directed and stared Thornton as Karl, a man suffering from mental illness who killed his mother and her lover when he was a boy. Released back into the world some 30 or so years later Karl quickly discovers that the world is still a place full of violence and abuse. \nNeil Young: Heart of Gold \nIn 1996 Jonathan Demme released the first of three documentaries that he would direct about legendary musician Neil Young. My personal tastes have always preferred Demme's \" Stop Making Sense ,\" a film about the Talking Heads , but there is a certain sadness and longing in Young's voice that makes it rather difficult to not be moved by his music. This particular documentary follows Young as he prepares to perform at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, \nTop Gun \nDirector Tony Scott 's ridiculously macho \" Top Gun \" was a massive hit during the summer of 1986. Watching it now, it is difficult to believe that the film was made for only $15 million. You couldn't even get Tom Cruise to tap dance for $15 million these days. Still, there is something thrilling about watching Cruise and Val Kilmer egos duke it out in fighter jets. \nHere's a complete list of titles leaving Netflix in December. \nLeaving 12/1/16 ",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nNetflix isn’t only in the business of churning out original content. They’re using the platform to resurrect series from the past, series such as Full House , Voltron , and Gilmore Girls . News about the return of the latter made Stars Hollow citizen wannabes sigh with content. The series stretched over seven seasons and introduced a host of peculiar but delightful personalities, most of whom called the small town of Stars Hollow home. Lorelai Gilmore ( Lauren Graham ) and her daughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) were the pillars holding up the story, but they were supported by memorable family and friends. \nWith Netflix’s revival Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hitting the streaming service this Friday, it’s the ideal time to turn your sights towards Gilmore Girls . However, I realize 153 episodes of anything is a lot to add to your probably already long to-watch list. If you have time for abbreviated viewing but want to experience the breadth of charm, humor, and drama the show offers, I have a quick and dirty guide for you. These 11 episodes capture the heart of the series – I recommend watching them in chronological order: Related Content",
