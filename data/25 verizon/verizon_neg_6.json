      "text": "NBC, Verizon Will Live-Stream Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Updated: November 22, 2016 — 9:00 AM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Brian Steinberg \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Sports fans can live-stream the Super Bowl and the Olympics. Now, aficionados of Macy's annual Thanksgiving Day Parade will have a to get a digital take of the proceedings. \nNBCUniversal and Macy's will make a video feed of the annual spectacle available on Verizon's YouTube page as part of a marketing partnership. The maneuver gives people who want to watch the event an option other than the NBC telecast for the first time since the network began its parade telecasts in 1952, and bring a new-media dimension to the venerable Macy's event, which began snaking through New York City's concrete canyons in 1924. Under the terms of the package, Verizon will stream the parade with five cameras placed along the route capable of beaming 360-degree views to users, and festoon the view with pop-up graphics offering facts about the proceedings. Actors Marlon Wayans and Olivia Culpo will curate the program. \n\"We've never really focused on an alternate viewing experience,\" said Alison Tarrant, executive vice president of client partnerships at NBCUniversal, in an interview. \"This is a big step for this broadcast.\" The live stream will be available on Verizon's YouTube page, http://www.youtube.com/verizon. \nThe new means of watching an old TV institution arrives as Madison Avenue is seeking different ways to partner with the industry overall. While traditional TV commercials thrive, marketers are placing new emphasis on devising content that dovetails with the programming that attracted viewers in the first place, rather than interrupting a show with messages routinely viewed as something of an annoyance. The emerging model is sprouting in various places, as anyone who has seen NBC late-night host Seth Meyers do on-set commercials for Amazon or watched Taco Bell sponsor an ongoing series of vignettes from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" in ad breaks on AMC can tell you. \nRelated If The 30-Second TV Ad Is Dying, TV Networks Are Helping To Kill It \n\"This partnership enables us to create content together that we would not have been able to do on our own,\" said Tarrant. \nBut there are other benefits as well. The YouTube stream might appeal to people on the go for the holiday who must rely on a mobile device to get a view of the annual parade. Or it might serve as a sort of \"second-screen\" enhancer for viewers already at home watching the event through traditional means. \nNBCUniversal will promote the digital stream in live mentions on several of its programs, through social-media posts and with ads that appear on the company's various TV networks. \nFinancial terms of the arrangement could not be learned. Zenith, one of the media-buying units of Publicis Media, helped put the deal together for Verizon.

      "text": "Barclay: Verizon’s Purchases Won’t Grant an Immediate Payday   Alexander Maxham \nVerizon and AT&T have both been looking towards the future lately, which is away from the wireless industry. With the wireless industry becoming more and more competitive, and the smartphone market plateauing, the two companies have been looking at ways to continue to grow and drive in more money. And the next step for them is becoming a media company. AT&T is arguably already a media company, with their own U-verse cable company and then picking up DIRECTV last year. Now they are aiming to pick up Time Warner for $80 million, a deal that has not been approved and President-elect Trump has already said he would block the deal. Verizon on the other hand has been picking up companies like AOL, Vessel and Yahoo to build their media empire. \nBarclays analysts wrote in a research note today that Verizon’s strategy in buying these three companies, appears to be a way for the company to watch consumption trends and change their strategy to fit these trends. This is a fast-moving market, so it’s important to identify trends quickly and move on them. Barclays analysts believe that their strategy is to “address how it believes media consumption will evolve and fit with its broader expectations around network evolution.” Verizon is also likely to “embrace OTT distribution and create a framework in supporting new content options that can possibly rival those provided by cable operators.” \nVerizon isn’t just looking to be a media company though, they are also looking to become the third largest advertiser. Right now, Google and Facebook are the top two advertisers. Which should surprise no one, given their platforms. And with Verizon having both AOL and Yahoo in their pockets, two companies that were and still are, fairly large advertising companies, they can definitely have a run at the number three spot. Barclays notes that Verizon will likely “face tough competition and high execution risk, in the mid-term we believe its strategy can still benefit from a large and growing digital ad market, even if it remains in a distant third position. They continued by saying that this strategy likely won’t bring in a huge pay day for Verizon in the next several years. Post navigation",

      "text": "Google Pixel \nOne of the biggest complaints about Google’s new Pixel smartphones , which have received all-around praise , is that it’s priced too high. Verizon’s throwing that notion out the window with its Black Friday deal , bringing the cost of the phone from $650 to $240. \nThe deal will only be available from November 24 to November 25, and the catch is that you’ll have to commit to buying the device on a 24-month payment plan. Still, you won’t find a deal like this for a while — you can nab the 32GB variant of the Google Pixel or Pixel XL for the low price of $10 a month for 24 months. If you want more storage, the 128GB model of the Pixel or Pixel XL will be available for $15 a month for 24 months, or $360. \nYou’ll still need to purchase the device for the starting price of $650 — the discount will be applied to your account in bill credits over the course of 24 months. Regardless, the Pixel deal is one of the best deals you can get on a flagship smartphone right now. \nVerizon is also offering Google Home, the search giant’s Amazon Echo competitor, for $100. That’s a $30 price cut, but Google , Best Buy, and other retailers are offering the same deal for a limited time as well. \nMore: Google’s Pixel phones are selling exceptionally well at Verizon \nIf you’re not interested in a Pixel, but have been thinking about switching to Verizon, Big Red has some other incentives. You can save $200 on any Android smartphone that costs $400 or more when you switch, or if you add a new line to your existing account. If you’re an existing customer and have an upgrade available, you can save $100 on any Android smartphone that’s $400 or higher. This deal runs from November 24-27. \nIf you want to get your shopping done before the Thanksgiving weekend starts, Verizon has something for you too. If you buy a Pixel, Pixel XL, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge or LG V20, you can get another for 50 percent off. This deal ends at midnight on November 23.

Verizon is a sponsor of NBC’s broadcast of the parade and will also be integrated into the streaming coverage. \n\nThe streaming presentation will be totally separate from the broadcast, using only footage from the six special cameras along the parade route that give viewers a more up-close look at the balloons, floats and bands. \n\nThe coverage will feature a special program hosted by Marlon Wayans and Olivia Culpo, who during the parade will demonstrate the new Google Pixel phone being offered by Verizon.",

      "text": "Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends\nOne of the biggest complaints about Google’s new Pixel smartphones , which have received all-around praise , is that it’s priced too high. Verizon’s throwing that notion out the window with its Black Friday deal , bringing the cost of the phone from $650 to $240.\nThe deal will only be available from November 24 to November 25, and the catch is that you’ll have to commit to buying the device on a 24-month payment plan. Still, you won’t find a deal like this for a while — you can nab the 32GB variant of the Google Pixel or Pixel XL for the low price of $10 a month for 24 months. If you want more storage, the 128GB model of the Pixel or Pixel X L will be available for $15 a month for 24 months, or $360.\nYou’ll still need to purchase the device for the starting price of $650 — the discount will be applied to your account in bill credits over the course of 24 months. Regardless, the Pixel deal is one of the best deals you can get on a flagship smartphone right now.\nVerizon is also offering Google Home , the search giant’s Amazon Echo competitor, for $100. That’s a $30 price cut, but Google , Best Buy, and other retailers are offering the same deal for a limited time as well.\nMore: Google’s Pixel phones are selling exceptionally well at Verizon\nIf you’re not interested in a Pixel, but have been thinking about switching to Verizon, Big Red has some other incentives. You can save $200 on any Android smartphone that costs $400 or more when you switch, or if you add a new line to your existing account. If you’re an existing customer and have an upgrade available, you can save $100 on any Android smartphone that’s $400 or higher. This deal runs from November 24-27.\nIf you want to get your shopping done before the Thanksgiving weekend starts, Verizon has something for you too. If you buy a Pixel, Pixel XL, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge or LG V20, you can get another for 50 percent off. This deal ends at midnight on November 23.\nSee at Verizon\nThe Moto Z is the first non-Google phone to be Daydream-ready Hot potato!

      "text": "google pixel carrier sales xl More Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends\nNo matter how you feel about carrier exclusivity, it’s an arrangement that’s working wonders for two happy campers this holiday season: Google and Verizon. According to a report from market research firm Wave7 Research, the Pixel, Google’s first branded smartphone, is selling exceptionally well at Big Red’s brick-and-mortar stores compared to the other retail channels through which it’s available.\nThe Pixel and Pixel XL are Google’s answer to Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s high-end Galaxy devices. They sport premium hardware, including chipmaker Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 821 processor and up to 128GB of storage. They command premium prices, accordingly: the 5-inch Pixel starts at $650, and the 5.5-inch Pixel starts at $770. And so far, they’ve been a critical success. Reviewers have been particularly impressed by the quality of the Pixels’ cameras and the robustness of Daydream, Google’s virtual reality platform, which the Pixels are the first to support.\nMore: T-Mobile offers up to 50 percent off your pixel purchase, but there’s a catch\nThe Pixel isn’t a Verizon exclusive, of course. In fact, it’s on sale unlocked and off-contract at Google’s online retail outfit, the Google Store, at Google’s Project Fi carrier store, and at nationwide electronics chain Best Buy. But despite the wealth of buying options, Pixel purchasers by and large have picked Verizon as their merchant of choice. Pixel devices claimed more than 7.5 percent of activations at Verizon stores over the past month, reported Wave7, momentum from which the carrier has handily benefited. “Activations at all other carriers stores are in the 0-2 range, so activating the Pixel at AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint is not yet a significant factor,” read the report.\nWave7 credits “aggressive promotions” for the uptick in activations. Google and Verizon spent $15 million and $12 million, respectively, in the period between October 27 and November 2, more or less confirming reports from early October suggesting that the two would spend “hundreds of millions” on advertising in the coming weeks. Google is also expected to buy ads during Thanksgiving football games, which can run into multiple millions of dollars. And Verizon’s vice president of device marketing, Jeff Dietel, told Fortune that the carrier would invest money in TV ads, internet marketing, social media, and other campaigns that’d run through the holiday season.\nSamsung’s Note 7 woes are partially responsible, too. Wave7 reports that the phone’s explosive tendencies and subsequent recall led the Seoul, South Korea-based company’s share of activations to “[decline] significantly” from summer levels across carriers.\nMore: Google may sell as few as three million Pixel phones this year, report predicts\nVerizon’s competitors haven’t taken news of its success lying down. On October 20, T-Mobile began offering a $325 bill credit to new and existing customers who activated the Pixel on the carrier’s unlimited T-Mobile One plan. Subscribers who supply proof of purchase within 30 days receive the discount in the form of a 24-month bill credit.\nStrong Pixel sales are no doubt music to Google’s ears. Earlier this month, analysts at DigiTimes projected the Mountain View, California-company would ship between 3 million and 4 million Pixel phones before the end of 2016. For the sake of comparison, shipments of the iPhone 7 are expected to exceed 60 million over the holiday season.\nIt’s a positive development, too, for HTC, Google’s manufacturing partner. The Taiwain-based company, which jointly led design and manufacture of the Pixel and Pixel XL, had a challenging recent fiscal quarter: profits dipped 78 percent year over year. It’s betting on the Pixel to turn things around — the firm expects as much as 40 to 50 percent of its mobile shipment volume to come from Google’s handsets in the second half of this year.\nHuawei declined to produce Google's Pixel smartphones over branding issue Don’t buy your Google Pixel from Verizon!

      "text": "verizon google pixel black friday phone More Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends\nOne of the biggest complaints about Google’s new Pixel smartphones , which have received all-around praise , is that it’s priced too high. Verizon’s throwing that notion out the window with its Black Friday deal , bringing the cost of the phone from $650 to $240.\nThe deal will only be available from November 24 to November 25, and the catch is that you’ll have to commit to buying the device on a 24-month payment plan. Still, you won’t find a deal like this for a while — you can nab the 32GB variant of the Google Pixel or Pixel XL for the low price of $10 a month for 24 months. If you want more storage, the 128GB model of the Pixel or Pixel X L will be available for $15 a month for 24 months, or $360.\nYou’ll still need to purchase the device for the starting price of $650 — the discount will be applied to your account in bill credits over the course of 24 months. Regardless, the Pixel deal is one of the best deals you can get on a flagship smartphone right now.\nVerizon is also offering Google Home , the search giant’s Amazon Echo competitor, for $100. That’s a $30 price cut, but Google , Best Buy, and other retailers are offering the same deal for a limited time as well.\nMore: Google’s Pixel phones are selling exceptionally well at Verizon\nIf you’re not interested in a Pixel, but have been thinking about switching to Verizon, Big Red has some other incentives. You can save $200 on any Android smartphone that costs $400 or more when you switch, or if you add a new line to your existing account. If you’re an existing customer and have an upgrade available, you can save $100 on any Android smartphone that’s $400 or higher. This deal runs from November 24-27.\nIf you want to get your shopping done before the Thanksgiving weekend starts, Verizon has something for you too. If you buy a Pixel, Pixel XL, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge or LG V20, you can get another for 50 percent off. This deal ends at midnight on November 23.\nSee at Verizon\nThe Moto Z is the first non-Google phone to be Daydream-ready Hot potato!

      "title": "Verizon discounts Pixel to just $10 or $15 per month",
      "text": "If you’re not too busy this Thanksgiving or Black Friday and still want a Pixel, you’ll be fighting doorbusters all the way to the Verizon store as the carrier has recklessly decided to discount the new Google phone.\nIt’s only been out for a month and here we are, talking about a major discount. How big? Get a 32GB Pixel for $10 per month for two years ($240 total) or a 128GB for $15 per month ($320). We’re talking at least a 53 percent cost cut from normal pricing, here.\nFor those who want a concession prize, you can also get $200 off any Android phone priced $400 or higher. You just need to add a line or sign up for a new account at Big Red between November 24 and 27. Even if you just want an upgrade on your own line, you still get $100 off the same lineup.\nPlus, starting tomorrow and going on through the 28th, you can get a Google Home from the carrier for $99.99 before the price jumps to its standard $129.99.\nOf course, whether or not you want to be stuck with Verizon as your carrier of choice is under your discretion.\nThe post Verizon discounts Pixel to just $10 or $15 per month appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "title": "Google’s Pixel phones are selling exceptionally well at Verizon",
      "text": "Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends\nNo matter how you feel about carrier exclusivity, it’s an arrangement that’s working wonders for two happy campers this holiday season: Google and Verizon. According to a report from market research firm Wave7 Research, the Pixel, Google’s first branded smartphone, is selling exceptionally well at Big Red’s brick-and-mortar stores compared to the other retail channels through which it’s available.\nThe Pixel and Pixel XL are Google’s answer to Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s high-end Galaxy devices. They sport premium hardware, including chipmaker Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 821 processor and up to 128GB of storage. They command premium prices, accordingly: the 5-inch Pixel starts at $650, and the 5.5-inch Pixel starts at $770. And so far, they’ve been a critical success. Reviewers have been particularly impressed by the quality of the Pixels’ cameras and the robustness of Daydream, Google’s virtual reality platform, which the Pixels are the first to support.\nMore: T-Mobile offers up to 50 percent off your pixel purchase, but there’s a catch\nThe Pixel isn’t a Verizon exclusive, of course. In fact, it’s on sale unlocked and off-contract at Google’s online retail outfit, the Google Store, at Google’s Project Fi carrier store, and at nationwide electronics chain Best Buy. But despite the wealth of buying options, Pixel purchasers by and large have picked Verizon as their merchant of choice. Pixel devices claimed more than 7.5 percent of activations at Verizon stores over the past month, reported Wave7, momentum from which the carrier has handily benefited. “Activations at all other carriers stores are in the 0-2 range, so activating the Pixel at AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint is not yet a significant factor,” read the report.\nWave7 credits “aggressive promotions” for the uptick in activations. Google and Verizon spent $15 million and $12 million, respectively, in the period between October 27 and November 2, more or less confirming reports from early October suggesting that the two would spend “hundreds of millions” on advertising in the coming weeks. Google is also expected to buy ads during Thanksgiving football games, which can run into multiple millions of dollars. And Verizon’s vice president of device marketing, Jeff Dietel, told Fortune that the carrier would invest money in TV ads, internet marketing, social media, and other campaigns that’d run through the holiday season.\nSamsung’s Note 7 woes are partially responsible, too. Wave7 reports that the phone’s explosive tendencies and subsequent recall led the Seoul, South Korea-based company’s share of activations to “[decline] significantly” from summer levels across carriers.\nMore: Google may sell as few as three million Pixel phones this year, report predicts\nVerizon’s competitors haven’t taken news of its success lying down. On October 20, T-Mobile began offering a $325 bill credit to new and existing customers who activated the Pixel on the carrier’s unlimited T-Mobile One plan. Subscribers who supply proof of purchase within 30 days receive the discount in the form of a 24-month bill credit.\nStrong Pixel sales are no doubt music to Google’s ears. Earlier this month, analysts at DigiTimes projected the Mountain View, California-company would ship between 3 million and 4 million Pixel phones before the end of 2016. For the sake of comparison, shipments of the iPhone 7 are expected to exceed 60 million over the holiday season.\nIt’s a positive development, too, for HTC, Google’s manufacturing partner.

Then you might want to check out this upcoming Black Friday deal from Verizon. \nDetails after the break. \nCome Thursday and Friday (November 25 through November 26), Verizon will let you buy a Pixel with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage for $10 and $15 per month, respectively. Normally for the 32GB model it’s $27.08 per month and then $31.24 per month for the larger 128GB model. \nThe way this will work is that Verizon will credit your account with the amount it takes to bring that monthly price down to $10 or $15, depending on what model you choose. \nUnfortunately, it could take 2-3 bill cycles for Verizon to start applying the credit, so you may be stuck with the full monthly bill for the first couple of months. On the other hand, with this deal, you’d only be paying $410 for the Pixel, whereas prices normally start at $650 for the 32GB model. \nIt’s also worth noting that this does require you to purchase the Pixel on a device payment plan. You’ll also have to see the full 24 month contract through to the end in order to get the full credit. \nNot interested in the Pixel? Verizon is also one of the new retailers carrying Google’s voice-activated speaker, Google Home. For Black Friday, Verizon will be joining a myriad of other retailers by discounting the speaker from it’s original $130 price point to just $100. \nThe Pixel XL isn’t included in this Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday discount.

      "title": "SOVA Introduces Verizon One Talk Unified Communications to Agents, VARs, MSPs",
      "text": "SOVA, a leading Platinum Level Master Agent for Verizon telecom solutions, recently introduced One Talk, Verizon’s 4G LTE-driven unified communications system to agents, VARs and MSPs. Verizon developed One Talk to serve a growing and more sophisticated market for integrated landline and mobile solutions. As a Platinum Level Master Agent, SOVA was one of the Verizon partners participating in the launch of One Talk. Since SOVA only works with Verizon, they are true Verizon experts that offer a level of personalized service difficult to find anywhere else.\n SOVA President Gene Esopi said, “We were honored to be selected for the launch. We have been a trusted Verizon partner with an excellent track record of customer satisfaction for more than 22 years.”\n Mobile workers will account for 75 percent of the U.S. population by the year 2020; there are 39 million employees working in the small to mid-sized business space alone that could use the following primary benefits of One Talk’s single number solution:\nNo Missed Opportunities: Customers can always reach employees. Cost-Effective: One service can power all business phones—both wireless and wireline. Immediate Business Mobility: Employees get all the benefits of a landline on their mobile number. Works with Any Wireless Carrier: Employees can add a One Talk business number directly to their personal smart device (iOS 9.0 or higher and Android 5.0 or higher), regardless of their wireless carrier. Effortless Customization: Every line and feature can be customized via an upgraded native dialer or mobile app (depending on device) or an easy-to-use website. Built-in Business Continuity: One Talk will continue to route customer calls on the Verizon Wireless network during a power outage, a facilities problem or broadband outage.\nWith One Talk, employees can have one number, and that number can be with them all the time—at their desk, when walking around the office, in the car and—for remote workers—at home. They can seamlessly transfer calls across multiple devices including smart phones, tablets, and Verizon One Talk desk phones\n One Talk calls can be initiated through select devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network and/or Wi-Fi. With One Talk, users can place a voice and/or video call on select desk phones, and these features are then supported on many smartphones.\n By installing the One Talk Mobile App, employees can use many of their existing smartphones and tablets (iOS 9.0 and higher and Android 5.0 and higher). They can also choose to use existing mobile or landline numbers as their One Talk number. Number porting is available for most mobile and landline services in the U.S.\n “With Verizon One Talk and SOVA, organizations get the very significant advantages of working with a leading provider of telecom solutions and a top tier telecom Master Agent,” Esopi said. “Our agents, VARs, MSPs and their clients get the benefits of our Verizon expertise, seamless back office support, and impeccable reputation across the telecom industry.”\n He continued, “One Talk is much more than a unified communication solution. It is in a class by itself. Unlike cloud communications solutions, One Talk supports true one-number service; in essence it offers everything that other UC solutions have and much, much more.”\nSome of the features include:\nOne Number Call Move Auto Receptionist Extension Dialing Line Sharing (e.g. boss/admin) 6-Way Conference Mobile Call Management Hunt Group Video Calling\n “What One Talk delivers is an architecture that creates a single solution with some very innovative features,” Esopi said, “For example, with Call Move, you can seamlessly transition from a One Talk desk phone to a mobile device with just a push of one button, and no one will hear any click. It’s a much more professional way to transfer from one device to another.”\n As a valued Verizon Program member since 1994, SOVA has earned Platinum level status; agents benefit from select privileges that many telecom solution providers cannot offer. SOVA has customized programs for telecom agents, VARs, MSPs, and telesales organizations and provides customer solutions in every product category including voice and data, network, cloud, mobility, machine-to-machine, managed internet, VoIP, and global services. SOVA’s award-winning agent program features no quotas, no minimums, no commitments; dedicated pre-sales and post-sales specialists; simplified quoting and ordering; and a state-of-the-art agent portal. SOVA is headquartered in Plains, Pa., with additional locations in Pittston, Pa.; Boston; Denver; and West Palm Beach, Fla.

Eisenach opposes net neutrality rules.\nTrump on Monday named Eisenach as a top advisor on his transition team for telecom issues. At minimum, he'll help staff the agency, and he might well wind up as chairman, analysts say.\n\"Eisenach is a front-runner for the FCC chair,\" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a research report. \"Eisenach will likely craft an FCC makeup that rolls back net neutrality.\"",

      "title": "Verizon Black Friday 2016 Deal Offers Google Pixel For $10 Per Month",
      "text": "Google’s latest flagship smartphone is exclusive to Verizon in the United States and that has done wonders for the carrier’s sales over the past month. Verizon has been spending a lot of money to promote the Pixel as well and now it’s going to be a big draw for customers over the holiday period. The carrier has confirmed that the Verizon Black Friday 2016 deal is going to offer the Google Pixel for as low as $10 per month. Customers who want to take advantage of this offer will first have to purchase the Pixel from Verizon on a device payment plan. They will start seeing a monthly credit in their account after 2-3 bill cycles to account for the discount promised as part of the Verizon Black Friday 2016 deal.\nVerizon is going to spread out the discount over 24 months, it will amount to $409.99 for the regular Pixel handset, but customers do have to keep the line for 24 months if they want to receive the full credit.\nThis effectively means that a 32GB or 128GB Pixel purchased from Verizon during this promotional period is going to cost $10 or $15 per month respectively. Don’t forget to read the fine print carefully before you decide to take Verizon up on this offer. It’s only going to be available for a couple of days so best not to waste any time if you want to spend money on a new Pixel at Verizon.\nFiled in",

      "text": "Ongoing 5G network trials by the likes of Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint has North America set to lead world in initial adoption. As one of the world’s largest telecom equipment vendors, it’s probably of little surprise that Ericsson is boastful on the potential of “5G” technology, with the vendor on board with expectations North America will lead the world in early adoption of the new wireless standard.\nIn a new report , the company predicts North America will lead the world in 5G connections by 2022, with the region accounting for 25% of the forecast 550 million 5G connections worldwide. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the second fastest in terms of 5G subscription growth, accounting for 10% of 5G connections by 2022.\n\nA number of telecom operators across North America are currently trialing early versions of 5G technology in hopes of beginning commercial deployments as early as next year. In the United States, Verizon Wireless, AT&T , T-Mobile US, Sprint and U.S. Cellular have also announced trials of various technology and spectrum bands expected to be included in the eventual 5G standard, with similar announcements coming from Canadian operators Telus and Bell Canada.\n“We are already seeing a great interest among operators in launching prestandard 5G networks,” said Ericsson CSO and CTO Ulf Ewaldsson, adding standardized 5G networks were still tracking for launch in 2020. “5G will accelerate the digital transformation in many industries, enabling new use cases in areas such as ‘internet of things,’ automation, transport and big data.”\nEricsson itself recently released equipment tapping into plans for the so-called 5G “new radio” standard and expected need for expanded multiple-input/multiple-output antenna support. The vendor said its AIR 6468 equipment moves to commercialize NR equipment with massive MIMO support in a package that also supports advanced LTE technology. \nThe strong push by carriers in rolling out network advances is being boosted by the continued spike in mobile data traffic. Ericsson noted data traffic grew 10% sequentially and 50% year-over-year during the third quarter, propelled by video content. The vendor said it expects mobile video traffic to grow by around 50% annually through 2022, accounting for nearly 75% of all mobile data traffic.\n\nIn terms of “connected devices,” Ericsson predicts there will be 29 billion units across the world in 2022, with 18 billion of those related to the booming IoT space.\nBored? Why not follow me on Twitter. \nThe post Ericsson predicts North America to lead initial 5G push appeared first on RCR Wireless News .\n",

      "text": "The steady stream of Black Friday deal announcements continues today with news from Verizon. \nVerizon will offer some notable deals on Black Friday . First up, the 32GB versions of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL will be available for $10 per month after 24 bill credits. With that deal, you’ll end up getting either Pixel for $240 total. \nIf you’d prefer more built-in storage, and you very well might since neither Pixel phone has a microSD slot, Verizon will also offer a deal on the 128GB Pixel and Pixel XL phones. You’ll be able to score either one for $15 per month after 24 bill credits, which works out to a total of $360. \nThese Pixel offers will be available on November 24 and November 25. \nIf you’d prefer a new Android phone not named Pixel, you can get $200 off any Android smartphone priced $400 or higher when you switch to Verizon or add a new line to an existing account. Existing customers can upgrade to a new Android smartphone priced at $400 or more and get $100 off the device. \nBoth of these upgrade offers require a device payment plan and will run from November 24 through November 27. \nFinally, Verizon will sell Google Home for $99.99, just like Google and other retailers . This price will be available from November 23 through November 28. Source:",

      "text": "Verizon now offering Google Home, Daydream, Pixel devices By 0 \nAs Google continues to grow its hardware line, people may start clamoring for the devices not just at Google’s online store but in other retail and online outlets. Verizon is one of their partners in making their products more available, and the carrier has now announced that Google Home will be available in their stores, together with the previously announced Pixel phones, Google Live Cases, and Daydream View. And of course since Black Friday is almost upon us, they’re offering some pretty good deals for consumers. \nIf you didn’t know or you forgot what Google Home is, it is basically the tech giant’s answer to the Amazon Echo. It is a voice-activated speaker that uses the power of Google Assistant to let you play your music, answer your queries, manage everyday tasks like schedules and to-dos, and even control smart devices in your home, like the Nest thermostat or the Phillips Hue bulbs. All you have to do is start it off with OK Google, then give the necessary commands and it will do the rest. \nBoth the Pixel and the Pixel XL are also available through Verizon to take advantage of their 4G LTE network. You will also be able to buy the Google Live Cases for the two smartphones: the Google Trends Live Case which shows you the trending topics from Google Search and the Google Earth Live Case which shows landscape shots from space on your screen. The virtual reality headset and motion controller, the Daydream View, can also be purchased through the carrier’s stores. \nFrom November 23-28, get the Google Home for just $99.99 and its regular price will be at $129.99. For a limited time, you’ll also get 6 months free on YouTube Red. The Pixel will cost just $10 a month through Black Friday or up to $200 off through November 27.",

      "text": "Verizon has announced two of its major Black Friday deals which feature sales on Google’s new entries in the market. Google Home , the search giant’s voice-powered home assistant, is available through Verizon for $99.99, today, November 23, through Monday, November 28. This is a discount from the regular price of $129.99, and Google is still offering six free months of YouTube Red to purchasers of Google Home.\nVerizon is also offering a sale on the Google Pixel . On November 24 and 25, Verizon customers can get a 32GB Pixel or Pixel XL for just $10/month, with the 128GB model priced at $15/month. Additionally, through Sunday, customers can receive $200 off any smartphone priced $400 or higher when adding a line or switching to Verizon. Upgrading Verizon customers can take advantage of a $100 price cut.\nThis is a solid set of deals, notable because of its emphasis on Google products, which don’t often receive major deals. And as far as discounts on the Pixel go, this will likely be the lowest price available this holiday season. If you’ve been thinking about pulling the trigger, now is the time.",

Guess Verizon didn't get the memo, but hopefully they can hear her now. \nOn Monday (November 21), a Twitter user shared a pic Minaj allegedly uploaded showing her phone using Verizon, an apparently scandalous bit of info since she does commercials for T-Mobile . \nVerizon caught wind of this the next day and decided to do what everyone on the internet does best: tweet petty things for attention. \nOf course, Minaj came back at Verizon with the receipts, setting the record straight like the boss she is, and T-Mobile joined the party to back her up. \n2016 is weird, guys.",

      "text": "Verizon Tried To Blast Nicki Minaj, But Ended Up Playing Themselves Did it on 'em. Published 55 minutes ago \nIf it isn’t common knowledge by now, Young Money raptress Nicki Minaj is the last person you would want to strike up controversy with. \nBut that didn’t stop Verizon from having a go at it when they accused the Barb of disloyalty to T-Mobile over a Twitter photo with the Verizon name attached to it. \nThe photo in question is a screenshot of Nicki from a phone that seems to have Verizon wireless as its service provider. As a result, the official Twitter handle of Verizon retweeted the photo, posted by another user, next to a photo of her in the T-Mobile promotional commercial. The caption reads, “Nicki Minaj promotes T-Mobile but uses Verizon.” To top it off, the user behind Verizon’s account threw more shade with a spin on a classic Nicki line, “T-Mo, what’s good?” \nSurely enough, Ms. Minaj clapped back with the quickness, correcting that the photo was a screenshot from her camera man’s phone. Not hers. If this wasn’t a valuable lesson in fact-checking, I don’t know what is. \nBut how’s that for a technical difficulty right? T-Mo, what's good? 😉 https://t.co/mbYqMbExif",

      "text": "U.S. Pixel buyers seem to be picking Verizon as their carrier of choice.\nMuch as everyone (myself included) has bemoaned the \"exclusive\" launch of the Pixel on Verizon , it seems to be a winning strategy in the U.S. for both Google and the carrier. Even though you can buy a Pixel through several different channels unlocked, including Google's own store, research has revealed that the Pixel is selling extremely well at Verizon directly.\n\nNumbers show that Pixels accounted for 7.5% of all phone activations on Verizon since it became available, which is a hefty chunk for a phone that's expensive and the first of its kind from Google. The same research shows that in-store activations of Pixels at T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T stores landed at less than 2% each, which makes sense considering they don't sell the phones directly. Those numbers show a narrow view of the phone's sales overall, of course, as not everyone who buys a Pixel will take it to one of the \"big four\" U.S. carriers.\nWe don't have a true view for how well the Pixels are selling, but Verizon is selling a lot.\nIn order to add some context to those numbers let's look at Verizon's Q3 2016 earnings report , where we can see it activates roughly 8 million phones per quarter. If you assume Verizon activates a similar number in Q4, that'd average out to 600,000 Pixels activated at Verizon in the first three months (of which we've just completed one). A lot of phones, but not world-beating numbers. We would need unlocked sales numbers to make a true assessment of how \"well\" the Pixels are doing.\nYou won't have had to pay too much attention in the past month to notice the aggressive advertising from both Verizon and Google for the Pixels, with TV ads, website ads and strong placement on the Verizon website for the phones. Google and Verizon have spent a combined $27 million on marketing for the Pixels thus far, according to the report.\nAs we kick off the aggressive holiday buying season, Google and Verizon are expected to increase ad spending as well, dropping TV ads during the big Thanksgiving NFL games and running impressive promotions through the end of the year.\nThe true view of how many Pixels Google can sell will come at the point when Verizon's exclusivity comes to an end, and whether or not that also means Google can strike deals with AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint to stock and sell the phones.\nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?

      "title": "Verizon and SOVA Introduce One Talk",
      "text": "Web Editor \nThe mobile workforce is growing, and technology companies need to grow with it if they want to stay relevant. More and more people are starting to work from home or on the go, yet technology doesn’t seem to be keeping pace. Workers on the road need to have the same convenient capabilities as those I the office and, until now, that wasn’t always an easy situation to set up. \nSOVA, a Platinum Level Master Agent for Verizon telecom solutions, has just announced One Talk, Verizon’s 4G LTE-driven unified communications system, for agents, VARs and MSPs. The purpose of One Talk is to integrate mobile and landline solutions, thus making it easier for employees on the go to stay up to date with incoming calls. \nNaturally, this is a great development for mobile workers. This type of employee will account for 75 percent of the U.S. population by 2020, and this group desperately needed some better technology. Right now, there are 39 million employees working in the small to mid-sized business space alone that could directly benefit from One Talk. \nWith OneTalk, employees are able to have one number, wherever they are. So, they can be reached at their desk, walking around the office, in the car, at home, etc. It doesn’t matter where they are or what device they’re using, the single number solution makes them reachable at all times and gets rid of the confusion associated with having multiple numbers and devices. \nThe One Talk single number solution has the potential to be revolutionary for mobile workers because it gets rid of missed opportunities, since customers are always able to reach employees; it’s cost-effective because this one service can power all business phones, both wireless and wireline; and employees have the benefits of landlines on their mobile phones. \nAdditionally, One Talk’s business number is compatible with any wireless carrier, making it possible for workers to add their One Talk business number directly to their personal smartphones. Customization is also easy thanks to an upgraded native dialer or mobile app. Finally, One Talk is great in all situations. Businesses cannot predict when something bad is going to happen, like a power outage or broadband outage. In a scenario like that, One Talk can route customer calls on the Verizon Wireless network. \n“With Verizon One Talk and SOVA, organizations get the very significant advantages of working with a leading provider of telecom solutions and a top tier telecom Master Agent,” SOVA President Gene Esopi said. “Our agents, VARs, MSPs and their clients get the benefits of our Verizon expertise, seamless back office support, and impeccable reputation across the telecom industry.” \nSpecifically, some of these features are one number, call move, auto receptionist, extension dialing, line sharing, six-way conference, mobile call management, hunt group and video calling. Esopi is excited to help bring these great features to people, saying, “What One Talk delivers is an architecture that creates a single solution with some very innovative features…For example, with Call Move, you can seamlessly transition from a One Talk desk phone to a mobile device with just a push of one button, and no one will hear any click. It's a much more professional way to transfer from one device to another.” ",

      "text": "SOVA recently introduced One Talk, Verizon’s 4G LTE-driven unified communications system to agents, VARs and MSPs. Verizon developed One Talk to serve a growing and more sophisticated market for integrated landline and mobile solutions.\nPLAINS, Pa. (PRWEB) November 23, 2016\nSOVA, a leading Platinum Level Master Agent for Verizon telecom solutions, recently introduced One Talk, Verizon’s 4G LTE-driven unified communications system to agents, VARs and MSPs. Verizon developed One Talk to serve a growing and more sophisticated market for integrated landline and mobile solutions.\n As a Platinum Level Master Agent, SOVA was one of the Verizon partners participating in the launch of One Talk. Since SOVA only works with Verizon, they are true Verizon experts that offer a level of personalized service difficult to find anywhere else.\n SOVA President Gene Esopi said, “We were honored to be selected for the launch. We have been a trusted Verizon partner with an excellent track record of customer satisfaction for more than 22 years.”\n Mobile workers will account for 75 percent of the U.S. population by the year 2020; there are 39 million employees working in the small to mid-sized business space alone that could use the following primary benefits of One Talk’s single number solution:\nNo Missed Opportunities: Customers can always reach employees. Cost-Effective: One service can power all business phones—both wireless and wireline. Immediate Business Mobility: Employees get all the benefits of a landline on their mobile number. Works with Any Wireless Carrier: Employees can add a One Talk business number directly to their personal smart device (iOS 9.0 or higher and Android 5.0 or higher), regardless of their wireless carrier. Effortless Customization: Every line and feature can be customized via an upgraded native dialer or mobile app (depending on device) or an easy-to-use website. Built-in Business Continuity: One Talk will continue to route customer calls on the Verizon Wireless network during a power outage, a facilities problem or broadband outage.\nWith One Talk, employees can have one number, and that number can be with them all the time—at their desk, when walking around the office, in the car and—for remote workers—at home. They can seamlessly transfer calls across multiple devices including smart phones, tablets, and Verizon One Talk desk phones\n One Talk calls can be initiated through select devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network and/or Wi-Fi. With One Talk, users can place a voice and/or video call on select desk phones, and these features are then supported on many smartphones.\n By installing the One Talk Mobile App, employees can use many of their existing smartphones and tablets (iOS 9.0 and higher and Android 5.0 and higher). They can also choose to use existing mobile or landline numbers as their One Talk number. Number porting is available for most mobile and landline services in the U.S.\n “With Verizon One Talk and SOVA, organizations get the very significant advantages of working with a leading provider of telecom solutions and a top tier telecom Master Agent,” Esopi said. “Our agents, VARs, MSPs and their clients get the benefits of our Verizon expertise, seamless back office support, and impeccable reputation across the telecom industry.”\n He continued, “One Talk is much more than a unified communication solution. It is in a class by itself. Unlike cloud communications solutions, One Talk supports true one-number service; in essence it offers everything that other UC solutions have and much, much more.”\nSome of the features include:\nOne Number Call Move Auto Receptionist Extension Dialing Line Sharing (e.g. boss/admin) 6-Way Conference Mobile Call Management Hunt Group Video Calling\n “What One Talk delivers is an architecture that creates a single solution with some very innovative features,” Esopi said, “For example, with Call Move, you can seamlessly transition from a One Talk desk phone to a mobile device with just a push of one button, and no one will hear any click. It’s a much more professional way to transfer from one device to another.”\n As a valued Verizon Program member since 1994, SOVA has earned Platinum level status; agents benefit from select privileges that many telecom solution providers cannot offer. SOVA has customized programs for telecom agents, VARs, MSPs, and telesales organizations and provides customer solutions in every product category including voice and data, network, cloud, mobility, machine-to-machine, managed internet, VoIP, and global services. SOVA’s award-winning agent program features no quotas, no minimums, no commitments; dedicated pre-sales and post-sales specialists; simplified quoting and ordering; and a state-of-the-art agent portal.

      "text": "© 2016   Wednesday Odds and Ends Comment \n-Verizon and R/GA want everyone to #BePresent during the holidays by turning their damn phones off! \n-Doner and client Smithfield used Amazon Echo to develop a “Hambulance” that responds to Turkey Day emergencies. Its solution? Serve ham instead! \n-Anonymous Twitter account @slpng_giants aims to shame brands that place ads on sites like Breitbart. \n-In other, far more obnoxious social media news, a “consultancy” called Rapid Reset loves to auto-spam every Twitter user even remotely affiliated with the ad industry while offering a free call to discuss its completely worthless services!! We cannot stress how annoying this practice is. \n-Two creative directors at Brigham Young University’s AdLab created “Brandsgiving,” or 30 days of spec work for 30 different brands. \n– Jessica Alba’s Honest Company is less than honest . \n-Infiniti is looking for new agencies to handle digital, CRM and social media across Western Europe. Don’t worry, CP+B will be fine. \n-Media buyers are growing more wary of “viral publishers” like Elite Daily and Thought Catalog … and not a moment too soon!",

      "text": "· LG G5 · Moto Droid Turbo 2 \nThe phone you get will have to be on Verizon’s monthly device payment program, as the company doesn’t offer two-year contracts anymore. Assuming your trade-in meets the eligibility requirements, the monthly cost of the device you choose will be credited each month. For instance, if you pick the Galaxy S7 Edge, which is $33 per month on Verizon’s device payment, you’ll get a $33 credit each month to make the phone free. Verizon’s fine print points out that this credit will appear within 2-3 billing cycles, and that the phone you’re trading in must be entirely paid off. \nIf you’re switching to Verizon, you’ll receive a $200 prepaid Visa gift card for each line you port in, up to a limit of four. As long as you activate new phones on Verizon’s device payment program, you can potentially get up to $800 in port in bonuses. Keep in mind that it could (and likely will) take up to six weeks after your purchase to receive your gift cards. \nFor existing customers who don’t have a phone to trade in, Verizon is offering the standard Pixel for $10 a month. You’ll actually receive a $432 bill credit when you buy a Pixel, which will be applied to your bill over 24 months. That isn’t a bad deal if you’re in the market for a new phone and want to give Google’s first a try. \nThe Pixel deal is available online tomorrow and in-store on Friday, while the trade in and port in promos will be available through Sunday. Aside from deals on phones, Verizon is also offering 32GB iPad Mini 2s on two-year contracts for $99, and $250 off any iPad with the purchase of an iPhone. Verizon’s own Ellipsis tablets are also on sale, with the Ellipsis 10 going for $49 with a new two-year contract. \nVerizon will also have various discounts available on accessories, with some only available through Friday and others available through Sunday. It sounds like Verizon will have a decent selection of offers for Black Friday, but those who are new to the carrier or have a phone to trade in are going to benefit the most.

      "text": "Verizon offers 'free' iPhone 7 with trade-in as part of Black Friday deals By Wednesday, November 23, 2016, 01:53 pm PT (04:53 pm ET) Looking to match T-Mobile, Verizon on Wednesday announced its own Black Friday deals, including a nearly identical trade-in offer letting people get a \"free\" iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. People have to trade in one of 13 eligible devices, the carrier said . These include the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, the 7/7 Plus, various LG and Samsung phones, and the Moto Droid Turbo 2. The deal begins Thursday online and Friday in stores, and ends on Sunday. Customers have to pay for the new hardware upfront, only getting the whole of the discount over 24 months' worth of credit. Trade-ins also have be in \"good, working and cosmetic condition.\" Separately, switchers to Verizon can get a $200 prepaid Visa card when they buy a smartphone on a payment plan. The offer is valid for up to four lines, with a maximum payout of $800. The carrier's other Apple-related deals are mostly iPad-focused. People can get $250 off an iPad if they buy an iPhone simultaneously, or buy a 32-gigabyte iPad mini 2 for $99 —with a two-year contract. The Mini deal is only valid Thursday and Friday online, and Friday at retail. Through Friday, people will be able to get $50 off Beats urBeats earbuds, which are normally $99.95. Until the end of Sunday, the company is slicing $75 off Beats' Solo3 Wireless headphones, which usually retail for $299.95. Topics:",

      "text": "We're still not sure if Apple's surprise entry into the Black Friday sales season will result in manufacturer discounts to the iPhone 7, but its newest challenger will be part of a major promotion sure to catch the eye of anyone considering a switch.\nSEE ALSO: Google's new update will help you avoid holiday shopping crowds\nVerizon's recently announced Black Friday promotion isn't extensive, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in quality. Google quality, to be specific.\nVerizon will be debuting Google Home at a special price of $99.99 through Nov. 28 — the same discount from $129 Google itself teased earlier in the season. But there's a catch: it appears that the Verizon discount only applies to in-store purchases.\nAlong with the Home, Verizon is promoting its deals on the new Google Pixel smartphone, exerting its power as the exclusive wireless carrier for the handset. Unlike the discount on the Home, however, Verizon is breaking from Google and offering even more savings.\nThe discount is a bit complicated, so we'll break it down in its simplest terms: on Thanksgiving and Black Friday in Verizon Stores shoppers can get a new 32GB Pixel for $10 per month over a 24-month period. If you want more capacity, the 128GB version can be had for $15 per month over the same span of time. Importantly, this discount is only applicable to the standard model and not the XL, which was confirmed to Mashable by Verizon representatives. Other outlets, most notably Android Central , have reported that the discounts extended to all Pixel phones.\nNormally, the 32GB Pixel costs $27.08 per month, with a full a retail price of $649.99. The 128GB version clocks in at $31.24 per month, or $749.99.\nWith the discount, it comes out to $240.00 for the 32GB Pixel and $360.00 for the 128GB version — an incredible deal. But there is some fine print: a $649.99 device payment purchase is required. The promotional $409.99 bill credit will then be applied to the account over the 24-month period, and you're locked in for the full two years or face penalties. It's like any other phone plan — the real deal is in the low monthly payments.\nThe Pixel XL, meanwhile, can be had with no money down — if you're ready to trade in your current device. It's one of eight models that are eligible for a trade-in, along with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the standard Pixel, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Droid Force, Samsung S7 and S7 Edge. The trade-in devices are below:\nImage: verizon/screengrab\nAdditionally, customers can save $200 (with device payment) on any Android smartphone priced $400 or higher when switching to Verizon or adding a line to an existing account from Nov. 24 through Nov. 27. Current customers save $100 (with device payment) on any Android smartphone priced $400 or higher.\nOther discounts are available at Verizon stores and online, covering tablets, speakers and more. Check out the full list below:\nImage: verizon/screengrab\nWith a strong discount on the Pixel, Verizon and Google are looking to raise the stakes of the smartphone game. Even if the XL isn't included in the monthly promotion, this is a tough deal to pass up.\nBONUS: Here is everything you need to know about the new Google Pixel",

The ad - embedded above - taps into the holiday spirit and encourages Verizon customers to \"be present\" this holiday season and connect with family and friends in real life, rather than via digital means. After all, Verizon's network will still be there when you want to use it again. As you can see in the video ad, Verizon is showing off some Google Pixel phones and Google's popular Duo video chatting app . Released earlier this year on Android and iOS, the app is very easy to use, and lets you see the caller before actually answering . As for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, Verizon is the only US carrier that's selling them, though you can buy any of the two devices unlocked and activate them on other carriers. Phones and apps aside, Verizon is right to suggest we should just disconnect from time to time, wouldn't you agree?  ",

      "title": "Verizon, AT&T set to lose 9M customers to cable operators by 2018, New Street says",
      "text": "by Colin Gibbs | Nov 23, 2016 12:04pm \nCable operators will claim 10% of the U.S. wireless market by 2020, New Street Research predicted, stealing most of those customers from the biggest wireless carriers. \nT-Mobile and Sprint have increased their share of the U.S. mobile market in recent quarters, New Street analysts observed in a research note this week, even as growth in the industry has slowed to a crawl. And while the market has seen some aggressive promotions, the smaller operators haven’t had to engage in an all-out price war to poach customers from Verizon and AT&T. \n“These gains happened in the context of a fairly benign competitive environment, which suggests a structural shift,” New Street analysts wrote. “This is worse than we thought for the incumbents and is set to get worse still with cable entering the market in 2017.” \nComcast said recently that it plans to join the wireless market next year, leveraging its network of 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots and a 5-year-old MVNO agreement with Verizon to create a new revenue stream. The cable operator will market mobile services within its existing footprint rather than launching a nationwide offering, bundling wireless with its existing TV, internet and landline phone services. \nMeanwhile, Charter has continued to plot its entry to the U.S. wireless market. In September, the company said it had asked Verizon to activate the MVNO agreement it inherited with the purchase of Time Warner Cable earlier this year, and like Comcast, it plans to couple that deal with its network of Wi-Fi hotspots. \nThe two companies—and perhaps other cable operators—will combine to capture 23 million wireless customers by 2020, New Street said. T-Mobile and Sprint are “relatively insulated” from those newcomers, according to the analysts, and may actually benefit from increased competition. But the nation’s two largest mobile network operators are vulnerable. \n“Comcast will be marketing an offer by the middle of next year; we expect Charter to be a couple of quarters behind,” the analysts wrote. “If carriers lose share proportionately, AT&T and Verizon stand to lose 9 million subs by the end of 2018. T-Mobile and Sprint would do worse than we expect, but perhaps not much worse than consensus expects. The incumbents may bear even more of the losses given their dominance at the high end of the market where cable companies will be focused.” \nThe imminent increase in competition is a major reason why Verizon and AT&T are looking to expand into digital media and advertising. Verizon is working to add Yahoo to a portfolio that includes AOL and its own Go90 video offering, while AT&T hopes to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion after pocketing DirecTV last year.

      "text": "Verizon matched one of T-Mobile’s most popular Black Friday offers, saying customers can get a free iPhone 7 by trading in of a recent smartphone.\nAs with T-Mobile, the free with trade-in offer also applies to other new flagship smartphones . Verizon included the Google Pixel and the Samsung Galaxy S7, among others. Customers must sign up for a 24-month installment plan, with Verizon covering the payment for the phone each month. A customer who stays with Verizon for less than the full two years wouldn’t get full credit for a phone.\nCustomers switching to Verizon from a competitor and who purchase a phone will get a $200 Visa prepaid card for each line they transfer, up to four lines, as well. And Verizon is offering discounts on an array of other accessories. The Black Friday offers will run through the weekend, Verizon said.\nWireless carriers are upping the ante on deals and promotions as the holiday shopping season gets going. The aim is to attract more customers in a market that is no longer expanding like it did a few years ago. Only T-Mobile tmus and Sprint added regular monthly phone customers recently, while Verizon and AT&T saw net losses in that most lucrative subscriber category.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nSprint s has said it will offer Black Friday customers who buy a Galaxy S7 phone a second S7 phone for free or a free Samsung Tab E tablet. The HTC Bolt phone will be half off, and customers who buy an LG V20 will get a free 43-inch LG 4K UHD Smart LED TV.\nBoth Sprint and T-Mobile have also offered discounts on service in addition to hardware promotions.\nAT&T’s deals, which started on Tuesday, include a free iPhone 7, Galaxy S7, LG G5 or LG V20 only for customers of the company’s DirecTV or U-Verse services who switch a line in from a competitor. The carrier is also offering an assortment of discounts and deals on other hardware, such as a $200 Visa gift card with purchase of a Samsung Galaxy S6 phone or an LG G Pad X 10.1 tablet for 99 cents with purchase of a flagship LG phone and a two-year contract.\nTo learn about Verizon’s Yahoo purchase, watch:\nWhen the iPhone 7 was first released, all four carriers offered a free with trade-in offers. T-Mobile and Sprint said the offers greatly increased demand compared to sales of last year’s iPhone 6s. AT&T t and Verizon verizon said their deals only modestly affected demand.\nAnalysts think the promotions may have helped sell more iPhones than expected, but Apple won’t reveal actual iPhone sales until January, when it reports results for the final quarter of the year. Even then, the company never discloses how many iPhones were sold in the U.S.",

      "text": "0 A customer stands outside of a Verizon Wireless store waiting to purchase the new Blackberry Storm phone in New York, November 21, 2008. Reuters/Brendan McDermid \nVerizon has announced an amazing deal on Google Pixel and Pixel XL. It is offering the smartphones for only US$240 (AU$330) on Nov. 24 and 25. Carriers are offering some pretty interesting Black Friday deals but this deal from Verizon is simply unthinkable. It has simply made the day for buyers on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. \nVerizon is offering the 32GB Google Pixel and Pixel XL on these days. The monthly instalment for both the devices for two years are only US$10 (AU$14) per month. In order to get the full bill credit applied monthly, users need to keep their lines active for two years. The 32GB Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices are priced at US$650 (AU$880) and US$770 (AU$1,040), reports Verizon . \nAdded to that, Verizon is also offering the 128GB versions of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL in the same deal with just US$15 (AU$20) monthly pay for two years. Needless to say, it’s an amazing deal being offered by Verizon as the 128GB Google Pixel variant costs US$750 (AU$1,020) and the Pixel XL variant costs US$870 (AU$1,180). \nFor those who cannot make it on these two days and also don’t want the Google Pixel phones, Verizon would be offering a discount of US$200 (AU$270) on any Android smartphone priced at US$400 (AU$540) or above. Buyers need to switch to Verizon and add line to an existing account from Nov. 24-27. Current customers upgrading will get US$100 (AU$135) off, writes Mashable . \nThe Verizon deal on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL is undoubtedly the best deal currently. There is one caveat though. Buyers need to pay the full price of the phones and the buyer will receive the savings in bill credit over the course of your contract. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Verizon Thanksgiving and Black Friday deals.",

      "text": "Print Subscribe \nWhile Facebook, Google, AT&T, and Verizon were still talking about it and putting a plan into action, a Boston-based startup called Starry went ahead and did it. The future of internet access lies in being wireless, and this particular thing is being discussed in the public domain for quite sometime now. But, instead of just doing the talking, Starry decided to jump on the bandwagon and do something concrete. \nStarry, an internet service provider (ISP) that aims to deliver super-fast internet access wirelessly, has finally launched its first closed beta in the Boston area. \nThe startup first announced about its Starry Internet service at the starting of this year, along with its Starry Station intelligent router that lets one easily manage their WiFi connections. Advertisement \nThe Starry Internet service is capable of providing the user with over 700 Mbps download speeds, which is several times faster than the speeds you can probably get from a cable modem. Yes, it is that fast. Until now, consumers would require a fiber connection to get this kind of speeds. \nHowever, don’t get excited so soon. For now, Starry’s beta is only catering to a very small number of testers and won’t be open as a public beta in whole of Boston until early 2017. Starry has planned not to go beyond the city of Boston till late next year. Also, the startup hasn’t yet divulged anything about how much is the service going to actually cost, but they have made the customers quite inquisitive by saying that the price would be much cheaper than what a standard consumer connection costs nowadays. The startup hasn’t yet revealed about when the service will exit its beta testing stage and be available to all. How does Starry work? \nIn order to make the Starry Internet service function effectively, the startup has planned to install Starry Beams transmitters on the top of buildings in Boston’s urban areas. These Beams are then plugged into the fiber internet connections, almost the same way as the wireless carriers transmitters do in order to deliver 4G data to our phones. But, unlike them, Starry Beam makes use of millimeter wave, a different kind of frequency, which is much, much faster than 4G to a receiver in our home. \nThose receivers are being called Starry Points, and one can easily install them in their window, almost the same way we install an air conditioner in our home. The Point then ends up connecting to one’s WiFi router, and they can easily use this high speed internet normally from there. \nLaunched in January this year, Starry intends to usher in a new era of broadband connectivity, by developing and deploying the world’s first active phased array technology for consumer internet communications to launch America’s next nationwide fixed wireless broadband provider. With the backing of premier investors including names like FirstMark Capital, Tiger Global, IAC, KKR, HLVP and Quantum Strategic Partners, the startup strongly believes that the future is wireless and is strongly working in that direction. \nAccording to Starry founder and CEO, Chaitanya “Chet” Kanojia, “The future of connectivity is wireless and having simple, affordable access to an internet connection is imperative for every household and business.” “But, far too many people don’t have a choice in how they access that connection. We set out to build an innovative alternative to wired broadband using millimeter waves and proprietary technology to deliver ultra high speed broadband to your home, wirelessly. With Starry’s technology, we can deploy and scale faster than traditional wired networks – at a fraction of the cost. This is how the networks of the future will be built around the globe.” \n[Top Image- cnet2.cbsistatic.com]",

      "text": "Comment It would be less than a day of waiting now. Verizon \nLooking for some good deals from Verizon this coming Black Friday and Cyber Monday? Well, you will be able to check out the dedicated Black Friday and Cyber Monday pages from Verizon, but right now, they just have a counter on display, letting you know just how many more days, hours, and minutes there are left on the clock. What do we know on paper about Verizon and their Black Friday with Cyber Monday sales so far ? \nIt looks like the newest hardware from Google would take centerstage with Verizon’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday offerings. It does seem to shape up that the Google Home voice assistant device will be seeing a Verizon launch this coming Wednesday. As to the predicted sales figure, your guess is as good as mine. It is said that from today all the way until November 28th, the Google Home voice assistant device can be purchased for $99.99 a pop as part of Verizon’s Black Friday weekend promotion. \nOther than the Google Home voice assistant device that will most likely be able to give the Amazon Echo a decent run for its money, one can also expect to see the recently introduced Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones being made available on offer. Apart from the two Android 7.0 Nougat powered smartphone, we can also look forward to checking out the Google Live Cases and Daydream View, now how about that? \nAs for the Google Pixel smartphone, do hold your horses until this Thursday, November 24th. That is when it is touted that you will be able to bring home the all new Pixel smartphone from Google for as little as $10 each month via Black Friday. Alternatively, you will be able to enjoy up to a $200 discount for a new Google Pixel smartphone all the way through to Sunday, November 27th. In order to qualify for this particular deal, you would need to purchase a Google Pixel smartphone for $649.99 a pop first. There will be a discount of $409.99 to your bill credited across the time span of 24 months. The crediting will kick off some time from 2 to 3 bill cycles, and it will come to an end when the balance is finally paid. Of course, caveats apply, and the line should never be inactive within the 24 month period in order for you to be eligible for the full credit. \nDo take note that Verizon at point of publishing happens to be the sole wireless provider to offer the Google Home voice assistant device, where it carries a recommended retail price of $129.99. For a limited time only, you might as well take advantage of this offer that will net you half a year’s worth of free YouTube Red with each Google Home purchase. The YouTube Red membership will surely let you enjoy an unforgettable YouTube Music experience, where there are way more songs with various versions sans ads, controlled using your voice and your voice alone.

      "title": "Black Friday: Verizon offers free Pixels, Galaxy S7 phones via trade-in program",
      "text": "LG G5 Motorola Moto Droid Turbo 2 \nThe free phone will be on Verizon’s monthly payment contract (no more two-year contracts). Let’s say you pick the Samsung Galaxy S7 , which is $28/month. In order to make the phone free, you’ll be awarded $28 credit each month. Note that the credit will appear within 2-3 billing cycles. Also the device you are trading in needs to me paid off entirely. \nWhat’s more, Verizon is willing to throw n $200 prepaid VISA gift cards for to switch to Big Red and buy a smartphone on device payment. The option is available for up to 4 lines, so you can potentially get up to $800 back. \nBut what if you are loyal Verizon customer, but don’t have a device to trade in? Not to worry, Big Red has something for you too. You can get the Google Pixel for $10 / month. More precisely you’ll be awarded $432 bill credit when you buy the Pixel , which will be stretched out over 24 months. \nThe Pixel promo is available starting today online and Friday in brick and mortar stores. The exchange and switching program will be available until Sunday. \nFor those who are looking for a tablet, Verizon is offering the Ellipsis 10 for $49 on a two year plan or for $99 outright and the Ellipsis 8HD for just $79. \nThe Ellipsis 10 for $49 promo is available Thursday and Friday online and in retail locations on Friday. The latter discounts will run until Sunday. \nLast but not least, Verizon offers a list of accessory discounts . Here are those valid all the way through Sunday: LG Tone Platinum – now $99 (save $100) Harmon Kardon Onxy Bluetooth Speaker – now $99 (save $100) Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones – now $249.99 (save $75) UE MEGABOOM – now $229.99 (save $70) FitBit Charger HR – now $89.99 (save $40) Morphie Powerstation XL – now $34.99 (save $35) NestCam – now $149.99 (save $50) Google Home – now $99 (save $30) FitBit Alta – now $99 + $10 VISA prepaid card via mail-in rabate (save $30) Buy two cases and get one free \nThere’s plenty to choose from at Verizon, so what are you going to pick?",

      "text": "Google and Verizon spent $27 million in a week advertising the Pixel phone View more By Ric Cowley , News Editor \nGoogle and mobile carrier Verizon have spent a combined $27 million advertising the Pixel line of phones since it launched. \nThis is according to a report from Wave7 Research, which studied Pixel phone sales and advertising spend during its first month of launch. \nIt found that 7.5% of all phone activations at Verizon stores over the last month were Pixel phones. The phone was initially only available through Verizon in North America, which explains the uptake. \nBig spend \nAs well as this, Wave7 found that Google had spent $15 million on TV advertising between October 27th and November 2nd. Verizon spent $12 million on its own Pixel-focused TV ads during the same period. \nThe phone is now available from other carriers, though the report notes that these stores are \"not a significant factor\" in the phone's activation rates. \nGoogle's Pixel launched on October 20th in five countries. Prices for the phone begin at $649 for the most basic model.",

      "title": "Verizon offers deep discounts on Pixel phones (as little as $240) and Google Home for Black Friday",
      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nBlack Friday deals have been kind of underwhelming for the last few years, but Verizon seems to be taking full advantage of its \"exclusive\" on the US carrier version of the Pixel phones. For customers who buy a new phone today (Thanksgiving) or tomorrow, the price is reduced to $10 a month for the Pixel and $15 a month for the Pixel XL . That works out to just $239.99 for the Pixel and $359.99 for the Pixel XL (only the 128GB model of the larger phone is being discounted) over the two-year payment period. \nIf you're waiting to hear the catch, here it is: this isn't a cash discount. You're actually paying the full retail price of the phone, less a $409 bill credit that's split up month by month. The discount is only for new customers, and you must remain active on Verizon for the full term of the financing period to qualify for the discount. So anyone hoping to snag a dirt-cheap Pixel on Verizon with an initial signup and then head for a cheaper carrier is out of luck. \nThose looking for any other device get a deal that's much less sweet: $100 off the price of any new Android phone $400 or higher for an upgrade, or $200 off for a new customer or a new line. Both of those offers end on Sunday, November 27th. \nThere's at least one discount to be had if you're not interested in Verizon's cell phone service. Verizon is selling the Google Home assistant speaker , and just like other retailers , it's offering the gadget for $99.99 ($30 off) for the time being. (It's the same Wi-Fi connected device, of course - the Home has no mobile connection.) If you can't find one elsewhere, a Verizon store or the online storefront might be your last chance. Source:",

      "text": "Verizon, Siminn, O2 DE, Telia N, Lycamobile DK, Orange FR Feedback Score 0 HD Voice problems on iPhone 7 I have two iPhones: a 7 and a 7+. Advanced calling is enabled on both lines, and both phones are set for Voice+Data LTE. Here's where the fun begins. Outbound calls FROM these two 7's TO other HD voice compatible devices generally connect in HD. But oddly, sometimes these calls are only HD voice one-way. The party receiving the call from the iPhones will hear HD voice (and see the indicator on-screen), but the iPhone side hears standard audio and sees no HD indicator. Inbound calls TO the iPhones, FROM those other compatible devices, will not connect in HD at all. Experience is the same on Wifi calling. I've removed advanced calling from both lines on the account, re-added it, changed settings on the phone, and even did a factory reset on the 7+. Nothing changes at all, and there is no improvement when connected to a different LTE cellsite. I chatted with Verizon, and they were worthless; I get it, the lack of HD voice should not be a showstopper, but I'm a nerd about wideband audio codecs and if the capability exists I want it to work. Plus I want to be able to use the conferencing capabilities. Is anyone else noting advanced calling anomalies with the 7, or is it just me? I'm beginning to suspect that it must be another software issue. Both 7's are up to date.",

      "text": "0 Galaxy S7 Verizon Deal Honored at Costco?? Verizon is offering the Galaxy S7 for $240 if you pay it out over 24 months (through $18 bill credits for two years). This is a phenomenal deal that I'm ready to grab. But I have a question. Costco is also offering a $200 cash card on the S7 as their Black Friday deal. Does anybody know, if I but the S7 at Costco and have them activate on a new line on Verizon, will I get the $18 bill credits from Verizon on my bills? Or is that deal ONLY good when buying directly from Verizon? If it'll work at Costco, I could essentially get the phone for $98 (the sales tax on the full $672 ($58 in my case) + $10 a month = $240 - $200 Costco cash card). Does anybody here know exactly how this deal works? Thanks! And Happy Thanksgiving.",

      "text": "News \nWhen I get a new speaker in the mail to test, one of my go-to devices for comparison is the UE Boom 2. Looks, features, sound – this speaker checks off all the boxes. Today, it even checks the box next to great price. Right now you can pick one up at Verizon for just $99, which is half the normal retail price and a full $30 less than the discounted price that everyone else is offering, including T-Mobile (better get on that Mr. Legere, can't let big red beat ya, it'll ruin your sterling reputation). \nWhat makes this deal even sweeter is that the discount isn't restricted to just one color combination as is often the case with killer sales. Want it in orange and purple? They've gotcha covered. How about gray and grayer? Those are available too! Want one that tastes like snozzberries? Well, that they don't have, but there is a pink and red one that looks absolutely delicious. \nThe only problem with this deal is that Verizon's price is so much better than everyone else's that their inventory is likely to disappear fast. Head on over to Verizon's site as fast as your overstuffed lil' tummy can take you to grab one before they are gone. Shipping is free and I promise not to tell your friends and family that you bought their Christmas gift from the devil. \nNow, get back to eating pie and watching football, that is, after you place your order.

EST November 24, 2016 (Photo: Wade, Jakie) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nA woman's struggle led her to have a Thanksgiving this year that she didn't get to have last year. \nGabrielle Dawkins introduces us to the person who went the extra mile after responding to a different issue. \nNancy Hogan moved to Macon about 10 years ago. She called Verizon on Sunday for assistance on transferring her contacts over to a new phone. \n“I couldn't believe it. I had prayed and prayed that someone could help us,” said Hogan. Nancy Hogan's prayers were answered, by a stranger, an employee at Verizon named Victoria Hay.“She just called and said that she was very upset. She was just saying that she's bedridden and she can't get around the house,” said Hay. Hogan said that her phone fell into some water and that something was wrong with it. \n“I depend on my phone because I have very bad anxiety, depression, and PTSD,” said Hogan. Because Hogan was unable to leave her house, Hay met her there. It turned out that the phone was not usable, so Hay went to buy her a flip phone.“And that's the phone going off right now. That's someone trying to call me,” Hogan said in excitement. Hogan said that with most of her money going toward bills, she didn't have enough money to get a Thanksgiving dinner with her family, but that's where the gift of giving came into play.“Not only did she bring the phone on Monday, she brought us our entire Thanksgiving dinner, which, to me, could only come from prayer,“ said Hogan. \nShe gave Hogan a hen, some vegetables, and bread to eat this Thanksgiving.

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nIn the market for a new phone? If you're on AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon, Best Buy may have some deals worth looking at. Some of these offers can get a little confusing between all the different carriers and options, so try to hang on. \nFirst up, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge offers. The first one , which includes a free $250 Best Buy gift card, a Gear VR, and $50 in Oculus content, is available to AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon customers who buy and activate an S7 or S7 edge with a monthly installment plan. (The AT&T-exclusive S7 active is also eligible.) That sounds great, until you look at the second one , which comprises of a free $400 Best Buy gift card, the same Gear VR, and the same $50 in Oculus stuff. It's pretty much the same offer, but with an extra $150 for free. However, this superior offer is only available to Verizon customers and new Sprint customers (sorry, AT&T subscribers!). Both offers will expire on November 27th. It's worth noting that you'll only receive the Gear VR after submitting proof of purchase online and waiting a few weeks. \nIf you prefer the removable battery and IR blaster-toting LG G5 over the S7 line, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon customers can get between $100 and $300 in Best Buy gift cards with the purchase and activation of one. Here, AT&T customers are short-changed again; while Sprint and Verizon users get $300 Best Buy gift cards, AT&T people only get $100. It's unclear when this offer will end. \nWant a phone to slice your fruits, vegetables, and meats with instead? The 5.2mm-thin Moto Z Droid may be the phone for you. By you, I mean Verizon customers, as this stunningly slim phone isn't available to purchase at a major discount from any other carrier (yes, I know the unlocked Moto Z exists). From now until November 27th, you can pay just $4.99 a month for 24 months ($119.77 in total) for a phone with a 1440p AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 820, and 4GB of RAM. That price is a whopping $504.23 off the MSRP of $624. Unfortunately, there isn't a similar offer for the superior Z Force. \nShould none of the previous deals have piqued your interest, perhaps this one will: trade any iPhone 6 or 7 variant (except the 6 Plus for some reason), Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy Note 5, LG G5, LG V20, or Droid Turbo in to a Best Buy store (this can't be done online), and get an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Pixel, Pixel XL, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Droid Force, or LG V20 for free with activation via monthly bill credits. That's quite the incentive. Like many of the other ones previously listed, this offer will cease on the 27th. \nKeep in mind that there are even more deals on carrier phones out there this Black Friday; for instance, the Pixel on Verizon is only $9.99 a month, adding up to $240 over 24 months. You can view them in our roundup of Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals . Source:",

AT&T's Black Friday deals includes some big discounts on older flagships, but also an interesting offer on Apple's iPhone 7. The carrier offers customers the possibility to get the iPhone 7 for free with bill credits, but only if they subscribe to both AT&T Next (at least a $50 plan), and DirecTV (at least a $29.99) until November 30. Moreover, customers who wish to buy the iPhone 7 Plus will be able to take advantage of the same offer, but they will be reimbursed $650 during a period of 24 months, or the price of an iPhone 7.

      "text": "Verizon has been selling its network-locked configuration of the successful LG V20 smartphone on a tempting buy-one-get-one-half-off plan for a few weeks now. And T-Mobile’s “kinda crazy” Black Friday deals even include the 5.7-incher as free… under certain conditions.\nMeanwhile, the SIM-free, factory unlocked handheld is still rather expensive stateside, at a recommended retail price of $800, which at least covers a number of gifts through B&H, namely a G Pad 7.0 tablet, Asus ZenPower Pro battery pack, and JBL Synchros Bluetooth on-ear headphones.\nShelling out the extra cash upfront for a carrier-free LG V20 this holiday season may start to seem like a good idea for semi-professional and amateur software developers too after hearing of the latest bootloader unlock program expansion.\nLG officially supports OS tinkering on the V20 now, but unlike the V10, G5 and G4, which are open to otherwise unauthorized ROM modifications on the old continent, the “next-gen” phablet only joins the party for the “US open market.”\nWe’re guessing that means US996 models sold on Amazon, B&H or Newegg as opposed to mobile operators, and of course, you should never rule out an eventual European love-spreading effort.\nIt’s very important to highlight LG V20 phones with unlocked bootloaders will surrender their manufacturer warranty rights, so take a moment and think about the risks before embracing a custom ROM. Remember, this thing already runs Android 7.0 Nougat, and the OEM’s proprietary skin is not that intrusive.\nThe post LG V20 gets official bootloader unlock support ‘for the US open market’ appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",
