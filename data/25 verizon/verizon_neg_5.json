      "title": "Telecom Stock Roundup: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi, Telephone and Data Systems Unit to Buy InterLinx",
      "text": "Last week has been rather dull for the U.S. telecom industry with most of the major stocks losing value. Despite this,telecom companies witnessed a few developments which are worth noting.\nVerizon Communications Inc. ( VZ - Free Report ) announced the acquisition of LQD WiFi LLC -- a New York-based firm specializing on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. With the buyout, Verizon intends to deliver WiFi related public safety features for urban areas and upcoming smart cities.\nMoreover, Telephone and Data Systems Inc.’s ( TDS - Free Report ) subsidiary, TDS Broadband Service LLC, inked a purchase agreement for Internet service provider InterLinx Communications LLC and its unit Tonaquint Networks LLC based in Southern Utah, U.S. The deal will add more than 170 route miles of fiber-optic transport of InterLinx to TDS Broadband Services.\nMeanwhile, U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently fined U.S. telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc. ( T - Free Report ) on anti-competitive grounds. The company’s recent zero-rating practices and its DirecTV service plans seem to suppress competition and thus violate the FCC’s net neutrality rules. The FCC has set a deadline of Nov 21, 2016 for the company within which it has to respond to the allegations.\nNevertheless, it has been quite a busy week for AT&T further witnessed two more important events in the last week. The company has announced that it help wireless customers save data costs by offering them a choice to stream videos at a lower DVD quality (480p). The feature, dubbed as ‘Stream Saver’, is similar to the ones offered by T-Mobile US Inc. ( TMUS - Free Report ) in its ‘Binge On’ services. Also, according to the company’s technology vendor Synacor, AT&T’s project to launch a mobile Internet portal in the fourth quarter of this year has been shelved. The new multi-platform Internet portal launch has likely been shifted to early 2017.\nOn the other hand,leading wireless chipset manufacturer Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM - Free Report ) is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its footprint in the field of communications and technology, especially when 5G is making inroads into the industry. Qualcomm’s subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., announced the launch of its first 5G New Radio (NR) spectrum sharing prototype system and trial platform.\nIn addition, Windstream Holdings, Inc. ( WIN - Free Report ) , a telecommunications and data services firm in the U.S., launched next-generation television service Kinetic in 13 North Carolina communities.\nOn the earnings front, DISH Network Corp. ( DISH - Free Report ) reported disappointing financial results for the third quarter of 2016 with the bottom and the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . \nRead the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Nov 10, 2016 .\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories \n1.    With the purchase of LQD WiFi, Verizon seeks to capture opportunities related to civic innovation and IoT. LQD WiFi presently develops outdoor interactive displays that provide WiFi connectivity along with news, emergency alerts and community information. Additionally, the technology possesses the ability to collect crowd, weather and other data through its sensors in the display. (read more: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi to Expand IoT Portfolio .)\n2.    Telephone & Data Systems is quite optimistic about its merger with InterLinx, which provides wholesale fiber connections to businesses, local Internet service providers and large carriers. Tonaquint Networks provides residential and business services using both fiber-to-the-premises and wireless Internet technologies. Tonaquint Networks also offers broadband wireless services. (read more: Telephone and Data Systems Arm Takes Over InterLinx .)\n3.    The FCC claims that it is not against zero rating practices but is rather looking at the varied programs being offered at different prices. However, the regulatory body believes that AT&T has gone too far with the zero rating of DirecTV Now. Moreover, in the ‘Sponsored Data’ program, DirecTV will be paying to AT&T which implies that one division will be shelling out money to another, which in a way implies that the overall company still ends up paying no money. (read more:  AT&T: FCC Calls DirecTV Now Services Anti-Competitive .)\n4.    The 5G NR spectrum prototype is based on Qualcomm Technologies' sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G NR end-to-end prototypes which include both base station and user equipment. Hence, this new spectrum prototype is an add-on to Qualcomm’s existing 5G NR sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave prototype systems. Qualcomm Technologies’ spectrum sharing test bed is being expanded to support Listen-Before-Talk technology, wideband waveforms with low latency and enhancements in the radio and network protocols. (read more:  Qualcomm Launches 5G NR Spectrum Sharing Prototype System .)\n5.    Quarterly net income of DISH Network came in at $307.42 million or 64 cents per share compared with $196.48 million or 42 cents in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share of 64 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents.Total revenue in the reported quarter was approximately $3,746.1 million, up 0.35% year over year but below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,755 million. (read more:  DISH Network Misses on Earnings and Revenues in Q3 .)\nPrice Performance \nThe following table shows the price movement of the major telecom players over the past week and the last six months.\nCompany \nLast Week \nLast 6 Months \nVZ\n-0.23%\n-5.83%\nT\n-0.99%\n-5.01%\nS\n7.99%\n118.18%\nTMUS\n-0.13%\n29.49%\nVOD\n-4.03%\n-3.07%\nCHL\n-3.74%\n-1.69%\nAMX\n-2.72%\n-8.08%\nCMCSA\n2.90%\n11.65%\nDISH\n-6.62%\n19.85%\nOver the last five trading sessions, share price movement of major telecom stocks was predominantly negative. While DISH (6.62%), Vodafone (4.03%) and China Mobile (3.74%) lost significant value, Sprint (7.99%) gained the most, over the same time frame. However, over the last six months, the price performance of most telecom stocks witnessed a mixed trend. Among the stocks that gained considerably were Sprint (118.18%), T-Mobile US (29.49%), DISH (19.85%) and Comcast (11.65%).\nWhat’s Next in the Telecom Sector? \nWe do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week. Consequently, we expect stocks to trade in line with the broader market movement.\nNow See Our Private Investment Ideas \nWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

      "title": "Verizon Wireless And Sprint Launch Blue Coral Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge: Pricing, Options And Deals",
      "text": "Sprint and Verizon Wireless have officially started selling the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge in Blue Coral. Here's what you need to know regarding pricing, options and promotional offers such as BOGO deals. ( Verizon Wireless ) Advertisement \nThe sleek and stylish Blue Coral Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has finally made its way to two more carriers: Sprint and Verizon Wireless. \nAT&T started taking preorders for the Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge earlier this month, with shipments set to start on Nov. 18. \nNews also surfaced this week that T-Mobile would also start selling the Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge on Nov. 18, and now Sprint and Verizon are joining in the party. What's With The Blue Coral Frenzy? \nThe Blue Coral avatar made its debut on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and was an instant hit. The color option was supposed to be an exclusive for the Note 7, but Samsung pulled the ill-fated device off the market and, after two Galaxy Note 7 recalls , the Blue Coral option made its way to the Galaxy S7 edge. Verizon Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge Price, Options And Deals \nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is available right now in the much-touted Blue Coral color option from Verizon at either $33 per month for 24 months or the full retail price of $792 outright. \nThe timing is also perfect for those looking for a little extra incentive, as the carrier is currently running a BOGO deal with the second phone at half price. Several premium Android smartphones are part of this promotion, including the Galaxy S7 edge. Verizon is also waiving activation fees until Nov. 23, which allows for extra savings of $20. Sprint Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge Pricing And Deals \nSprint has also started selling the Galaxy S7 edge in a Blue Coral avatar, offering the smartphone at $33.13 per month for 24 months or $794.99 outright, at full retail price. \nSprint is also running a Black Friday sale with attractive BOGO deals on a number of smartphones, including the high-end Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Same Power, Different Shade \nOther than the sleek Blue Coral with gold accents coating, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge remains the same smartphone powerhouse as for all color options. As a refresher, the handset rocks a 5.5-inch QHD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) dual-edge curved display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor under the hood, 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal storage capacity expandable up to 256 GB via microSD, a 12-megapixel dual pixel rear camera and a large 3,600 mAh battery, among the highlights. \nThe Galaxy S7 edge is widely considered one of the best Android smartphones currently available on the market and with the Galaxy Note 7 out of the picture, it's among the top choices for smartphone shoppers looking for a new Samsung flagship.

      "text": "Verizon’s Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge is Now Available   Alexander Maxham \nWith the Galaxy Note 7 debacle behind them, at least Samsung is attempting to put it behind them, the company is now releasing a new color of their earlier flagship smartphone from 2016 – the Galaxy S7 Edge . With the Galaxy Note 7 out of the picture, the company has been upping their manufacturing of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, in an effort to minimize their profit loss for the remainder of the year, until the Galaxy S8 launches next Spring. And that includes putting out a brand new color, in Blue Coral which is now available from Verizon. \nNormally, this new color wouldn’t be making it to carriers in the US, but due to the unprecedented circumstances, Samsung needed to do something to raise interest in the Galaxy S7 Edge ahead of the holiday season. The Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge is available from Verizon for the same price as the regular Galaxy S7 Edge – not a surprise, seeing as this is the exact same smartphone, just with a new coat of paint. That means you can pick up the Blue Coral colored Galaxy S7 Edge for just $33/month on Verizon EDGE or $792 outright. If you’re looking to pick up a couple handsets, then you’ll want to know about Verizon’s latest promotion. Which gets you a second device for half off. \nThis promotion allows you to buy a Galaxy S7 Edge (other devices are part of this promotion as well), and get 50% off the second one instantly. Instead of it being monthly bill credits like other carriers are doing, you’ll instantly get the 50% off even if you are buying it on Verizon EDGE. That is definitely a great deal, especially for families that are looking to replace multiple phones on their account. This promotion is only available for a limited time, and Verizon has not stated when that limited time is up. \nFor those that may need a bit of a refresher, seeing as the Galaxy S7 Edge was announced way back in February, the device sports a 5.5-inch curved Quad HD Super AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM. There is also 32GB of storage inside with a micro SD card slot available for expanding storage. Camera-wise, there is a 5-megapixel sensor on the front and a 12-megapixel sensor on the back. All of this is powered by a rather large 3600mAh battery.",

      "text": "Comment Google Pixel is now available on Google Store, Verizon and Bestbuy CNET \nThe Google Pixel and Pixel XL are new smartphones that were recently announced by Google, making a move away from the Nexus brand name. Perhaps it is part of Google’s effort to consolidate everything under one roof. After all, they do have their own Google-branded WiFi router that is already available for pre-order with shipping commencing this December 5, 2016, so what about the two flagship smartphones? The Google Pixel and Pixel and Pixel XL have certainly picked up rave reviews, and you have decided to make the jump to either smartphone by taking advantage of whatever Black Friday deals that are available this year. Let us make the journey together by sifting the chaff from the wheat, and see what Verizon and Best Buy have in store for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. \nGoogle Pixel and Pixel XL deals this Black Friday from Verizon It seems that Verizon will be offering close to a 50% on the Google Pixel smartphone, and this particular discount will also be extended to the flagship Google Pixel XL device. Of course, with Verizon carrying multiple other smartphones under their stable, you can be sure that the like of the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge and Android 7.0 Nougat powered LG V20 will come with fair deals of their own. However, our focus for now would be the Google Pixel and Pixel XL from Verizon. Word on the street has started to trickle in, citing that Verizon introduced a BOGO (Buy One, Get One) 50% off program that will allow their customers to pick up the second Google Pixel handset at half the price. This would be the ideal arrangement if as a couple, the two of you would want to carry the same handset as it makes installation of apps, backups, and other data management a wee bit more uniformed and simpler. \nOf course, those who are interested in Verizon’s offer will first have to purchase the Google Pixel and Pixel XL according to their monthly plan option -- that would amount to $27.08 each month for 24 months, which would mean the device would cost $649.99 eventually for the Pixel, with the Pixel XL attached to a $32.08 monthly bill for 24 months, resulting in a $769.99 sticker price tag. Agree to that, and Verizon would gladly provide the second phone of equal value with 50% off. Other than that, there will be a 20% discount on the Google Pixel device with the SAVE20 discount code. \nNot only that, other parties point to Verizon offering a $300 discount on both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones under the Black Friday 2016 deals department. Let us wait and see, shall we? \nBest Buy Pixel and Pixel XL offers this Black Friday As for retail giant Best Buy, they will be offering a $100 discount for both the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL smartphones. This will fall under their Black Friday 2016 sales campaign, and not only that, each purchase of either the Pixel or Pixel XL will net you a free Google Chromecast as a sweetener. Any takers? ",

The acquisition still needs approval from some state regulators.

According to police, Reynolds told police she was denied the upgrade. \n\"After being asked to leave several times, she eventually left the store and was confronted in the parking lot by officers,\" Epping Police Chief Michael Wallace said. \"She ended up backing up and struck detective Sean Gallagher in the elbow with the side of the truck.\" \nPolice said Reynolds was stopped, resisted arrest and allegedly told officers, \"I hope you die you lying pigs. You guys deserve to be shot. You guys get everything you deserve.\" \nWallace said Reynolds was \"uncooperative\" during the entire encounter. \nReynolds was charged with criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, reckless conduct (deadly weapon), resisting arrest, criminal mischief and second-degree assault. She is currently held at the Rockingham County jail on $25,000 cash bail. \nReynolds was also arrested in Portsmouth and Seabrook earlier this year for alleged assaults, one on a Comcast worker in Portsmouth, the other on a police officer. \nReynolds was arrested Aug. 25 for simple assault and disorderly conduct after allegedly striking a Comcast employee with a plastic document holder during an exchange with the worker at the Comcast office on Greenleaf Avenue, according to Sgt. David Colby. Colby said Reynolds was upset about a bill and “lost her temper.” He said she knocked the desk item at the employee by either throwing it or knocking it with her hand. \nReynolds was arrested in Seabrook Sept. 21 in the parking lot at her address for simple assault on an officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, according to Seabrook police.",

      "title": "Telecom Stock Roundup: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi, Telephone and Data Systems Unit to Buy InterLinx",
      "text": "Telecom Stock Roundup: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi, Telephone and Data Systems Unit to Buy InterLinx November 17, 2016, 07:46:00 PM EDT By Zacks Equity Research,   \nLast week has been rather dull for the U.S. telecom industry with most of the major stocks losing value. Despite this,telecom companies witnessed a few developments which are worth noting. \nVerizon Communications Inc. VZ announced the acquisition of LQD WiFi LLC -- a New York-based firm specializing on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. With the buyout, Verizon intends to deliver WiFi related public safety features for urban areas and upcoming smart cities. \nMoreover, Telephone and Data Systems Inc.'s TDS subsidiary, TDS Broadband Service LLC, inked a purchase agreement for Internet service provider InterLinx Communications LLC and its unit Tonaquint Networks LLC based in Southern Utah, U.S. The deal will add more than 170 route miles of fiber-optic transport of InterLinx to TDS Broadband Services. \nMeanwhile, U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently fined U.S. telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc. T on anti-competitive grounds. The company's recent zero-rating practices and its DirecTV service plans seem to suppress competition and thus violate the FCC's net neutrality rules. The FCC has set a deadline of Nov 21, 2016 for the company within which it has to respond to the allegations. \nNevertheless, it has been quite a busy week for AT&T further witnessed two more important events in the last week. The company has announced that it help wireless customers save data costs by offering them a choice to stream videos at a lower DVD quality (480p). The feature, dubbed as 'Stream Saver', is similar to the ones offered by T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS in its 'Binge On' services. Also, according to the company's technology vendor Synacor, AT&T's project to launch a mobile Internet portal in the fourth quarter of this year has been shelved. The new multi-platform Internet portal launch has likely been shifted to early 2017. \nOn the other hand,leading wireless chipset manufacturer Qualcomm Inc. QCOM is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its footprint in the field of communications and technology, especially when 5G is making inroads into the industry. Qualcomm's subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., announced the launch of its first 5G New Radio (NR) spectrum sharing prototype system and trial platform. \nIn addition, Windstream Holdings, Inc. WIN , a telecommunications and data services firm in the U.S., launched next-generation television service Kinetic in 13 North Carolina communities. \nOn the earnings front, DISH Network Corp. DISH reported disappointing financial results for the third quarter of 2016 with the bottom and the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . \nRead the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Nov 10, 2016 . \nRecap of the Week's Most Important Stories \n1. With the purchase of LQD WiFi, Verizon seeks to capture opportunities related to civic innovation and IoT. LQD WiFi presently develops outdoor interactive displays that provide WiFi connectivity along with news, emergency alerts and community information. Additionally, the technology possesses the ability to collect crowd, weather and other data through its sensors in the display. (read more: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi to Expand IoT Portfolio .) \n2. Telephone & Data Systems is quite optimistic about its merger with InterLinx, which provides wholesale fiber connections to businesses, local Internet service providers and large carriers. Tonaquint Networks provides residential and business services using both fiber-to-the-premises and wireless Internet technologies. Tonaquint Networks also offers broadband wireless services. (read more: Telephone and Data Systems Arm Takes Over InterLinx .) \n3. The FCC claims that it is not against zero rating practices but is rather looking at the varied programs being offered at different prices. However, the regulatory body believes that AT&T has gone too far with the zero rating of DirecTV Now. Moreover, in the 'Sponsored Data' program, DirecTV will be paying to AT&T which implies that one division will be shelling out money to another, which in a way implies that the overall company still ends up paying no money. (read more: AT&T: FCC Calls DirecTV Now Services Anti-Competitive .) \n4. The 5G NR spectrum prototype is based on Qualcomm Technologies' sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G NR end-to-end prototypes which include both base station and user equipment. Hence, this new spectrum prototype is an add-on to Qualcomm's existing 5G NR sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave prototype systems. Qualcomm Technologies' spectrum sharing test bed is being expanded to support Listen-Before-Talk technology, wideband waveforms with low latency and enhancements in the radio and network protocols. (read more: Qualcomm Launches 5G NR Spectrum Sharing Prototype System .) \n5. Quarterly net income of DISH Network came in at $307.42 million or 64 cents per share compared with $196.48 million or 42 cents in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share of 64 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents.Total revenue in the reported quarter was approximately $3,746.1 million, up 0.35% year over year but below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,755 million.

      "text": "Can you remember the last time a 4G LTE-enabled Windows tablet was sold directly by Verizon or, for that matter, any of the other three major US mobile operators? The Nokia, yes, Nokia Lumia 2520 perhaps? No, we got it, it was probably the non-Pro Surface 3 .\nThe point is, it’s been a while, and aside from the just-released HP Elite x2, Big Red exclusively carries Android and iOS tabs at the moment. Not to be confused with the 6-inch Elite x3 phablet , the x2 1012 G1 costs $900 on-contract or $1,000 full retail starting today, LTE connectivity included.\n“Strikingly thin and powerful”, the 2-in-1 12-incher comes with a built-in kickstand, detachable travel keyboard and HP Active Pen stylus as standard, very clearly competing against “sister” Windows 10 Pro hybrid Surface Pro 4 .\nOnly Microsoft’s entry-level configuration, unfortunately, as there’s no way to upgrade the Intel Core m3 processor or 128GB SSD, let alone the 4GB RAM. On the bright side, Verizon’s HP Elite x2, like Wi-Fi-limited SKUs available elsewhere, touts unrivaled “enterprise-class” security, MIL-STD-810G-certified robustness, as well as premium Bang & Olufsen sound powered by dual stereo speakers and a dual microphone array.\nAll in all, business convertible tablet/laptop users should be satisfied with what they’re getting here. Everyday consumers, not so much.\nThe post 2-in-1 HP Elite x2 Windows 10 tablet launches on Verizon out of the blue appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Follow \nLast week has been rather dull for the U.S. telecom industry with most of the major stocks losing value. Despite this,telecom companies witnessed a few developments which are worth noting. \nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) announced the acquisition of LQD WiFi LLC -- a New York-based firm specializing on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. With the buyout, Verizon intends to deliver WiFi related public safety features for urban areas and upcoming smart cities. \nMoreover, Telephone and Data Systems Inc.’s (NYSE: T ) subsidiary, TDS Broadband Service LLC, inked a purchase agreement for Internet service provider InterLinx Communications LLC and its unit Tonaquint Networks LLC based in Southern Utah, U.S. The deal will add more than 170 route miles of fiber-optic transport of InterLinx to TDS Broadband Services. \nMeanwhile, U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently fined U.S. telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) on anti-competitive grounds. The company’s recent zero-rating practices and its DirecTV service plans seem to suppress competition and thus violate the FCC’s net neutrality rules. The FCC has set a deadline of Nov 21, 2016 for the company within which it has to respond to the allegations. \nNevertheless, it has been quite a busy week for AT&T further witnessed two more important events in the last week. The company has announced that it help wireless customers save data costs by offering them a choice to stream videos at a lower DVD quality (480p). The feature, dubbed as ‘Stream Saver’, is similar to the ones offered by T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE: T ) in its ‘Binge On’ services. Also, according to the company’s technology vendor Synacor, AT&T’s project to launch a mobile Internet portal in the fourth quarter of this year has been shelved. The new multi-platform Internet portal launch has likely been shifted to early 2017. \nOn the other hand,leading wireless chipset manufacturer Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its footprint in the field of communications and technology, especially when 5G is making inroads into the industry. Qualcomm’s subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., announced the launch of its first 5G New Radio (NR) spectrum sharing prototype system and trial platform. \nIn addition, Windstream Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: WIN ) , a telecommunications and data services firm in the U.S., launched next-generation television service Kinetic in 13 North Carolina communities. \nOn the earnings front, DISH Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) reported disappointing financial results for the third quarter of 2016 with the bottom and the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . \nRead the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Nov 10, 2016 . \nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories \n1. With the purchase of LQD WiFi, Verizon seeks to capture opportunities related to civic innovation and IoT. LQD WiFi presently develops outdoor interactive displays that provide WiFi connectivity along with news, emergency alerts and community information. Additionally, the technology possesses the ability to collect crowd, weather and other data through its sensors in the display. (read more: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi to Expand IoT Portfolio .) \n2. Telephone & Data Systems is quite optimistic about its merger with InterLinx, which provides wholesale fiber connections to businesses, local Internet service providers and large carriers. Tonaquint Networks provides residential and business services using both fiber-to-the-premises and wireless Internet technologies. Tonaquint Networks also offers broadband wireless services. (read more: Telephone and Data Systems Arm Takes Over InterLinx .) \n3. The FCC claims that it is not against zero rating practices but is rather looking at the varied programs being offered at different prices. However, the regulatory body believes that AT&T has gone too far with the zero rating of DirecTV Now. Moreover, in the ‘Sponsored Data’ program, DirecTV will be paying to AT&T which implies that one division will be shelling out money to another, which in a way implies that the overall company still ends up paying no money. (read more: AT&T: FCC Calls DirecTV Now Services Anti-Competitive .) \n4. The 5G NR spectrum prototype is based on Qualcomm Technologies' sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G NR end-to-end prototypes which include both base station and user equipment. Hence, this new spectrum prototype is an add-on to Qualcomm’s existing 5G NR sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave prototype systems. Qualcomm Technologies’ spectrum sharing test bed is being expanded to support Listen-Before-Talk technology, wideband waveforms with low latency and enhancements in the radio and network protocols. (read more: Qualcomm Launches 5G NR Spectrum Sharing Prototype System .) \n5. Quarterly net income of DISH Network came in at $307.42 million or 64 cents per share compared with $196.48 million or 42 cents in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share of 64 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents.Total revenue in the reported quarter was approximately $3,746.1 million, up 0.35% year over year but below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,755 million. (read more: DISH Network Misses on Earnings and Revenues in Q3 .) \nPrice Performance \nThe following table shows the price movement of the major telecom players over the past week and the last six months. \nCompany ",

      "text": "Retirement: One Dividend At A Time Summary \nThe price of sheep rises as uncertainty over the election outcome causes a lot of investors to want to count them at night. \nTransition uncertainties are causing a continuing loss of ZZZs. \nInterest rate indecision is causing income investors to lose more ZZZs at night, or is it? I Could Use More ZZZs After All The Stress: Verizon's 2.3% Raise Helps Me Get My V s At Night Subscribers to \" Retirement: One Dividend At A Time \" get an early look at this material and receive instant text message trade alerts which often produce lower entry price points and higher yield and income. Okay. It's been decided. The country has elected a new president. That's one uncertainty out of the way and the market has been celebrating this resolution by rising every day since the election concluded, to new highs. Now it seems 19,000 on the Dow is within hailing distance. I discussed in an earlier article, \"The Market Dies By Uncertainty and Thrives on Certainty\" , how uncertainty plagues the markets and hinders them from pushing higher, even when economic news points to an improving economy. At the conclusion of the presidential election, I wrote, \"Trump Shock And Ahhh…The World Is Not Coming To An End\" to expound further on these concepts. It created quite a lively discussion, amounting to over 300 comments as of this writing. Well, now it seems we've traded one uncertainty for another set. Because Mr. Trump's opponent won the popular vote, a high level of tension has spilled onto the streets with nightly demonstrations breaking out all over the country. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton are concerned about many statements made by Mr. Trump and feel threatened by policies he may implement. In addition, several appointments he's made have caused more worry. One uncertainty has been traded for another, and this may weigh on the markets going forward. Uncertainty #2 The continuing battle over interest rates, and whether or not they should be raised at next month's FOMC meeting, is another cause for concern, especially for investors in interest-sensitive equities. Improving economic growth measures are giving rate hawks further ammunition to finally pull the trigger. Retail sales came in strong on Tuesday, and GDP growth is being projected at 3.3% for the fourth quarter. No matter that the stronger case for raising rates rests on an improving economy, which will be good for all companies. The reflexive response has continued to move investors from high-yield, dividend-producing stocks like the telecoms, to growth stocks where investors believe an expanding economy will give them more bang for their buck under the new president. The recent move on the 10-year treasury, from 1.9% to a recent 2.35% in a short period of time, really spooked the market into believing we've finally begun a march on the path of rising rates. Telecoms Fall on Rate Fears and Election Jitters Click to enlarge Table created by the author As you can see from the above table, in the two-month lead up to the election, as anxieties and tension continually built and uncertainties remained unresolved, the telecommunications companies, viewed as capital-intensive and reliant on large amounts of debt to fund their operations, all suffered substantial price damage. From AT&T (NYSE: T ) losing 12.45% to CenturyLink's (NYSE: CTL ) loss of 14.40% in just two months' time. From 52-week highs, the price damage has been that much more substantial. Here, the decreases ranged from 17.68% for T, to 18.91% for Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), to a 27.32% loss for CenturyLink. One has already entered its own bear market, while the other two are hovering near bears of their own. Strategy Session: 2.3% or 5%, or both? Traders are ecstatic if they make 2.3% on a position. They'll sell, take their profit and try to do it again. The trouble is, it's mighty hard to do that on a consistent basis. Sometimes, capital gain is here today and gone tomorrow. It's not so reliable. Even if they get one part of the leg correct and garner capital gains on paper, most investors never know when to sell and book their profit in order to convert it to a realized capital gain. What if you discovered a company that would pay you 5% on a consistent basis? What if they raised the payout every year by 2.3%? Even better, what if the pace of dividend increases resumed its past five-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 3.07%? Would you be interested to find more of a sure thing, more reliable than the ephemeral, one-off capital gain? Would you be surprised to learn some companies have been doing just that for over 30 years? Verizon is one of those companies. Verizon Communications Inc., through its subsidiaries, provides communications, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental agencies worldwide. Its Wireless segment offers wireless voice and data services; messaging services; wireless Internet access services on notebook computers and tablets; multimedia access services and business-focused services. As of December 31, 2015, it had 112.1 million retail connections. The company's Wireline segment provides high-speed Internet, FiOS Internet, and FiOS video services; voice services, such as local exchange, regional and long distance calling, and voice messaging services, as well as VoIP services and business communications services. The company was formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation and changed its name to Verizon Communications Inc. in June 2000. Courtesy Yahoo Finance Click to enlarge From the third quarter 2016 Verizon presentation Smartphone penetration rose from 82% a year ago to 86%. In the third quarter of 2016, the company added 1.7 million 4G LTE devices, resulting in a 13% year-over-year increase. In this same quarter, 4G network usage increased around 45% Y/Y. Increased penetration plus increased use will lead to increased revenues. Click to enlarge From the third quarter 2016 Verizon presentation FiOS, which is Verizon's service that provides phone, T.V. and internet via light fiber, is driving consumer growth for the company. The company constantly runs promotions with varying discounts to sign consumers up for their triple play bundle. FiOS consumer revenue grew 4.2% year over year in the third quarter, 2016. Internet subscribers grew by 90,000 with a 40.4% penetration. Video subscribers grew by 36,000 in the quarter with a 34.5% penetration. Price-Focused Investors Perceive Damage Price-focused investors only see the damage to stock price value demonstrated in the table above and in this chart: VZ price Click to enlarge Dividend Income Investors Perceive Opportunity and Value The value, income-focused investor sees an entirely different picture. He clearly perceives that as the price of the stock compresses (blue line), the yield rises (orange line), from about 4.2% two months ago, to almost 5% today. This 19% increase in yield is the true value that is sought by income investors, from high-quality companies like Verizon, with a history of constantly increasing the dividend over a period of 30 years. Here is where income investors perceive real and extraordinary value. Whenever the price falls, the yield and income that the investor derives from the investment clearly rise. Verizon Yield Rises While Price Falls Click to enlarge Verizon Dividend Rises, Regardless of Price, for 30 years Click to enlarge In the above chart we see a longer term perspective on this telecom's earnings and dividend-paying power. Dividends come from strong earning power and this powerhouse of telecom delivers through all economic cycles. Notice how, regardless of all the ups and down in the price, the trend line for dividends (the orange line, highlighted by the red line above it), is always moving upwards. The drop of the line in 2000 was not a dividend cut. It was an extra dividend of $.042 paid in July of 2000, in addition to the regular dividend of $.346 paid three days before that, on July 3rd, 2000. From the chart below, it can be seen that all the while that Verizon's dividend is rising, the yield percentage fluctuates. For most of those 30 years, the yield inhabits the 3 ½% to 4 ½% zone. Only briefly in 2011 did the yield breach the 7% zone, only to fall precipitously to 4% thereafter. Verizon Yield, Compared to the Dividend Click to enlarge At a current annual payout of $2.31, the yield, based on Monday's close at $46.18, is right at the sweet spot of an even 5.00%. If we can grab it around $45.25, we'll secure an even better 5.1% reliable and growing dividend. High-yielding dividend stocks are perceived to be a proxy for the bond market. When rates go higher, bond prices contract. So too, with dividend stocks. If bond rates trend higher, they are perceived to be more attractive by equity investors who sell their holdings to invest proceeds in the more attractive, higher-yielding bonds. This is the cycle that feeds into lower stock prices. Along with the continuing weakness in the bond market, especially leading up to the December 14 FOMC meeting, we may find even greater value at the targeted price point of $45.25, which would hand us a more than generous yield of 5.1%.In addition, the lower price at $45.25 per share will give us a greater margin of error on the downside added to the cushioning we'll receive from the enhanced dividend. How Long Till Verizon's Dividends Pay Me Back My Investment? Have you ever wondered how long it will take your company's dividends to pay you back your original investment? I was interested in finding this out as it applies to a prospective investment in Verizon. The Dividend Return on Investment Real Time Tracker enables me to quickly discover how long each of my prospective investments, or current investments, will take to return 100% of the original company investment amount through dividends alone. It also helps to compare different stock investments to determine which would be the most efficient use of capital to obtain quicker payback of the original investment amount. Why 100% Is Return on Investment Important To Understand? An integral part of buying a business or piece of property is determining how long the payout will take to break even on your investment. Whether it's an investment in a laundromat or an income-producing rental building, the prospective owner needs to know how long it will take till the income produced will pay him back the total amount of his investment. If choosing between two or more investments, the smart investor wants to know which will be most efficient and have the faster payback, all else being equal. Investing in the stock of a company such as Verizon should be looked at in the same way. After all, the buyer of a share of stock is an owner and is entitled to his share of income from the business, paid out as a dividend. Incorporating Return on Investment , or ROI, should become an important part of the investor's bag of tricks as he performs his due diligence on prospective companies to add to a dividend portfolio. Click to enlarge Income investors understand that the volatility of the stock market makes it next to impossible to predict any semblance of return on investment based on stock price. Those prices are influenced by too many variables that are not within the control of the investor and can cause prices to rise and fall with no rhyme or reason. Most investors would agree that when a stock rises or falls 10% on any given day, with no particular catalyst, that the intrinsic or liquidation value of the company could not have changed that much in one trading day. However, if we choose investments in companies with long and reliable records of paying an increasing dividend stream, we have entered into a more predictable space and one where future dividend streams can be inferred from past performance. This new Dividend ROI tracker performs that function for us automatically with just a few inputs required. Because it incorporates historical compound annual growth rates, it becomes a living, breathing tool that reliably predicts future income streams and dividend accumulations, as long as the company at issue continues its future payouts along the lines of past payouts. As shown above, I entered the tickers for both Verizon and AT&T to do a yearly comparison of annual income, starting each investment with a similar dollar amount. After entering the company tickers and number of shares held, or prospective amount of shares to be bought, and the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) the tracker automatically shows me: 1. The current stock price all day long in real time. 2. The current dividend and change when it increases or decreases. 3. The current dividend yield and will change in real time with the change in stock price or dividend amount. 4. The current total dollar amount of the investment. 5. The current annual income on our total shares. 6. This year's annual income. 7. The projected annual, accumulated dividend income over the next 30 years. 8. No math skills are required. All of the embedded algorithms do all the work for us. Projecting income for several years with the Dividend ROI Tracker Click to enlarge When we scroll to the right, the accumulated dividend totals for both AT&T and Verizon are clearly displayed. Now, it is simply a matter of scrolling until we see at what point our total accumulated dividends match our initial investment in the company. Once this point has been reached, we've attained a 100% return on our investment on dividends alone from Verizon. With this goal accomplished, why stop there? Scrolling all the way to the right, we can see yearly what our Verizon dividends will accumulate to as far as 30 years out. Projecting Dividend Income, 30 years out Click to enlarge Caveat It should be noted that future changes to Verizon's dividend, either higher or lower than historical CAGRs indicate, will have an impact on the projections made by the tracker. When we insert a changed, future CAGR, it will be automatically reflected in all future dividend accumulation projections in the tracker. T and VZ Income Comparison As noted, we can also use the tool to compare two different companies with different dividend amounts, yields and CAGR. This can help us to choose the more efficient use of our capital to attain a quicker ROI. Click to enlarge In the example shown above, AT&T is paying a higher current yield than Verizon, its rival in the telecommunications space. To do a comparison of these two companies, we've used the tracker to automatically determine the correct number of shares to buy in VZ in order to compare two equal dollar investment amounts. It is clear that because T pays a higher yield, the income derived on this position is higher for several years as compared to the income received from our VZ investment. Take a look at the CAGR for each stock over the past five years. Notice that Verizon has been growing its dividend by 3.07%, compounded annually, while AT&T has been growing it at the rate of just 2.22%. Dividend CAGR Click to enlarge As we scroll to the right, we notice that by the 12th year, the accumulated dividends obtained from our investment in Verizon has not only caught up to, but has surpassed those dividends earned on T to that point. Year 12 Income Comparison Year 14, VZ reaches 100% return on dividends alone VZ , if it keeps up its record of growing the dividend at its recent rate, will pay the investor back 100% of his investment by year 14. T , by comparison, takes a bit longer, to year 15 to accomplish the same goal. Year 15, T returns 100% based on dividends alone Dividend ROI, 30 years out on AT&T and Verizon Click to enlarge Here, by year 30, it becomes readily apparent that the investor in VZ has accumulated $3,672.91 more dividends, $25,662 in total , than the investor in T who accumulated just $21,989 over the same time frame. This represents 17% more income for Verizon investors over this time period. This ROI tool can help us to choose more of our investments wisely, with an eye towards higher total payouts and faster returns on our investments. Who doesn't enjoy playing on the house's money? This tool reveals when that day will arrive. The simple interface of this digital tool makes it easy for me to arrive at the answer: How long until the dividends from Verizon pay my original investment back? Disclaimer: It should be noted that past performance of a company's dividend payout record cannot necessarily be counted on for future performance, nor can it be guaranteed in any way. However, we can increase our chances of success by focusing our efforts on choosing companies with long, reliable records of growing their payouts to shareholders. If dividends increase higher and at a faster rate than history suggests, the investor will reach 100% ROI from dividends that much faster. Should dividend increases in the future progress at a lower and slower rate, 100% return on investment will take that much longer to achieve. Any dividend decrease or elimination will necessarily slow down this progress considerably.

      "text": "1 x USB 3.1 Type C with Thunderbolt support 1 x USB 3.0 Type A Bang & Olufsen dual stereo speakers and dual microphone array 40Whr Li-ion polymer battery Windows 10 Pro \nThe Elite x2 tablet has also passed MIL-STD-810G testing, which Verizon says means \"you don't need to worry about drops or spills\". However, it also notes that \"damage under the MIL STD test conditions or any accidental damage requires an optional HP Accidental Damage Protection Care Pack.\" \nVerizon has priced the Elite x2 at $899.99 on a two-year contract, or $999.99 without a contract. \nThat might sound like a lot of money, but it appears pretty competitive when compared to Microsoft's entry-level Surface Pro 4. Indeed, the Elite x2 has a lot in common with that device, from the detachable keyboard and retractable kickstand, to the stylus and overall size. But the Elite x2 might just have the upper hand over its Microsoft rival, on paper at least. \nThe most affordable Surface Pro 4 with Core m3 processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD is priced at $899 - but while the Microsoft tablet also comes with a pen, you'll have to pay an additional $129.99 if you want a Type Cover keyboard . The Pro 4 doesn't have the Elite x2's MIL-STD-810G rating either, nor does it offer any option for 4G LTE connectivity, although it does have a higher-resolution display than the HP tablet.",

      "text": "Verizon Opens Pre-Orders for Mophie’s Moto Z Battery Mod November 18, 2016 - Written By Mihai Matei \nThe latest Motorola smartphone series dubbed Moto Z was introduced by Lenovo earlier this summer as a response to the concept of modular smartphones. Moto Z devices can be paired with magnetic back covers that snap into place to expand the handsets’ functionality, and the company promotes its own modules while allowing third party manufacturers to create their own. Mophie counts among the third-party brands to hop on board with Motorola’s vision, and Verizon – being one of the US carriers to offer the Moto Z series in the country under the “Droid” sub-brand – has now started offering the Mophie Battery Mod on pre-order terms for the price of $79.99. \nAs the name suggests, the Mophie Battery Mod is a so-called “juice pack” or battery bank designed to breathe more life into compatible Motorola smartphones. As with other Moto Mods, Mophie’s battery bank snaps on the back of Moto devices using integrated magnets, and specifically the module is compatible with the Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, and Moto Z Play Droid with Moto Mods platform 1.0 or later. The module contains a 3,000 mAh battery said to provide “more than 60 percent extra battery” and is equipped with a USB-C port to facilitate 15W fast charging. The battery pack also carries an LED power indicator below the “mophie” logo, offering information regarding battery levels and charge status. Given the battery bank’s capacity, it’s also worth noting that the Moto Mod in question carries more juice than the stock / unmodded Motorola Moto Z Droid, which relies on a 2,600 mAh battery. In contrast, the Moto Z Force Droid and Moto Z Play Droid carry a 3,500 mAh and 3,510 mAh battery, respectively. \nOverall, the Mophie Battery Mod juice pack measures 153 x 73 x 8.8 millimeters and weighs 109 grams, adding a bit of extra weight on top of the 136 – 164 grams Moto Z and Moto Z Force / Z Play. The mod is currently available for pre-order from Verizon Wireless’ online store for the price of $79.99 and is available only in black. The item has an estimated shipping date of November 28, but as is usually the case with pre-purchases, shipping dates remain subject to change. Post navigation",

      "text": "Verizon is now selling the $1000 HP Elite x2, an LTE-connected Surface Pro 4 competitor Verizon is now selling the $1000 HP Elite x2, an LTE-connected Surface Pro 4 competitor Posted: Tags : Verizon - Verizon + Windows - Windows + HP - HP + Tablets - Tablets + Verizon is now selling the HP Elite x2 Windows 10 2-in-1. The 4G LTE slab, priced at $999 without a contract or $899 on a two-year agreement, is an interesting alternative to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. Verizon seems to be focusing on marketing the HP Elite x2 among business customers, a move that makes a lot of sense given the hardware specs. The metal-built HP Elite x2 features a 12-inch IPS display running at 1920 by 1080 pixels. While that's a step down compared to the Surface Pro 4's 2560 by 1200 display, the sharpness will still suffice for most office tasks. A layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 ensures scratch and drop protection.Speaking of drop protection, the HP Elite x2 is MIL-STD-810G certified, meaning that it's able to survive potential drops or spills. This is a rare feature on a tablet but purchasing managers are surely not going to complain about. The brain of the operation is an Intel Core m3-6Y30 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, the same base setup as the entry-level Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and a decent configuration overall. In the camera department, the HP Elite x2 is equipped with a 5MP primary sensor and a 2MP sensor for video conferences. Interestingly, the x2 fares much better when it comes to audio thanks to its Bang & Olufsen stereo speakers and dual microphone array. Other notable features include support for LTE bands 4, 5, and 13, a USB 3.1 Type C port with Thunderbolt support, a USB 3.0 Type A port, a 40Whr Li-ion polymer battery. Looking at the specs and features, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and the HP Elite x2 share a lot of characteristics. They are similar in terms of build and overall size, feature Wacom digitizers, come with built-in retractable kickstands and detachable keyboards, and come with sufficient processing power for most office tasks. The entry-level Surface Pro 4 costs $899 and features a higher-resolution display but does not come with LTE connectivity or splash and drop protection. Also, the $129.99 Type Cover is not included in the base price. The $999 Elite x2, however, includes the attachable backlit keyboard. Which one would you guys choose between the two?",

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nA year ago, Microsoft and HP introduced the Elite x2, a 2-in-1 Windows 10 PC targeted at business professionals featuring a detachable keyboard, a stylus as well as extra security and manageability features for IT departments. Yesterday, US Carrier Verizon has announced that would start selling the tablet which unlike Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 supports cellular connectivity (via Neowin ). \n“The HP Elite x2 is perfect for a wide range of business applications” explained HP in the press release, highlighting built-in security features such as HP Sure Start technology. Additionally, the US carrier claimed that “you don’t need to worry about drops or spills” as the hybrid tablet passed MIL-STD-810G testing. \nHere are the detailed specs of the Elite x2: 12.0″ diagonal BrightView LED-backlit WUXGA + UWVA Ultra-slim (1920 x 1280) Touchscreen with Corning® Gorilla® Glass Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD (expandable with microSD, not included) 2MP 1080p front-facing webcam; 5 MP 1080p rear-facing camera Bang & Olufsen dual stereo speakers and dual microphone array 4-cell, 40 WHr Li-ion polymer battery delivering up to 10.25 hours of battery life LTE Bands 13/4/5; CDMA 1X/RTT, EV-DO rB, BC0 & BC1; GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900; HSPA+/UMTS 850/900/1700/1900/2100 Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2×2) Bluetooth 4.2 1 x USB 3.1 Type C with Thunderbolt support 1 x USB 3.0 Type A Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system \nWhile the HP Elite x2 is already a year old, its cellular connectivity option and USB-C port may well make it slightly more versatile options than other 2-in-1 Windows 10 devices. However, at $899.99 with a new two-year contract (or $999.99 at full retail price), the Elite x2 is not exactly cheap but that is to be expected with a business-targeted device. You can get more information on the HP Elite X2 by checking the store listing on Verizon’s website. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Verizon taps into the sharing economy to make the last mile of commuting easy Media contacts @Marie_McGehee \nEveryday, people commute to work or to university campuses using mass transit. Whether it’s a college or a business campus, reaching the last mile of a commuter’s final destination between transit stops can be daunting. To help alleviate this issue, Verizon is working with Swiftmile to make the last mile of commuting easy by getting commuters on “smart” electric bikes. \nWhether you’re just starting out or expanding an established business, Verizon Share solutions are designed to provide an easy entry into a sharing economy that’s booming. Swiftmile will use Verizon’s newly-enhanced internet of things (IoT)-enabled Share Solutions platform as part of its electronic bike (ebike) transit share system. In turn, Swiftmile will deploy its ebikes, powered by Verizon Share Solutions, to the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority (VTA) – a special purpose district responsible for public transit services, congestion management and specific highway improvement projects for Santa Clara County, California. \n“The investment that Verizon is making in communications infrastructure to support the growing internet of things will profoundly impact all aspects of our lives including transportation,” said Gary Miskell, Chief Technology Officer for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. “Innovative projects like Swiftmile’s solar powered eBikes can increase the use of alternative transportation options, including public transit and reduce harmful carbon emissions.” \n“These are important mobility options that reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles thus reducing congestion,” Miskell continued. \nAccording to Swiftmile CEO Colin Roche, VTA employees will have access to Swiftmile’s eBikes through the new Swiftapp, where they can \"tap, rent and roll\" for short distance commutes. “By doing so, VTA employees will decrease single occupancy trips that are the main cause of congestion, smog and added stress to our daily lives. It also provides for a much more fun, green and efficient way to get around without the worry of breaking a sweat,” said Roche. \n“We are thrilled to work with Swiftmile to help deliver the Verizon Share platform to the VTA,” said Mike Toto,” Director - IoT Product Development & Strategic Planning at Verizon. “Our work with Swiftmile demonstrates how companies are looking to grow their revenue and stay ahead of their competition by providing their end customers with an easy, on-demand ‘mobility- as- a-service’ experience, which aligns with the growing trend from ownership to “usership”. \nVerizon Ventures also announced Swiftmile as the latest company to join the portfolio. Transportation solutions that aim to solve the complex problem of working with existing urban infrastructure has also been a focus for Verizon Ventures.

Enabling recreation equipment rental companies to deliver an on-demand, user-friendly rental experience to millennials while driving new revenue opportunities. Making transportation options align with campus sustainability initiatives to reduce congestion, and improve accessibility.",

While you could argue that the new Moto Z phones aren't necessarily direct successors of the Moto X series, there's still undeniable innovation packed into Motorola's new flagship smartphone line. Moto Mods are the most successful form of modularity that we've yet to see with smartphones, and starting today, you can pick up a brand new one that's currently available exclusively through Verizon. The latest Moto Mod to hit the market is made by Mophie, and as you'd expect from the company, their new offering is a battery extension for Motorola's line of Moto Z phones. The new Moto Mod offers a total capacity of 3,000 mAh, and Mophie says that this should deliver a battery increase of 60-percent when attached to your phone. An LED light on the pack shows how much juice it currently has, and charging your Moto Z phone with the Mophie Moto Mod attached to it will charge both gadgets at the same time. Interestingly enough, Mophie's new Moto Mod is currently only available to purchase through Verizon Wireless. The battery pack here will work on any Moto Z phone no matter who you bought it through, but it looks like Verizon currently has dibs on it for the time being. If you're interested in it, the new Mophie Moto Mod is currently selling for $79.99 and is available to purchase starting today.",

      "text": "– A + Apple accused of throttling iPhone 7 performance on Verizon to match slower speeds on AT&T By Neil Hughes \nFriday, November 18, 2016, 10:39 am PT (01:39 pm ET) \nIn an effort to offer a uniform experience on the iPhone 7 regardless of carrier, Apple could be reducing the top speeds capable on Verizon, keeping them on par with rival carrier AT&T, a new investigation alleges.\n\n\nVia Bloomberg . \n\nApple's choice of LTE modem suppliers for the new iPhone 7 series is believed to be the main cause for the issue, according to Bloomberg . Specifically, the Intel modem featured in AT&T-compatible iPhone 7 units offers slower download speeds than the Qualcomm modem found in Verizon units.\n\nApple for years has diversified its supply chain to help keep production levels high and also drive down costs. A similar controversy erupted last year, when it was discovered that A9 processors in the iPhone 6s were made by both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nWhile some benchmark tests suggested not all A9 chips were created equal, Apple said that in real-world use, the processors performed similarly. Tests subsequently confirmed those claims .\n\nWhile variations in performance are to be expected from multiple suppliers, the difference between the Qualcomm and Intel modems is said to be far more pronounced: Qualcomm's X12 modem is capable of up to 600 megabits per second, while Intel's maximum speed is just 450 megabits per second.\n\n\n\n\nTests conducted by Twin Rime found that the Verizon iPhone 7 offers slightly faster LTE speeds than AT&T. But the same Qualcomm X12 chip is found in the Samsung Galaxy S7, and its network speeds on Verizon are about twice as fast as the iPhone 7.\n\nThe suggestion is that Apple is throttling the performance of the X12 modem in the Verizon iPhone 7 so that it matches the capabilities of Intel's modem in the AT&T version.\n\nIn the U.S., Apple sells two versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: The Qualcomm modem is compatible with both Verizon and Sprint, while the Intel modem can connect to both AT&T and T-Mobile.",

      "title": "Apple May Be Throttling Verizon iPhone 7 LTE Performance",
      "text": "Apple may be throttling the LTE performance of the Verizon iPhone 7 to keep it on par with the AT&T iPhone 7, according to research conducted by Twin Prime and Cellular Insights and shared by Bloomberg. Based on testing, the Verizon iPhone 7 performs about as well as the AT&T iPhone 7, but it does not reach the data transfer speeds that it is capable of hitting.\n\nThe Verizon (and Sprint) iPhone 7 models use different LTE hardware than the AT&T (and T-Mobile) iPhone 7 models, adopting a Qualcomm LTE modem instead of an Intel LTE modem.\n\nThe hardware from Qualcomm is capable of maximum theoretical download speeds of 600Mb/s, while the Intel LTE modem tops out at 450Mb/s, but the Qualcomm-equipped Verizon iPhone 7 is only marginally outperforming the AT&T iPhone 7. Researchers believe Apple may be hobbling the Verizon iPhone 7 by not taking advantage of \"a crucial component,\" thereby ensuring all models of the iPhone 7 perform at a similar level.\n\"The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities,\" said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. \"I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.\" [...]\n\nField tests suggest the Verizon iPhone 7 is just a \"little faster\" than the AT&T iPhone 7, but not as fast as it could be. Tests were conducted by comparing iPhone 7 performance on the Verizon network to a Samsung Galaxy S7, which also uses the Qualcomm X12. Data collected from more than 100,000 phones downloading the same image indicates the S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7.\n\nIn a statement, an Apple spokesperson said there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the iPhone 7 models.\n\n\"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,\" Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. \"In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\n\nThough the two phones are performing on a similar level, past testing by Cellular Insights suggests that changes somewhat when signal strength is an issue. In areas of weak reception, the Verizon iPhone noticeably outperforms the AT&T iPhone by maintaining a stronger connection and enabling faster low-signal transfer speeds.\n\nOther network testing companies that Bloomberg contacted said that reliably measuring data transfer speeds is difficult due to the many factors that can affect performance, but the information collected from Cellular Insights and Twin Prime was not disputed.Related Roundup: iPhone 7\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The segment generated ~$1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), which was a rise of 10.1% on a YoY (year-over-year) basis. \nIts wireline segment’s adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.2% in 3Q16 compared to 18.9% a year ago. It was driven by a faster-than-expected recovery following the strike in 2Q16. The main reason for the rise was primarily growth in Verizon FiOS (Fiber Optic Service) and the cost management measures taken by Verizon. \nTotal revenues for Verizon FiOS rose 4.4% on a YoY basis in 3Q16. Verizon added 90,000 FiOS Internet subscribers and 36,000 FiOS video subscribers that quarter. FiOS Internet and video penetration were 40.4% and 34.5%, respectively. \nVerizon expects the new union contract negotiated in the wake of the strike to generate total cash savings of $500.0 million from 2017–2019. As a result, Verizon is optimistic about its wireline segment’s EBITDA margin growth in the coming years. Wireline strike had a negative impact on Verizon \nAlthough Verizon’s wireline margins improved in 3Q16, the story was different in 2Q16. Verizon’s wireline segment’s adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.0% in 2Q16 compared to 18.7% in 2Q15, which was a pretty large fall. The main reason for the fall was the seven-week work stoppage from the strike in its wireline segment in 2Q16. The strike resulted in a $0.07 per share hit to its earnings. \nThe company suffered from a backlog of FiOS installations due to the strike. The work stoppage impacted FiOS connection growth, and the company lost 13,000 FiOS Internet subscribers and 41,000 FiOS video subscribers in 2Q16. \nDespite this setback, FiOS revenues for Verizon rose 3.7% on a YoY basis in 2Q16. To boost its FiOS business further, Verizon acquired XO Communications earlier in 2016 for $1.8 billion. XO will provide Verizon with fiber-optic networks in some US markets. \nIn 2Q16, Verizon also divested its wireline operations in California, Florida, and Texas to Frontier Communications ( FTR ) for about $10.0 billion. \nIn the next part of this series, we’ll look at Verizon’s postpaid subscriber net additions.

      "title": "Verizon: –5% Stock Price Decline Pushes Dividend Yield Near 5%",
      "text": "With interest rates still near historic lows, Verizon’s 4.8% dividend yield could be a buying opportunity. \nBusiness overview \nVerizon is a telecommunications company. It provides television, internet and phone service to business and residential customers. \nIt operates in two main businesses: Verizon Wireless (71% of total revenue) Verizon Wireline (29% of total revenue) \nVerizon Wireless includes the company’s cell phone service division. This is its most important business—the wireless segment has 35.8 million device payment plan phone connections. \nWireless segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 44.9% last quarter , up 170 basis points year over year. \nVerizon generates very high profit margins and cash flow. This is because it operates in an oligopoly. Verizon and its close competitor AT&T ( NYSE:T ) control about two-thirds of the wireless industry in the U.S. \nThe reason is because there are very high barriers to entry. It would require billions of dollars to build a network that could compete on a similar scale as the two industry giants. \nThis provides Verizon and AT&T with what Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ) would refer to as an \"economic moat.\" \nAs a result, Verizon has produced solid growth over the past few years. \nSource: 2015 Annual Report , page 4 \nThe biggest driver of Verizon’s huge cash flows is its wireless business. \nSource: 2015 Annual Report , page 7 \nVerizon has invested significantly in its network and is reaping the benefits. Verizon raked in $21 billion of free cash flow in 2015 . The company allocated billions of free cash flow to shareholders. It paid $8.5 billion of dividends and bought back $5.1 billion of its stock. \nBusiness conditions remain very positive for Verizon. Consumers love their cell phones and have a seemingly insatiable hunger for data. \nVerizon refers to its high-quality customer base as its driver of profitability. \nVerizon’s customers are willing to pay higher prices for the company’s top-tier network, which fuels high margins. This is especially true on the wireless side of the business. \nVerizon’s churn, which represents customers that leave for a competing service, has held below 0.90% for six consecutive quarters . \nGrowth prospects \nOne might assume the telecom industry is saturated in the U.S. But the good news for Verizon shareholders is that the company has several tailwinds for growth at its back. \nSource: Third Quarter Earnings Presentation, page 13 \nAmong Verizon’s most important drivers of future growth are 5G, the Internet of Things (or IoT) and digital advertising. \nApproximately 90% of Verizon’s traffic now resides on its 4G network. It is likely that 5G will be the next step in Verizon’s growth. \nAs demand for mobile video grows, so too will data requirements. The rollout of 5G will allow Verizon to strengthen its position as having the industry’s strongest network. This will continue to be a competitive advantage for the company. \nSeparately, the Internet of Things will be a growth driver. Internet of Things brings connected solutions to the physical environment. For example, increased connectivity at home and in automobiles. \nTo expand in this area, Verizon is turning to acquisitions. It acquired Telogis this year to enter the connected car market. In addition, the company acquired Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion in the same area. \nVerizon’s Internet of Things revenue increased 18% last year and the recent acquisitions pave the way for even greater growth. \nLastly, Verizon has conducted acquisitions to build its digital advertising platform. To do this, it bought AOL for $4 billion and a collection of assets from Yahoo ( NASDAQ:YHOO ) for nearly $5 billion. \nDividend analysis \nThe one positive about Verizon’s share price decline is that it has elevated the dividend yield to nearly 5%. This gives investors the opportunity to earn more than double the average dividend yield of the S&P 500. \nFor income investors, Verizon’s falling stock price could be viewed as a buying opportunity. Even more so, because the dividend looks highly sustainable going forward. \nAfter acquiring the rest of Verizon Wireless for $130 billion, Verizon has a lot of debt on the balance sheet. In fact, it ended last quarter with $103 billion of long-term debt. \nFortunately, its debt appears to be manageable. Verizon has $3.5 billion in long-term debt that is due in the next year. Its debt is spread out over many years. \nSince it generates such high free cash flow, it should have little trouble sustaining its dividend payments and raising its dividend modestly each year. \nLast year , Verizon had earnings per share of $3.99 and declared dividends of $2.23 per share. This means the company distributed 56% of its earnings per share last year as shareholder dividends. \nWith a payout ratio slightly over half of annual earnings, Verizon has a comfortable dividend payout. \nGoing forward, investors can expect annual dividend growth that at least matches inflation. This sets investors up well for income generation. Verizon offers a high dividend yield and enough dividend growth to protect its investors’ purchasing power over time. \nFinal thoughts \nInvestors never like to see a stock price decline. But the upside is that it elevates a stock’s dividend yield. Verizon’s share price decline in recent weeks has lifted its dividend yield up to 4.8%. Verizon is a consistently high-paying dividend company with growth potential . \nIncome investors looking for high, sustainable dividend yields have an opportunity to scoop up Verizon and its ~5% dividend yield. \nDisclosure: I am not long any of the stocks mentioned.

      "title": "iPhone 7 On Verizon’s Network Not Performing As Well As It Could",
      "text": "iPhone 7 On Verizon’s Network Not Performing As Well As It Could  37 PST \nLast year there was a bit of controversy regarding the iPhone 6s chipsets, in which it was discovered that the TSMC-made chipsets provided longer battery life (on paper) compared to the ones made by Samsung. Could a similar problem be brewing this year for Apple’s iPhone 7? It’s certainly starting to look that way. \nAccording to a report from Bloomberg , it seems that researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights have found that the iPhone 7 on Verizon’s networking isn’t performing as fast as it could, and it could be Apple’s own doing. The researchers have found that testing the phones on AT&T and Verizon’s network yielded similar results, but they also note that the iPhone on Verizon’s network could potentially hit higher internet speeds. \nIf you might recall, it has been discovered that depending on which carrier you use, your iPhone’s modem could either be made by Qualcomm or Intel . Qualcomm’s modem is supposed to be faster with download speeds of up to 600Mb/s, while Intel’s model tops out at 450Mb/s. This means in theory Verizon’s iPhone should be capable of achieving faster download speeds. \nHowever some analysts speculate that maybe this was done on purpose to ensure a uniform experience across all iPhones, although right now we’re sure that some iPhone users probably aren’t too thrilled to learn that their iPhones could be artificially limited in some way. \nAccording to Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller, “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones .

      "text": "Android 7.0 Update Reportedly Hitting Verizon’s Moto Z & Force   John Anon \nThe Moto Z and Z Force are the two current flagship smartphones from Lenovo and Motorola. However, if you were one of the first to get your hands on the Moto Z or Z Force then chances are that you own a ‘Droid edition’ as the two Moto Z devices originally arrived in Droid form via Verizon. If one of those Droid Edition Moto Z phones is your current phone, then you might want to check if you have an update waiting. Specifically, an update to Android 7.0 (Nougat). \nAt the moment this is still an unconfined update from Lenovo, Motorola and/or Verizon. However, some users on Reddit are reporting that their Moto Z devices on Verizon have received the update to Nougat. As is usually the case with this sort of claim, there are pictures coming through (which you can see below) supporting the claim that the Nougat update is indeed rolling out. At least, to some Verizon Moto Z devices. It should be pointed out that at the end of September, ‘Q4’ was the time that a Verizon representative was quoted stating that the update to Android 7.0 would come through for the Moto Z family. So while this seems to be a bit of a surprise update, it would essentially be on time, in spite of Q4 being fairly vague and spanning a three-month period. \nEither way, as this is still an unannounced update, the details are a little light. However, one of the images does confirm some of the features that are included in the update. For instance, Split-Screen mode and App quick switching are both included. According to the images, the update comes with version number NCL25.86-11 and includes the November 1 security patch. In spite of the size of the update not being shown in any of the images or provided by any of the users, the install image does detail that the update takes about 20 minutes to install. It is also worth noting that the user who posted one of the images is confirming that it “ works with daydream. ” Needless to say, if you do own a Verizon Moto Z or Moto Z Force, then now is the time to be heading into the settings and seeing if an update is ready for you to download and install. After all, this is the Android Nougat update Post navigation",

      "text": "The Moto Z and Moto Z Force Start Getting Android 7.0 Nougat Update at Verizon GO The update was previously confirmed for Q4 2016 Nov 19, 2016 02:31   Motorola hasn't yet brought Android 7.0 Nougat to any of its smartphones. The US-based company didn't even launched a Nougat smartphone, but that's likely to change if the recently leaked Motorola DROID Turbo 3 makes its debut. The good news is some Motorola fans can already take advantage of the Android Nougat features, but only if they own the Moto Z or the Moto Z Force. Another condition would be to own Verizon's version. Multiple reports coming from Moto Z and Moto Z Force users claim Motorola has already pulled the plug on the Android 7.0 Nougat rollout for these two devices. We believe this is a staged deployment, so there's a high chance that only a limited number of users might have received the update. As mentioned earlier, the update is only available for the Moto Z and Moto Z Force for Verizon. If you're looking for an official confirmation, you won't find any, as Verizon hasn't yet updated the phones' support pages. Motorola Z Force Droid According to some of those who received the software update with the firmware version NCL26.86-11, this is a fairly sizable update, which will take around 20 minutes to install. But the wait is well worth since Android 7.0 Nougat brings a lot of cool stuff to the Moto Z and Moto Z Force, including the split-screen mode, Daydream VR support, along with app quick switching functionality. It's probably going to take Motorola a few days to push the update to more users, but it's great that the company has started the rollout earlier than expected. Motorola originally announced that it will provide the Android 7.0 Nougat update for the Moto Z sometime in Q4. Even though the update is only available for the Verizon-branded version of the Moto Z, we doubt the unlocked variant won't receive Nougat in the next couple of weeks as well.

      "text": "Apple Limiting iPhone 7 LTE Perfomance On Verizon, Lowering Data Speeds To Match AT&T Variant 19 November 2016, 4:01 am EST By Vincent Lanaria Tech Times LTE performance of the iPhone 7 on Verizon is reportedly limited by Apple to match the data speeds the AT&T variant is capable of. ( Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple is accused of limiting the iPhone 7's LTE performance on Verizon to match those of the AT&T variants in a bid to provide a uniformed experience across every model. \nPut simply, the iPhones supported by the Big Red technically have more capable hardware for faster data speeds, as they are powered by Qualcomm modems as opposed to the slower Intel chips under the AT&T versions' hoods. Verizon's iPhone 7 Held Back From Full Potential \nThrough tests, Twin Prime researchers find that the iPhone 7 on Verizon is not \"taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities,\" as Bloomberg reports . \nThat said, Twin Prime Head of Products Gabriel Tavridis says that he doubts that Apple is throttling but may have decided to \"not enable certain features of the network chip.\" Qualcomm vs. Intel: Leveling The iPhone 7 Playing Field \nA report back in October revealed that the Qualcomm modem offers better cellular connectivity than the Intel one. \nTheoretically, the Qualcomm X12 modem housed in the iPhone 7 on Verizon are rated to download data up to 600 megabits per second, while the Intel component in the AT&T models maxes out at 450 megabits per second. \nDespite that, the former is faster by only a small margin. \nCellular Insights analyst Milan Milanovic says that Apple's decision on the matter is \"likely to level the playing field between the Qualcomm and Intel variants.\" \nFor the record, the iPhone 7 loaded with the Qualcomm X12 modem is sold by CDMA carriers Verizon and Sprint, and the variant with the Intel chip is provided by GSM AT&T and T-Mobile. Field Tests: iPhone 7 Models And Galaxy S7 Compared \nTwin Prime researchers conducted field tests that involved more than 100,000 phones downloading the same image. \nIn the comparison graph below, the results show that that iPhone 7 on Verizon slightly bests the AT&T variant, but the Samsung Galaxy S7 on Verizon that also uses a Qualcomm X12 modem outperforms the two, downloading the image twice as fast. (Photo : Twin Prime | Bloomberg) Apple Says The Difference Is Negligible \nApple says that users shouldn't notice a huge difference in performance of the iPhone 7 models and that all of them up to par or even exceeds the company's standards. \n\"In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models,\" Trudy Muller, Apple spokesperson, says. \nWith all said and done, what do you think of Apple limiting the LTE performance of the iPhone 7 on Verizon?

      "title": "Verizon iPhone 7 devices aren’t as fast as they should be",
      "text": "Verizon iPhone 7 devices aren’t as fast as they should be Mike Wehner Pin it Share If you’re an iPhone 7 user on Verizon and don’t think your phone is quite as speedy as it should be, it might not just be your imagination; new performance tests show that despite the speedier network, Apple’s newest smartphone is only barely faster on Verizon than its AT&T counterpart. The tests, which were carried out by Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights, show only marginally faster LTE speeds for the Verizon version of the iPhone 7, which as we know should easily outpace its AT&T twin . The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime, told Bloomberg . “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” In real world testing by Twin Prime, a battle between the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7, both running on Verizon, was easily won by the Samsung handset. This is despite the fact that both devices utilize the same Qualcomm modem chip, and should theoretically be roughly equal. Instead, the S7 was twice as fast as the newest iPhone. Jan Dawson, founder of tech insight firm Jackdaw Research LLC, theorized to Bloomberg that the throttling was being done on Apple’s end. “They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better. If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance,” she said. Apple has remained steadfast in its claim that all versions of the iPhone 7 meet its standards, regardless of carrier or individual components. If the speed parity is indeed an effort to keep all customers, and even the carriers, on the same level playing field, it’s likely Apple will have very little more to say on the matter.

      "text": "Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States GO Verizon's iPhone 7 version should be faster than AT&T's Nov 19, 2016 03:28 GMT · By Andrei Vlad · Share: It's a common fact that Apples uses components from different suppliers with each iPhone the company launches, and this year's model is no exception. For example, in the United States, there are two different version of the iPhone 7 , but they're only different because they embed different components, not because one performs better than the other. Bloomberg reports that Verizon's iPhone 7 is equipped with a Qualcomm X12 modem, while the AT&T/T-Mobile version comes with an Intel XMM 3360. On paper, the Qualcomm X12 modem should perform much faster than the Intel XMM 3360. According the their specification, Qualcomm's latest X12 modem is capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second, while the Intel modem can only reach up to 450 megabits per second. However, in reality, both modems are about the same when it comes to performance. Apparently Apple has decided to throttle down the Qualcomm X12 modem, as to not upset carriers and customers alike. A field test that put against each other the Galaxy S7 equipped with the Qualcomm X12 and the iPhone 7 with the same modem chip, showed that Samsung's smartphone was twice as fast on the same network. iPhone 7 Basically, we now have two iPhone 7 versions that perform the same, but one of them could be faster than the other if Apple would have enabled the full power of the Qualcomm X12 modem. Obviously, that's not going to happen since the Cupertino-based company has no intention of angering either AT&T or T-Mobile, as well as their customers in the United States, by making one of the iPhone 7 variants weaker than Verizon's model. Currently, there's a small performance different between the Verizon iPhone 7 and those from AT&T and T-Mobile (in favor of the former), but it's almost negligible. Apple refused to comment on the matter, though a spokeswoman did stated that “ every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing .” CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (2 Images)",

      "text": "  \nVerizon IndyCar Series teams and drivers will make a gradual shift from Brembo's braking package for the Dallara DW12 to a new solution provided by Performance Friction Corporation ( inset, image courtesy of PFC ). Although IndyCar announced the vendor change in September, the specifics behind the migration were not provided. \nRather than implement a complete substitution this offseason, the switch to PFC as IndyCar's exclusive brake vendor from 2017-'20 will see teams use a blend of both packages next year and a complete move to PFC products in 2018. \n\"For 2017, teams will use the existing Brembo caliper and we will be providing brake discs, hats, pads, and hardware,\" PFC's Darrick Dong told RACER . A brand-new PFC brake caliper will replace the Brembo unit the following year. \n\"In 2018 the full package will be on the car; the design criteria for the caliper has been finished and expect teams will be able to inspect and review it in March or April, and to start testing with it after the Indy 500,\" he added. \"It's a Monobloc caliper with all of the bells and whistles.\" \nAccording to Dong, PFC took the opportunity to reduce the number of pieces required for assembly with each brake disc to lower weight and complexity. \n\"When we got the nod to provide brakes for IndyCar, the first thing we looked at was how to build carbon products that fit the existing Dallara system,\" he said. \"We've incorporated a mounting package with 15 titanium pegs that go into the hat. The disc fits on top of these titanium pegs and we've been able to eliminate all the bolts and washers and extra items from the last package. It's a clever way of implementing a larger carbon content to the package than drivers have had.\" \nIn a blind test conducted at multiple tracks, PFC's discs and pads earned rave reviews, and after years of complaints regarding uneven brake temperatures, high wear rates, and excessive vibrations, braking could become a happier topic to broach with drivers next year. \n\"We're doing more testing on the Sebring short course and are looking at ventilating the pads to further reduce heat soak,\" Dong said. \"We've been testing continually since the Road America test and the wear has been very good, the consistency has been good, and we've done three oval tests and had no vibration issues which was another problem teams have dealt with. Firestone was also happy about the vibrations going away.\" \nDue to the somewhat late timing of the agreement between IndyCar and PFC, teams will conduct most of their pre-season tests using the full Brembo package ( pictured above, Marshall Pruett image ). The timing is tight, but Dong is confident PFC will deliver ahead of the March 1 deadline. \n\"We've committed to the series to have everything delivered at the beginning of March, but we know the second week of March is the first race at St. Pete,\" he said. \"Our goal is to have at least one car set per team in their hands by the middle of February so they can test without St. Pete being right around the corner.\"",

      "text": "If you’re an iPhone 7 user on Verizon and don’t think your phone is quite as speedy as it should be, it might not just be your imagination; new performance tests show that despite the speedier network, Apple’s newest smartphone is only barely faster on Verizon than its AT&T counterpart.\nThe tests, which were carried out by Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights, show only marginally faster LTE speeds for the Verizon version of the iPhone 7, which as we know should easily outpace its AT&T twin .\nThe data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime, told Bloomberg . “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.”\nIn real world testing by Twin Prime, a battle between the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7, both running on Verizon, was easily won by the Samsung handset. This is despite the fact that both devices utilize the same Qualcomm modem chip, and should theoretically be roughly equal. Instead, the S7 was twice as fast as the newest iPhone.\nJan Dawson, founder of tech insight firm Jackdaw Research LLC, theorized to Bloomberg that the throttling was being done on Apple’s end. “They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better. If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance,” she said.\nApple has remained steadfast in its claim that all versions of the iPhone 7 meet its standards, regardless of carrier or individual components. If the speed parity is indeed an effort to keep all customers, and even the carriers, on the same level playing field, it’s likely Apple will have very little more to say on the matter.\nTrending right now:\n10 hidden iPhone tricks Apple never told you about All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon Release date for Pokemon Go Generation 2 might have just leaked See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple rarely offers discounts on its iPhone products. Unlike most major retailers, the tech company more often than not eschews deals on its mobile gadgets, forcing consumers to seek out local retailers on special shopping holidays — like Black Friday — to try and nab them at a discount.\nFinding the best iPhone deals can be tricky, but lucky for you, we've taken care of all the hard work and research so you don't have to. Read on to learn where you can find the best iPhone discounts this year.\nTarget Target Source: Lynne Sladky/AP Target is offering up a free iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus and $250 gift card with the purchase of an AT&T, Sprint or Verizon cellular plan. Depending on the desired amount of storage, the same model would cost shoppers between $649 and $849 for the iPhone 7 and between $769 and $969 for the iPhone 7 Plus at an Apple store.\nWalmart Walmart Source: Joe Raedle/Getty Images If you've been hoping to purchase one of Apple's older iPhone models, you're in luck: Walmart is practically giving away the iPhone 5s for Black Friday . It's only $99 and includes 16GB of storage and must be purchased with a Straight Talk wireless plan, which starts at $45.\nShoppers can buy any Apple smartphone (the SE , 6s , 6 Plus , 7s or 7 Plus ) with $0 down on an AT&T Next or Verizon cellular plan and get a $250 store gift card for free.\nVerizon Verizon Wireless Source: MANDEL NGAN/Getty Images The wireless carrier won't have a traditional money off deal this year for its Apple phones but will be giving Verizon customers the opportunity to trade in their old iPhone 6S or 6s Plus and save $300 on the purchase of a new iPhone 7 . iPhone SE owners are eligible for a $200 discount while iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPhone SE can get up to $100 off.",

      "text": "0 Looking For Mobile Hotspot Router I use my Verizon phone as a hotspot at home from time to time. Well, honest a lot, but I need to be able to hook wirelessly to a router then that router put out wifi in my home. Now here's the catch... I have a Netgear that does this already but I'm limited to the amount of wireless connections I can make to it. I think 10 is the max. I need at least 20. I want a good one that will put out at least 100 feet of linear wifi. Can anyone help? Feedback Score 0 You can use a ddwrt on a router to pickup the hotspot. Then you can put that out to a access point or if you get a dual band you can use one. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Feedback Score 0 So I'm looking for a Dual Band router? I've heard that Cradlepoint routers are good but I don't know what ddwrt means. I can use that info. I just need to get up to speed in the lingo. Google is good for that kind of stuff. LOL. I've seen a frequency type. What am I looking for on that? If someone has a suggestion for a model plug that in here as well. Thanks for all the help. 0 Originally Posted by Clark Grizwold So I'm looking for a Dual Band router? I've heard that Cradlepoint routers are good but I don't know what ddwrt means.

Be aware it dont work on every type or router. I do know a r7000 and a wrt1900ac router does work this was because i have both. Those are newer types of router which is over kill for what ur wanting.

      "text": "Apple May Be Throttling Verizon iPhone 7 LTE Performance \nTests are showing that the Verizon iPhone 7 is performing similarly to the AT&T iPhone 7 even though it can reach higher data transfer speeds . Apple, however, is adamant that all versions perform nearly identically. \nThe Verizon (and Sprint) iPhone 7 models use different LTE hardware than the AT&T (and T-Mobile) iPhone 7 models, adopting a Qualcomm LTE modem instead of an Intel LTE modem. The hardware from Qualcomm is capable of maximum theoretical download speeds of 600Mb/s, while the Intel LTE modem tops out at 450Mb/s, but the Qualcomm-equipped Verizon iPhone 7 is only marginally outperforming the AT&T iPhone 7. Researchers believe Apple may be hobbling the Verizon iPhone 7 by not taking advantage of \"a crucial component,\" thereby ensuring all models of the iPhone 7 perform at a similar level.",

      "text": "Verizon Has Been Getting Smoked Nov.20.16 Summary \nVerizon Communications (VZ) has been a stock that I have been long for about nine months now. \nI bought Verizon on the fact that it was a safety trade because in times of uncertainty that is where normal investors run to. \nIf for some reason rates begin to decline and investors flock back to the high yielding dividend stocks this will be the first place they are going to move to. Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) has been a stock that I have been long for about nine months now. I will admit that I am a bit disappointed with my holding thus far as I am down 2.3% including dividends and writing premiums. This company just cannot get out of its own way with lots of headwinds of which the questionable Yahoo acquisition is one and the fact that interest rates have been rising, causing investors to sell the high yielding dividend stocks such as Verizon for the safety of US treasuries. I bought Verizon on the fact that it was a safety trade because in times of uncertainty that is where normal investors run to, driving the price of the stock upwards while driving the dividend yield of the stock downwards. The valuation on Verizon is pretty inexpensive as well, but it just doesn't have any real growth rate. Currently the stock trades at 14x trailing earnings while it is trading at 12x next year's earnings estimates, those are not bad numbers. However, earnings are only expected to grow 2.7% in 2017 from what they were in 2016 but that is a reasonable number as I believe it should grow around the rate of the US gross domestic product. When the stock had pulled back at little I felt that there was room to the upside. That is when I purchased the $52.50 November call and subsidized the purchase by writing the November $55 call. I was willing to keep purchasing the stock at that price if it were to jump higher but it has floundered at around the $48 level. From its highs around $56 the stock dropped to $46 in a straight line, that is nearly an 18% move! The dividend was very well covered as the company shells out $2.31 annually while it made $3.43 over the past year. On a cash flow basis the company paid out $9.1B in dividends over the past year on an operating cash flow basis of $28.1B. Verizon has not required any capital raises to sustain the dividend like a lot of other companies have been doing these days. So from these numbers we know the dividend is well covered and the business is intact. Now you can see why I was hoping for the stock to show a bounce by the November expiration date. So now that my November calls have expired I will continue to be bullish on the name and look to buy even more shares of the stock. If for some reason rates begin to decline and investors flock back to the high yielding dividend stocks this will be the first place they are going to move to. In the meantime I am going to continue to write some more upside calls and collect the premiums and hope that the stock can begin to climb higher.

      "text": "Verizon brings Coral Blue variant of Samsung Galaxy S7 edge By 0 \nIf you’re not too crazy about the standard colors that Samsung brought to the Galaxy S7 edge , specifically the Black Onyx, Gold Platinum, or Silver Titanium, then you’ll be happy to know you now have another color option. The Blue Coral variant was officially announced earlier and some carriers have made it known they will carry this color as well. Now, Verizon ’s online store says the device is now available and you can even get the second one at 50% off. \nThe ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 had another thing going for it when it was first released and it was its slick-looking coral blue color. So when Samsung announced earlier this month that they were releasing a version of the Galaxy S7 edge with the same color, there was much interest in it. Now Verizon has opened its digital doors so you can get this variant if you are a customer of the carrier. Plus, you also get 50% off the second device, same phone and color, that you will get. \nAside from the color, you’ll still get the same ole Galaxy S7 edge that everyone else got (well, those who bought one of course). It has a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED screen, 1440 × 2560 display, 12MP dual rear camera, Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage, and a 3600mAh battery. It is also waterproof, which is a big factor for a lot of mobile people right now. \nYou can get the Galaxy S7 edge Coral Blue variant for $33 per month for 24 months or if you want a one-time payment, it’s $792. And if you want to get another unit, you’ll be able to get it at 50% off. Other carriers are also offering the color, like T-Mobile and AT&T.",

      "title": "Apple Reportedly Throttling Verizon iPhone 7 (Update: Confirmed)",
      "text": "Update 11/19: Sources tell Recode that Apple purposely limited the LTE capability of the iPhone 7 on Verizon in order to make the handset similar across carriers. If you're looking for the fastest phone on Verizon, you may want to steer clear of the iPhone 7. According to researchers at Twin Prime Inc and Cellular Insights, Apple may be throttling its flagship phone on that network.\nCredit: Sam Rutherford More Credit: Sam Rutherford \nThe researchers shared their results with Bloomberg , reporting that the Galaxy S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7 on Verizon after collecting data from more than 100,000 phones that downloaded a large image. This huge delta exists despite the fact that the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 use the same advanced Qualcomm X12 modem.\nMORE: Why You Might Want to Skip iPhone 7 and Wait for 8 \nWhy would Apple possibly throttle its own phone? Perhaps to make the device's performance more consistent across carriers. The iPhone 7 for AT&T uses a slower Intel LTE modem that's capable of 450 megabits per second speeds, while the X12 modem on the Verizon model has a theoretical max of 600 Mbps.\nApple didn't deny that it might be throttling its own phone, telling Bloomberg only that the \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards.\" The spokesperson added that \"there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\nThat may well be true, but it's important to note that Apple is comparing only iPhones to iPhones across networks and not handsets from other manufacturers.\nIn a follow-up story, sources told Recode that Apple did in fact throttle the Qualcomm modem on the Verizon iPhone 7 in order keep the different versions of the phone \"as similar as possible.\" Apple has another motive: to realize the cost savings of having two chip suppliers.\nRecode went on to say that it would be difficult to know how well the iPhone 7 would perform if the Qualcomm modem was used to its full potential because one doesn't exist. But the Galaxy S7's much better performance on the same network seems like a pretty good clue.\n\nA phone's 4G LTE throughput is only one aspect of a its performance. The overall speed, camera quality and battery life are all important. But consumers should be able to get the most out of Verizon's network, especially given that its plans tend to cost more than that of the competition.\nSee also : The Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) Best iOS Games - Top Rated Games by Category 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try 11 Weirdly Awesome (and Useful) Gifts",

In fact, only about 0.3% of all Android devices with the Play Store actually have it . Many Verizon customers have reported that their Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Droid Force phones have received OTAs to Nougat. \nThe update brings the device to Android 7.0 (not 7.1) with the November 1st security patch level. The update also allows the Z Droid and Z Force to use Daydream mode, joining the ZTE Axon 7 as the only non-Pixel devices with the feature. In addition, the update finally brings Camera API 2 support, allowing certain applications to more fully control the camera. \nThe download is a whopping 1586 MB, so you might want to download it over Wi-Fi. As always, software updates roll out over the course of several days, so all owners should receive it shortly. Thanks:",

      "text": "verizon rootmetrics testing More jetcityimage/123rf.com\nBig Red has some boasting to do. According to Rootmetrics, Verizon has been named the No. 1 mobile service provider in 83 of the 89 metro areas where Rootmetrics operates. In other words, Verizon is ranked the best network, either alone at the top or tied with another network, a hefty 93 percent of the time.\nThe news follows a report from earlier this year that said Verizon was ranked the best network in all six performance categories — including reliability, data, speed, and call and text performance.\nMore: New $250 Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD tablet boasts Snapdragon 617 and 3GB of RAM\n“Customers enjoy our network to stay connected and share their experiences, and more importantly, depend on us when they need us most, like in times of severe weather,” said Nicki Palmer, Verizon chief network officer, in a statement . “We work 24/7 to ensure industry-leading performance and reliability – providing by far the best network experience available.”\nSo how did Roometrics, which offers scientifically collected and crowdsourced mobile network performance information to consumers and the industry, come up with its scores? Basically, it purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 from each of the four major wireless networks in the U.S., then conducted testing of things like data speeds, texting, calling, and so on. Testing went on 24 hours per day for a number of days in each of the testing areas, and included both indoor and outdoor testing.\nOf course, the best network isn’t cheap — Verizon is pretty consistently ranked among the most expensive networks. Still, prices do seem to have evened out between networks over the past few years, and Verizon appears to have at least attempted to keep up with changes implemented by the likes of T-Mobile. One of Verizon’s main selling points is that it’s the largest network around, a distinction that allows the company to gain customers by being the only option in some areas.\nVerizon rolls out LTE Advanced tech for faster peak wireless data speeds Who has the best family plan? Shake-ups from T-Mobile and Sprint tilt the balance Who's the best cell phone carrier of them all? Verizon, according to RootMetrics",

      "text": "If you’re not too crazy about the standard colors that Samsung brought to the Galaxy S7 edge , specifically the Black Onyx, Gold Platinum, or Silver Titanium, then you’ll be happy to know you now have another color option. The Blue Coral variant was officially announced earlier and some carriers have made it known they will carry this color as well. Now, Verizon ’s online store says the device is now available and you can even get the second one at 50% off.\nThe ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 had another thing going for it when it was first released and it was its slick-looking coral blue color. So when Samsung announced earlier this month that they were releasing a version of the Galaxy S7 edge with the same color, there was much interest in it. Now Verizon has opened its digital doors so you can get this variant if you are a customer of the carrier. Plus, you also get 50% off the second device, same phone and color, that you will get.\nAside from the color, you’ll still get the same ole Galaxy S7 edge that everyone else got (well, those who bought one of course). It has a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED screen, 1440 × 2560 display, 12MP dual rear camera, Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage, and a 3600mAh battery. It is also waterproof, which is a big factor for a lot of mobile people right now.\nYou can get the Galaxy S7 edge Coral Blue variant for $33 per month for 24 months or if you want a one-time payment, it’s $792. And if you want to get another unit, you’ll be able to get it at 50% off. Other carriers are also offering the color, like T-Mobile and AT&T.\nSOURCE: Verizon",

[Details Here] By Ella Rozic , Parent Herald November 20, 03:09 pm TAG iphone , iPhone 7 , Verizon , bloomberg , mobile , technology , internet , apple , smartphone NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 16: One of the first customers to buy a new iPhone walks out of an Apple store in Manhattan on September 16, 2016 in New York City. People around the globe waited in long lines to be among the first to purchase both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The phones offer longer battery life, faster browsing, a better camera and do not have a traditional headphone jack. (Photo : Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \nVerizon is expected to provide internet data speeds far better than other service providers such as AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Word goes around that Verizon's iPhone 7 downloads slower than it should be. Advertisement \nAs the latest iPhone model was released, so was the announcement of its two variations. We can recall that the new iPhone 7 has two suppliers for its modems - Intel and Qualcomm. News traveled fast saying that one of these variations is much slower than the other so the discrepancy about data speed is not totally new. \nTwin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights had the chance to speak with Bloomberg about the iPhone issue and expressed how these iPhones aren't performing to its capabilities. According to several reports, iPhone 7 models with Intel modems are slower than the ones with Qualcomm modems. \nBloomberg's new research opposes the allegations that Intel-powered iPhones are slower than those with Qualcomm. A field test was conducted between the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7, both runs on Verizon and both has Intel modem chips. The results are quite interesting Yes, Apple is limiting some iPhone 7 download speeds. But you #apps #appstore #iphone https://t.co/KKkcjpQ3ZY \n— Alisia Batts (@AlisiaBatts) November 20, 2016 \nAccording to Bloomberg , Verizon's iPhone 7 runs a little faster than AT&T but not as fast as it could be. With the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 comparison test, Twin Prime found out that the S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7. \nThe reason for this confusion and discrepancy is not well-defined. Although, Gabriel Tavridis of Twin Prime suggests that the Verizon modem may not have enabled all its features. Apple replied saying that every iPhone model, specifically the new models iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, exceeds the company's performance standards. \nThis, for sure, will cause a commotion among customers as they will get curious as to why this drawback is existing. Will this affect Apple as far as sales are concerned? Comment below.  ",

      "title": "Verizon: 15% Stock Price Decline Pushes Dividend Yield Near 5%",
      "text": "Sure Dividend Published November 18th, 2016 by Bob Ciura Verizon Communications' (NYSE: VZ ) stock has declined around 15% from its 52-week high. The market appears concerned that rising interest rates will negatively impact high-yield dividend stocks like telecoms. Verizon does have a lot of debt, after buying Verizon Wireless a few years back. But it also generates tens of billions of dollars each year in free cash flow. This allows it to pay down debt and pay a substantial dividend to shareholders. Income investors tend to favor telecoms because of their high dividend yields. Verizon is no exception. This stock has a nearly 5% dividend yield and the company raises its dividend regularly. In September, Verizon increased its dividend by 2%. That was its 10thconsecutive annual dividend increase. This makes Verizon a Dividend Achiever; a select group of stocks with 10+ consecutive years of dividend increases. You can see all 273 Dividend Achievers here . With interest rates still near historic lows, Verizon's 4.8% dividend yield could be a buying opportunity. Business Overview Verizon is a telecommunications company. It provides television, Internet, and phone service to business and residential customers. It operates in two main businesses: Verizon Wireless (71% of total revenue) Verizon Wireline (29% of total revenue) Verizon Wireless includes the company's cell phone service division. This is its most important business - the wireless segment has 35.8 million device payment plan phone connections. Wireless segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 44.9% last quarter , up 170 basis points year over year. Verizon generates very high profit margins and cash flow. This is because it operates in an oligopoly. Verizon and its close competitor AT&T (NYSE: T ) control about two-thirds of the wireless industry in the U.S. The reason is because there are very high barriers to entry. It would require billions of dollars to build a network that could compete on a similar scale as the two industry giants. This provides Verizon and AT&T with what Warren Buffett would refer to as an 'economic moat'. As a result, Verizon has produced solid growth over the past few years. Click to enlarge Source: 2015 Annual Report , page 4 The biggest driver of Verizon's huge cash flows is its wireless business. Click to enlarge Source: 2015 Annual Report , page 7 Verizon has invested significantly in its network and is reaping the benefits. Verizon raked in $21 billion of free cash flow in 2015 . The company allocated billions of free cash flow to shareholders. It paid $8.5 billion of dividends, and bought back $5.1 billion of its stock. Business conditions remain very positive for Verizon. Consumers love their cell phones and have a seemingly insatiable hunger for data. Verizon refers to its high-quality customer base as its driver of profitability. Verizon's customers are willing to pay higher prices for the company's top-tier network, which fuels high margins. This is especially true on the wireless side of the business. Verizon's churn, which represents customers that leave for a competing service, has held below 0.90% for six consecutive quarters . Growth Prospects One might assume the telecom industry is saturated in the U.S. But the good news for Verizon shareholders is that the company has several tailwinds for growth at its back. Click to enlarge Source: Third Quarter Earnings Presentation, page 13 Among Verizon's most important drivers of future growth are 5G, the Internet of Things (or IoT), and digital advertising. Approximately 90% of Verizon's traffic now resides on its 4G network. It is likely that 5G will be the next step in Verizon's growth. As demand for mobile video grows, so too will data requirements. 5G rollout will allow Verizon to strengthen its position as having the industry's strongest network. This will continue to be a competitive advantage for the company. Separately, the IoT will be a growth driver. IoT brings connected solutions to the physical environment. For example, increased connectivity at home and in automobiles. To expand in this area, Verizon is turning to acquisitions. It acquired Telogis this year to enter the connected car market. And, Verizon acquired Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion in the same area. Verizon's IoT revenue increased 18% last year, and the recent acquisitions pave the way for even greater growth. Lastly, Verizon has conducted acquisitions to build its digital advertising platform. To do this, it bought AOL for $4 billion and a collection of assets from Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) for nearly $5 billion. Dividend Analysis The one positive about Verizon's share price decline is that it has elevated the dividend yield to nearly 5%. This gives investors the opportunity to earn more than double the average dividend yield of the S&P 500. For income investors, Verizon's falling stock price could be viewed as a buying opportunity. Even more so, because the dividend looks highly sustainable going forward. After acquiring the rest of Verizon Wireless for $130 billion, Verizon has a lot of debt on the balance sheet. In fact, it ended last quarter with $103 billion of long-term debt. Fortunately, its debt appears to be manageable. Verizon has $3.5 billion in long-term debt coming due over the next year. Its debt is spread out over many years. And, since it generates such high free cash flow, it should have little trouble sustaining its dividend payments and raising its dividend modestly each year. Last year , Verizon had earnings-per-share of $3.99 and declared dividends of $2.23 per share. This means the company distributed 56% of its earnings-per-share last year as shareholder dividends. With a payout ratio slightly over half of annual earnings, Verizon has a comfortable dividend payout. Going forward, investors can expect annual dividend growth that at least matches inflation. This sets investors up well for income generation. Verizon offers a high dividend yield and enough dividend growth to protect its investors' purchasing power over time. Final Thoughts Investors never like to see a stock price decline. But the upside is that it elevates a stock's dividend yield. Verizon's share price decline in recent weeks has lifted its dividend yield up to 4.8%. Verizon is a consistently high paying dividend company with growth potential . Income investors looking for high, sustainable dividend yields have an opportunity to scoop up Verizon and its ~5% dividend yield. About this article:",

      "text": "Apple limiting iPhone 7 LTE speeds on Verizon to match AT&T model Data shows iPhone 7 not taking advantage of Verizon capabilities Apple refutes the claims of different download speeds \nApple has been accused of limiting the LTE performance of iPhone 7 models powered by Qualcomm chipset to match speeds of the Intel-powered models. Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 models on Verizon network should have higher download speeds on paper than Intel-powered ones AT&T, however, in testing, Bloomberg reports it was found that iPhone 7 models from both Verizon and AT&T had similar speeds in real life. \nThe Bloomberg report cited researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights for testing. Recode in a separate report citing sources claims that Apple indeed limited some iPhone 7 models featuring Qualcomm chipset to match the speeds of Intel-powered chipsets. \"It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible,\" said Ina Fried in her report. Apple has however refuted the claims of different download speeds. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller commenting on the report said, \"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\nFor those unaware, the iPhone 7 models sold through Verizon (and Sprint) feature Qualcomm's X12 modem which is claimed to offer maximum download speeds of up to 600Mbps while iPhone 7 models on AT&T (and T-Mobile) are powered by Intel chipset with a maximum download speed of up to 450Mbps. \nGabriel Tavridis, Head of Product at Twin Prime, on similar LTE speeds on the iPhone 7 models from Verizon and AT&T said, \"The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities. I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.\" Twin Prime from its internal testing claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S7 powered by the same Qualcomm X12 modem was way faster than the iPhone 7 on Verizon. \nThere's no question that two models powered by different modems will perform same, but if the test reports are correct, then it seems Apple thought it would be awkward if iPhone 7 models on Verizon were faster than the ones on AT&T (and T-Mobile).",

While the current A10 SoC is solely manufactured by TSMC, the LTE modem used on the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are either powered by Qualcomm or Intel. Now, a new report suggests that Apple may be throttling the speeds to offer a uniform experience on the new iPhone 7, irrespective of the carrier.

      "text": "Like many carriers, Verizon is generally pretty terrible when it comes to updating its devices. This month, for example, it finally delivered the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update to the BlackBerry Priv , over six months after the manufacturer said it was available . \nBut it seems Verizon is wasting little time in making Android 7.0 available to the Moto Z Droid and Z Force Droid. Following numerous reports from owners of the two devices, GSM Arena confirmed that the update is indeed rolling out over-the-air to both handsets. \nThe update is roughly 1.5GB in size, and bumps the software version of Verizon's Moto Z up to NCL26.86-11; and that of the Z Force up to NCL25.86-11. Among the new features that users can expect are a new Data Saver function, quick app switching, split-screen mode, and Quick Settings customization options.",

      "text": "Verizon \nHere’s the surprise of the week: the Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid on Verizon are getting an update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Speedy updates have gone downhill since Lenovo took over Motorola, and Verizon isn’t exactly known to be first to the party as far as the latest updates go. So, this is quite the surprise — a surprise owners of these two Droid devices are going to like very much. \nJoin us after the break for details. \nVerizon and Lenovo together launched the Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid over the summer. Just a few months later, they’re bringing Android 7.0 Nougat to the duo. It’s certainly a surprise, especially when you consider that Nexus devices (and now Pixel handsets) are the first to get the latest flavor of Android. After those two brands get it, it usually takes awhile for the latest version of Android to catch on with other manufacturers. \nBut no, not this time around. Android 7.0 Nougat is rolling out to the Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid right now. You’re not getting version 7.1, but you’re still getting the latest flavor of Android, and with the November 1 Android security patch level, too. \nThere’s plenty of neat things that Android 7.0 Nougat is bringing to the two devices, but what might be the most exciting is that this update makes them Daydream compatible. In other words, after this update, you’ll be able to use the Daydream View with either smartphone. \nThis now means that there are four devices now Daydream compatible — the Pixel phones, the ZTE Axon 7 and now the Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid. \nIf you’re on Verizon and have either the Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Force Droid, keep an eye out for the update! And now that this is rolling out to the two Droid versions on Verizon, we can’t imagine it’ll be long before their Lenovo counterparts get the update as well.

      "text": "Bluegrass LTE-A plans with Verizon push rural carrier deeper into 4G market with 5G plans for segment on the horizon. Networks advances may be common across the domestic market’s nationwide operators, but rural carriers are also getting in on advancing their LTE-based “4G” networks.\nThe most recent is Bluegrass Cellular, which announced it has rolled out LTE-Advanced updates said to provide 50% faster download speeds “combining multiple wireless connections for added capacity, which then increases speed for users.” The Kentucky-based carrier said customers will not be charged a premium for access to the higher speeds.\nCustomers will need to have compatible devices, which at the moment includes the HTC One M9; Apple iPhone models 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, SE and the iPad Pro; LG G4, G5, V10 and V20; and Samsung’s Galaxy Note 5, S6, S6 Edge, S7 and S7 Edge.\nThe upgrade is part of Bluegrass’ LTE deployment work with nationwide operator Verizon Wireless, which Bluegrass works with through the larger carrier’s LTE in Rural America program. Verizon Wireless in late August rolled out its LTE-A upgrades under the “LTE Advanced” banner, claiming the same 50% increase in download speeds by using carrier aggregation to combine spectrum channels across the 700 MHz, 1.7/2.1 GHz and 1.9 GHz bands.\nAccording to Verizon Wireless, two-channel carrier aggregation can boost peak download speeds to 225 megabits per second, and three-channel carrier aggregation can boost speeds to around 300 Mbps.\nBluegrass in 2010, was the first rural operator to sign up for Verizon Wireless’ somewhat controversial LTE in Rural America program. The agreement called for Verizon Wireless to lease upper C-Block 700 MHz wireless spectrum in the Bluegrass Cellular service areas where Verizon Wireless did not plan on constructing its network. \nThe program relies on tower and backhaul assets from rural operators, with Verizon Wireless offering up 22 megahertz of wireless spectrum and core LTE equipment. The deal also provides for a reciprocal roaming arrangement between the parties.\nVerizon Wireless said it has signed up 21 operators across 15 states to the program, and announced late last year all participating rural carriers had launched LTE services as part of the program. Bluegrass completed its 5-year build late last year, which included 115 new LTE sites providing coverage to 732,000 potential customers in a 10,300 square mile radius.\nBluegrass Cellular’s LTE network launched in connection with Verizon Wireless should not be confused with the carrier’s self-launched GetSetGo fixed-wireless LTE network , which it launched in 2013. That offering runs across the carrier’s 700 MHz, A-Block spectrum and relies on a fixed, wireless router device to provide consumers with an in-home broadband connection. The service was initially launched to meet Federal Communication Commission build-out requirements for its spectrum licenses.\nThe LRA program initially rubbed some operators and trade associations the wrong way , though operators that have signed up for the plan note it has allowed them to quickly launch LTE services.\nRural carriers balance 4G on road to 5G At the recent Competitive Carriers Association Annual Convention , a number of rural carriers talked about the current balance of rolling out LTE networks with next-generation “5G” networks on the horizon. \nSlayton Stewart, CEO of Carolina West, cited some frustration in the fact technology is advancing so rapidly in terms of network equipment that it is difficult for a smaller carrier to keep pace. He also noted smaller carriers need to keep pace with what their larger roaming partners are doing in terms of network deployments in order to maintain those roaming arrangements.\nIn terms of 5G plans, Stewart said that with Carolina West just now getting toward the end of its planned LTE deployments, it is looking to perhaps recoup some of those costs first before jumping into a new network evolution.\nHu Meena, president and CEO of C Spire, noted the carrier recently conducted fixed wireless “5G” use cases with vendor partner Nokia that achieved network speeds up to 2.2 gigabits per second using spectrum in the 28 GHz band. Meena noted C Spire had picked up the spectrum assets 20 years ago and was now just able to find a use for the licenses.\nSimilar to Verizon Wireless’ partnership efforts, T-Mobile US used the event to push for greater collaboration between rural carriers and larger operators on technology advancements. \n“We want to be the best damn roaming partner you can ever wish for,” said T-Mobile US CTO Neville Ray, at the event, but added the carrier “needed LTE.”\n“We want LTE across the entire nation … from both roaming and organic footprint growth,” Ray said. “We don’t need to build all of this network ourselves … and we will be the best damn partner you have ever had, guaranteed.”\nRay also noted the move toward voice-over-LTE services would allow the carrier and CCA members to get past the voice challenge of roaming deals between the GSM-based nationwide operator and many of CCA’s members that rely on CDMA-based networks for voice support.\n“We don’t care about the old CDMA vs. GSM as we have VoLTE now,” Ray said. “No one understands VoLTE better than us and we can help in launching VoLTE. … It’s an open door from T-Mobile on that front.”\nBored?

      "text": "0 \nThe Moto Mods are something that Motorola has added so that users will be able to add new, useful things for their Moto Z devices and its variants, both from Motorola itself and from partners. One of the new mods that they’ve announced is the mophie Juice Pack, to give your smartphone extended battery life, 3,000mAh to be exact. Verizon has announced they’re now accepting pre-orders for the mod which will start shipping out later this month. \nThe Mophie Juice Pack is especially handy for those people who use their Moto Z devices heavily when they’re mobile and don’t have access to outlets and their powerbanks have run out. The mod snaps right into the back of the Moto Z, the Moto Z Force, and the Moto Z Play smartphones, as long as they’re on the Modo Mods platform 1.0 or later. It has a 3,000mAh battery that can give you 60% extra battery \nIt also comes with a set of lights that will show you the charge levels of your device so you can actually save the juice in case your phone is already charged enough. And if you have time for a quick charge, it comes with a USB Type-C port for 15W, which will charge both the battery and the phone itself. \nYou can already start pre-ordering your Mophie Juice Pack from Verizon. You need only shell out $79.99 to get one of these. They start shipping to buyers by November 28. There is no indication if this is just an initial price or this will be the SRP once it starts becoming available in retail stores.",

      "title": "Apple reportedly limits Verizon iPhone 7 modem speed to match AT&T model",
      "text": "Apple has been limiting the modem speeds of the iPhone 7 built for Verizon Wireless's network in order to match the slower speeds of the AT&T iPhone, according to reports Friday by Bloomberg and Recode .\nThe Verizon iPhone 7 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon X12 modem that is capable of LTE download speeds of up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T model uses an Intel XMM 7360 that goes up to 450Mbps. But Apple limits the Verizon model so that it performs similarly to the AT&T one; to achieve this, Apple may disable certain features of the network chip, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg's report is based on data from testing firms including Cellular Insights, which wrote about its findings on its blog .\n\"Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41,\" Cellular Insights analyst Milan Milanovic wrote. \"Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers.\"\nThe Verizon iPhone was still slightly faster than the AT&T one despite not reaching its full capabilities, according to field tests by Twin Prime , Bloomberg wrote. The iPhone was significantly slower on Verizon than the Samsung Galaxy S7, which uses the same Qualcomm chip.\nThe Verizon model is also used for the Sprint network, while the AT&T model is also used on the T-Mobile USA network. The AT&T/T-Mobile variant does not support the CDMA voice and data networks used by Verizon and Sprint.\nAn iPhone user isn't going to hit 450Mbps under typical network conditions, so it's unlikely anyone would notice the speed limitation without doing some extensive testing. But the enforcement of consistent speeds despite the use of different chips demonstrates how Apple and carriers view the importance of similar performance across networks, even when that requires limiting one phone's capabilities.\nApple historically used Qualcomm modems for the iPhone but this year decided to use both Qualcomm and Intel ones . \"By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price,\" Bloomberg noted.\nApple also uses components from multiple suppliers to make sure it can produce enough iPhones to meet consumer demand . For example, Apple used both Samsung and TSMC to make the A9 chip for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.\nSince carriers had no control over the modem decision, \"it would be a little unfair if Apple allowed, say, Verizon and Sprint to say that their iPhone performs better than AT&T and T-Mobile’s,\" Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said, according to Recode.\nDawson also noted that it isn't uncommon for phone makers to leave some features disabled to save on battery life, \"so you rarely see a phone that’s maxed out on all possible performance parameters.\"\nApple provided a statement to Bloomberg and Recode confirming that iPhones across different networks perform similarly, but the statement did not address how Apple limited the speeds of the Qualcomm modem. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models,\" Apple said.\nWe contacted Apple today, but the company declined to provide any further information.",

While this brings many of the best features from the latest version of Android, it actually marks a first in the smartphone market. \nThese are the first smartphones from another manufacturer to be recognized by Google as Daydream-ready devices – a distinction given to phones that have been certified for the Daydream platform and are built for VR with high-resolution displays, ultra-smooth graphics and high-fidelity sensors for precise head tracking. \nNow that the devices are receiving the update, this marks the first non- Pixel devices to be certified as “Daydream Ready”. With this ability, this means that the Moto Z and Moto Z Force can be used with the new Daydream View headset so that you can experience everything that Google has integrated into the latest version of Android.",

      "text": "Verizon is now competing with Facebook and Google in tracking consumers’ personal data Despite “privacy concerns” appearing consistently in consumers’ top reasons for using an ad blocker. Lowell McAdam, chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications, talks on his cellphone as he attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Drew Angerer / Getty Verizon has topped itself by playing Russian roulette with consumer trust in an attempt to compete with the advertising businesses of Google and Facebook. In an email announcement last Sunday night to select subscribers, Verizon signaled how it intends to compete with those two powerhouses, outlining its plan to combine offline information, such as postal address, email address and device type, with AOL browser cookies, Apple and Google advertising IDs, and their own unique identifier header. Coupled with all of their customers’ browsing history and app usage, this mass of customer data will make for a rich competitive product to Facebook and Google. Facebook, Google and now Verizon are in fast pursuit of the holy grail for digital advertising — syncing up a consumers’ personally identifiable information with all browsing history and app usage. There’s just one problem: This practice requires explicit opt-in consent from consumers under the new FCC privacy rules . Although the rules are not yet required to be adopted (and notably on the chopping block in a Trump presidency), it's hard to argue that Verizon’s plan doesn't violate the spirit of the rulemaking. Verizon’s unilateral move to compete with Google and Facebook is likely due to the fact that the well-documented “ duopoly” collectively takes more than 100 percent of the incremental growth in digital advertising — their gravy train is tied to the data which fuels their direct-marketing businesses. Why? Because Google and Facebook have a unique ability to link up personally identified users with browsing history, app usage and location across the device graph. It’s been nearly two years since I wrote for Recode about Verizon and Turn’s massive zombie cookie stumble which ultimately led to an FCC investigation and settlement . It was a prime example of the breakdown in consumer trust, which we had been highlighting for years, and presciently previewed the ad blocking crisis to come. It also inspired DCN to express its concern to the FCC when the agency deliberated how to enforce privacy rules for broadband. After all, ISPs have a unique ability to see nearly all of your internet traffic, not unlike Google and Facebook. Whether it’s a third party like Facebook or Google tracking across the web, or an ISP leveraging its distribution arm, this is outside of consumer expectations. Enter ad blocking. The primary consumer grievances inspiring installation of ad blockers are now widely understood: Ads infringe on user privacy, obscure content, expose users’ devices to security hazards, and hoover up bandwidth and slow page loads. As the IAB’s LEAN standards bear fruit, we expect several of these concerns to be pacified. However, the industry is willfully ignoring the canary in the coal mine — consumer privacy. While the “A” in LEAN refers to the industry’s self-regulatory AdChoices program, consumers need even more protection and better privacy tools. Meanwhile, Facebook, Google and now Verizon are instead accelerating their tracking efforts, despite privacy concerns appearing consistently in the top reasons for using an ad blocker. They are in fast pursuit of the holy grail for digital advertising — syncing up a consumers’ personally-identifiable information with all browsing history and app usage: Facebook was the first company to do this at scale across devices, due to its persistent login for the service. The social network was only missing an ability to track browsing history and app usage across the web, which it solved in 2014 by proliferating the web with “Like” buttons to passively track consumer web usage under the disguise of being a consumer feature. Google held fast on its privacy promise for nearly a decade until the pressures to compete with Facebook and link up personal info across devices became too significant. In October, investigative reporter Julia Angwin uncovered that Google had quietly erased its ban on personally identifiable web tracking by linking up its massive DoubleClick tracking arm with its personal info from Gmail. The most extensive data brokers can collect thousands of points of data on consumers, but their accuracy and capabilities are limited by not being able to link up to personal information. My most recent review of BlueKai’s detailed registry of what they think they know about me was littered with bad information. Whether it’s a third party like Facebook or Google tracking across the web or an ISP leveraging its distribution arm, this is outside of consumer expectations. Importantly to the digital media industry, it also devalues the context and relationship of consumer trust which drives the businesses of premium publishers. While we were hopeful that the new FCC privacy rules would shift value back to publishers , we now recognize that they’re in limbo without backing from the White House. It’s unfortunate that Verizon has chosen to bury them before the new guy even shows up at the door. Advantage: Ad blocking.

      "text": "@VZWkarens \nAs wildfires burn through the southern Appalachians across seven states in the southeastern US, Verizon is responding with support for firefighters, the US Forest Service, support personnel and impacted residents. \nRelentless drought and years of forest floor build-up have resulted in more than 30 still uncontained wildfires that have already burned a total of 128,000 acres. More than 5,000 firefighters and support personnel from at least 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are battling blazes in the fire zone-covering areas in northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee into eastern Kentucky, the western Carolinas and parts of surrounding states. \nDuring an emergency, first responders rely on wireless more than ever to coordinate efforts in the face of fire, flood, snow and wind storm, earthquakes, tornados, or hurricanes. When the southern Appalachian wildfires ignited, Verizon Network teams immediately began monitoring network performance in affected areas to ensure residents and emergency crews could communicate. \nAs wildfires burn through the southern Appalachians across seven states in the southeastern US, Verizon is responding with support for firefighters, the US Forest Service, support personnel and impacted residents. Adding wireless capacity through CoLTs \nIn addition to monitoring for sustained network performance, Verizon has actively supported emergency responders by deploying two CoLTs (Cells on Light Trucks), which are temporary generator-powered mobile cell sites with multiple voice and data channels capable of processing thousands of calls and data transmissions simultaneously. These CoLTs provide additional wireless capacity for emergency crews accessing the Internet, sending text and video messages and making phone calls during disaster response efforts. \nTo accompany this increased network capacity, Verizon has delivered wireless phones and internet hotspots for the Forestry Service to use in their efforts and has set up a charging station at a fire department in NC to help keep wireless equipment charged and ready for use. In addition to providing reliable connections and added network capacity for the brave heroes fighting the raging wildfires, we were pleased to provide a truck of water and sports drinks for firefighters and support personnel to help keep them hydrated and healthy while they protect the residents of these areas. \nHaving the best, most reliable 4G LTE network and being there for our customers is never more important than in times of emergencies. We were there during the Louisiana floods. We supported our communities throughout Hurricane Matthew. We provided essential support during the West Coast wildfires. We never left South Carolina’s side during the floods earlier this year. And we are here for our communities now. Being crisis-ready and crisis-proven is paramount to Verizon, and we are committed to supporting those who need us most. Tags:",

      "title": "Red Pocket 1 Year Prepaid Wireless Plan Deal Spotted on ebay",
      "text": "A few months ago, it was announced that Red Pocket will be offering one-year plans under Verizon's LTE service. A previous post showed that the plan was priced at $199.99 for a year's service. But according to Red Pocket, the original list price for the plan posted on ebay is $399.\n\nFor a limited time, you can take advantage of Red Pocket's promotion. Instead of paying $399, you'll only have to pay $149.99 for a one-year prepaid wireless plan from the MVNO. As a prepaid plan, you won't have to worry about any contracts.\n\nThe plan includes:\n1,000 minutes 1,000 texts 1,000 MB of data The service works with almost any unlocked, GSM or CDMA device. The only requirement is that your wireless contract should have already ended and that you have a good standing account with your former carrier. To avoid issues, Red Pocket recommends using the SIM cards from the Starter Kit. But if you are already a Red Pocket customer or using a non-LTE CDMA or Sprint device, you don't need to use the Starter Kit SIM cards. you can simply activate your phone at myeasyactivation.com after receiving your activation code via email. \n\nSource: SlickDeals PrepaidPhoneNews.com Some Rights Reserved .

Applicable taxes and surcharges will apply in both cases.The quake struck east of Fukushima at around 6am on Tuesday and prompted urgent warnings for people to leave low-lying areas in the Fukishima and Miyagi prefectures as tsunami waves hit shores. There are no reports of severe injuries from the quake, but the same region was hit by a series of weaker quakes in the following few hours.",

      "text": "Verizon’s New Digital Ad Plan May Overlook User Privacy   Justin Diaz \nVerizon is preparing to implement its plans for competing with Google and Facebook on digital advertising. The customer data tracking efforts which it has recently discussed include a collective of data that should allow it to rival two of the biggest global internet companies when it comes to amounting customer information for advertising purposes. While Google collects the majority of its customer information from things like browsing and search history through Chrome and Google Search, Facebook is able to gather its information from all of the data made public via its social media site, while both have more than a few apps that are able to provide the data as well. Verizon had recently made it known as of last week that it wants a share of the digital advertising growth, and it seems to be doing while looking the other way in regards to the privacy of its customers. \nVerizon’s plans are to combine data from numerous sources, including cookies from the AOL browser, their unique identifier header, and Apple and Google advertising IDs. Verizon isn’t stopping there, though, as its plans is to take all of those data sources and further combine them with data from various offline means, like a person’s physical address, email address, and what devices they’re using, which Verizon already has access to from the get go with their customers, as a physical address and email address are needed to set up a Verizon Wireless service account, and once the account is set up the device type eventually comes into play when a customer finalizes the service activation process. \nAccording to recode, Verizon began vocalizing their plans to some of their service subscribers through emails that were sent out on Sunday, November 13th. Even though they were telling customers about their plans for the new initiatives with which they plan to acquire data and use for advertising, some subscribers is not all subscribers, and as recode notes, grabbing all of this data from consumers through the multiple means which here highlighted requires opt-in consent from the customer as per the FCC’s privacy rules. Having said that, policies could very well change after January, and Verizon is not technically obligated to follow these rules just yet as there is no current requirement to adopt them as of right now, and if they’re reversed under the new administration, Verizon may not end up needing consent from customers in the long run anyway, which could be a part of why they have initiated the start of these new changes at this time.

Even though the pair were manufactured by HTC, they are the first smartphones designed by Google. Data from Wave 7 indicates that the two Pixel models made up 7.5% of all activations at Verizon during the last month.Verizon and Google are spending big bucks promoting the handsets. From October 27th through November 2nd, Google spent $15 million on ads for the Pixel and Pixel XL. During that same time period, Verizon spent $12 million on advertising for the same phones. While Verizon has an exclusive on the Pixel phones in the U.S., that didn't stop T-Mobile from offering a 50% refund ($325 USD) to buyers of the unlocked 32GB Pixel who end up activating the phone on T-Mobile . Verizon, as you would expect, is the one U.S. mobile operator that is really taking advantage of the popularity of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Compare the Pixel's 7.5% share of Verizon's activations over the last month, to the 0% to 2% share of activations that the Pixel and Pixel XL are responsible for at other stateside carriers. If AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint can start selling the phones over the next few weeks, Wave 7 sees sales of the Pixel and Pixel XL exploding in the U.S. Speaking of the U.S., the phones are now available in the states at Best Buy, the Google Store, and Verizon.

I am disabled handicapped living in country by myself with phone my lifeline!!”",

      "text": "Courtesy of NBC November 22, 2016 | 06:00AM PT \nSports fans can live-stream the Super Bowl and the Olympics. Now, aficionados of Macy’s annual Thanksgiving Day Parade will have a to get a digital take of the proceedings. \nNBCUniversal and Macy’s will make a video feed of the annual spectacle available on Verizon’s YouTube page as part of a marketing partnership. The maneuver gives people who want to watch the event an option other than the NBC telecast for the first time since the network began its parade telecasts in 1952, and bring a new-media dimension to the venerable Macy’s event, which began snaking through New York City’s concrete canyons in 1924. Under the terms of the package, Verizon will stream the parade with five cameras placed along the route capable of beaming 360-degree views to users, and festoon the view with pop-up graphics offering facts about the proceedings. Actors Marlon Wayans and Olivia Culpo will curate the program. \n“We’ve never really focused on an alternate viewing experience,” said Alison Tarrant , executive vice president of client partnerships at NBCUniversal, in an interview. “This is a big step for this broadcast.” The live stream will be available on Verizon’s YouTube page, http://www.youtube.com/verizon . \nThe new means of watching an old TV institution arrives as Madison Avenue is seeking different ways to partner with the industry overall. While traditional TV commercials thrive, marketers are placing new emphasis on devising content that dovetails with the programming that attracted viewers in the first place, rather than interrupting a show with messages routinely viewed as something of an annoyance. The emerging model is sprouting in various places, as anyone who has seen NBC late-night host Seth Meyers do on-set commercials for Amazon or watched Taco Bell sponsor an ongoing series of vignettes from “Fear the Walking Dead” in ad breaks on AMC can tell you. Related If The 30-Second TV Ad Is Dying, TV Networks Are Helping To Kill It \n“This partnership enables us to create content together that we would not have been able to do on our own,” said Tarrant. \nBut there are other benefits as well. The YouTube stream might appeal to people on the go for the holiday who must rely on a mobile device to get a view of the annual parade. Or it might serve as a sort of “second-screen” enhancer for viewers already at home watching the event through traditional means. \nNBCUniversal will promote the digital stream in live mentions on several of its programs, through social-media posts and with ads that appear on the company’s various TV networks. \nFinancial terms of the arrangement could not be learned. Zenith, one of the media-buying units of Publicis Media, helped put the deal together for Verizon.",

      "text": "Google Pixel Doing Wonders For Verizon Sales By Adnan Farooqui on 11/22/2016 08:23 PST \nThe Pixel is the first smartphone that’s “ Made by Google ” and the search giant is making sure that this fact stands out. It hard at work pushing the new flagship smartphone to customers. The company decided to make the Pixel exclusive to Verizon in the United States even though it’s selling unlocked and off-contract versions of the flagship through its online store. The Pixel appears to be doing wonders for Verizon sales. \nA new report from Wave7 Research shows that the Pixel is selling well at Verizon even though customers have the option to pick it up unlocked and off-contract. \nThe report shows that the Pixel accounted for 7.5 percent of all smartphone activations on Verizon over the past month. That’s a big deal when you consider that Verizon is the biggest mobile carrier in the United States and that the holiday season is just around the corner. \nThe uptick in activations can be attributed to Google ’s massive marketing campaign for the Pixel but it’s not like Verizon isn’t chipping in. Big Red is running its own campaigns on TV to promote the Pixel and the expenditure is clearly paying off. \nThe report mentions that in just one week from October 27th to November 2nd, Google spent almost $15 million on ads for the Pixel while Verizon spent an additional $12 million. That’s a whole lot of money to be spent on campaigns over a week and that’s clearly going to result in an uptick in sales. \nFiled in Cellphones . Read more about Google , pixel and Verizon .

      "text": "\nVerizon ’s reputation as an exclusive Google Pixel reseller may have proven to be a success for the carrier. Based on data from research company Wave7 , Fierce Wireless reports that the Pixel accounted for “7.5% of activations at Verizon stores” over the last month, while other carriers are trailing behind.\nThe Pixel isn’t inherently tied to Verizon: it’s also available unlocked from Google and Best Buy . However, Google partnered with Verizon to get the devices out in stores, and it’s the only carrier listed on Google’s store page as an official reseller. What’s more, both Google and Verizon made significant attempts to market the product, with Verizon spending an estimated $12 million and Google an estimated $15 million on Pixel advertising in a single week.\nThe result is the comparatively high ratio of activations on Verizon, while activations in other carrier stores, like T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint are said to be in the “0-2 range” (we assume this means percent but have reached out for clarification).\nSee also: Best Verizon prepaid Android phones (November 2016) 6 days ago In an attempt to steal the spotlight from Verizon shortly after the Pixel launch, T-Mobile announced that it would offer a $325 discount to Google Pixel owners who took out a T-Mobile One plan . Google hasn’t commented on the overall sales numbers for the Pixels, but said that the pre-order demand had exceeded its expectations .",

      "text": "NBCU, Verizon Add Live Stream to Thanksgiving Day Parade Menu 360-degree cameras used for production appearing on YouTube 11/22/2016 09:00:00 AM Eastern Follow @jlafayette \nThe 90-year-old Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is jumping into the digital video age, with a boost from NBCUniversal and Verizon. \nNBCU is producing a livestream of the parade that will be shot with 360-degree cameras that will be available on Verizon’s YouTube page. Verizon is a sponsor of NBC’s broadcast of the parade and will also be integrated into the streaming coverage. \nThe streaming presentation will be totally separate from the broadcast, using only footage from the five special cameras along the parade route that give viewers a more up-close look at the balloons, floats and bands. \nThe coverage will feature a special program hosted by Marlon Wayans and Olivia Culpo, who during the parade will demonstrate the new Google Pixel phone being offered by Verizon. \n“With Verizon, we’re leaning-in to technology to bring the ‘Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade’ to audiences at home in a way that has never been done before,” said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships at NBCUniversal. “This partnership shows NBCUniversal’s continued commitment to develop unique solutions for clients and enhance how our viewers watch content regardless of platform.” \nThe livestream will open with an animation highlighting Verizon and Macy’s roles in the presentation. During the live steam, a bug in the corner of the screen will promote Macy’s and Verizon, and Verizon will be mentioned as a sponsor. \n“We are always looking for new and creative ways to transform the way content is delivered to consumers,” said John Nitti, chief media officer at Verizon. “With this partnership, we are providing a front row seat to the parade regardless of where you are. By leveraging the latest technology, the 360 live stream offers an immersive experience coupled with curated programming, and brings a first-of-its-kind experience to consumers on Verizon’s YouTube page.” \nVerizon is locked in a tough battle in the mobile phone business and is looking for way to make its network stand out and a high profile sponsorship that demonstrates tech leadership might be good for its image. \nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. \nNBCU began promoting Verizon’s live stream of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade during Sunday Night Football . Another high-profile promo ran during the Today show Monday, according Alison Tarrant, executive VP of client partnerships at NBCU. The live stream will also be promoted on a number of other NBCU properties, including E!, USA and Syfy. \nDuring the parade broadcast on NBC, viewers will be urged to check out the live stream, but Tarrant notes “we don’t want to lose our TV audience. It’s a very sensitive balance for us.” \nTarrant says Verizon came to NBCU with the idea of a live stream and that NBCU worked closely with Verizon, its agency Zenith, Macy’s and YouTube to bring the idea to life. \nUsing the 360-degree cameras should produce a distinct point of view about the parade, giving viewers who’ve never attended the event in person a taste of what it’s like to be among the crowd, the giant balloon and bands. “It will really heighten that experience for those at home.” \n“The goal here is with the audience having a richer experience,” she says, adding that social media—including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter—will be used to promote and enhance the experience. \n\"We are extremely excited to partner with NBCUniversal and Verizon to bring millions of fans a new way to experience our total Parade. Via 360 cameras positioned at strategic points along the route, spectators nationwide can experience what 3.5 million people enjoy live in Manhattan,\" said Amy Kule, executive producer of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. \"From the national telecast on NBC to the 360 experience on Verizon's YouTube channel, the 90th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will be more accessible than ever before.\" \nMarlon Wayans is the star, creator and executive producer of the new NBC sitcom Marlon premiering in early 2017. He also has a Netflix film Naked coming out next year. On social media, Wayans is very active with nearly 10 million followers across all platforms.  ",

      "text": "by Colin Gibbs | Nov 22, 2016 12:03pm \nVerizon’s ongoing spending spree in digital media is likely to produce incremental advantages rather than an immediate payday, Barclays analysts said. \nThe nation’s largest mobile network operator is looking to build a media empire through a series of acquisitions. Last year it bought AOL for $4.4 billion , and it may soon finalize its $4.83 billion deal to acquire Yahoo (although the future of that agreement is still uncertain following the major hack of Yahoo’s customer information). Meanwhile, Verizon recently bought the web-video startup Vessel for an undisclosed sum, and it continues to pursue Go90, an OTT video offering aimed at young mobile users. \nThose transactions are small, of course, compared to AT&T’s proposed $85 billion takeover of Time Warner . But both carriers are clearly looking to generate content and advertising revenues to offset slowing growth in the U.S. mobile market. Verizon’s strategy appears to be more moderate to enable the carrier to monitor consumption trends in a fast-moving market, Barclays analysts wrote. \n“While to some Verizon’s MediaCo strategy seems piecemeal, our deeper exploration suggests a deliberate multiyear initiative designed to 1) address how it believes media consumption will evolve, and 2) fit with its broader expectations around network evolution,” the analysts wrote in a research note to investors. “Specifically, the company’s goals are to embrace content tailored towards new forms of consumption/creation, open up additional revenues for revenue growth at the service layer (advertising, etc.), shift away from current content cost structures towards pay per use, embrace OTT distribution, and create a framework in supporting new content options that can possibly rival those provided by cable operators.” \nRELATED: Oppenheimer downgrades Verizon over Yahoo pursuit, other concerns \nIndeed, Verizon has some important pieces in place as it seeks to expand beyond its traditional telecom business. It has powerful advertising weapons in AOL and Millennial Media; a broad base of mobile users in the U.S. and Yahoo’s worldwide distribution footprint. Crucially, it also will be able to access vast amounts of data to deliver highly targeted—which means highly lucrative—ads to consumers around the world and across devices. \nGoogle and Facebook are the two dominant online advertising platforms in the U.S., of course, and Verizon has made no secret that it hopes to make a run at the No. 3 spot. Putting all those pieces in place will require nearly flawless execution, though—and it won’t result in huge new revenue streams overnight. \n“Although MediaCo will likely face tough competition and high execution risk, in the mid-term we believe its strategy can still benefit from a large and growing digital ad market, even if it remains in a distant third position,” Barclays said. “That being said, the initiative is unlikely to drive a material financial benefit for several years and still comes with high execution/adoption risk. Thus we believe its strategy bears monitoring as the divergent video/media strategies of all distributors—all still unproven—will clearly drive meaningful longer-term competitive implications.” Read more on",

      "text": "Yorktown Police Strike $153k Deal with Verizon to Build New Cell Tower Content Options By GABRIELLE BILIK November 22, 2016 at 1:07 PM \nYORKTOWN, N.Y. - The Yorktown Police Department and Verizon Wireless have entered into an agreement under which Verizon will build and maintain a new cell tower at police headquarters, replacing a 25-year-old tower owned by the town and used by first responders. The company will also provide a new dispatching radio system—valued at about $50,000—for the department. \nChief Robert Noble presented the plans at the Nov. 15 Town Board meeting and said his predecessor, former chief Daniel McMahon, and Town Attorney Michael J. McDermott were instrumental in developing the terms of the lease. \nThe new tower will be built further behind the existing tower and will be taller, McDermott said. The exact height of the new tower was not available. The current tower, which has been there for 25 years, is owned by the town of Yorktown and is not affiliated with any wireless cell phone service providers, McDermott said. It is used by the Yorktown Police Department as well as other emergency first responders such as local fire departments, ambulance corps and the F.B.I. The tower will be taken down only when the new one is constructed. \nSign Up for E-News \nMcDermott said Verizon approached the town about building a cell phone tower at police department headquarters because the location is ideal for optimum coverage. In exchange for allowing the cell tower to be built, Verizon agreed to move users of the existing tower to the new tower. \n“The town is getting an enormous financial benefit in the way of donations of hardware, other equipment and labor, all at no cost to the taxpayers of the town,” McDermott said. \nCurrently, McDermott said, the lease agreement has been signed by both parties and the project has moved into the planning stage. The building department will vet the plans and issue permits accordingly. Although excavation has begun, McDermott said, he is unsure of the exact dates construction will begin. \nAltogether, the improvements that will be made amount to $153,139.60. The lease is for five years with the option of four additional terms at five-year intervals for up to 25 years. The initial rent is $18,000 annually with a 2 percent increase after that. \nAccording to the terms of the lease, the town will receive 20 percent of any revenue earned if Verizon subleases antennae space to other wireless providers. McDermott said the estimated revenue to the town will be an additional $20,000 per year. \nVerizon has also agreed to provide an automated gate to protect the tower and property, remove and dispose of the old cell tower and build a concrete pad and shelter to house equipment for the new tower, Noble said. \nAccording to Noble, the town is due for a new tower and referred to the current one as a “majestic rusted piece of steel.” \n“To see that thing coming down—that’s kind of nice,” he said. \nNoble also said the department is ready for a new public-safety software provider and will be switching to Impact Safety Systems Inc., which currently services 22 other police departments in Westchester County. \n“It became readily apparent to us that there were efficiencies to be gained by switching to Impact,” Noble said. \nEfficiencies mentioned included: saving money on annual server maintenance fees, eliminating the duplication of report writing and streamlining report writing obligations of the department. \nNoble said the changes will hopefully allow the department to spend more time in the field rather than doing paperwork. \nJonathan Williams, senior account manager for Impact, gave a brief presentation at last week’s town board meeting about Impact’s services. He said the company will export and convert data from the department’s old system into the new. Impact’s data management system will allow officers to have web access to files and data from patrol cars and at the department. \n“I believe it’s going to eliminate some of the redundancies,” Noble said. He said he hopes much of the information that has to be written repeatedly into several documents can be typed into a field and seamlessly inserted into new files with the new software. \n“This is one-stop shopping,” he said. “On a whole [it’s] a lot more efficient than the system we’re using now.” \nThe town board also approved the $73,034 purchase of 13 new patrol tablets from Patrol PC and the accompanying hardware and software upgrades. Noble said much of New York State is converting to paperless methods of issuing tickets and performing other patrol duties such as scanning registrations, taking photographs and sending live video feeds of evidence, which can all be done with the tablets. \n“We’re going to be ahead of the game now by going to this,” Noble said. \nThe board also approved the purchase of new portable radios for the department. Noble said the current ones in use are 20 years old and cost more than they are worth to evaluate and repair when they break down. The board also approved the purchase of two license plate readers. \n“The town board thought it very important for the public to know what’s going on and what we’re doing in the police department,” said Town Supervisor Michael Grace. “Sounds like great stuff.” You May Also Like",

      "text": "By James Walker 1 hour ago in Technology Apple is deliberately throttling the iPhone 7's performance on Verizon's network so it matches the AT&T version, according to recent reports. The two versions of the handset have different modems inside, one of which is dramatically faster than the other. Apple's iPhone is famous for being universal – aside from colour and storage, every device is effectively identical. With the iPhone 7, Apple dual-sourced a critical component though. Some handsets have a wireless modem from Qualcomm while others come with one from Intel. The difference here is more important than in other dual-sourced components. The Qualcomm chip outperforms its Intel rival considerably, offering 600Mbps download speeds. In contrast, Intel's offering provides 450Mbps. Both theoretical transfer rates are very high but Qualcomm's X12 has a clear edge overall. Apple supplied the Qualcomm-equipped iPhone 7 to Verizon while the Intel ones are being sold to AT&T. According to the spec sheet, handsets bought from Verizon should offer noticeably faster transfers under test conditions. In practice, this isn't happening, according to reports from Bloomberg and Recode on Friday. Apple appears to have deliberately limited the faster Qualcomm chip's top speed so it matches the performance of its lesser Intel rival. Testing of the two models by Twin Prime revealed the Qualcomm modem is being throttled significantly. It still outperforms the Intel version but is being limited from reaching its full potential. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7, powered by the same modem, it's clear that Apple has tweaked Verizon's iPhone 7 to reduce the performance discrepancies with the AT&T model. Additional testing by Cellular Insights presented the same results. iPhone 7 modem performance - Qualcomm vs Intel vs Qualcomm Samsung Galaxy S7 [Image via Bloomberg / Twin Prime] Twin Prime / Bloomberg \"The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities,\" said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime to Bloomberg . \"I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.\" In reality, no mobile network user is ever going to see speeds anywhere near 450Mbps, even with optimum wireless conditions. The throttling won't be noticed by customers during regular handset use. Its presence suggests Apple still needs every iPhone to operate identically, even with different, superior hardware, on the U.S. networks. \"It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product,\" Insinet analyst Jeff Kvaal commented to Bloomberg . Apple has aimed to regulate performance to maintain consumers' perception of each phone being the same. It doesn't want customers to give different models individual reputations as this could lead to it losing its image of providing consistent, reliable performance. However, the move has already been criticised by some owners who believe they've bought devices which don't fulfil their potential. \"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,\" Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said to Bloomberg . \"In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\" ",

      "text": "Share this Story Verizon LG V20 Gets Security Update With VPN Tweaks \nVerizon’s LG V20 is receiving an update today to software version VS99512A. The update weighs in at about 477MB and provides the latest Android security patches, while also tweaking some of Android’s VPN services. \nAccording to the changelog provided by Verizon, outside of the security patch, the update contains minor changes to how you access VPN settings. The pre-update setup showed VPN options under Network settings when available on your work network and hid them when not available. After the update, the VPN option will always show, but will be greyed out if your work network doesn’t allow for VPN access. \nThe update seems to be live right now, as both our unit and a reader’s has already been prompted with it. Once updated, you’ll be on the November 1 security patch. \nWhen droid-life mentions you in a post jbworldwide1 \nDid droid-life ever review the V20? Shady Gambino \nI think they did a quick first impressions thing, but not a proper review. I really liking it so far. Jdub174 \nIt is a really underrated phone NastyEmu \nNope. It’s a pretty good phone though. It’s not as awesome as the Note 7 I had to replace, but the dual cameras and 2nd display are cool. I’m very happy with it.

      "title": "Verizon's Black Friday sale offers a Pixel or Pixel XL for just $240",
      "text": "This is probably the best deal you're going to find on a Pixel this year.\nIf you're in the market for a new high-end phone, Verizon has an amazing deal available for a new Google Pixel or Pixel XL . The sale will drop the Pixel or Pixel XL to just $240 on Friday only. Just like other major retailers, Verizon is also offering Google Home for just $99, or $30 off.\n\nSo here's the deal. If you head to Verizon on Black Friday, and are willing to buy on a 24-month payment plan, you can get a 32GB Pixel or Pixel XL for the same price: $10 per month, totaling $240. If you want more storage, you can get a 128GB version of either phone for just $15 per month, or $360. That's a screaming deal you aren't likely to beat anywhere else. The deal will be available online as well, which is even more surprising.\nThe best deal you'll find on a Pixel this year.\nIf the Pixels in particular aren't your sort of thing, through November 27 Verizon is offering $200 off any phone $400 or more for those who move to Verizon and add a line, or $100 off any phone $400 or more for those upgrading. That's still a nice discount, but nowhere near the sale being offered on Friday for the Pixels.\nVerizon still has another great deal if you're looking to buy two phones this week, where you get 50% off the second phone after buying the first. The deal is available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid and LG V20 . The buy one, get one 50% off deal runs until midnight on November 23 so you'll have to act fast.\nSee at Verizon \nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?
