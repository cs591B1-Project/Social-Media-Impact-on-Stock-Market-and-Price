By Nov. 17, 2016 3:02 p.m. ET Text Size Large Illustration: Getty Images \nEver since AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner, experts and investors have debated whether the deal would actually happen. That’s why Time Warner shares have consistently traded below AT&T’s $107 offer price. \nSkeptics have argued that the merger was unlikely to pass regulatory muster, with government officials balking at the accumulation of power under one roof. \nThat was then. In a research note Thursday, Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson at MoffettNathanson wrote: “Now, in the wake of a presidential election that stunned everyone, it is time to concede that everything we thought we knew may now be wrong.” \n“A few weeks ago, we assigned a ‘coin flip’ probability to approval of the acquisition,” the analysts said. “Those odds now look too low.” \nThe thinking is that a Trump administration will undo the regulatory status quo in Washington, relaxing rules in the process. MoffettNathanson now puts the likelihood of the deal’s approval at 60% to 65%, up from 50% prior to the election. And that, in turn, increases the chances that Time Warner shares will jump to AT&T’s $107 offer price. \nThe firm upgraded Time Warner shares to Buy from Neutral. The stock rose 1.5% on the news Thursday, to $90.30, still 19% below AT&T’s acquisition price. \nBig Picture: Because of the election of Donald Trump, there’s a growing likelihood that AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner will be approved.

Microsoft \nGoldman Sachs upgraded Microsoft to buy from hold with a price target of 68. Heather Bellini, a Goldman analyst, says Microsoft's Azure cloud service will prosper vs. Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google and Alibaba Holdings ( BABA ). \n\"We believe the shares are poised to more consistently outperform in the year ahead on the back of sustained traction in its cloud offerings. We estimate that Microsoft Azure will contribute $0.94, or 19% of Microsoft's total 2020 non-GAAP EPS of $4.83, and potentially $19 per share (23% of total estimated value),\" Bellini said in a report. \nMicrosoft stock rose 1.7% to 60.64 Thursday, still in buy range from a 58.80 entry area. \nRELATED: \nAmazon Confronts Microsoft, Google, IBM In Cloud Computing Wars Time Warner \nMoffettNathanson upgraded the media giant to buy with a price target of 100 on increasing odds that regulators will approve AT&T's $85 million purchase.

      "text": "Donald Trump may have promised to block AT&T’s plan to buy Time Warner on the campaign trail , saying it was too much power for one organization to have—but his next pick for attorney general would disagree.\nThat’s according to a note Evercore ISI’s Head of Political Analysis, Terry Haines, sent Friday after hearing the president-elect Trump chose Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be attorney general.\n“ Sessions’ likely nomination and confirmation by the Senate, in which he has served since 1997, is a market positive for merger and acquisition activity, ” Haines wrote. “ Sessions as attorney general would shift immediately from the current mostly ‘red light’ Obama antitrust/competition policy and move towards one that would be friendlier to M&A activity. ”\nThe attorney general heads the Justice Department, and in addition to enforcing antitrust laws, Sessions will be responsible for prosecuting white-collar crimes, among other tasks.\nUnlike the Obama administration, Sessions would be less likely to equate larger companies with trouble for competition, Haines said, when considering the Senator’s career.\nSessions may decide, “ that no reflexive test for the disapproval of a merger should be applied, as Obama regulators did with their ‘no four into three’ doctrine,” Haines wrote.\nHaines isn’t the only one to suggest Sessions would be a boon to dealmakers.\n“Sen. Sessions brings experience, intelligence, and passion to Justice,” Robert Raben, formerly an assistant attorney general under former President Bill Clinton and now head of consulting firm the Raben Group told the Washington Post . “Regrettably, it is likely to be exercised toward the attempted elimination of civil rights, environmental, and antitrust enforcement.”\nConventional wisdom also suggests that Republicans are less likely to act on antitrust rules—though research into the topic is sparse.",

      "text": " Time Warner's ( TWX ) Warner Bros. studio has high hopes for its \"Harry Potter\" spin-off \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" which opens this weekend. The movie is based on the book by J.K. Rowling and is the first in a five-part movie series about a magical zooologist.\nThe film cost $180 million to make and is expected to earn up to $200 million in its opening weekend. The eight-part original Harry Potter series grossed about $8 billion worldwide.\nTime Warner is \"excited\" about the movie and expects it to be \"a global hit,\" Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said during a conference call earlier this month.\n\"The great thing about these big-tent kind of things like 'Star Wars' is that it almost doesn't even matter if they're good. That's the beauty of it. It's somewhere between it will do well or it will do great,\" former Wall Street banker and CNBC contributor Evan Newmark said on Friday afternoon's \"Closing Bell.\"\nWhile a number of comic book movies have flopped recently, that's only because the industry goes through cycles, he pointed out. Superhero movies did well 15 years ago, but then the market became oversaturated with them.\nThe release date of the movie is optimal because it can pick up traffic over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend next week, noted CNBC's Julia Boorstin. In addition, it's coming out about a month before the new \"Star Wars\" film from Disney's (DIS) Lucas Films, so it can get some attention before that movie takes over the headlines.",

      "text": "How the Time Warner Acquisition Could Benefit AT&T PART 7 OF 13 Why Does Time Warner Expect Its Programming Costs to Rise? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 17, 2016 3:18 pm EST Rise in programming costs \nIn fiscal 4Q16, Time Warner ( TWX ) expects its programming costs to go up. One of the reasons for the higher programming costs is because of Time Warner’s deal with the NBA (National Basketball Association). Time Warner’s Turner division is going to pay higher licensing fees to the NBA for using its licensed programming starting in fiscal 4Q16. Time Warner’s Turner has a licensing agreement with the NBA to broadcast NBA games through 2025. \nTime Warner has always maintained that it would strive to maintain Turner’s growth rate for its programming costs in the “high-single digits.” However, next year, it expects its programming costs to rise in “double-digits,” as its licensing of sports programming contracts comes up for renewal. However, Time Warner stated at its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that it doesn’t expect that the increase in programming costs would be a sustained trend and expects the rise in costs to moderate over time. \nThe company further explained at its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that its deal with the NBA has also meant multiple revenue-generating opportunities for the company. It includes digital programming rights for Time Warner through NBA Digital where the company has observed a rise in viewing through this platform. The high program ratings for NBA games has also resulted in higher advertising revenues for the company. Disney’s ESPN focus on sports programming \nFor media companies, sports programming is a lucrative means of generating revenues as live sports broadcasts have higher ratings and are immensely popular among viewers, which means higher advertising revenues for the company. Walt Disney Company’s ( DIS ) ESPN is another company that also holds sports programming rights for the NBA games through the 2024–2025 games season. However, Disney’s falling subscriber base for ESPN has been a cause of worry for its investors. In a bid to lure subscribers, Disney has also invested in BAMTech. The company also plans to launch a new direct-to-consumer streaming subscription service for ESPN. \nAs the chart above shows, the number of subscribers for ESPN fell from around 99 million in fiscal 2013 to 92 million in fiscal 2015. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"TWX\",\"DIS\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Time Warner Inc.\",\"The Walt Disney Company\"]} X",

      "text": "Time Warner Adds Online Heft, Acquires Machinima By Investopedia | November 21, 2016 — 1:06 PM EST \nNot content to wait and settle its agreed-upon acquisition by AT&T , last week Time Warner 's (NYSE: TWX ) Warner Bros. studio announced a deal to acquire Machinima, a popular website and YouTube channel that's spent the last few years helping produce and distribute original content. Financial terms weren't disclosed. \nThe timing of the deal is interesting not only because of the telecom giant's deal to acquire Time Warner, but also because of the changes Machinima has made since CEO Chad Gutstein joined the company two years ago. In that time, the network has gone well beyond its original purpose of serving video gamers by developing a full-service production studio and striking content deals with major providers, including Sony for the PlayStation Vue, China's Sohu , and The CW, a joint venture between Warner and CBS . \nNow that Warner is graduating from partner to owner, Machinima will become one of the lead properties in the company's recently created Warner Bros. Digital Networks. \"Machinima is a strong gamer and fandom content and social brand with enormous reach and high engagement with audiences that play our games and are big fans of DC films and television shows,\" said Craig Hunegs, president of business and strategy for Warner Bros. Television Group and also of Warner Bros. Digital Networks, in a press release. \nWarner's gaming operations play a crucial role in the deal. Consider the Lego license: Warner's TT Fusion subsidiary has published dozens of titles since acquiring the gaming studio in 2007, including Lego Batman, which has sold at least 11 million copies worldwide so far and which is sure to get a boost when the movie loosely based on it hits theaters in February 2017. A recent trailer for the movie had garnered roughly 5.7 million online views in two weeks. \nWhy should investors care about this or the Machinima deal? According to data supplied by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Warner Bros. is responsible for the majority of Time Warner's revenue, but just 21% of its operating profit. Integrating games and online content with movies and television could help to shrink that gap. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nTim Beyers owns shares of Time Warner.

      "text": "The regulatory environment for cable operators will likely be more favorable under president-elect Donald Trump's administration, Liberty Media president and CEO Greg Maffei said Wednesday.\n\"It's hard to see how the regulatory environment will get worse under president-elect Trump than it was under the Obama administration and the FCC to date,\" he said at the Morgan Stanley European Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in Barcelona in a session that was webcast. \"We were constricted around net neutrality, we were constricted around usage-based pricing. It's hard to imagine that theirs is going to be quite as onerous in a go-forward world. So I think there is upside.\"\nHe added that the stock of Charter Communications, in which Liberty owns a big stake, traded up \"nicely\" on the news. And Maffei said: \"The tech companies have had an enormous influence on the FCC and on...what they perceived were positive changes, but in the main were not positive for cable.\"\nHe concluded: \"So I think there is likely to be a swing back the other way, and that's probably a positive on the regulatory front.\"\nLiberty Media chairman John Malone had told investors last week: \"The deregulatory aspects of a Republican administration will be favorable. I think the likelihood you will see government intervening to support one particular industry's goals, relative to another's, is probably less risky today.\"\nDiscussing AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which Trump has spoken out against, Maffei said: \"I assume the AT&T Time Warner deal gets done. I think president-elect Trump has shown he is a great negotiator, likes to make those statements.\" He predicted there would likely be a series of conditions put on the deal though.\nRead more: Liberty's John Malone Talks Netflix, Donald Trump, Likens Sports to Cocaine\nAsked about the broader impact of the mega-deal, Maffei also said, \"I am less fearful in some ways than John [Malone] is,\" adding, \"I don't suspect it's going to lead to as much of a round of M&A as John does.\"\nAsked about the outlook for additional major cable M&A, including for Charter, Maffei said: \"There's not that much left out there to buy.\" The only company with real scale is Cox Communications, with roughly 4 million subscribers, whose owners seem to remain \"very happy being independent.\" He concluded: \"There's just not enough cable left to buy.\"\nMaffei on Wednesday also touted Liberty's planned acquisition of Formula One and the upside for Liberty's music-related businesses. With its stakes in SiriusXM and Live Nation, the company is \"positioned to benefit from growth of global music,\" he said.\nLiberty in September agreed to acquire global motor sports business Formula One in a deal that values it at $4.4 billion and will occur in stages, with an initial purchase of $746 million for an 18.7 percent minority stake. The enterprise value for the racing circuit per the deal is $8 billion. Maffei touted upside from the likes of better TV rights deals and a planned OTT service for Formula One fans, as well as an increase in the number of races.\nFormer 21st Century Fox president and COO Chase Carey will become chairman of F1, replacing Nestle chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe. The 85-year-old Bernie Ecclestone will remain CEO.\nRead more: John Malone's Liberty to Acquire Formula One, Chase Carey to Become Chairman",

      "text": "Trump’s new telecom advisers are a good sign for the AT&T and Time Warner deal, despite his threats against the merger Campaign promises don’t equal presidential policy. share Drew Angerer / Getty While the president-elect railed against companies like NBCUniversal and Amazon for being too big and threatened antitrust action during his campaign, the advisers Trump named today to help oversee his FCC and Justice Department transitions have a history of being very pro-industry and anti-regulation, particularly when it comes to mergers. That’s good news for AT&T’s $85 billion bid for Time Warner , despite what Trump said on the trail . The merger is currently under review by antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, where a decision will probably not be reached until Trump is in office. Jeff Eisenach, who Trump officially named today to help transition the FCC under his presidency, has supported major media mergers proposed in recent years. When Comcast was considering a Time Warner takeover in 2013, Eisenach wrote , “The best thing that could happen for U.S. consumers would be substantial consolidation in the cable business.” And when AT&T wanted to purchase T-Mobile in 2011, Eisenach likewise argued in favor of the merger , pointing out, \"The wireless market is extremely competitive.” Mark Jamison, the person Trump named to help with the FCC transition, also argued in favor of the AT&T and T-Mobile merger, although in the end the FCC declined to approve the deal. Of Trump’s three new advisers for the transition of the Justice Department — J. Patrick Rowan, Jessie Liu and Ronald Tenpas — none specialize in mergers and acquisitions, but all three have extensive experience in helping large, private companies navigate the U.S. regulatory landscape. Rowan has helped counsel at least one sale of a U.S. telecom company to a foreign buyer, according to his law firm’s website . In October, Trump said that he would block the AT&T and Time Warner merger if he became president. “As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” he said at a Pennsylvania rally. But considering Trump is bringing so many pro-industry, pro-merger and anti-regulatory heads in to advise him, the president-elect’s stance against the merger may shift. In a comment right after the election, AT&T CFO John Stephens said he was looking forward to working with the Trump transition team and that many of Trump’s policies “fit right in with AT&T's goals.” * Comcast’s NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Recode parent company Vox Media. recode_divider",

      "text": "Big data and how telecom operators can extrapolate information from their growing collection of services is set to determine success in the market. AT&T’s recent announcement that it is to acquire Time Warner for the eye-watering sum of $85 billion underlines two things: namely that telco’s and communications service providers are rapidly attempting to reverse declining fortunes by increased diversification; and second, that the era of CSPs as a one channel revenue stream is well and truly over.\nCSPs and other service providers who cultivate large user bases are now wise to what many in the digital content game already know: the more content you have, and can offer, the more of a power player position this puts you in.\nIncreasingly converged operators such as AT&T, a global powerhouse in offering omnichannel, multimedia and multiplatform services to consumers, are acutely aware that engaging content holds the key in their ability to monetize and diversify, as well as lock in current customers. The fact is the vast and multidimensional content world is now frequently emanating from single sources: Amazon.com, Netflix and HBO are good players for operators to learn from. From a consumer perspective, this luxury of engaging content choice, combined with convenience in terms of multichannel access will deliver major differentiation and service upsell potential to AT&T.\nBut what lessons should major operators take from this acquisition?\nThe power of content is something that AT&T and other major operators have been aware of for some time. In fact, AT&T has been on the acquisition trail for a while – it gobbled up DirecTV last year, instantly becoming America’s largest pay-TV provider. BT in the U.K. continues to take up major investments in sporting content, securing rights to high-profile football packages to secure customer loyalty as a pay-TV provider.\nRumors persist around other potential acquisition targets and tie-ups, including Vodafone, Sky and potentially Liberty Global recently, which has since petered out. And now it isn’t simply operators eyeing up media companies, as T-Mobile US is now reported to be the next hot acquisition target for some of the world’s largest content providers.\nCan multistream imply multiscreen choice? Most of the time, an operator’s first acquisition represents the quickest way to better monetize existing and emerging video content. The steady migration of users to streaming and on-demand services like Netflix and the rapid move of rich content bundling, optimized content for the user and media set-top streaming boxes has cannibalized traditional TV viewing figures and fragmented it even faster and further. These separate strands of activity have made it extremely difficult to measure and ultimately monetize through associated marketing and advertising activity. The rise of multiscreening means the days of relying on Nielsen’s traditional TV ratings to measure eyeballs on content are effectively over.\nPay-TV providers and other network operators are having a hard time gripping onto this audience, as it increasingly fragments and difficulty therefore in shifting new offers their way and monetizing that audience. Despite its importance to the bottom line, it’s also more difficult than ever to accurately count how many people view specialty TV content, particularly if they are streaming it with a specialist provider. This creates a significant challenge in the eyes of the brand marketers that the operators will look to recoup the multibillion-dollar investments being made in the content.\nThe big data conundrum Audience fragmentation is also doing away with specialty service providers’ ability to collect the most accurate, up-to-the minute data on audience and demographic trends. Measuring all the separated-out strands of data that is pouring in has become a mammoth task: collecting data emanating from set-top boxes, on-device data and other sources into one unified dashboard with meaningful outputs is incredibly hard. Combine this with a need to collate and extrapolate the data in a data warehouse or central repository and the task becomes positively gargantuan. And with increasingly different types of data from disparate sources often stored and managed in separate silos, it becomes tougher to providers to get their hands on that audience or segmentation information in a timely way without the use of expensive analytics platforms, or the right data scientists to extrapolate findings. \nQuality, comprehensive measurement and theorizing in a rich way is what’s needed to bring the right information in, and this will afford the greatest degree of insight. This audience measurement data is highly targeted and relevant enough to inform programming, ad inventory and placement decisions, and help operators to better utilize this data as they negotiate content carrying fees with the content providers\nWhat’s next for audience measurement? Some big data hard truths The ambitious plans of many telco’s to become content providers themselves will fall at the first hurdle if it hey cannot find better ways to monetize the data they collect. Simply put, without such critical video data usage analytics at their fingertips, rich content and media providers will have all the cards at the poker table, but not be able to tell who is holding what hand. Without this crucial ability, they will not be able to personalize their video offerings for viewers and monetize these offerings with targeted, appropriate advertising.\nTV and other video service providers can improve the deep data pool of viewing data, and organize and manage that data more effectively, by developing and deploying better video usage analytics tools and by acting on that data in real-time. But first they must acknowledge some hard truths: they’re not collecting the available viewing data as effectively as they should do, and most are not organizing, managing or analyzing viewing data in an effective way.\nUpon acknowledging these two critical points, service providers can start pivoting away from their old and often obsolete data collection systems. Rather than trying to re-tool legacy data systems they should start by building in fit-for-purpose data management dashboards, which action the right intelligence from complete, accurate and valid data sets. This enables an operator to make better business decisions with meaningful and timely information from diverse big data analytics sources.\nWagging the tail of the dog: acknowledging big data’s shadow Finally, and try as it might, the “big data issue” simply will not disappear for pay-TV and other video service providers. If anything, the problem only promises to get bigger as audience fragmentation continue to grow and consumers continue to watch more programs on more screens than ever before, at a time of their choosing. If you are a content or video service provider, the onus is on you to start taking the big data issue more seriously.\nService providers must start doing a better job of collecting the viewing data they need and can act upon. They must also sort, organize, manage and analyze all that data so they can put it to work. Once they accept these two basic tasks, they’ll be able to move forwards and reach the other major challenge: counting and tracking the viewership they reach.\nAnd they must be ready to embrace the standards-based open solutions for total audience measurement that the market is now increasingly offering.\nEditor’s Note: The RCR Wireless News Reality Check section is where C-level executives and advisory firms from across the mobile industry share unique insights and experiences. \nThe post Reality Check: What AT&T’s Time Warner acquisition says about the big data challenge appeared first on RCR Wireless News .\n",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nThe film from the Harry Potter spin-off series, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, grossed an impressive $220m worldwide during its opening weekend. \nI discuss why I see this as good news, even though others view the weekend's results as a disappointment. \nLooking forward, I think Harry Potter content is here to stay. This is bullish for Time Warner and Comcast shareholders. It's such a pleasure for me to write an article focused around the wonderful wizarding world that J.K. Rowling has created. I grew up a huge Harry Potter fan and remain so to this day. I get nostalgic just thinking about it and although I didn't contribute to the opening weekend box office performance of the most recent Harry Potter spin-off film, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, I plan on seeing the film with my wife sometime this week. I can't wait! I've been looking forward to the newest film installation from the Harry Potter universe for some time now (as both a fan and an investor). In this piece I will discuss the film's opening weekend performance and why I think Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ) shareholders should be excited about the continued growth potential of the Harry Potter franchise (Fantastic Beasts is the first of 5 upcoming films in the series which should give TWX a magical boost over the next decade or so). Knowing that this film series was set to be released was one of the reasons that I first picked up shares of Time Warner Inc. back in early August. At the time I thought TWX was trading below fair value with a bright future ahead fueled by growth drivers such as the upcoming Harry Potter series, HBO, which is a gem of an over the top platform, and a strong relationship with the National Basketball Association (which is the pro sports league that I'm most bullish on long-term) via Turner's cable networks. For years I've been a bull when it comes to companies that create and own valuable content; I've said it before and I'll say it again, moving forward in today's digital world where everyone has a screen at their finger tips 24/7 and a massive thirst for entertainment, content is king. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is my largest holding due to this basic thesis. However, over the past year I've taken steps to diversify myself within the entertainment sector, having started building positions in TWX , Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) as well. This move to diversify has turned out to be a good call on my part. As you can see, Disney is the relative under performer of the group, with both TWX and CMCSA providing solid returns for investors over the last year. Click to enlarge I covered this decision in a recent piece, but due to a large purchase of TWX shares due to the arbitration spread in the TWX/AT&T (NYSE: T ) merger, TWX is now a top 5 holding for me as well. Needless to say, I'm all in on content, and Time Warner specifically, which is why I was so pleased with the opening weekend results posted by Fantastic Beasts. So, let's get straight into the numbers. In the film's opening weekend the domestic gross sales were ~$75m. The film also pulled in another ~$145m internationally, putting the world wide total at ~$220m. Considering that fact that it is estimated that the film cost roughly $180m to produce, I can't help but believe this is good news. I also think it's worth noting that the film has yet to open in several major international markets, including both China and Japan, where I expect to see significant sales before it's all said and done. Now, not everyone is so impressed with these numbers. Why? Well, first of all, because this film has underperformed all of the original Harry Potter films on an opening weekend basis. This chart below, which I sourced from this article published by IGN focused on the film, shows that on an inflation adjusted basis, this underperformance is even more pronounced. Click to enlarge But, I think what this really comes down to it a matter of expectations. I wasn't surprised to see the movies that were based directly off of the books doing better. The mania surrounding J.K. Rowlings books was amazing and this film doesn't have any supporting content to directly boost its interest. Essentially, this spin-off series is still piggy backing off of the success of the original book series which dates back over a decade. I think the fact that this film sold so well proves that there is still an appetite for wizarding world content which will only grow as Rowling, who wrote the screen play for Fantastic Beasts (and the upcoming sequel set to release in 2018) develops these new characters into new fan favorites and moves the Beast story line, which takes place a generation or two before the time of many of the Potter characters, towards the more familiar plot lines that so many already know well and love. I believe this opening film from the spin-off series has the ability to ignite a Potter passion in an entirely new generation of fans which bodes well for all companies involved with the content and merchandise involved, namely TWX and CMCSA (via the Wizarding World of Harry Potter that this company offers at their Universal Studios attractions). This part is a bit speculative on my part, but I hope that you'll indulge my fan-hood a bit (potential spoiler alerts start here, so don't continue if you haven't read the books). 5 feature films have already been announced as a part of this spin-off series. It's not quite certain what the exact time span that these films will cover, though I think it's safe to say that as we move along Rowling and crew will continue to introduce characters that were involved in the original Potter plot line. We're seeing this already with Johnny Depp's character, Gellert Grindelwald, who was notorious in the original book series as one of the world's predominant dark wizards who would eventually be bested by Potter's mentor, Albus Dumbledore. The development with Grindelwald via Depp is an interesting proposition for fans, especially as we begin to learn more about the back stories of other characters in the original series. From an investment standpoint, I think Depp's involvement bodes well for the film, especially in the Far East where his previous block buster series, Pirates of the Caribbean, has done so well for Disney. Ultimately, this is where I see this series leading: to the beginning of Lord Voldemort's reign, setting the stage for another string of books and/or feature films focused on the dark lord's uprising, the original Order of the Phoenix, and eventually culminating with the death of Harry's parents and the spell that produced that lightning bolt shaped star on his forehead that he's grown so famous for. If I'm correct at all in these assumptions, it'll mean that fans will be devouring Potter content for years and years to come. This will serve as a boon for all parties involved and as a long-term investor (and Potter-head), I look forward to reaping the potential rewards. Now, if you want exposure to this Potter phenomena in your portfolio, you're in for a bit of a tricky situation. Right now I think TWX is the obvious choice; however, the problem with that investment in the present in that investors are forced to pay the M&A premium associated with the stock because of AT&T's pending attempt to acquire the company. I originally bought TWX shares for $77.92, which represented a 13.5x multiple on 2016 EPS estimates. Right now the stock is trading at $91, which means investors are forced to pay a higher premium: 15.7x. Even though the stock has been on a run as of late, I don't think that ~16x multiple represents an overly expensive price to pay. I expect TWX to continue to grow earnings and cash flows well into the future, meaning that a few years down the road, today's prices could look incredibly cheap. Playing devil's advocate a bit here, in the short-term this $91 price could seem silly as well, should the AT&T deal get nixed and shares fall back below $80 where they were prior to the deal being announced. Comcast is more expensive right now, though admittedly, this is the more diversified company. I bought my shares back in May for $61.57, but I don't expect that we'll see those prices again anytime soon barring a major market wide sell-off. The company's shares are currently trading for ~$68 and the average analyst estimate for 2016 EPS is $3.50, meaning the market has placed a 19.4x multiple on this year's earnings. Analysts expect CMCSA to produce strong growth as well, so looking forward one year this multiple shrinks to 18x the average EPS estimate of $3.77/share. CMCSA is currently on the list on companies that I'm closely monitoring and I hope to add to my position on any future weakness. Both TWX and Comcast offer investors dividend yields, albeit relative low ones, 1.76% and 1.61% respectively. Both company has also been generous to shareholders in the recent past, growing those dividends at double digit clips over the past 5 years. TWX's 5 year DGR is 10.49%. CMCSA's 5 year DGR is an even more impressive 21.48%. Both companies are considered to be dividend Challengers of David Fish's CCC list. TWX has a 7 year annual dividend growth streak while CMCSA's streak sits at 9 years. I think both companies will continue to grow their dividends into the foreseeable future (unless TWX gets acquired, which will mean that its cash flows will contribute to T's strong dividend moving forward). In closing, we'll return to Fantastic Beasts. Even with the film's relatively slow start, I still think it has massive potential from a world wide gross standpoint. I don't foresee this film breaking the billion dollar barrier, though I think it's doing a great job setting the stage for future films in the series to hit this mark. I also think this film's legs will be longer than most when it comes to success on the big screen because it should do well throughout the family oriented holiday season with little competition other than Disney's Moana, which I'm not 100% sold on yet (frankly put, I think this film may have been better off as a summer time release due to its tropical settings; I think some of the original draw to Frozen was seasonal, which helped drive interest until the magic of the musical numbers captured the hearts of so many). Obviously, Rogue One is coming out this holiday season and I expect that film to do well at the box office too. Though, I think there is a slightly different demographic interested in latest Star Wars release than the previously mentioned flicks. Regardless, I think what has already been a banner year for content creators at the box office will end strongly. A strong box office typically bodes well for all involved and I think that generally speaking, the record figures we've seen in 2016 are setting the tone for a strong 2017, which has a handful of potential block busters slated to release as well. I'm happily long several of the major players in this industry and I look forward to sitting back with my popcorn and watching as the results roll in.

      "text": "A good sign for the AT&T-Time Warner deal? (Seeking Alpha) \nAT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) has filed the S-4 form related to the deal with Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ) with the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). The filing highlights the background and financials of the deal, while not mentioning any competing bidders, Deutsche Bank’s Matthew Niknam said in a report. Background And Financials \nNiknam listed the timelines of the deal as: August 25: AT&T’s CEO Randall Stephenson “expressed interest in exploring a potential combination” of the company with Time Warner, in a meeting with the latter’s CEO Jeff Bewkes. AT&T offered ~$100 per Time Warner share, and Bewkes indicated that the board would require “a meaningfully higher price to pursue such a transaction.” September 28: AT&T offers $103 per share in a deal comprising 45 percent cash and 55 percent stock. Bewkes indicated that the board would require a price “well above” that. AT&T raised the offer to $105 per share. Bewkes again noted the board would require “a meaningfully higher value.” October 6: The boards of the two companies meet to discuss the revised offer, “other potential acquirers of [TWX], the likelihood that any of them would provide a transaction superior to [...] AT&T,” and “the latitude the [TWX] board would have under a merger with [AT&T] to consider competing proposals.” Time Warner’s board then authorized management to continue talks, seeking to improve the offer price and change the cash/stock ratio to 50 percent. October 7: Time Warner proposes $110 per share and a 50 percent cash/stock mix. AT&T mentioned that it had already “improved the offer price significantly,” and it would need to conduct due diligence to consider any further increase. October 11: Bewkes and Stephenson agree to a price of $107.50 per share with a 50 percent cash/stock mix and a 5 percent symmetrical collar on the stock component and a payment of $500 million as the break fee in case regulatory approvals were not obtained. October 22: Time Warner’s board again discusses “other potential acquirers [...] and likelihood any of them can consummate a transaction superior to [...] AT&T.” The board ultimately moves forward with AT&T’s offer , with a joint release from the two companies being announcing the deal that night. At Last Check AT&T was up 1.09 percent at $38.15. Time Warner was up 1.09 percent at $92.56.  ",

      "text": "Drew Angerer | Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump gives a brief comment about 'Saturday Night Live' before his meeting with U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) at Trump International Golf Club, November 20, 2016 in Bedminster Township, New Jersey. While the president-elect railed against companies like NBCUniversal and Amazon for being too big and threatened antitrust action during his campaign, the advisers Trump named today to help oversee his FCC and Justice Department transitions have a history of being very pro-industry and anti-regulation, particularly when it comes to mergers.\nThat's good news for AT&T 's $85 billion bid for Time Warner , despite what Trump said on the campaign trail. The merger is currently under review by antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, where a decision will probably not be reached until Trump is in office.\nMore from Recode:\nAmazon has big plans to expand its online tickets business\nApple's executive ranks are still overwhelmingly white and male\nFacebook, Google and now Verizon are accelerating their tracking efforts despite consumers' privacy concerns\nJeff Eisenach, who Trump officially named today to help transition the FCC under his presidency, has supported major media mergers proposed in recent years.\nWhen Comcast was considering a Time Warner takeover in 2013, Eisenach wrote, \"The best thing that could happen for U.S. consumers would be substantial consolidation in the cable business.\"\nAnd when AT&T wanted to purchase T-Mobile in 2011, Eisenach likewise argued in favor of the merger, pointing out, \"The wireless market is extremely competitive.\"\nMark Jamison, the person Trump named to help with the FCC transition, also argued in favor of the AT&T and T-Mobile merger, although in the end the FCC declined to approve the deal.\nOf Trump's three new advisers for the transition of the Justice Department — J. Patrick Rowan, Jessie Liu and Ronald Tenpas — none specialize in mergers and acquisitions, but all three have extensive experience in helping large, private companies navigate the U.S. regulatory landscape. Rowan has helped counsel at least one sale of a U.S. telecom company to a foreign buyer, according to his law firm's website.\nIn October, Trump said that he would block the AT&T and Time Warner merger if he became president. \"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" he said at a Pennsylvania rally.\nBut considering Trump is bringing so many pro-industry, pro-merger and anti-regulatory heads in to advise him, the president-elect's stance against the merger may shift.\nIn a comment right after the election, AT&T CFO John Stephens said he was looking forward to working with the Trump transition team and that many of Trump's policies \"fit right in with AT&T's goals.\"\n— By April Glaser, Re/code.net .\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "Good afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for checking out this week’s edition of Swerve. Before we break for Thanksgiving, here’s your latest helping of news and musings on AT&T Inc. T, +2.19% Time Warner Inc. TWX, +0.84% and on what’s happening in the media industry as a whole. Plus, the latest news from President-elect Donald Trump. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media .\nBroken promises: President-elect Donald Trump made a lot of promises during his more than 18-month run to win the White House. He’s walked back several of those, including the scale of his planned border wall, the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and the plan to prosecute rival Hillary Clinton. Trump also promised he would straight up block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. His campaign said he “would never approve such a deal.” But as Recode reporter April Glaser writes , the advisers Trump tapped to oversee the FCC and Justice Department transitions “have a history of being very pro-industry and anti-regulation, particularly when it comes to mergers.”\nJeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, who are helping with the FCC transition, argued in favor of AT&T’s proposed, but ultimately failed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011. And Eisenach said consolidation was the best thing that could happen in the cable business when Comcast was considering a Time Warner takeover in 2013.\nAngry bird: Donald Trump made sure the world knew his feelings about the “highly overrated” Broadway hit “Hamilton” and its cast ’s message to his Vice President Mike Pence last weekend. Trump took to Twitter again on Tuesday to vent about the New York Times. And not for the first time.\nI cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 Trump met with — and gave an earful to — executives and anchors from the country’s five biggest TV networks on Monday, according to CNN Money . Trump reportedly vented about media coverage, but also committed to improving media access. On Tuesday he was set to meet with the New York Times, but canceled after incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus urged him to , according to Times reporter Sydney Ember. Priebus was allegedly concerned Trump would face questions he wasn’t prepared to answer. The meeting was eventually rescheduled. Times staffers posted updates throughout the duration of the meeting, which you can read here .\nThe dark side: Donald Trump’s new chief strategist Steve Bannon sat down with Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter to talk about plotting “an entirely new political movement.” Bannon, who is the former news chief of controversial alt-right news site Breitbart, has been slammed since his appointment for being a white nationalist. He told Wolff:\n“Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they [liberals and the media] get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.”\nAmazon’s Hail Mary: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.68% really wants to get into streaming sports. And any sport will do. Wall Street Journal reporter Shalini Ramachandran, citing sources, writes that Amazon has been in talks with the NBA, MLB, NFL and even lacrosse and surfing leagues for the rights to carry live games. Live sports are the last frontier in streaming TV, as one of the few things forcing fans to keep their cable TV subscription. The NFL and Twitter signed a deal to live stream Thursday Night Football games.\nTeam up: The two biggest fantasy sports sites, DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Inc., have agreed to set aside their differences and merge, as they both struggle with regulatory and legal challenges to their core business, writes Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Berzon .\nFOMO: Claire Atkinson at the New York Post reports that Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.04% network ABC is exploring the possibility of a 24-hour news digital news channel.\nForce to be reckoned with: Disney’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” set for its North American release on Dec. 16, is tracking for a massive $150 million box office debut, according to The Hollywood Reporter .\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nDonald Trump meets with The New York Times after Twitter spat\nGood afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for checking out this week's edition of Swerve. Before we break for Thanksgiving, here's your latest helping of news and musings on AT&T Inc. (T), Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and on what's happening in the media industry as a whole. Plus, the latest news from President-elect Donald Trump. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media (https://marketwatch.typeform.com/to/YStdOx).\nBroken promises: President-elect Donald Trump made a lot of promises during his more than 18-month run to win the White House.

      "text": "Cinemoi Takes Aim at AT&T-Time Warner Merger Warns about impact on independent and diverse programming 11/23/2016 7:26 AM Eastern \nDaphna Ziman, president of Cinemoi, the women-owned high-end lifestyle programming network, took aim at the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger in a statement Tuesday. \n\nThere is no Federal Communications Commission docket to post such comments in because the deal has yet to be filed with the commission, and there is even a question of whether it will have to be filed there at all. But the merger will definitely get Justice Department scrutiny at least, and FCC advice in the process at a minimum, if past is prologue (which it may or may not be in a Trump administration). \n\nWhichever agency does the vetting, Ziman (pictured) wants them to know she thinks the merger could adversely impact independent programmers. \n\n\"The lack of women and minority ownership is a threat to diversity of viewpoints and equality,\" she said in the statement. \"Cinemoi looks forward to supporting the FCC and Congress in creating protections which address these concerns.\" \n\n\"Gender diversity in media is absolutely critical for our democracy, never more glaring than now\" she said. \"This proposed merger could have serious public interest consequences.\" \n\n\"We will use Time Warner content as a 'launching pad' for new, mobile-first packages that better meet consumer demand,\" AT&T said in response to Ziman's statement. \"We think Time Warner will help us persuade other providers to join these offerings. And when we innovate, we think others in the industry will innovate and experiment as well.\" \n\nCinemoi launched on DirecTV (now owned by AT&T) in September 2012, but was dropped in July 2013. DirecTV said it was for nonpayment. Responding to a Facebook query about the channel's absence, DirecTV said at the time: \"Cinemoi Channel 259, a network that paid for programming air time has unfortunately been removed for non-payment of fees. At this time, we are uncertain if this channel will be returning.\" It wasn't, though Verizon did subsequently pick it up for FiOS TV. \n\nZiman is a familiar access advocate in D.C. She was among the panelists at an FCC workshop last April on issues related to independent programmers and access to distribution. \n\nShe told FCC officials, including Media Bureau chief Bill Lake, that the industry is dominated by greedy, monopolistic gatekeeper media conglomerates that ensure a \"pay for play\" reality. Unless an independent network can get exposure, and as a result get valued by advertisers, such independent networks are effectively \"a one-way ticket to bankruptcy,\" she said.

      "text": "Cinemoi Takes Aim at AT&T-Time Warner Merger Warns about impact on independent and diverse programming 11/23/2016 12:22:00 PM Eastern Follow @eggerton \nDaphna Ziman, president of Cinemoi, the women-owned high-end lifestyle programming network, took aim at the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger in a statement Tuesday. \nThere is no Federal Communications Commission docket to post such comments in because the deal has yet to be filed with the commission, and there is even a question of whether it will have to be filed there at all. But the merger will definitely get Justice Department scrutiny at least and FCC advice in the process at a minimum if past is prologue (which it may or may not be in a Trump administration). \nWhichever agency does the vetting, Ziman wants them to know she thinks the merger could adversely impact independent programmers. \n\"The lack of women and minority ownership is a threat to diversity of viewpoints and equality,\" she said in the statement, which her representatives also said was sent to members of Congress. \"Cinemoi looks forward to supporting the FCC and Congress in creating protections which address these concerns.\" \n\"Gender diversity in media is absolutely critical for our democracy, never more glaring than now\" she said. \"This proposed merger could have serious public interest consequences.\" \n\"We will use Time Warner content as a 'launching pad' for new, mobile-first packages that better meet consumer demand,\" AT&T said in response to Ziman's statement. \"We think Time Warner will help us persuade other providers to join these offerings. And when we innovate, we think others in the industry will innovate and experiment as well.\" \nCinemoi launched on DirecTV (now owned by AT&T) in September 2012 but was dropped in July 2013. DirecTV said it was for nonpayment. Responding to a Facebook query about the channel's absence, DirecTV said at the time: \"Cinemoi Channel 259, a network that paid for programming air time has unfortunately been removed for non-payment of fees. At this time, we are uncertain if this channel will be returning.\" It wasn't, though Verizon did subsequently pick it up for FiOS TV. \nZiman is a familiar access advocate in D.C. She was among the panelists at an FCC workshop last April on issues related to independent programmers and access to distribution. \nShe told FCC officials, including Media Bureau chief Bill Lake, that the industry is dominated by greedy, monopolistic gatekeeper media conglomerates that ensure a \"pay for play\" reality. Unless an independent network can get exposure, and as a result get valued by advertisers, such independent networks are effectively \"a one-way ticket to bankruptcy,\" she said.  ",

      "text": "Key Analysis of AT&T’s Acquisition of Time Warner PART 6 OF 14 Why AT&T Proposed Acquiring TWX instead of Partnering with It By Shirley Pelts | Nov 22, 2016 9:36 pm EST AT&T’s point of view \nAT&T (T) believes that it was better to propose the acquisition of Time Warner ( TWX ) rather than just a partnership with Time Warner. AT&T explained the rationale behind this proposed acquisition on its 3Q16 earnings call. The company said it believed owning content to be critical, especially considering the changing landscape of video consumption. The company further explained that for it to innovate quickly and efficiently, it would be better to acquire TWX than to partner with it. \nAT&T cited the example of its DIRECTV acquisition. It had been a reseller of DIRECTV for a long time, but after its acquisition of DIRECTV, the company added 1.2 million pay-TV customers for DIRECTV within a year. AT&T indicated that this would have been difficult for it to do as a reseller of DIRECTV. AT&T and content rights \nAT&T further stated that it was finding it increasingly difficult to negotiate content rights with companies to put their content on its mobile platform. However, it was able to negotiate all its content agreements within a year after its acquisition of DIRECTV. \nAT&T’s CEO, Randall Stephenson, said, “I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities of content to our customers and really integrate – I’m talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth. As we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure, will happen faster.” \nIn 3Q16, AT&T gained 323,000 satellite video subscribers but lost 326,000 U-Verse video subscribers, a net loss of US pay-TV subscribers for the company. In the last few quarters, AT&T has been experiencing subscriber losses in the US pay-TV market. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"T\",\"TWX\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"AT&T Inc.\",\"Time Warner Inc.\"]} X",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO - Free Report ), Disney (NYSE: DIS - Free Report ), Danaher (NYSE: DHR - Free Report ), Halliburton (NYSE: HAL - Free Report ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX - Free Report ). \nToday, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.

Driving the weakness has been headwinds from uncertain outlook for emerging markets, unfavorable currency movements and other structural issues like weakness in the company's North American sparkling beverage business. These issues notwithstanding, the company reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter of 2016 courtesy of higher prices for sodas and strong demand for water and sports drinks in North America. The analyst likes Coke's formidable portfolio of globally recognized brands. The company has witnessed improved margins on higher pricing and smaller packaging in developed markets, amid slowing sales. (You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here>> ) \nDisney shares have lagged its peers (the stock is down more than 6% year to date) on concerns about the impact of 'cord cutting' on the company's ESPN franchise. But Disney is more than just the ESPN franchise, as the analyst points out in the updated research report issued today. The analyst likes the company's movies business and favorable momentum in its parks and resorts division. The success of its movies also means greater business opportunities for its consumer products business. (You can read the full research report on Disney here>> ) \nBuy rated Danaher shares have struggled lately on concerns about its business repositioning that involved greater exposure to the healthcare and environmental verticlas following the Fortive spin-off. The analyst points out that the new Danaher is less exposed to volatile end-markets following the spin-off and has a more recurring revenue business. Two of the company's latest acquisitions, namely Cepheid and Phenomenex, are expected to boost its already thriving Diagnostics and Life Sciences business, respectively. However, on the flip side, sluggish economic conditions across some key operating regions and unfavorable currency translations pose as significant headwinds.

      "text": "Dividend Yields: Time Warner vs. Disney (TWX, DIS) By Richard Saintvilus | November 28, 2016 — 5:14 AM EST \nTime Warner Inc. ( TWX ) and The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) are two diversified entertainment companies operating within the media sector. Both firms operate cable television studio production segments and film studios. But which of the two media giants offers the more appealing dividend yield ? \nShares of Time Warner will begin trading ex-dividend on Monday, Nov. 28. To qualify for a dividend check, investors must have owned Time Warner prior to Monday, which is the day the company's management will finalize its roster of shareholders to whom it will mail payments. (See also: AT&T-TWX Deal Aided By New Trump Aides .) \nTime Warner stock closed Friday at $93.20, up 0.45%. The shares have risen 44% year to date, including gains of 17.62% in the past three months. This compares with an 8.29% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index ( SPX ). Disney shares, meanwhile, closed on Friday at $98.82, up 0.57%. The shares have declined 5.96% this year, while gaining 3.79% in three months. \nBased on Friday's closing price, Time Warner's 40.3-cent per share quarterly dividend yields 1.74% annually, or about 26 basis points below the 2.00% average yield of the S&P 500 index. Time Warner will send its dividend payment on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 30. The company has raised its dividend by 90% since it paid a 21.25-cent per share dividend in 2010. Time Warner stock has a consensus Buy rating and an average analyst 12-month price target of $102.34, implying a potential premium of about 10% from current levels. \nIn comparison, Disney's 35.5-cent per share dividend yields 1.45% annually, which is 55 basis points below the S&P 500 average. Disney stock has a consensus Buy rating and an average analyst 12-month price target of $106.54, implying a potential premium of about 8% from current levels. (See also: Disney Exploring 24-Hour Digital News Channel .) \nThe verdict? Time Warner's annual dividend yield of 1.74%, which tops Disney's yield by 29 basis points, is more attractive, especially when combined with its projected stock premium of 10%, which is about two percentage points above Disney's consensus premium.

      "text": "Key Analysis of AT&T’s Acquisition of Time Warner PART 10 OF 14 Will Ratings Agencies Downgrade AT&T on Its Proposed Acquisition? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 22, 2016 9:36 pm EST Financial impact of the TWX acquisition \nAccording to AT&T (T), its proposed acquisition of Time Warner ( TWX ) could benefit it financially. AT&T expects the acquisition to be accretive on an adjusted EPS (earnings per share) and FCF (free cash flow) per share basis in the first year following the close of the deal. \nIn late October 2016, AT&T announced that it would acquire Time Warner in a stock and cash transaction for $107.50 per share, a 36.0% premium. The transaction is valued at an equity value of $85.4 billion and a total value of $108.7 billion. The total transaction value also includes $21 billion of Time Warner’s net debt. According to the terms of the transaction, Time Warner’s shareholders will receive a 50-50 mix of AT&T stock and cash for their shares. \nAT&T stated on its 3Q16 earnings call that the cash portion of the stock-and-cash exchange was financed with a $40 billion bridge loan and its existing liquidity. \nThe company also stated that considering the strong free cash flow of the combined company, AT&T expects its pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA 1 ratio to be ~2.5x in the first year following the close of the acquisition. It expects this ratio to be ~1.8x by the fourth year. AT&T and ratings agencies \nAT&T acknowledged on its 3Q16 earnings call that ratings agencies may be concerned about the debt taken on by the company. However, it also stated, “On the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion, so to speak, of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt.” \nAT&T also stated that considering it expects its net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio to go from 2.5x in the first year to 1.8x in the fourth year following the acquisition, it still expects ratings agencies to rate it as investment grade. AT&T further indicated that 90% of its debt “is locked into rates with about a 14-year average life.” earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization ↩ {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"T\",\"TWX\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"AT&T Inc.\",\"Time Warner Inc.\"]} X",

      "text": "AT&T, which has agreed to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion, and its satellite TV arm DirecTV on Monday unveiled pricing and bundling details of the much-anticipated DirecTV Now and other streaming video offers that the telecom giants hopes will appeal to Americans as their TV viewing behavior continues to evolve.\nAnd it did so with the help of a celebrity appearance by Reese Witherspoon.\nThe services, which were demoed on Monday afternoon in midtown Manhattan, will launch imminently, giving AT&T, the largest U.S. pay TV company with more than 25 million subscribers, a head start over such competitors as online video joint venture Hulu, which is planning a 2017 launch for its own live streaming service. Alphabet/Google and Apple are also believed to have been working on possible over-the-top video services.\nThe invitation-only event did not feature AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson, but was led by John Stankey, CEO of AT&T Entertainment Group, and colleagues. An opening video featured popular TV shows, movies and such tag lines as \"Let Freedom Stream\" and \"The Future Is Now.\"\nThe new service that is getting most attention is DirecTV Now, which will launch later this month, with monthly prices starting at $35 for up to more than 100 live streamed TV networks, as AT&T had previously announced . DirecTV Now also offers premium add-on options.\nThat makes it closer to the DirecTV satellite TV service than more typical 25-channel or so skinny bundles like Dish Network's Sling TV. People at AT&T and working with the company say the telecom giant's message has been that the appeal of skinny bundles is limited, something content company CEOs also have been saying.\nAll major entertainment giants, except for CBS Corp., have in recent months unveiled deals to be included in DirecTV Now - from Walt Disney to Time Warner's Turner and HBO, NBCUniversal, Viacom to AMC Networks, Discovery Communications and, most recently, 21st Century Fox. AT&T executives said the goal was of providing the best of live and on-demand TV.\nBefore Monday, no specific date had been set. AT&T on Monday said DirecTV Now will be available starting on Wednesday and also detailed the specific networks that will be included in its various streaming services. Latest expectations ahead of Monday's launch event were that the $35 per-month DirecTV Now service would include live local streams of ABC and NBC in select markets.\nAT&T unveiled the following packages and prices for DirecTV Now: Live a Little for $35 per month with 60-plus channels, Just Right for $50 a month for 80-plus channels, Go Big for $60 for 100-plus channels and Gotta Have It for $70 per month for 120-plus channels. \"Fans of HBO and Cinemax can add these channels for just $5 each per month in addition to your base programming package,\" the company said.\nRead more: AT&T to Sell DirecTV as Streaming Service\n\"We're extending our entertainment portfolio for those who value premium content but also want more TV freedom suited for their lifestyle, whether watching at home or on their mobile devices.

He said taking costs out of the fully digital system will allow the company to pass those on to consumers. And more features will follow over time, he said.

      "text": "AT&T, which has agreed to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion, and its satellite TV arm DirecTV on Monday unveiled pricing and bundling details of the much-anticipated DirecTV Now and other streaming video offers that the telecom giants hopes will appeal to Americans as their TV viewing behavior continues to evolve.\nAnd it did so with the help of a celebrity appearance by Reese Witherspoon.\n.@TaylorSwift13 fans have a new destination for unique and never seen videos, #TaylorSwiftNOW - coming soon, only on AT&T. pic.twitter.com/PY8FxiMddK\n- DIRECTV (@DIRECTV) November 28, 2016\nThe services, which were demoed on Monday afternoon in midtown Manhattan, will launch imminently, giving AT&T, the largest U.S. pay TV company with more than 25 million subscribers, a head start over such competitors as online video joint venture Hulu, which is planning a 2017 launch for its own live streaming service. Alphabet/Google and Apple are also believed to have been working on possible over-the-top video services.\nThe invitation-only event did not feature AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson, but was led by John Stankey, CEO of AT&T Entertainment Group, and colleagues. An opening video featured popular TV shows, movies and such tag lines as \"Let Freedom Stream\" and \"The Future Is Now.\"\nThe new service that is getting most attention is DirecTV Now, which will launch later this month, with monthly prices starting at $35 for up to more than 100 live streamed TV networks, as AT&T had previously announced. DirecTV Now also offers premium add-on options.\nThat makes it closer to the DirecTV satellite TV service than more typical 25-channel or so skinny bundles like Dish Network's Sling TV. People at AT&T and working with the company say the telecom giant's message has been that the appeal of skinny bundles is limited, something content company CEOs also have been saying.\nAll major entertainment giants, except for CBS Corp., have in recent months unveiled deals to be included in DirecTV Now -- from Walt Disney to Time Warner's Turner and HBO, NBCUniversal, Viacom to AMC Networks, Discovery Communications and, most recently, 21st Century Fox. AT&T executives said the goal was of providing the best of live and on-demand TV.\nBefore Monday, no specific date had been set. AT&T on Monday said DirecTV Now will be available starting on Wednesday and also detailed the specific networks that will be included in its various streaming services. Latest expectations ahead of Monday's launch event were that the $35 per-month DirecTV Now service would include live local streams of ABC and NBC in select markets.\nAT&T unveiled the following packages and prices for DirecTV Now: Live a Little for $35 per month with 60-plus channels, Just Right for $50 a month for 80-plus channels, Go Big for $60 for 100-plus channels and Gotta Have It for $70 per month for 120-plus channels. \"Fans of HBO and Cinemax can add these channels for just $5 each per month in addition to your base programming package,\" the company said.\n\"We're extending our entertainment portfolio for those who value premium content but also want more TV freedom suited for their lifestyle, whether watching at home or on their mobile devices. This is TV your way,\" said Stankey. \"Our new customer-centric offers show that mobility and entertainment are better together.\"\nWitherspoon came out as a surprise celebrity guest during the press event to share with the audience of reporters and analysts that she was thrilled to partner with AT&T and DirecTV \"to bring my new production company Hello Sunshine to their customer base.\" Witherspoon recently teamed with Otter Media, the joint venture of The Chernin Group and AT&T, on Hello Sunshine, which will focus on telling female-driven stories across various platforms.\nBentley also promised more AT&T originals will become available over time, including one entitled Taylor Swift Now, which a slide called \"a new video experience only on AT&T\" and which the executive said will have 13 chapters.\nStephenson last year mentioned that the company was looking to target the 20 million-plus U.S. homes without pay TV subscriptions, which Stankey confirmed on Monday. That means it is going after people who haven't had access to pay TV, have cut or want to cut the cord or have no interest in signing up for linear pay TV. \"This isn't the junk nobody wants. This is 100 premium channels ... the premium content you know and love to watch,\" Stephenson said. \"This is a game changer.\"\nRead More Analysts say Wall Street and Hollywood companies will in 2017 spend much time analyzing the performance and impact of DirecTV Now and other planned over-the-top video services.\n\"Ma Bell is about to set the tone for the industry; all eyes are on the success of DirecTV Now, as well as D.C. views on zero-rating and the pending Time Warner deal,\" Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong wrote in a recent report.\n\"Contrary to the prevailing concern, we see minimal cannibalization risk to its linear video business,\" she added. \"The offering targets the 20 million-25 million broadband-only homes and urban areas where DirecTV is under-indexed. Assuming a modest 5 percent take-rate, we believe [DirecTV] Now could add 1 million-plus subs in short order.\"\nSome have wondered how DirecTV Now can make a profit for AT&T. Wall Street observers have said that the service could help the telecom giant sign up wireless subscribers from such competitors as Verizon. Data used to watch DirecTV Now on mobile devices will be free for AT&T wireless subscribers. Critics have said that could also mean that subscribers using such services as Netflix could face higher data bills than DirecTV Now users.\nMoffettNathanson analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson have estimated that the programming costs for DirecTV Now alone could hit $34 per subscriber per month, which would make other financial and operational benefits key drivers of its success.\nCharter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge, meanwhile, recently said that DirecTV Now offers many networks, but not all and looks like it has a profit margin built in. \"I don't think they are below price.

He called it \"a big game changer.\"\nStankey said his son, who lives and works in Washington, DC was home for Thanksgiving, played around with the service and told him \"this is what I want.\"",

      "text": "AT&T ( T ) wants to be Ma Streamer.\nFive weeks after announcing a deal to acquire Time Warner ( TWX ) for $86.5 billion, the company once known as Ma Bell on Monday announced the launch of a multichannel streaming service that the telecom operator hopes can offset flat or declining subscribers for its wireless and pay-TV services.\nThe service, which will go live on Wednesday, targets the roughly 20 million to 25 million households that don't subscribe to any pay-TV service. At the top of that list are young people, those most unlikely to have a pay-TV contract, but also those in urban areas where AT&T satellite TV service DirecTV, which it acquired in 2014, has lagged its cable TV rivals.\n\"We have a new segment of the market that we want to address, and this platform lets us do that,\" AT&T executive John Stankey, head of its entertainment group, said at an event held in midtown Manhattan on Monday. \"This is the foundation for how we're going to do things in the future.\"\nDirecTV Now will go head to head with Dish Network 's ( DISH ) Sling TV and Sony 's ( SNE ) PlayStation Vue. In the coming weeks, they'll be joined by Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google Unplugged and a similar service from Hulu .\nThe overarching question for AT&T is whether its ambitious effort to win over mobile users by offering them a do-everything streaming platform will make economic sense.\nAt $35 per month for 100 channels, AT&T is said to be operating on very slim margins, far slimmer than what its charged for decades through the traditional pay-TV bundle. The list of networks to appear on DirecT Now includes every major content product apart from CBS, Netflix ( NFLX ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) .\nOf course, both Netflix and Amazon operate online platforms, one very big reason that AT&T has invested so much time and money into DirecT Now.\nAT&T's Stankey addressed the issue of profitability by arguing that DirecTV Now will afford greater control over programming, advertising and consumer behavior.\n\"This has come together on terms that put is in a very enviable position from a cost-structure point of view,\" Stankey said. \"This is bigger than anything we've ever done because we have total control of the product.\"\nAT&T is betting that its comparatively low monthly price of $35 will distinguish it from its rivals and also attract those unhappy with the cost of the traditional pay-TV bundles, often priced at more than $80 per month. For AT&T wireless customers, DirecTV Now won't count against their usage plans, a point that rivals such as Dish have countered could run counter to federal regulations.\nDirecTV Now subscribers also will be offered Time Warner's HBO for $5 per month, a full $10 less than the cost of HBO Now, the premium network's standalone offering. Cinemax also will be available for $5 per month. A larger selection of 120 channels will be sold for $70 per month.\nNFL Sunday Ticket, DirecTV's exclusive package of NFL games, will not be part of the platform, though Stankey said AT&T is in talks with the league about bringing the service into DirecTV Now. As for CBS ( CBS ) , which hasn't licensed its shows to DirecTV Now, Stankey said the platform may be targeted at a demographic that doesn't place a high priority on the network's content.\nIf CBS CEO Leslie Moonves' recent statements are any indication, the company appears content instead to sell its programming through its online streaming service, CBS All Access , which recently surpassed the 1 million subscriber mark. CBS also hasn't signed on with Hulu's own multichannel streaming service that's expected to go live early next year. Hulu is a joint venture between Disney ( DIS ) , Comcast 's ( CMCSA ) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) , with Time Warner taking a 10% stake in August.\nDirecTV Now's content, aside from Time Warner channels, also will include networks owned by Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox, Viacom ( VIAB ) , Starz ( STRZA ) , Scripps Networks Interactive ( SNI ) and Discovery ( DISCA ) .\nComcast and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells CMCSA and GOOGL ? Learn more now .\nAT&T also is rolling out two other, smaller versions of DirecTV Now. AT&T wireless users will have the option of subscribing to DirecTV FreeView, an ad-supported product that will offer a variety of shows and some networks as an add-on to existing customers. A third tier, known as Fullscreen, will be built for iPhones and Android devices, offering the kind of video on-demand that younger audiences generally embrace.\nMost important for investors, AT&T appears to be offering its flagship product for a price 30% lower than the most basic pay-TV bundle. Such a discount speaks to AT&T's eagerness to win market share and get ahead of Hulu and Google Unplugged in the race for the hearts and minds of Millennials.\nAT&T is likely to tweak and reshape DirecTV Now, Stankey said, as it learns more about what \"cord-cutters\" and \"cord-nevers\" want from online television. The success of DirecTV Now is also integral to AT&T's investment in Otter Media, a joint venture with Chernin Group , which recently announced the creation of a $500 million fund to acquire and develop video services for digital multichannel platforms. As part of that collaboration, actress Reese Witherspoon spoke briefly at the DirecTV Now event to publicize her company, Hello Sunshine , which AT&T described as producing exclusive video-on-demand content for DirectTV Now and DirecTV focusing \"on positivity, humor and inspiration for women.\"\nDirecTV Now also said its initial round of marketing would feature Taylor Swift NOW, a video catalog aimed at showcasing concert performances, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the singer-songwriter.\nIf DirecTV is well received, offering users an interface that delights rather than deceives, subscriptions could exceed 1 million in \"short order,\" Macquarie media analyst Amy Yong said in a Nov. 16 investor note.",

      "text": " Bob Johnson, founder of asset management firm RLJ Companies and the CEO of Black Entertainment Television met with President-elect\nDonald Trump last week to discuss what he called \"business solutions to social problems.\"\nBecause of Johnson's background in the media, he spoke on CNBC Tuesday about what's next for the industry under a Donald Trump presidency. In particular he discussed the proposed merger between AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) announced in October for $85.4 billion.\nThat deal is awaiting federal regulatory approval. However, Trump has stated intentions to block the deal.\n\"Here's my read based on knowing him and business background and acumen,\" Johnson said: \"He is going to sit down and negotiate.\"\nJohnson expects Trump to stake out a position as he would in any business deal and will bring all the sides together in an attempt to iron out an agreement.\n\"He'll sit down with [AT&T CEO] Randall Stephenson and the guys from AT&T; he'll sit down with whoever the regulators might be, whether it's the Justice Department or the [Federal Communications Commission] and ask what the ultimate goal is,\" Johnson contended.\nNext, the President-elect will weigh the benefits of the deal for consumers, businesses, and jobs and economic growth. \"I think that is the platform he starts with everything he looks at from a business standpoint,\" Johnson noted.\n(AT&T is a holding in David Peltier's Dividend Stock Advisor. )",

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively.MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.",

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- President-elect Donald Trump has consistently taken to Twitter ( TWTR ) to offer his opinions both during and after the election. But the potential ramifications Trump's tweets on society and financial markets are unclear.\nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted:\nI thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016 CNN is owned by Time Warner ( TWX ) , which agreed to sell itself to AT&T ( T ) in October. Trump has voiced his disdain for the deal.\nWhat should investors make of comments like this?\n\"I think that we have to look at it not as information but as what this man is saying. People are going to have to decide for themselves, based on educating themselves in a lot of different ways,\" said Editor-in-Chief of The Information Jessica Lessin on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" on Tuesday.\nLessin said that even though the information-hungry public wants posts on Twitter to be truthful, we cannot expect Twitter to check all the information posted.\nShares of Twitter were higher in afternoon trading on Tuesday.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates the stock as a \"hold\" with a ratings score of C.\nTwitter's strengths such as its impressive record of earnings per share growth, robust revenue growth and good cash flow from operations are countered by the fact that the stock has had a generally disappointing performance in the past year.

      "text": "CNN, the cable TV network owned by Time Warner ( TWX ) , has placed a bet on the millennial audience with the acquisition of popular YouTube personality Casey Neistat's video-sharing startup Beme.\n\"Together we are launching a new media company dedicated to timely and topical video content powered by bleeding edge mobile technology,\" said Andrew Morse, General Manager of CNN Digital Worldwide, in an internal note circulated Monday and obtained by TheStreet. Morse will also act as an executive officer for a new company that will be formed within CNN with Beme employees, among others.\nNeistat and fellow Beme co-founder Matt Hackett, as well as the team behind Beme, which includes about 11 employees, have joined CNN Worldwide as part of the acquisition, terms of which were not disclosed.\nBeme employees will use the Beme's video technology to launch a stand-alone media company much like Great Big Story, which is a separate, stand-alone business within CNN focused on telling stories with no apparent tie to the 24-hour news cycle.\nThe new company, still without a name, won't be producing what most people think of as ''news,'' but will be relevant to the daily conversations, CNN told TheStreet. CNN will also hire \"dozens of producers, builders, developers, designers and content creators of every mold\" for the new company, it said.\nThe new company will launch as a startup by the summer of 2017.\nNeistat has a following of nearly six million subscribers on Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) YouTube video platform. Following the deal, Neistat is free to maintain his own YouTube channel and make all the editorial calls about his personal channels. Although the acquisition isn't a TV talent deal, CNN will explore every possible way to tap into the Youtube sensation's ability to connect with new audiences.\nThe deal comes about as traditional TV cable news networks start to seek creative channels to attract new audiences. CNN's deal with Beme comes after Comcast ( CMCSA ) 's NBCUniversal made a $200 billion investment in Buzzfeed last week, which was NBCUniversal's second round of investments in Buzzfeed after its TV and film division made $200 million investments in BuzzFeed and Vox Media respectively last year.\nCompanies founded by successful Youtube personalities who have a track record of engaging millennial audiences and consumers are increasingly being pursued by big name brand corporations. For example, digital media channel Maker Studios, home to many Youtube talents, was acquired by Disney ( DIS ) in March 2014 for $500 million.\nThe Beme app, which allows users to shoot four-second bursts videos that could be uploaded onto the social sphere without tweaking or editing, sells on the idea of \"authenticity.\" The app took off initially but gradually lost steam as competition from similar platforms like Snap Inc .'s Snapchat and Facebook ( FB ) 's Instagram intensified.\nThe Beme app will shut down on Jan. 31 according to a blog post from Hackett, having amassed around 1.2 million downloads during its more-than-a-year-long operation.\nThe deal comes as Time Warner is in the process of being acquired by AT&T ( T ) for $85.4 billion.\nAlphabet, Comcast and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition Login to download Turner CEO Says Donald Trump \"Really Cares About What CNN Is Saying,\" Talks AT&T-Time Warner Deal 5:41 PM PST 11/30/2016 by Georg Szalai Courtesy of Turner Corporate US John Martin John Martin says that a Trump White House is \"probably a little bit better from a business standpoint\" and that there are \"too many shitty\" cable networks that must go away. \nDonald Trump may have been criticizing CNN, but John Martin, chairman and CEO of Time Warner's Turner unit that it is part of, said Wednesday evening in New York that he is not worried that the president-elect would negatively affect the news network's business. \nAppearing at Recode's Evening With Code Media event in midtown Manhattan, the exec reacted to a tweet this week from Trump that said: \"I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!\" \n\"Please, failing?!\" Martin said when asked about the comment, adding that he felt CNN generally did a good job covering the campaign and gave \"pretty much equal time\" to both candidates and let people decide. \"I couldn't be more proud about how we covered the election,\" he concluded. \nTrump probably watches more CNN than any other news organization, Martin also said about the president-elect given his complaints. \"I think he really cares about what CNN is saying,\" the Turner boss offered. \nFinancials also are looking strong. \"CNN is completing its hall of fame year\" with a record profit of around $1 billion, Martin emphasized. And he said next year could be even a better financial year for CNN given lower costs compared to the election year, higher affiliate fee revenue and more originals despite lower advertising revenue. \n\"A general fascination\" with Trump could also help ratings in 2017, the Turner boss suggested. Overall, Trump is \"probably a little bit better from a business standpoint,\" said Martin. \nBut he said Trump's election win likely doesn’t mean too much for CNN and how it does things. And the exec took a shot at other news networks. “We have a huge journalistic mission,\" Martin said. \"We’re not Fox News, which is cheering, or MSNBC, which is laying on the floor.” CNN wants to be \"holding everyone's feet to the fire,\" he added. \nMartin also lauded CNN head Jeff Zucker, who he said has “done a phenomenal job,\" for running an editorial review meeting every morning that includes spirited debates about coverage focus areas and tone. \"We're going to constantly evaluate,\" Martin said. \nMartin shared that his sister told him that Fox News was more balanced than CNN, and \"I thought my head was going to explode,\" he said. \nTelecom giant AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner also was a key topic of debate. Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara had assured investors on Tuesday that the Time Warner studio would retain the autonomy it needs after the AT&T deal closes and that he'd \"protect the culture\" of the film unit. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has emphasized that Warners should be staffed by entertainment executives rather than by telecom experts, because \"you need the special sauce to create the great movies,\" Tsujihara added. \nMartin said Wednesday the sale could help Time Warner better understand consumers and \"super-charge our ability\" to transform into more of a technology company. \nThe Turner CEO told the event that he had lunch with Stephenson the day after the deal announcement, adding that \"I had a really good feeling\" as the AT&T boss respects the culture of Time Warner. Martin said the feeling was much different than when a mega-merger of the past was unveiled. \"I knew on day two of the AOL-Time Warner merger that it was going to be a shit show,\" he recalled. \nAsked if AT&T could keep HBO only to itself, Martin said: \"That's a moronic thought, because it would ruin the value of HBO.\" But he said \"there may be\" exclusive forms of content for AT&T subscribers in the future. \nMartin in his appearance also suggested that in the future Time Warner networks may not want to license shows to Netflix a year after they debut, but could instead offer them in their own SVOD-type environment. \nAsked about the rising number of digital and virtual pay TV operators, such as Sling, Sony Vue, DirecTV Now and planned services from Hulu, Google and Amazon, Martin said they will help weed out weak cable networks that get carried by traditional pay TV firms despite soft ratings. \"There are too many shitty networks in the United States that have to go away,\" he said. \nBut none of Turner's fall into that category? No,\" Martin said. \"I feel really good. I'll put up our networks against anybody.\" \nWednesday evening's event also featured Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei, whose new start-up focuses on high-end subscription services for healthcare, finance and tech, and Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed UK.",

      "title": "Turner CEO Says Donald Trump \"Really Cares About What CNN Is Saying,\" Talks AT&T-Time Warner Deal",
      "text": "Donald Trump may have been criticizing CNN, but John Martin, chairman and CEO of Time Warner's Turner unit that it is part of, said Wednesday evening in New York that he is not worried that the president-elect would negatively affect the news network's business.\nAppearing at Recode's Evening With Code Media event in midtown Manhattan, the exec reacted to a tweet this week from Trump that said: \"I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!\"\n\"Please, failing?!\" Martin said when asked about the comment, adding that he felt CNN generally did a good job covering the campaign and gave \"pretty much equal time\" to both candidates and let people decide. \"I couldn't be more proud about how we covered the election,\" he concluded.\nTrump probably watches more CNN than any other news organization, Martin also said about the president-elect, given his complaints. \"I think he really cares about what CNN is saying,\" the Turner boss offered.\nFinancials also are looking strong. \"CNN is completing its hall of fame year\" with a record profit of around $1 billion, Martin emphasized. And he said next year could be even a better financial year for CNN given lower costs compared to the election year, higher affiliate-fee revenue and more originals despite lower advertising revenue.\n\"A general fascination\" with Trump could also help ratings in 2017, the Turner boss suggested. Overall, Trump is \"probably a little bit better from a business standpoint,\" said Martin.\nRead more: Warner Bros. CEO Vows to \"Protect the Culture\" of Film Studio After AT&T Acquisition\nBut he said Trump's election win likely doesn't mean too much for CNN and how it does things. And the exec took a shot at other news networks. \"We have a huge journalistic mission,\" Martin said. \"We're not Fox News, which is cheering, or MSNBC, which is laying on the floor.\" CNN wants to be \"holding everyone's feet to the fire,\" he added.\nMartin also lauded CNN head Jeff Zucker, who he said has \"done a phenomenal job,\" for running an editorial review meeting every morning that includes spirited debates about coverage focus areas and tone. \"We're going to constantly evaluate,\" Martin said.\nMartin shared that his sister told him that Fox News was more balanced than CNN, and \"I thought my head was going to explode,\" he said.\nTelecom giant AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner also was a key topic of debate. Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara had assured investors Tuesday that the Time Warner studio would retain the autonomy it needs after the AT&T deal closes and that he'd \"protect the culture\" of the film unit. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has emphasized that Warners should be staffed by entertainment executives rather than by telecom experts, because \"you need the special sauce to create the great movies,\" Tsujihara added.\nMartin said Wednesday the sale could help Time Warner better understand consumers and \"super-charge our ability\" to transform into more of a technology company.\nThe Turner CEO told the event that he had lunch with Stephenson the day after the deal announcement, adding that \"I had a really good feeling\" as the AT&T boss respects the culture of Time Warner. Martin said the feeling was much different than when a mega-merger of the past was unveiled. \"I knew on day two of the AOL-Time Warner merger that it was going to be a shit show,\" he recalled.\nAsked if AT&T could keep HBO only to itself, Martin said: \"That's a moronic thought, because it would ruin the value of HBO.\" But he said \"there may be\" exclusive forms of content for AT&T subscribers in the future.\nMartin in his appearance also suggested that in the future Time Warner networks may not want to license shows to Netflix a year after they debut, but could instead offer them in their own SVOD-type environment.\nAsked about the rising number of digital and virtual pay TV operators, such as Sling, Sony Vue, DirecTV Now and planned services from Hulu, Google and Amazon, Martin said they will help weed out weak cable networks that get carried by traditional pay TV firms despite soft ratings. \"There are too many shitty networks in the United States that have to go away,\" he said.\nBut none of Turner's fall into that category? \"No,\" Martin said. \"I feel really good. I'll put up our networks against anybody.\"\nWednesday evening's event also featured Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei, whose new start-up focuses on high-end subscription services for health care, finance and tech, and Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed U.K.\nRead more: Turner Broadcasting CEO John Martin Bullish on Company's Financial Picture: \"We May Be Bucking the Trend\"",

      "text": "During his campaign for President, Donald Trump declared that he would not approve a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner on the grounds the deal represented “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” But as with so much else when it comes to Trump, it appears that vow is negotiable.\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s transition team assured AT&T T they would review the deal with an open mind, and that company executives came away confident that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny.\nThis confidence appears to be based in part on the conversation, but also on the fact Trump has chosen people who have demonstrated a laissez-faire approach to antitrust issues in the past. As the FT reports :\nAmerica's largest telecommunications group by market value has been encouraged by Mr Trump's appointments to his transition team of two former competition officials with a hands-off record on antitrust enforcement, people close to the company said.\nMr Trump picked as his antitrust advisers Joshua Wright , a former federal trade commissioner with traditional Republican views on competition policy, and David Higbee, who worked in the business-friendly administration of George W Bush.\nMeanwhile, the share price of Time Warner TWX rose over 2% to about $94 on Thursday afternoon, which may be another signal investors are bullish on the prospects for the merger.\nThe deal is fiercely opposed by many consumer advocates because it would give AT&T control of many popular media outlets owned by Time Warner, including CNN, HBO and the Harry Potter franchise.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nCritics fear that AT&T would use control of this content to favor its own distribution platforms by making shows available exclusively or at a lower rate. Those platforms include DirecTV as well the mobile devices of millions of AT&T subscribers.\nUnder American antitrust rules, the proposed merger must survive the scrutiny of both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.\nUntil this month, the FCC appeared to pose a serious obstacle for the deal because the agency--controlled for now by Democrats under the Obama administration--has the power to block the transfer of mandatory spectrum licenses from Time Warner to AT&T. But Trump has already appointed two officials to oversee the FCC who are unlikely to object to a merger, and he is rumored to be considering appointing Brandt Hershman --a strong proponent of deregulation--as the next Chair of the agency.\nIn other words, Trump’s FCC will likely be favorable to AT&T’s request to approve the merger, although it would almost certainly require the company to abide by a series of conditions designed to protect competition. As for the Justice Department, it would have to file a lawsuit if it wished to block the merger, which now also seems unlikely.\nOf course, the wild card in all this is Trump himself. While AT&T appears to see Trump’s appointment’s as propitious, the mercurial populism of the President-elect means his policy choices remain unpredictable. It’s entirely possible he will stick to his guns and rebuff a telecommunications giant that is unpopular with many ordinary Americans.\nAs Fortune Editor Alan Murray wrote this week: “My decades of experience watching Washington is proving of no value in predicting Trump.”",

      "text": "print \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson (right) Getty/Alex Wong \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has assured AT&T that, contrary to Trump's campaign rhetoric, the proposed merger of AT&T- and cable company Time Warner will be treated without prejudice, according to the Financial Times . \n\"After talking with the president-elect’s team, AT&T executives are confident that their deal has a good chance of passing regulatory scrutiny, people informed about the conversation said,\" the FT wrote on Thursday . \nThere have been concerns that the government, particularly under Donald Trump, would move to block the $85 billion deal. Trump certainly helped give that impression. \n“In an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump had said while campaigning. \nThis attitude seems to have softened, especially with Trump's appointment of two former officials with favorable records on the issue to his transition team. The FCC question \nBut even before these recent developments, AT&T was telling Wall Street not to worry. \nAt RBC's Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications (TIMT) Conference in New York last month, AT&T management suggested there wouldn't be any trouble with the merger. \nOne big reason AT&T was optimistic at the conference is because the company believes the merger won't be under the jurisdiction of the FCC. \n\"The only scenario in which the FCC would have jurisdiction is if Time Warner transfers certain broadcast licenses to AT&T,\" RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who viewed the presentation by AT&T's Chris Womack and Michael Black, wrote. \"The company believes these licenses (primarily business radio licenses and licenses related to Time Warner’s ownership of the WPCN superstation) can be offloaded easily, obviating the need for an FCC review.\" \nThat would mean the merger would only need to clear the Department of Justice, which AT&T is optimistic about. \n\"The major difference between an FCC and DOJ review is that a DOJ review provides AT&T legal recourse while the FCC, if it chooses not to support the deal can defer the issue to an administrative law judge, a process that can last upwards of three years, usually resulting in the dissolution of the deal,\" Atkin wrote. \nAT&T said it liked its odds, and expects the timeline on the merger to be 12-14 months.

      "text": "Above: Republican Donald Trump delivers remarks at the Shale Insight energy conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S. September 22, 2016. Image Credit: REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo \nWill Trump violate another campaign promise? \nDuring his campaign for President, Donald Trump declared that he would not approve a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner on the grounds the deal represented “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” But as with so much else when it comes to Trump, it appears that vow is negotiable. \nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s transition team assured AT&T they would review the deal with an open mind, and that company executives came away confident that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny. \nThis confidence appears to be based in part on the conversation, but also on the fact Trump has chosen people who have demonstrated a laissez-faire approach to antitrust issues in the past. As the FT reports : \nAmerica’s largest telecommunications group by market value has been encouraged by Mr Trump’s appointments to his transition team of two former competition officials with a hands-off record on antitrust enforcement, people close to the company said. \nMr Trump picked as his antitrust advisers Joshua Wright , a former federal trade commissioner with traditional Republican views on competition policy, and David Higbee, who worked in the business-friendly administration of George W Bush. \nMeanwhile, the share price of Time Warner rose over 2% to about $94 on Thursday afternoon, which may be another signal investors are bullish on the prospects for the merger. \nThe deal is fiercely opposed by many consumer advocates because it would give AT&T control of many popular media outlets owned by Time Warner, including CNN, HBO and the Harry Potter franchise. \nCritics fear that AT&T would use control of this content to favor its own distribution platforms by making shows available exclusively or at a lower rate. Those platforms include DirecTV as well the mobile devices of millions of AT&T subscribers. \nUnder American antitrust rules, the proposed merger must survive the scrutiny of both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. \nUntil this month, the FCC appeared to pose a serious obstacle for the deal because the agency—controlled for now by Democrats under the Obama administration—has the power to block the transfer of mandatory spectrum licenses from Time Warner to AT&T. But Trump has already appointed two officials to oversee the FCC who are unlikely to object to a merger, and he is rumored to be considering appointing Brandt Hershman —a strong proponent of deregulation—as the next Chair of the agency. \nIn other words, Trump’s FCC will likely be favorable to AT&T’s request to approve the merger, although it would almost certainly require the company to abide by a series of conditions designed to protect competition. As for the Justice Department, it would have to file a lawsuit if it wished to block the merger, which now also seems unlikely. \nOf course, the wild card in all this is Trump himself. While AT&T appears to see Trump’s appointment’s as propitious, the mercurial populism of the President-elect means his policy choices remain unpredictable. It’s entirely possible he will stick to his guns and rebuff a telecommunications giant that is unpopular with many ordinary Americans. \nAs Fortune Editor Alan Murray wrote this week: “My decades of experience watching Washington is proving of no value in predicting Trump.” \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "text": "Will Trump violate another campaign promise?\nDuring his campaign for President, Donald Trump declared that he would not approve a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner on the grounds the deal represented “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” But as with so much else when it comes to Trump, it appears that vow is negotiable.\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s transition team assured AT&T they would review the deal with an open mind, and that company executives came away confident that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny.\nThis confidence appears to be based in part on the conversation, but also on the fact Trump has chosen people who have demonstrated a laissez-faire approach to antitrust issues in the past. As the FT reports :\nAmerica’s largest telecommunications group by market value has been encouraged by Mr Trump’s appointments to his transition team of two former competition officials with a hands-off record on antitrust enforcement, people close to the company said.\nMr Trump picked as his antitrust advisers Joshua Wright , a former federal trade commissioner with traditional Republican views on competition policy, and David Higbee, who worked in the business-friendly administration of George W Bush.\nMeanwhile, the share price of Time Warner rose over 2% to about $94 on Thursday afternoon, which may be another signal investors are bullish on the prospects for the merger.\nThe deal is fiercely opposed by many consumer advocates because it would give AT&T control of many popular media outlets owned by Time Warner, including CNN, HBO and the Harry Potter franchise.\nCritics fear that AT&T would use control of this content to favor its own distribution platforms by making shows available exclusively or at a lower rate. Those platforms include DirecTV as well the mobile devices of millions of AT&T subscribers.\nUnder American antitrust rules, the proposed merger must survive the scrutiny of both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.\nUntil this month, the FCC appeared to pose a serious obstacle for the deal because the agency—controlled for now by Democrats under the Obama administration—has the power to block the transfer of mandatory spectrum licenses from Time Warner to AT&T. But Trump has already appointed two officials to oversee the FCC who are unlikely to object to a merger, and he is rumored to be considering appointing Brandt Hershman —a strong proponent of deregulation—as the next Chair of the agency.\nIn other words, Trump’s FCC will likely be favorable to AT&T’s request to approve the merger, although it would almost certainly require the company to abide by a series of conditions designed to protect competition. As for the Justice Department, it would have to file a lawsuit if it wished to block the merger, which now also seems unlikely.\nOf course, the wild card in all this is Trump himself. While AT&T appears to see Trump’s appointment’s as propitious, the mercurial populism of the President-elect means his policy choices remain unpredictable. It’s entirely possible he will stick to his guns and rebuff a telecommunications giant that is unpopular with many ordinary Americans.\nAs Fortune Editor Alan Murray wrote this week: “My decades of experience watching Washington is proving of no value in predicting Trump.”\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

There are about 75 apps on the platform, which serves as a \"virtual cable service\" in which users can simply pay for the channels they want.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

Heres His New Pick On the surface, it's similar to the app-based channels on Apple TV, Roku, and Alphabet 's Android TV. However, Amazon Prime members pay less for those subscriptions compared to the stand-alone apps. For example, a stand-alone subscription to CBS 'Showtime usually costs $11 per month, but only costs $9 per month on Amazon Channels.\nTherefore, the more channels a Prime member signs up for, the more money they save.

AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 per share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock has been trading far below that level amid uncertain regulatory approval.\nTime Warner stock rose 2.5% to 94.14 on the stock market today , its highest close since late 2001. Time Warner stock is up nearly 8% since Nov. 14.\nAT&T shares rose 0.65% Thursday.\nAn Oppenheimer report last week quoted Andrew Lipman, a senior partner at Washington D.C. law firm Morgan Lewis, as saying candidate Trump's comments were likely \"rhetoric, not necessarily in line with what he will do as President.\"",

      "text": "AT&T – Time Warner Merger Getting Fair Shake Under Trump December 1, 2016 - Written By Daniel Fuller \nThe US presidential election recently entered the final phase, and all that stands between Donald Trump and the White House is the vote of the Electoral College at this point. With his status now sitting at “President-Elect”, Trump has been busying himself setting things up and getting a transition team ready, full of advisers who will end up in key roles in government when the dust settles. During his campaign, Trump talked of “draining the swamp” and getting corporate interests out of government. On this note, he specifically addressed the not-yet-complete merger of AT&T and Time Warner, saying that such a deal would not be approved under his administration. It seems that his tune has changed a bit, because a conversation with Trump’s people has AT&T fairly confident that the deal will go off without a hitch. \nAT&T’s plan to scoop up Time Warner, and rights to all of the media properties that it controls, has raised eyebrows across the entire industry, with net neutrality and antitrust proponents decrying the deal en masse. The wireless giant has stake in popular media, the area of the industry where this deal would have the biggest impact. AT&T has been accused of violating net neutrality with its zero-rated DIRECTV Now service, which serves up content that AT&T has rights to through DIRECTV to select wireless customers without eating into their data plans. Naturally, when using Netflix or YouTube would take up a customer’s precious data allotment, it’s easy to see how this may give AT&T a bit of a home field advantage. \nDonald Trump’s cabinet, as the arrangement of officials pertains to telecoms and wireless, has a few key figures who want to diminish the FCC’s authority and openly oppose net neutrality principles and laws, for reasons that are entirely their own. Thus, it’s not too big of a surprise to see Trump’s people assuring AT&T that there would be no knee-jerk repulsion or other bias in reviewing their proposed merger with Time Warner, and that it would be looked at from the perspective of consumers on a number of levels. While it’s still not a guarantee that the deal will go through, these events point to the merger’s approval, and at that point, only time can tell if it will actually be doing consumers any favors.

      "text": "Fears ebb of Trump blocking AT&T’s $85bn Time Warner deal James Fontanella-Khan and David Crow 12 Mins Ago Kena Betancur | AFP |Getty Images People walk past an AT&T store in New York on October 23, 2016. \nDonald Trump 's transition team has reassured AT&T that its $85.4bn acquisition of Time Warner will be scrutinised without prejudice despite the president-elect vowing to block the deal because it concentrated too much \"power in the hands of too few\". \nAmerica's largest telecommunications group by market value has been encouraged by Mr Trump's appointments to his transition team of two former competition officials with a hands-off record on antitrust enforcement, people close to the company said. \nMr Trump picked as his antitrust advisers Joshua Wright, a former federal trade commissioner with traditional Republican views on competition policy, and David Higbee, who worked in the business-friendly administration of George W Bush . \nAfter talking with the president-elect's team, AT&T executives are confident that their deal has a good chance of passing regulatory scrutiny, people informed about the conversation said. \nMore from the Financial Times: DirectTV sued for alleged collusion with rival pay-TV groups \nCritics of AT&T's acquisition argue that the telecom company can use its ownership of Time Warner content such as HBO, CNN and film franchise Harry Potter to favour its own users, restrict choice and increase prices. AT&T rejected the criticism saying that there is no overlap between the two businesses. \nIn October, Mr Trump singled out the transaction as \"an example of the power structure I'm fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few\". \nDespite his tough rhetoric during the campaign, antitrust experts said the appointments made by Mr Trump indicated that his views on competition have changed since the November election. \nMr Wright, executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University and senior counsel at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, recently wrote in the New York Times that using antitrust enforcement for political reasons, including protecting jobs or reducing the power of large corporations, was misguided. \n\"The new antimerger fervour is based on the presumption that they are never a good deal for consumers because more consolidation always leads to higher prices, and never leads to cost savings or product improvements that benefit consumers. Both are demonstrably false,\" wrote Mr Wright. He added: \"A high level of concentration in an industry simply does not mean the industry lacks competition.\" \nErik Gordon, professor at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said that Mr Trump's administration would be less aggressive on competition than the Obama administration on enforcement but it would be tough on deals that could harm jobs. \n\"The Obama administration seemed to have an almost gut, visceral dislike of big powerful companies. I think the Trump administration doesn't have that,\" Mr Gordon said. \n\"[However], the slight populist streak in the Trump administration means that it will bring antitrust cases where it feels that mergers will hit small and midsize companies or will put a lot of people out of work,\" he added. \nAn antitrust lawyer who asked not to be named as he is close to members of Mr Trump's transition team said: \"The most likely scenario is that he will make AT&T's life hard and will force them to make some onerous concession but at the end they will let the deal through.\" Related Securities",

      "text": "Kena Betancur | AFP |Getty Images People walk past an AT&T store in New York on October 23, 2016. Donald Trump 's transition team has reassured AT&T that its $85.4bn acquisition of Time Warner will be scrutinised without prejudice despite the president-elect vowing to block the deal because it concentrated too much \"power in the hands of too few\". \nAmerica's largest telecommunications group by market value has been encouraged by Mr Trump's appointments to his transition team of two former competition officials with a hands-off record on antitrust enforcement, people close to the company said. \nMr Trump picked as his antitrust advisers Joshua Wright, a former federal trade commissioner with traditional Republican views on competition policy, and David Higbee, who worked in the business-friendly administration of George W Bush . \nAfter talking with the president-elect's team, AT&T executives are confident that their deal has a good chance of passing regulatory scrutiny, people informed about the conversation said. \nMore from the Financial Times: \nUS files antitrust lawsuit against AT&T's DirecTV over sports channel \nAT&T to launch live online television service \nDirectTV sued for alleged collusion with rival pay-TV groups \nCritics of AT&T's acquisition argue that the telecom company can use its ownership of Time Warner content such as HBO, CNN and film franchise Harry Potter to favour its own users, restrict choice and increase prices. AT&T rejected the criticism saying that there is no overlap between the two businesses. \nIn October, Mr Trump singled out the transaction as \"an example of the power structure I'm fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few\". \nDespite his tough rhetoric during the campaign, antitrust experts said the appointments made by Mr Trump indicated that his views on competition have changed since the November election. \nMr Wright, executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University and senior counsel at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, recently wrote in the New York Times that using antitrust enforcement for political reasons, including protecting jobs or reducing the power of large corporations, was misguided. \n\"The new antimerger fervour is based on the presumption that they are never a good deal for consumers because more consolidation always leads to higher prices, and never leads to cost savings or product improvements that benefit consumers. Both are demonstrably false,\" wrote Mr Wright. He added: \"A high level of concentration in an industry simply does not mean the industry lacks competition.\" \nErik Gordon, professor at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said that Mr Trump's administration would be less aggressive on competition than the Obama administration on enforcement but it would be tough on deals that could harm jobs. \n\"The Obama administration seemed to have an almost gut, visceral dislike of big powerful companies. I think the Trump administration doesn't have that,\" Mr Gordon said. \n\"[However], the slight populist streak in the Trump administration means that it will bring antitrust cases where it feels that mergers will hit small and midsize companies or will put a lot of people out of work,\" he added. \nAn antitrust lawyer who asked not to be named as he is close to members of Mr Trump's transition team said: \"The most likely scenario is that he will make AT&T's life hard and will force them to make some onerous concession but at the end they will let the deal through.\"",

The group has raised concerns about the merger. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)\nRead the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2016.

      "title": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal: AT&T Reportedly Feels Confident Merger Will Pass Under Trump",
      "text": "12/02/16 AT 12:35 PM Close \nAT&T feels confident about its pending purchase of Time Warner following a meeting with the transition team of President-elect Donald Trump, a report from the Financial Times has indicated. \nAccording to the report, the Trump administration plans to scrutinize the proposed merger of the massive communications company and programming entity that owns CNN and HBO, but will do so \"without prejudice.\" The talks apparently left the heads of AT&T feeling confident about the likelihood the deal would pass regulatory muster. \nThe newfound confidence in the $85.4 billion deal may come as a surprise given Trump's fiery campaign rhetoric, in which he regularly rallied against the purchase, positioning himself as an adversary to the type of consolidation of power that would take place. \n\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a campaign speech on October 22. \nJust over a month later, the report from Financial Times may indicate President-elect Trump has softened his views. \nThe members of the transition team who oversee the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may have been the first signal the AT&T-Time Warner deal would be a go under President Trump. Two of the appointees—Jeffrey Eisenach and Mark Jamison—have served as lobbyists for telecommunications companies in the past. \nThis week, the two were joined by American Enterprise Institute scholar Rosyln Layton . All three have been outspoken opponents to net neutrality . \nJamison's views are of particular interest regarding the future of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. The former Sprint lobbyist has suggested there is rarely such a thing as a telecommunications monopoly and believes the FCC has outlived its purpose. Related Stories Additions to Trump Transition Team May Signal An Attempt to Dismantle Net Neutrality \n\"Most of the original motivations for having an FCC have gone away,\" Jamison wrote in an October 2016 blog post. \"Telecommunications network providers and ISPs are rarely, if ever, monopolies. If there are instances where there are monopolies, it would seem overkill to have an entire federal agency dedicated to ex ante regulation of their services.\" \nEisenach, who once served as a consultant for Verizon, has similar views on the role of the FCC, which may indicate a more hands off approach to regulating deals like AT&T's purchase of Time Warner. \nJoshua Wright, a law professor who has been tapped to lead the transition of the Federal Trade Commission, has also shown to be favorable toward telecom consolidation. In an opinion piece for the New York Times , Wright argued the \"new antimerger fervor\" is based upon the presumption that mergers lead to higher prices and worse services, which he called \"demonstrably false.\" \nWhile none of Trump's appointments indicate a sure-fire approval for AT&T's bid for Time Warner, it does signal the incoming administration will be friendlier to telecom dealings than Obama's FCC. During the Obama presidency, AT&T was blocked from buying T-Mobile and was warned about behavior that may have violated net neutrality. The FCC under President Obama also blocked Comcast's attempted purchase of Time Warner Cable —a separate entity from Time Warner—in 2015.

      "text": "With Dividends, AT&T Deal Offers 12% IRR Dec. 2.16 \nAT&T-Time Warner deal on track. \nSiriusXM wants to open Pandora’s bo. \nTeleflex buys Vascular Solutions. Welcome to the Ma Bell issue of M&A Daily AT&T The $12.03 arb spread in the AT&T (NYSE: T ) acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) offers a 12% IRR if the deal closes by 2018 as I anticipate. Before it can close, it requires approvals by the DoJ, FCC, and Time Warner shareholders. Each should and probably will grant their consent. This is a good deal for the target's shareholders. As for the regulators, it is not a highly problematic deal for a transaction of this size. If their stick to their statutory mandates and do not unduly politicize the process, it should be pretty straightforward. What about the politics? The president elect spoke badly of this deal (probably because of unfavorable treatment from CNN). However, there does not appear to be much follow up to his adversarial statements. Focusing on the people Trump is picking for his antitrust and regulatory agencies, they appear to be highly professional and market-oriented. If anything, the most surprising thing about this team is that it is so entirely normal , similar to who other more traditional Republicans would pick. After AT&T management met with Trump antitrust leaders such as Joshua Wright, they had renewed confidence in their deal's prospects. Regardless of the President-Elect's prior comments, the incoming administration's agencies will be led by sound people who trust in market-based competition. President-Elect Trump's agency landing team includes Jeff Eisenach for the FCC and Paul Atkins for the SEC, CFPB, DFIC, and the OCC. Both would be my top choices for key roles. They could help rein in America's expensive and obtrusive regulatory burden. Watsi We raised $8,552 for Watsi so far. Thanks to everyone who has chipped in. I am grateful to all 89 donors. My goal is to reach $10,000 and 100 donors by Saturday. Let's help Watsi reach our next 10,000 patients. One day remains; please help!",

Two more speakers are also in the lineup: Gene Kimmelan, president and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge , and Daphna Ziman, president of Los Angeles-based fashion and film TV network Cinemoi. \nThey will testify in Washington, D.C. at a hearing for the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights. It's part of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The lineup was posted to its website. \nAT&T and Time Warner announced in October that their boards had approved a deal valued for $108.7 billion in cash, stock and debt. If the merger is approved, Dallas-based AT&T would acquire New York-based Time Warner and its library of valuable TV shows, movies and networks, including HBO, Warner Bros. Studios and CNN. \nCuban has been a strong advocate of the deal, saying it would allow AT&T to take on tech giants like Facebook and Apple and emerging TV companies like Netflix. \nLike Time Warner and AT&T, Cuban is in the the TV and entertainment business. He's an investor on ABC's reality TV show \"Shark Tank.\" He also owns two movie theater companies: Landmark Theatres and Magnolia Pictures. And he's chairman of AXS TV , a television network that carries music programs and festivals, comedy performances and mixed martial arts fights. The network is a partnership between Cuban, CBS, AEG, Ryan Seacrest Media and Creative Artists Agency. View Comments",

      "text": "Mark Cuban to Testify on AT&T-Time Warner (T, TWX) By Donna Fuscaldo | December 2, 2016 — 1:25 PM EST \nAT&T Inc. ( T ) and Time Warner Inc. ( TWX ) merger supporter Mark Cuban is reportedly slated to testify at a U.S. Senate Judiciary panel hearing next week on the deal. \nAccording to Reuters, the panel is set to look into AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner on Dec. 7. Seeking comment not only from Cuban but AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner head Jeffrey Bewkes. Cuban, a billionaire investor who owns the Dallas Mavericks and Landmark Theaters, is backing the merger saying publicly that combined the two could be a counterweight to Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google and Amazon. Looking for Balance \nIn a recent interview with Recode, Cuban argued that there is “no danger” from a combined AT&T and Time Warner given it’s a “complimentary group of assets that still have to be made to work together.” What’s more, Cuban argued combining the two gives them the weight to compete with Facebook, Apple, Google, Netflix and Amazon and even WhatsApp, if its success grows. \n“AT&T/Time Warner also now has something that the FANGAS (Facebook, Apple, Google, Netflix and Amazon) have, that Time Warner never had. They can finally know who consumes their content,” said Cuban. “That's a dramatic change that gives them a chance, but not the assurance to compete with the FANGAS companies.” Reuters reported Gene Kimmelman, president and CEO of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge is also slated to testify before the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. The Long-Running Guessing Game \nEver since AT&T announced its megadeal with Time Warner, questions have arisen about whether or not regulators will approve the deal. At the heart of the concerns are worries that a combined AT&T and Time Warner will raise prices or favor its own content over those of its competitors. DirecTV Now, launched this week at a low introductory price of $35 month, was designed to appease regulators. Still, with the low price offered only for a limited time, it may not be enough to quell concerns. \nAT&T executives appear confident that the deal will go through. According to a Financial Times report this week, executives at AT&T met with President Elect Trump’s transition team and walked away confident that the deal will win regulatory approval.

      "title": "AT&T, Time Warner Merger Looks Likely Under Trump Administration",
      "text": "AT&T feels confident about its pending purchase of Time Warner following a meeting with the transition team of President-elect Donald Trump, a report from the Financial Times has indicated. According to the report, the Trump administration plans to scrutinize the proposed merger of the massive communications company and programming entity that owns CNN and HBO, but will do so \"without prejudice.\" The talks apparently left the heads of AT&T feeling confident about the likelihood the deal would pass regulatory muster.\nThe newfound confidence in the $85.4 billion deal may come as a surprise given Trump's fiery campaign rhetoric, in which he regularly rallied against the purchase, positioning himself as an adversary to the type of consolidation of power that would take place.\n\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a campaign speech on October 22.\nJust over a month later, the report from Financial Times may indicate President-elect Trump has softened his views. \nThe members of the transition team who oversee the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may have been the first signal the AT&T-Time Warner deal would be a go under President Trump. Two of the appointees—Jeffrey Eisenach and Mark Jamison—have served as lobbyists for telecommunications companies in the past.\nThis week, the two were joined by American Enterprise Institute scholar Rosyln Layton . All three have been outspoken opponents to net neutrality .\nJamison's views are of particular interest regarding the future of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. The former Sprint lobbyist has suggested there is rarely such a thing as a telecommunications monopoly and believes the FCC has outlived its purpose.\n\"Most of the original motivations for having an FCC have gone away,\" Jamison wrote in an October 2016 blog post. \"Telecommunications network providers and ISPs are rarely, if ever, monopolies. If there are instances where there are monopolies, it would seem overkill to have an entire federal agency dedicated to ex ante regulation of their services.\"\nEisenach, who once served as a consultant for Verizon, has similar views on the role of the FCC, which may indicate a more hands off approach to regulating deals like AT&T's purchase of Time Warner.\nJoshua Wright, a law professor who has been tapped to lead the transition of the Federal Trade Commission, has also shown to be favorable toward telecom consolidation. In an opinion piece for the  New York Times , Wright argued the \"new antimerger fervor\" is based upon the presumption that mergers lead to higher prices and worse services, which he called \"demonstrably false.\"\nWhile none of Trump's appointments indicate a sure-fire approval for AT&T's bid for Time Warner, it does signal the incoming administration will be friendlier to telecom dealings than Obama's FCC. During the Obama presidency, AT&T was blocked from buying T-Mobile and was warned about behavior that may have violated net neutrality. The FCC under President Obama also blocked Comcast's attempted purchase of Time Warner Cable —a separate entity from Time Warner—in 2015.\nRelated Articles \nAT&T To Acquire Time Warner For $85.4B Additions to Trump Transition Team May Signal An Attempt to Dismantle Net Neutrality",

      "title": "Turner, Sebastian Ortega, Bruno Stagnaro Team For ‘Un Gallo Para Esculapio’",
      "text": "BUENOS AIRES — Time Warner’s TNT is teaming in Argentina with Sebastian Ortega and Pablo Cullel’s Buenos Aires-based Underground Producciones to co-produce and air adventure thriller “Un Gallo Para Esculapio.” A shorter format 10-episode TV series, “Un Gallo” reps the return to TV direction of Bruno Stagnaro and the latest show from Underground, a driving force of upscale TV fiction in Argentina which leapt to international prominence after the Sebastian Ortega show-run “El Marginal” won top prize at Paris’ Series Mania this year and was picked up by Netflix, airing from October.\n“Gallo” also marks part of TNT’s original production rollout in Argentina – with Mexico its key territory hub in Latin America – as it rings the changes on new windowing and co-financing arrangements which are one hallmark of the new Latin American TV.\nStagnaro broke through to fame co-directing with Israel Adrian Caetano “Pizza, Birra, Faso,” a 1998 movie which scored box office, plaudits and critical praise, demonstrating the artistic and commercial viability of low-budget filmmaking in Argentina. Aired in 2000, Stagnaro’s 11-seg squatter-themed “Okupas,” is likewise thought a highpoint of early century Argentine TV.\nWritten by Stagnaro and actor Ariel Staltari, who starred in “Okupas,” and to be directed by Stagnaro, “Un Gallo para Eculapio” returns to the same world of criminality and life-on-the-margins which Ortega explores so well in “El Marginal.” It follows a man who comes to Buenos Aires from its deep north Misiones province to look for his brother, who was last heard of working for a criminal gang. He infiltrates a criminal organization, which robs trucks carrying merchandise, TV sets, stern systems, hoping to know more about his brother.\nFor Ortega, Stagnaro is a natural creative bedfellow. Stagnaro is a writer-director whom I admire a lot. “Okupas” in 2000 was one of the main reasons that back then I was like: ‘There is a chance to do different things on network TV,’” Ortega said.\nHe added: “Everything he has done in the past is linked to that marginal universe. He has a talent for portraying that lifestyle that is pretty similar to mine.”\nLike “The Sopranos,” another major inspiration for Ortega, he said, “Un Gallo Para Esculapio” “shows you who each character is, the duality between what they do for a living and how they live their life.”\nTNT has first TV window. The partners are negotiating with a free-to-air broadcaster for second TV window in Argentina. TNT, Ortega’s Underground and Telefe teamed in 2015 to make “Historia de un clan,” about the notorious supper middle-class assassin kidnappers Clan Pucci which again won in France, taking the top prize at Biarritz’s FIPA fest in January 2016. Here, Telefe, Argentina’s biggest TV network, took first broadcast window and TNT screened a day later.\nThat, Turner ’s Mariano Cesar said at Ventana Sur’s new Fiction Factory forum, is the new TV reality in Latin America.\nBased out of Buenos Aires and handling TNT and TNT Series, Cesar is also overseeing for Turner a co-production with Pol-ka, another top Argentine TV production house, on “La Fragilidad de los cuerpos,” with Eva de Dominichi, Juan Gil Navarro and German Palacios.\nCesar said TNT is “quite agnostic” about series’ length, fully financing or bringing in multiple equity partners, and release window chronology.\nOrtega agreed:“I was watching a Bruce Lee interview I have seen many times. He was talking about water, how it fits into a cup of tea, a can of soda, a bottle, Producers that do content at the moment, where the industry is in the middle of a transition, we are like water. We have to learn to adapt.”\nRelated stories\nTurner's FilmStruck Movie-Subscription Service Now on Apple TV; Roku, Chromecast Promised in 2017\n10 Things We Learned About Latin America's New TV Scene at Ventana Sur\nSamantha Bee's 'Full Frontal' Renewed by TBS Through 2017\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Time Warner's CNN said Monday that it has agreed to acquire the staff and technology behind social media app Beme, created by YouTube star Casey Neistat and Matt Hackett.\nFinancial terms weren't disclosed. The company said its 12 employees will join CNN.\nBeme was created to offer a social application that allows millennials and others to share short videos without the ability to edit content.\n\"CNN changed the world at the end of the 20th century, using the then-emerging technologies of cable television and satellite video feeds to add depth, breadth, and speed to our understanding of it,\" Hackett, a former Tumblr executive, wrote in a blog post. \"In starting Beme, Casey and my goals were just as lofty: to reshape social media into the vehicle for candid, unfiltered perspectives that we always felt it should be. We wanted to create more empathy in the world by making the perspective of each of its inhabitants immediately and compellingly accessible through video.\"\nHe added: \"Social media is supposed to connect across geographies and beliefs, to be the tool for building a less cruel and more creative world. It is this idealism for what technology can achieve that built Beme. Recent days have made it crushingly obvious that the social media we have built so far - at Beme or elsewhere - has not yet achieved this ideal … Truth matters. Hearing voices and seeing perspectives far from your own matters. These principles, on which Beme was built, will form the core of our mission as a part of CNN.\"\nHackett wrote that Beme would be shutting down on Jan. 31 to become part of the Time Warner news network powerhouse. \"By joining forces with CNN, we're able to give our mission more than just one, startup-budgeted shot,\" he said. \"We are going to hunker down and create something new. To do that with the full focus it deserves, we have to say goodbye to Beme.\"\nRead more: Jeff Zucker Talks Trump TV and CNN's Ratings Hot Streak: We've \"Outshined Everybody\"",

      "text": "Time Warner is struggling to expand HBO Now, the cable-free streaming service of the popular premium pay-TV network, The Post has learned.\nWhile HBO brass had set its sights on a good chunk of the estimated 15 million homes that have cut the cable cord, HBO Now’s subscriber count currently hovers “just above 1 million,” one source familiar with the service said.\nThat’s up just slightly from March, when HBO said it was nearing the 1 million mark. As of last Dec. 31, there were 800,000 subscribers.\nInsiders point to the possibility that millennials aren’t rushing to the 20-month-old service, in part because mock news fave Jon Stewart has yet to debut an animated online-only news show.\nMeanwhile, sports writer Bill Simmons’ “Any Given Wednesday” failed to arouse interest and was axed.\nDistribution isn’t a problem for the $14.99 a month service.\nWhile it started only on Apple TV, HBO Now is now available in Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft’s Xbox and, beginning last week, on a paid tier alongside Amazon Prime Video’s channels.\nHBO also said it would be available for $5 per month as part of DirecTV Now, owned by AT&T, which is in the process of buying Time Warner.\nAn HBO spokesman said owner Time Warner would likely update overall subscriber counts as part of its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, which usually occur in February.\nCompetitors include CBS’ Showtime, which also has 1 million subscribers, and Liberty Media’s Starz and Epix (owned by Paramount, MGM and Lionsgate).\nWhile HBO Now’s stunted growth may seem disappointing, HBO is still a hugely lucrative profit driver for Time Warner, with the vast bulk of its revenue still derived from the pay-TV industry.\n ",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition Verizon CEO Talks AT&T-Time Warner, Content Strategy 7:00 AM PST 12/6/2016 by Georg Szalai Lowell McAdam Lowell McAdam appeared at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York. \nVerizon chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam told an investor conference Tuesday that AT&T's $85.4 billion deal for Time Warner doesn't affect Verizon and its strategy. \n\"No. I respect the strategy,\" he said when quizzed on the topic. \"It makes perfect sense for them\" given the telecom rival's assets. But he said Verizon was focused on serving millennials with content that is \"more snackable\" and otherwise different from traditional programming. \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York, he was also asked about the regulatory outlook for the Trump administration. Highlighting that Verizon didn’t get into Twitter wars with either candidates, he said it was too early to tell. \nCorporate tax reform could be good news, but things would depend on details, he said, adding: \"You really have to wait and see.\" McAdam also said that Verizon would \"continue to play our game\" while the outlook becomes clearer. \nFellow telecom giant AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion and recently launched streaming service DirecTV Now to reach consumers who aren't currently pay TV subscribers. DirecTV Now, which starts at $35 per month, has struck content deals with all major entertainment companies except for CBS Corp. Verizon instead has focused on deals that have built out its digital offers for millennials, focusing on another opportunity. \nVerizon earlier this year announced the $4.83 billion acquisition of Yahoo's core internet business, but has since looked at the fallout from a Yahoo email hack and whether that should lower the price tag it pays. McAdam didn't provide any updated forecast for that process on Tuesday. McAdam previously told analysts that there would be “meaningful” financial synergies in the Yahoo deal, but the company so far hasn't detailed any figures. \nThe company previously also bought AOL and Millennial Media and last year launched millennials-focused mobile video service Go90. McAdam told the UBS conference that the combination of offering AOL, Go90, skinny bundles and Verizon's FiOS pay TV service allows the company to better monetize content across platforms. \nAsked if Verizon has all the assets it needs, McAdam said \"we'll keep our options open.\" But he said the company feels good about its position in sports, finance, news and entertainment, which, followed by lifestyle, are its key content pillars.

      "text": "Currency DirecTV Now Exceeding Expectations, AT&T Says Stephenson sees Time Warner acquisition as completion of premium-content strategy 12/06/2016 09:03:00 AM Eastern Last updated at 12/06/2016 09:47:05 AM Follow @jlafayette \nCustomers signing up for DirecTV Now has \"exceeded expectations,\" according to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson. \nSpeaking at the annual UBS Global Media and Communications Conference Tuesday, Stephenson said that on its first day last Wednesday, the number of customers exceeded early projections for the month. \n“It’s early. We have no idea what the churn characteristics of this are going to look like, so we’re going to be cautious about putting numbers out, but the early demand had been rather dramatic,” Stephenson said. “It’s been really, really impressive.” \nHe said the product was over-indexing in apartment buildings, a market DirecTV had been targeting. \n\"This demonstrated the demand for long-form premium content,\" Stephenson said. “We think we’re in the golden age of TV and we don’t see that changing and that premium long form content on a mobile device is going to be a huge demand.” \nAcquiring access to long-form content was a driver for acquiring DirecTV, he said. The proposed acquisition of Time Warner would be a completion of that strategy, he added. \nAt $35 a month for 100 channels, analysts see little profit in DirecTV Now. \n\"Early on I do expect the margins to be thin,\" Stephenson said. But over time, with most DirecTV customers using some form of over-the -top video, there will be increased advertising opportunities that AT&T and DirecTV can capitalize on. \"Think about the advertising opportunity using data,\" he said. \"We'll have some unique viewership data. The advertising opportunity is fairly significant.\" \nStephenson also minimized the threat that DirecTV Now would cannibalize his satellite business. \"You know you have something special when the great concern is are you are going to cannibalize your existing product set,\" he said. With DirecTV Now limited to two streams per household, \"long term it's a manageable dynamic.\" \nAT&T is offering free data—or zero rate—to customers who want to stream their DirecTV Now content to AT&T mobile phones. This has raises concerns that it violates government net neutrality regulations. \nBut Stephenson insisted zero-rate was a good thing. “I think free is pro-consumer,” he said. \nHe added that he expected that under the new Republican Trump administration, net neutrality will get “little attention.” \nAlthough Trump has threatened to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, Stephenson said he thought Trump’s plan to lower corporate taxes would be good for business. For the first time, he said, in the company’s planning meetings, they are looking at “what happens if economic growth is more than we’re anticipating.” \nHe said that lower taxes should lead to higher investment which will increase productivity, creating growth.

      "text": "Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who counts CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. and TBS among the media companies in his portfolio, says that President-Elect Donald Trump’s campaign promises to redefine the First Amendment and “open up the libel laws” are not likely to happen when he takes office. “No, I don’t think that’s a serious thing. We should all worry if anybody was going to change the First Amendment,” Bewkes said at Business Insider’s Ignition conference, when asked about the campaign promises by interviewer Henry Blodget.\n“Remember, the Democratic party had a campaign plan to change the First Amendment, but they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform,” Bewkes added. “That would worry me more, because the press tends to miss that, because they tend to lean that way, therefore they supported what they were doing, and I think though they viewed it charitably as something cleaning up money in politics. I think the threat to the First Amendment came more from the Democratic side.”\nBewkes was also asked about Trump’s criticism of CNN on the campaign trail. At rallies, Trump has on occasion led the crowd in chants of “CNN sucks,” and he regularly tweets his complaints about CNN’s coverage.\nTrump and his team have \"had various disappointments in [their] own evaluation of the press, with all of the news outlets, and at times they have mentioned CNN. We have noticed that some of those mentions have been exaggerated by other media outlets, I don’t know why they would do that,” Bewkes quipped.\nBewkes was also asked about Trump’s promise to cancel the proposed Time Warner-AT&T merger.\n“AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said at a rally in October.\nBewkes said that Trump may not have been familiar with the details of the deal, noting that a Senate committee initially called the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner Cable to appear under oath, apparently unaware that Time Warner Cable had previously been sold to Charter Communications.\n“It may have been, it was still before the election, we know some of the strains of populism in the election on both sides,” Bewkes said. “As it becomes clear what we are doing, it will be seen by everyone as being pro-competitive, pro-consumer.”",

      "text": "AP  52AM PT \nDonald Trump has railed against the media and threatened to change libel laws to make it easier to sue reporters who print or broadcast critical coverage. \nOne of the president-elect’s favorite targets has been CNN. However, Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes , who leads CNN’s parent company, doesn’t believe that Trump poses a grave threat to free speech. \n“I don’t think that’s a thing,” said Bewkes, who said that Trump’s issues with CNN have been magnified by rival news organizations. \nThe Time Warner chief argued that he was more concerned about the Democratic Party’s commitment to campaign finance reform. On the trail, Hillary Clinton, the party’s nominee, said that she would push for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on political spending by corporations and interest groups. \n“I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side,” said Bewkes, who argued that the reforms would “restrain multiple voices.” He suggested that the press didn’t cover that threat because they “lean” to left side of the political spectrum. He did not mention the fact that Time Warner, which makes money from television advertising, benefits financially from loosening restrictions on political spending. \nBewkes, whose company is awaiting government approval for its $85.4 billion sale to AT&T, also struck back at a New York Post report that HBO, the company’s cable channel, is disappointed by subscriptions for its streaming service, HBO Now. The subscriber base is just above 1 million, which the paper said suggested the service was not as popular as Time Warner has expected the offering would be. \nBewkes quipped that maybe the numbers were disappointing to the Post, but not to Time Warner brass. \n“They do have some good stories in there, that one I don’t think was one of them,” said Bewkes. \nHe also hit back at suggestions that Bill Simmons’s “Any Given Wednesday,” a ratings-challenged interview show with sports figures, was a dud. The show was recently canceled. \n“It didn’t flop,” said Bewkes, who said that HBO doesn’t make programming decisions based on ratings. He added that Simmons is “working on other things which we think will be better and fairly noticeable.” \nBewkes also paid a backhanded compliment to Netflix, the streaming service that is seen as a main rival to more traditional media companies. He said it was “great,” just not as great as HBO. \n“I watch it when I can,” he said, adding, “Don’t you watch things in order of preference? First you watch the good stuff.”",

      "title": "TIME WARNER CEO: The 'real threat' to the First Amendment came from Democrats, not Trump",
      "text": "print \nJeff Bewkes. Screenshot/Business Insider \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes told Business Insider's Henry Blodget on Tuesday that the \"real threat\" to the First Amendment did not come from President-elect Donald Trump during the campaign, but rather from the Democratic Party. \nBewkes' remarks came during Business Insider's annual IGNITION conference, during which he was asked about Trump's frequent campaign threats to open up libel laws . \nTrump has also set his sights on Bewkes own media property, CNN, which he consistently ridiculed along the campaign trail and has continued to do even after Election Day . \n\"Do you worry about that at all?\" Blodget asked. \nBewkes said he didn't \"think that's a serious thing,\" adding that \"we should all worry\" if someone were seeking to change the First Amendment. He suggested that came from the Democratic Party, which \"had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.\" \n\"And that was worrying me more,\" Bewkes continued. \"Because the press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing, I think overly charitably, as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices.\" \nDemocrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, vowed to engage in campaign finance reform following the election, a cause that has been bolstered in recent years by the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. The 2010 ruling deemed corporations and labor unions as people who could flex First Amendment rights in contributing to campaigns, and led to the advent of so-called Super PACs. \n\"So I thought the real threat to the First Amendment came from the Democrats' side more,\" Bewkes said. \"There's not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.\" Business Insider's flagship annual conference",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes Says Democrats Were Bigger First Amendment Threat Than Trump 7:56 AM PST 12/6/2016 by Paul Bond Francois G. Durand/Getty Images Jeff Bewkes \"The threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side more,\" he says, arguing journalists viewed a Democratic plank, \"overly charitably,\" as campaign finance reform. \nWhen it comes to free speech and free press, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes said Tuesday that he doesn't fear president-elect Donald Trump as much as he does his rivals on the other side of the political aisle. \n\"The threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side,\" Bewkes said Tuesday during a conversation Tuesday with Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget at a conference in New York in a session that was webcast. \nBewkes made the comment after Blodget noted that Trump has criticized CNN for allegedly unfair coverage, and even threatened some sort of regulation in retaliation against CNN, owned by Time Warner. \"I don't think that's a serious thing,\" Bewkes told Blodget at the Ignition: Future of Digital conference. \"If anybody is going to change the First Amendment ... remember, the Democratic party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.\" \n\"That was worrying me more, because the press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing, I think overly charitably, as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices,\" Bewkes argued. \"So, I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side more. I think there won't be a serious effort on the Republican side.\" \nBewkes also said Trump wasn't the only Republican candidate to complain of unfair coverage, as Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush and others also weren't happy with CNN and the press. \"That's more about the nature of change in that party right now,\" he said. \"I think we're going to see it on the Democratic side, too.\" \nBewkes also said he isn't worried that Trump has said he'd like to prevent AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, suggesting that maybe politicians who initially spoke against the merger confused Time Warner with Time Warner Cable, which would have been a tougher sale to regulators, given AT&T already owns pay TV giant DirecTV. \n\"We were still before the election and we know some of the strains of populism in that election on both sides,\" he said. \"I'm not saying whether everybody thought the it was the cable company merging with a phone company — they're different competitive issues — but it isn't that, and I think when it becomes clear what we're doing it will become clear to everyone that it will be pro-competitive, pro-consumer and improve competition in advertising.\"",

      "text": "Time Warner CEO Says Democrats Worse for First Amendment Than Donald Trump \nJeff Bewkes said push to overturn Citizens United decision would “restrain multiple voices” Matt Pressberg | December 6, 2016 @ 9:09 AM Time Warner Inc. \nTime Warner’s CNN has been one of President-elect Donald Trump’s main media punching bags, but the company’s boss isn’t worried about any First Amendment threat posed by the man who has talked about wanting to “open up the libel laws.” He’s more concerned about what the Democrats might do. \n“I thought the real threat to the First Amendment came from the Democrats’ side more,” Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said at Business Insider’s Ignition conference in New York. “There’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.” \nBewkes singled out Hillary Clinton’s campaign promise to push for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United v. FEC , a 2010 Supreme Court decision that essentially allowed corporations and interest groups to spend money unfettered in the name of political advocacy under the argument that money is speech. Also Read: Jeff Bewkes on Time Warner's Future Under AT&T: 'I'm Not Going Anywhere' \nBewkes seemed to agree with that in his remarks at the conference, saying that Clinton and the Democrats “had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.” \nHe also blamed the political leanings of the mainstream media for their failure to perceive the consequences of a Citizens United reversal. \n“Therefore they were supporting what they were viewing, I think overly charitably, as something in cleaning up money in politics, when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices,” he said. 14 Billion-Dollar Acquisitions Before AT&T-Time Warner (Photos) \nThink $85 billion is a lot of cash? Take a tour through the lurid amounts of money dropped on American media and content machines over the years. \n1999: Disney Buys ABC The alliance is such a potent brand that it's hard to imagine them as solo entities, but the $19.5 billion sale gave the Disney company an iconic TV brand to call its own. Handout \n1999: Clear Channel buys AMFM Inc The radio giant paid $20.6 billion for its rival AMFM, their 830 radio stations, 425,000 billboards and 19 TV stations per Forbes. Handout \n1999: Viacom Buys CBS Fifteen years ago, the media giant acquired the TV network for $34.1 billion. While the companies would split in 2006, always remember -- history repeats itself . Handout \n2000: Time Warner and AOL Merge It's often referred to as one of the most disastrous mergers in history. The $186.2 billion price tag seemed visionary at the time, but quickly devolved into a corporate culture way... and the of the dot-com collapse. Handout \n2006: Disney Buys Pixar In the first of a series of key moves from Disney CEO Bob Iger -- ones that would ensure long-term health and eventually see the company take record-breaking market share -- Steve Jobs was convinced to entrust the animation studio to them for a reported $7.4 billion. Handout \n2009: Disney Buys Marvel Iger's $4 billion purchase of the comic book studio changed the industry, secured Robert Downey Jr. as the highest paid actor in Hollywood and made a new constellation of stars and film franchises. Handout \n2012: Disney Buys Lucasfilm Bob Iger's hat trick was completed with a major coup in landing the \"Star Wars\" universe for $4 billion, which resulted in the No. 3 all-time top grossing film, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" YouTube \n2013: Comcast Buys Remaining Stake in NBC After purchasing a majority stake in 2011 for $30 billion, Comcast paid another $16.7 billion to wholly own the TV brand, film studio Universal and its California and Florida theme parks. Handout \n2013: Yahoo Buys Tumblr It's a relatively small price for a media acquisition, but spend-happy Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer raised a lot of eyebrows by paying $1 billion for the blogging platform Tumblr. Handout \n2014: Facebook Buys WhatApp While this is a straight-up tech acquisition, it's interesting to note that Facebook paid a staggering $22 billion for the European-based WhatsApp, a mobile application that lets users text for free over WiFi, to bolster their own messaging app. The company has repeatedly said it doesn't care to acquire content engines, but this signals a strong urge to level competition if they ever change their minds. Handout \n2015: Activision Blizzard Buys King Mobile The video game company literally spent $5.9 billion on fun and games. Mobile game company King counts the most successful app of all time, Candy Crush, and legacy social games like Bubble Witch in its stable. Now Activision gets to develop properties like a just-sold CBS game show based on Candy Crush.

      "text": "AT&T, Time Warner CEOs hopeful merger will be approved under Trump by Dylan Byers @CNNMoney  26 PM ET The top executives at both AT&T and Time Warner appear hopeful that President-elect Donald Trump and his administration will not stand in the way of their companies' $85.4-billion merger. \nSpeaking at the Business Insider Ignition conference in New York on Tuesday, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said \"the merits of the law suggest it's a deal that gets done.\" \n\"This is a vertical merger,\" he said. \"We compete nowhere. I don't think you can find an example where such a merger has been denied... Generally, vertical mergers are viewed as consumer friendly.\" \nA few hours earlier, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes told the same audience that he wasn't worried, and even wondered if politicians who opposed the merger had confused Time Warner with Time Warner Cable, which is a separate company. \n\"I'm not saying whether everybody thought it was the cable company merging with a phone company -- they're different competitive issues -- but it isn't that, and I think when it becomes clear what we're doing it will become clear to everyone that it will be pro-competitive, pro-consumer and improve competition in advertising,\" Bewkes said. \nBoth Stephenson and Bewkes will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to address congressional concerns about antitrust violations. \nAs a candidate, Trump had positioned himself as an opponent of the acquisition, calling it \"an example of the power structure I am fighting.\" \n\"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump had said. \nDuring the transition, however, Trump's team has shown more flexibility. Many Wall Street analysts now believe the Trump administration will actually be a boon for the deal. \n\"AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner likely has a higher probability of getting approved given the impending power shift in Washington, D.C.,\" Eric Handler, of MKM Partners, said in a note to investors last month. \n\"We now view the likelihood of AT&T/Time Warner getting approved as a 70/30 proposition based on a recent expert discussion we held.\" \nOn Tuesday, Stephenson suggested Trump may have expressed opposition to the deal because of his frustrations with CNN, which is part of Time Warner. \n\"Look, anytime the president of the United States comes out and says they're not in favor of what you're trying to do, you have to pay attention,\" he said. \"But I don't know what part of the deal he's referring to. I've heard rumors he's not happy with CNN, so that might have come into it.\"  26 PM ET",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe CEO of Time Warner, which operates CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. and TBS, said Tuesday that it is not President-elect Donald Trump who is the “real threat” to the First Amendment — it’s the Democrats. \nDuring a sit-down Tuesday with Business Insider editor Henry Blodget, Time Warner’s Jeff Bewkes was asked about Trump’s frequent campaign promise to “open up the libel laws” as president. Bewkes said he doesn’t believe those comments were a “serious thing.” Trump says he wants to \"open up our libel laws\" so he can sue news outlets and \"win lots of money.\" pic.twitter.com/AeWfSvPfi5 \n— PolicyMic (@PolicyMic) February 26, 2016 \nBut he does have some hangups on the issue when it comes to the Democratic Party, which he noted “had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.” \n“That would worry me more,” Bewkes said, according to Politico, “because the press tends to miss that, because they tend to lean that way, therefore they supported what they were doing, and I think though they viewed it charitably as something cleaning up money in politics.” \nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders promised to delve into campaign finance reform after the election. For several years, Clinton has actively campaigned against the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which classified corporations and labor unions just as it did people. The ruling allowed corporations to practice First Amendment rights by making financial contributions and ultimately led to the creation of so-called super PACs. \n“I think the threat to the First Amendment came more from the Democratic side,” the Time Warner CEO said. “There’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.” \nLater in the interview, Bewkes responded to Trump’s specific criticism of CNN and the president-elect’s supporters’ oft-invoked chant, “CNN sucks.” \n“[Trump and his campaign] have had various disappointments in [their] own evaluation of the press, with all of the news outlets, and at times they have mentioned CNN,” he said, jokingly adding, “We have noticed that some of those mentions have been exaggerated by other media outlets, I don’t know why they would do that.”",
