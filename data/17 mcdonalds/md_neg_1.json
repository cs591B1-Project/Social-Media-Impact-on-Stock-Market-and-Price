      "text": "David Marsden—Getty Images (and smaller) \nHave you ever thought McDonald’s Big Mac was too small or too big? Soon you’ll be able to order the size that’s just right. \nThe fast food chain announced Thursday that it plans to introduce two new sizes to his most famous menu offering: the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr . The menu change will start in early 2017 and will be a limited-time offer to reignite interest in the nearly 50-year old Big Mac. \nThe Grand Mac has two beef patties and two slices of cheeses, and weighs a third of a pound. The Mac Jr. has one regular beef patty. \nThe company tested the new offerings in Columbus, Ohio and Dallas, where the Mac Jr. cost between $2.39 to $2.59; the Grand Mac was $4.89, according to industry news sources . \nMcDonald’s rarely tweaks with its iconic burger, but it has made a lot of other changes to its offerings recently in hopes of turning around declining sales, including experimenting with made-to-order burgers and introducing all-day breakfast .

      "text": "Society McDonald's files $20m lawsuit against the city of Florence The fast-food chain has taken the city to court over a rejection of its application to open an outlet at a famous historic location. IB Times Satff Reporter November 8, 2016 10:47 IST McDonald's files $20m lawsuit against the city of Florence. Picture: A man passes a McDonald's restaurant in Singapore July 25, 2016. Reuters \nOn Monday, one of America's top fast-food chains stated that it was claiming about $20 million from the Italian city of Florence. Why? Because the city rejected their application to open an outlet at its famous Piazza del Duomo -- one of the most visited places in Europe. \nThe Mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, reportedly rejected McDonald's application in June. The technical panel which approved the decision wanted to preserve the city's ancient heritage site. The Guardian reports that Nardella told the city council that \"McDonald's has the right to submit an application because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.\" Bidders line up for McDonald's East Asia business sale \nThe Mayor was looking to support only traditional businesses within the Piazza del Duomo. Nardella also added that they didn't have any 'prejudice' against McDonald's since the fast-food chain was already present across other parts of the city. \nThe Piazza del Duomo is one of the most visited sites in Europe attracting thousands of tourists each year. The Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Giotto bell tower and the St John Baptistery are all located here. \nBut why has McDonald's filed a $20 million lawsuit? McDonald's is reportedly angry with the city as it had made changes to its business model so that it would fit in with Florence regulations. With the denial of the application, it was deemed a setback for them. \nMeanwhile, Florence does not want fast-food joints overcrowding their city and in January 2016 had mandated that restaurants which were situated in the historic heart had to make use of products from the city or the Tuscany region. \nThere are numerous issues that fast-food chains do face across Europe when they look at opening an outlet in an historic location. Menu choice, litter control and the design of the business façade are some of the common issues that they have to deal with. Also read ",

Photo: Andrew De La Rue ╳ exit \nFast food chains McDonald's, Hungry Jacks, KFC and Starbucks and banking giant CBA will be forced out of their prime, high-trading Swanston Street stores to make way for the government's $10.9 billion Melbourne Metro Rail project. \nThe business behemoths will join a growing exodus of key retailers abandoning the city's main shopping core, Swanston Street, ahead of years of disruption expected from work on the project's centrepiece tunnel and two city stations. \nMetro authorities are negotiating the compulsory acquisition of four Swanston Street properties between Young & Jackson's Hotel on Flinders Street and the Nicholas Building on the corner of Flinders Lane. \nAll four buildings – along with the Port Phillip Arcade behind – will be razed to make way for the rail project's CBD South station. \nPlans for the new city tunnel have already seen a number of retailers take flight, looking for other locations nearby to set up shop. \nMen's clothing store Tarocash, shoe retailer Foot Locker and Brunetti's Cafe are in negotiations, or have announced, new trading locations. \nStarbucks is being forced to move from a site at the base of Westin Hotel at the rear of City Square due to looming construction that will see City Square overtaken as a staging base for much of the tunnel project. \nThe nine-kilometre twin tunnel will have five underground stations – Domain, CBD South, CBD North, Parkville and Arden – expected to take half a decade to complete before they become operational in 2026. \nMcDonald's owns the three-storey building at 9-11 Swanston Street and will be hard pressed to find a store in an equally prominent location to replace what has been a jewel in its trading crown. \nMcDonald's confirmed it was approached by the Metro Rail authorities and were \"working through the process\", a spokeswoman said. \"We are keen to maintain a presence it the area,\" she said. \nHungry Jacks is believed close to sealing a deal to replace one of the two trading locations it will lose on Swanston Street, but would not comment. \nAs well as being required to move from a two-level building at 15-19 Swanston, it is also being forced to vacate its store at the northern end of the strip on the corner of La Trobe Street, which will be demolished to make way for CBD North station. \nColliers International retail director Cam Taranto said the rail project was pushing retailers to open shops in other high-traffic locations such as Elizabeth and Bourke streets. \nAnother agent, Jarrod Herscu, said other retailers were taking advantage of the perceived disruption to secure better, long-term deals. Rozzi's Italian Canteen recently leased an entire building at 157 Swanston at below market rates, Mr Herscu said. \nMetro Rail confirmed it was in discussions with building owners. \nThe compulsory acquisition process was likely to be triggered early next year once planning approvals were received, a spokesman said. \nSome CBD roads – including sections of Franklin and A'Beckett streets – will be permanently closed once tunnel work is underway.

      "text": "(Photo: AP/Tampa Bay Times, Skip O'Rourke)\n\nRoderick Livingston protests in front of the McDonald's in Tampa, Florida in 2015. \n\nElection Day is finally here (phew!), and as usual, there’s a lot at stake for working Americans. On the presidential level (at the risk of stating the obvious), there is a huge chasm between Clinton and Trump when it comes to backing a progressive, working-families agenda.\n\nWhile Donald Trump has promised to be a voice for the (white male) working class, his proposed policies won’t magically bring back manufacturing and offshored jobs. In fact, his proposals would be downright disastrous for working people. Hillary Clinton , by contrast, supports a $12 federal minimum wage and mandatory paid sick and family leave, advocates ambitious policies that would boost infrastructure spending and lift up workers in the child- and home-care industries, and promises to push through immigration reform, which would create a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers. (There’s more, but you get the picture.)\n\nOf course, the presidential election is just one of many consequential races. Who controls the U.S. Senate, state governors’ mansions, and legislative chambers, as well as the fate of a slew of ballot measures, will all be decided today.\n\nHere’s what to watch for:\n\n**Unions’ Ground Game in Swing States**\n\nIf Clinton is to win the White House, she must do well in several battleground states (Florida, Nevada, Ohio, New Hampshire , Wisconsin, North Carolina , and Pennsylvania) that also feature heated U.S. Senate races. (Democrats are also hoping their Senate candidates can win in Missouri and Indiana, too, through for Clinton herself, those states are out of reach.) Labor unions have lined up behind Clinton and Democratic Senate candidates in battleground states and poured millions into ad buys. But unions’ real power rests with their formidable ground-game operations to turn out the vote.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, in partnership with the national teachers unions, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and liberal benefactor Tom Steyer have been running a voter canvassing and turnout operation called For Our Future, targeting in voters in many of those states. Working America , the AFL-CIO’s non-union political organizing arm, has been working to convince white working-class voters in states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Ohio to vote Democratic. The Service Employees International Union has forged its own independent political program that is specifically aimed at turning out black and Latino working-class voters. In Florida alone, the union has knocked on more than half a million doors three times over, the vast majority being Latino households.\n\nAll of these union-backed efforts have ramped up over the weekend and will continue with GOTV through Election Day to drive up Democratic base turnout. Their ability to do so will likely be a determining factor in how Clinton and down-ballot Democrats fare in those states.\n\n**The Race for the States **\n\nThere are 12 elections for state governors today, and seven of them are wide open. The most closely contested races have significant stakes for labor.\n\nPerhaps the most consequential gubernatorial race for unions is in Missouri, where the Republican-controlled legislature has not only passed legislation banning localities (including St. Louis and Kansas City) from enacting their own minimum wage laws, but has also, at the behest of state business leaders, sought to make the state right-to-work, meaning that unions can no longer mandate membership or fees as a condition of employment at unionized worksites. The only things that have kept right-to-work and a larger anti-worker agenda from taking hold have been the vetoes by Democratic Governor Jay Nixon, who is term-limited out of office this year. Right-to-work has become a key issue in the race between Democratic contender (and former Republican) Chris Koster, who has broad support from state and national unions and opposes the policy, and Republican contender (and former Democrat) Eric Greitens, who has pledged to sign right-to-work into law. Polls show the two running neck and neck.\n\nIn West Virginia, billionaire Democrat Jim Justice is running against Republican president of the state Senate Bill Cole to replace Democratic Governor Earl Ray Tomblin. The Republican-held legislature has already pushed through right-to-work legislation (though unions got a temporary injunction after filing suit in court) and repealed its prevailing wage law for state-funded construction projects, overriding Tomblin’s vetoes of both. With an anti-union Republican like Cole in control, the party would be able to further devastate unions in a state where they’ve already seen a precipitous drop in power.\n\nIn Indiana, Governor (and Republican vice presidential candidate) Mike Pence has blocked attempts to raise the state’s minimum wage, repealed its prevailing wage law, and defended its right-to-work law, while vehemently advocating for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb is running for governor in Pence’s place, pledging to continue Pence’s politics. The union-backed Democrat, former state Speaker of the House John Gregg, has said that Republican control of the legislature, means there isn’t a viable path to repeal right-to-work and restore the prevailing wage. At the very least, though, he would provide a roadblock against further attacks on unions.\n\nIn other post-industrial Midwest states, unions are hoping that Democrats can flip the Wisconsin Senate and the Michigan House to provide a counterweight to the anti-labor politics of Governors Scott Walker and Rick Snyder, respectively. Meanwhile, Kentucky Democrats are fighting to hold on to their thin (five-seat margin) control of the House, which as of now is the only thing keeping Republican Governor Matt Bevin from turning the state right-to-work.\n\n**Ballot Measures **\n\nIt’s hard to keep track of the hundreds of initiatives and referendums on the ballot across the country, but several of them will directly affect workers. On the ballot in both Virginia and Alabama are constitutional amendments that would encase those states’ existing right-to-work laws within their respective constitutions. If passed, these measures would block any future legislative attempts to repeal right-to-work and require opponents to get voters to amend the constitution at the polls.\n\nIn four states, voters will decide whether to increase their state’s minimum wage. In Washington, the initiative would increase the state’s minimum to $13.50 an hour by 2020, and also mandate paid sick leave for workers. In Arizona , Colorado , and Maine, the measures would increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. Arizona’s measure would also include paid sick leave. In South Dakota, voters will decide whether to decrease the state’s $8.50 minimum wage (enacted via ballot measure in 2014) to $7.50 an hour for workers under the age of 18.\n\nIn Seattle, voters will also decide if hotels should be required to have protections against sexual assault and harassment for its workers and whether hotel owners should help pay for the health care of contracted workers and protect against employee job loss when contracting out hotel work. In San Jose, a measure is on the ballot that would require businesses to offer available hours to part-time workers before hiring more workers.",

      "text": "McDonald's Sues Florence For $20 Mn Over Site Refusal McDonald's Sues Florence for $20 mn Over Site Refusal AFP | Updated: November 08, 2016 16:22 IST Tweeter Hard on the heels of stoking anger over plans to open a restaurant in the Vatican, McDonald's has filed a $20-million lawsuit against Florence for blocking a proposed outlet in the city's most revered square.The US fast-food chain told AFP Monday it was claiming 17.8 million euros ($19.65 million) in damages after the city rejected an application to open an outlet in the historic Piazza del Duomo, one of the most visited places in Europe.McDonald's said the suit was being filed with the administrative court, which arbitrates in governance disputes in Italy. The firm gave no other details.Florence's centre-left mayor, Dario Nardella, turned down McDonald's application in June, in a decision that was confirmed the following month by a technical panel in charge of preserving the city's ancient heart .\"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no,\" Nardella told the city council, saying he wanted to support \"traditional business\" in the area.\"We don't have any prejudice\" against McDonald's, Nardella said, noting that the company had opened restaurants \"in other parts of town.\"According to several reports in the Italian media, McDonald's is particularly aggrieved in the case of Florence as it had promised to make major changes to its business model to fit in with local regulations. Cardinals in a tizz Worried about the proliferation of fast-food outlets catering to backpackers in the city of Michelangelo, Florence introduced new licensing regulations in January requiring restaurants in the historic heart to use \"typical products\" either of the city or from the Tuscany region.The Piazza del Duomo -- \"Cathedral Square\" -- is a treasure of Gothic and Renaissance architecture. Its buildings include the domed Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Giotto bell tower and the St. John Baptistery.Last month, the daily La Republicca reported that plans to open a McDonald's in a piazza next to Saint Peter's Square in Rome had angered cardinals who live above the proposed site.The scheme is \"by no means respectful of the architectural traditions of one of the most characteristic squares which look onto the colonnade of Saint Peters,\" it quoted Cardinal Elio Sgreccia as saying.In their expansion into historic locations in Europe, McDonald's and other fast-food chains often encounter opposition on cultural or architectural grounds. Many disputes, though, end in a compromise, in such areas as menu choice, litter control and the design of the business facade. (This   auto-generated  ",

Ray Kroc, a high school dropout and the son of immigrants, not only conquered the fast-food world, he started his assault when he was well into his 50s and wouldn’t taste success for another decade. \nIn 1961, with a $2.7 million loan, he bought out the two brothers who had started McDonald’s and began to run the company his way. With fewer than 1,000 franchises under his belt, Kroc took McDonald’s stock public in 1965 and became an instant millionaire, 33 times over. Today there are more than 36,000 McDonald’s worldwide. \nThat last numerical nugget is one of the many things readers won’t find in the surprisingly cursory duel biography, Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away (Dutton, 266 pp., ** out of four stars). It's not that author Lisa Napoli, an experienced journalist, hasn’t done considerable research or doesn’t cover the basics. She simply leaves things out that would have enlivened her narrative. \nThe first page is tantalizing enough, with the promise of a peek inside the gated world of those devil-may-care “one-percenters.” Ray Kroc apparently would fire people — actually, have his secretary do the honors — for drinking the wrong cocktail. “Manhattans, he thought, were for sissies,” Napoli writes. Joan, Ray’s third wife, also had an underling discharge “a once-beloved cook who deigned to ask for a modest raise after years of service.” \nAuthor Lisa Napoli. (Photo: Preston Wiles) \nBut thereafter the book settles into a fairly humdrum tale that offers little that is new or particularly insightful. Ray was a workaholic and a high functioning alcoholic, and he and Joan had some real donnybrooks. These are not explored in any detail, even though Joan once filed for divorce citing physical and mental cruelty and obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband. The couple reconciled. \nWe learn that Ray was a \"staunch conservative,\" that he ordered, for example, the flags at all McDonald’s to fly at full-staff after four Kent State students were killed by National Guardsmen in 1970. He gave more than $250,000 to Richard Nixon’s 1972 reelection campaign, but then the trail goes cold. \nJoan, on the other hand, was a liberal, something she hid from the world until after her husband’s death in 1984. In addition to embarking on a life of laudatory philanthropy, the widow gave $1 million to the Democratic Party in 1987 and $3.6 million to the Carter Center. (If she gave another penny to the Democrats before she died in 2003, the reader doesn’t find out). \nRay Kroc built McDonald's into a fast-food empire. (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) \n“St. Joan of the Arches” was, indeed, a godsend to myriad causes, from National Public Radio to the Salvation Army, which alone received more than $1.5 billion (yes, billion) from her. She gave most of her fortune away; this is documented in too much detail. \nJoan Kroc, the author cautions, was not a saint. But rather than explore her complex personality, Napoli only provides bromides, such as, “She had a bawdy sense of humor, and she smoked like a fiend.” An example of an off-color joke would have been most welcome at this point. \nThe reader is left with many questions about Joan and Ray, who smoked and drank too much. \nMaybe we'll learn more from The Founder , the movie starring Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc. It's set to open in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 16 and nationwide on Jan. 20.",

      "text": "We McDonald ‘Home’“The Voice” Video: Watch Live Playoffs Performance! Truth rating: 10 By Shari Weiss | 8:19 pm, November 7th, 2016 VIDEO (NBC) \nWe McDonald performed “Home” during “The Voice” Live Playoffs on Monday. Check out the video below! \nAs Gossip Cop has reported, McDonald has been one to watch during season 11 of the NBC competition thus far. She stunned in her Blind Audition with a deep-throated performance that had the coaches going crazy. They were even more shocked to hear the teen’s high-pitched speaking voice. \nBut it’s McDonald’s singing vocals and confident performance style that’s propelled her through the Battles and Knockouts. Now in the Top 20 as a member of Team Alicia, the aspiring star had the chance to sing live for the first time. And while doing so, she had to hope to earn enough votes to make it into the Top 12. \nWith “Home” from The Wiz , McDonald gave a soulful performance that seemed to go over well with the audience. But unlike in past episodes and seasons, the contestant didn’t get any immediate feedback. As the Live Playoffs were taking place entirely on one night this cycle, instead of two episodes plus a results show, the format required all of Keys’ team members to perform one right after another with no critiques. \nViewers could vote in real time to choose two of Keys’ five artists to stay in the competition. Would McDonald make the cut? She absolutely did, along with team mate Christian Cuevas. It was up to the coach herself to pick a third contestant, and she went with Sa’Rayah. Josh Halverson and Kylie Rothfield were therefore eliminated. Watch below! \nEnter your email address here to receive daily news updates from us.",

      "text": "Share \nThe conveniences of fast food are getting even more convenient now that McDonald’s is gearing up to roll out the ability to order and pay for a Big Mac online. \nAccording to a report by The Next Web , McDonald’s is gearing up to launch the new app that will support online orders next year. But not every fast food fan is going to have access to the app since it will be launched only in certain international markets at first, including Australia, Canada, France and the U.K. \nThe exact timing of the new app is unclear at this point, but it’s part of the fast food chain’s efforts to get more high-tech. It’s already working toward rolling out technology in all of its stores worldwide by the end of 2018, noted the report. McDonald’s is a little late to the ordering-via-an-app party. After all, Starbucks , Domino’s and Taco Bell already have digital payment options that have been hugely popular with consumers, particularly millennials who were born with a smartphone at their hip. Take Domino’s, for one example. \nFor some time now, Domino’s has been aggressively courting millennials and using technology to lure them. It launched its AnyWare technology strategy, which aims to give customers the ability to place an order using any one of a multitude of platforms. They include voice ordering through Dom, the company’s order-taking app; placing an order via its Twitter feed, where customers can use a pizza emoji to place an order; and through text messaging. Customers can even shout out an order to Amazon’s Echo, Samsung’s Smart TV and Ford’s Sync, if they are in the car. Domino’s recently expanded its digital ordering offerings to include the ability to place an order through smartwatches. \nTo baby boomers, who witnessed the birth of the Ann Arbor, MI-based pizza chain, it may seem easier just to phone it in, which still is possible to do. But for millennials, who grew up with mobile devices and who would rather text than talk to someone, it seems to be resonating, with half of Domino’s sales coming from digital channels, according to BTIG Analyst Peter Saleh. Domino’s has said that customers tend to order more when using a digital venue, as opposed to a phon e.",

McDonald's is suing Florence for €18m after it was blocked from opening a restaurant on one of the Italian city's most historic plazas. \nThe fast-food giant had its plans for an outlet on the Piazza del Duomo rejected by Florence's mayor in June. \nThe decision was upheld in July by a technical panel in charge of preserving the city's ancient heart. \nBut McDonald's, which modified its proposals to fit with city guidelines, has now launched a bid for damages. \nThe chain is claiming it has been discriminated against, and wants to recoup the €17.8m (£15.9m; $19.7m) it estimates it will lose over the next 18 years, according to Italian newspaper Firenze Today. Right to say no \nIt argues it put forward a plan to \"operate respectfully towards the local policies, even accepting to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation\". keyboard shortcuts: V vote up article J next comment K previous comment",

Meanwhile, the Mac Jr. has a single patty.

      "text": "Chicago Construction News Construction permit issued for McDonald’s new West Loop headquarters Work can now start on the fast food giant’s 600,000-square-foot corporate HQ at 110 N. Carpenter Street by Jay Koziarz Nov 8, 2016, 9:47am CST Rec Sterling Bay/Gensler Perhaps the single most important and potentially transformative developments to hit Chicago’s West Loop in a number of years, McDonald’s new corporate campus is ready to break ground at the site of Oprah’s demolished Harpo Studios. The nine-story, block-wide project from developer Sterling Bay and architect Gensler just received a permit to begin work on its foundation and two-level, 300-stall underground garage. As with many of Chicago’s larger developments, the issuance of a foundation permit allows work to begin while the remainder of the permitting is still under review. The Micky D’s project quickly made its way through the city approval process after its first public unveiling in June. Meanwhile, Oprah’s old TV studios at Randolph and Carpenter were torn down to make way for the $250 million project. McDonald’s has signed on to occupy the majority of the new building’s rentable space and will vacate the firm’s current campus in suburban Oak Brook in 2018. The move to Chicago proper is expected to draw a number of suppliers and other related businesses to the hot and rapidly-changing West Loop.

      "text": "McDonald’s Sues The City of Florence (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | November 8, 2016 — 12:13 PM EST \nFlorence is located in the Tuscany region of Italy and is known for Renaissance art and architecture, as well as fashion and wealthy residents. It’s not the kind of place you would expect to find McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ). However, there are already nine McDonald’s locations in Florence, and due to millions of visitors to the city per year, McDonald’s considers Florence a prime location, especially Piazza Del Duomo, where McDonald’s wanted to open a new restaurant. Request denied. (See also, 10 Countries with the Most McDonald's Locations ) \nAfter being rejected, McDonald’s is now suing the city of Florence for $20 million. The rejected application related to changes in the city’s licensing laws, which now protects the city from tourist-based businesses and protects historic sites. The mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, said, “McDonald’s has the right to submit an application because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.” \nFlorence's deputy head of tourism and economic development, Giovanni Bettarini, said, “It’s a not a blanket rejection of McDonald’s. It’s just a rejection of that specific project.” \nMcDonald’s stated that it put forward a plan to “Operate respectfully towards the local policies, even accepting to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation.” \nMcDonald’s added: “We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected. But we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without helping anyone.” \nMcDonald’s is suing for $20 million because that’s the amount it estimates it will lose over the next 18 years after being discriminated against. It’s good to see that McDonald’s fights for what it wants, but there are cultural boundaries, and this is borderline disrespectful. You should never go where you’re not wanted. \nMCD has depreciated 0.10% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 3.35%.",

Right to say no \nIt argues it put forward a plan to \"operate respectfully towards the local policies, even accepting to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation\". \n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald's told the BBC in a statement. \nBut Florence's mayor Dario Nardella says they were not prejudiced in rejecting the bid to open a branch on the piazza, famous for its Gothic and Renaissance architecture. \nHe told the city council earlier this year: \"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.\" \nThis is the second high profile spat over an Italian location this year for McDonalds. Last month it was reported that cardinals at the Vatican had been angered by plans to open a branch in a piazza next to Saint Peter's Square.",

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from being able to regain full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain. \n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has to some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel... \nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel... \n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who tore his ACL this spring, too. \"That was a really good good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters.\nOn demands on his schedule \nThat is going to be a little bit difficult but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally \nYou're an idiot (laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series \nI said, 'I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.' That's all i could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammate during the rain delay after the Indians tied the game 6-6 \nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single \nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the 'Rocky' movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the 'Rocky' stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, 'I'm not going to get out,' you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously i faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before so I wanted to back off the plate.  ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup \nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away were we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title \nI was drained and hung over so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, 'Im done. I need to go to bed.'\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason: \nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber? \nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in 'Anchorman' (he asked the audience, trying to think of actor DavidKoechner). ... What aboutZachGalifianakis. There you go.\n  Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs Albert Almora Boston Red Sox Jason Heyward",

McDonald's new Grand Mac and Junior Mac sandwiches are being tested at Florida restaurants. (handout from McDonalds / Orlando Sentinel) Kyle Arnold is testing its next generation of Big Mac spin-off sandwiches in Florida before it rolls out to the rest of the country early in 2017.\nMcDonald's restaurants throughout the state began quietly taking orders for the new Junior Mac and Grand Mac burgers as part of a \"soft rollout,\" said New Smyrna Beach franchisee Sue Smith. \n\"You can order one now, but we won't put them on the menu for a few days until we get more comfortable,\" said Smith, who operates three restaurants in the Volusia County town. \nMcDonald's announced the new burgers last week. The Junior Mac is a smaller version of the classic Big Mac sandwich with one patty and two buns. \nThe Grand Mac keeps three buns and two burgers, but uses one-sixth of a pound patties instead of one-tenth, as well bigger buns. \nSmith, who is the president of the association of Central Florida McDonald's franchisees, said Florida restaurants got an early peak at the new burgers because many have been extensively remodeling. Caption Brownies, biscuits, tacos and more with Central Florida Food Minute \nOn this week's Central Florida Food Minute, we talk about Brownieria coming to Winter Park, Bartaco opening in Dr. Phillips, Lazy Moon opening in downtown Orlando, Dick's Last Resort closing, Holler & Dash opening in Celebration, and Whole Foods moving to a bigger spot in Winter Park. \nOn this week's Central Florida Food Minute, we talk about Brownieria coming to Winter Park, Bartaco opening in Dr. Phillips, Lazy Moon opening in downtown Orlando, Dick's Last Resort closing, Holler & Dash opening in Celebration, and Whole Foods moving to a bigger spot in Winter Park. Caption The Bear & Peacock, Domu host soft openings and more on Central Florida Food Minute \nThe Bear & Peacock in Winter Park and Domu in East End Market both held soft openings this week, while Create Your Nature officially opened. \nThe Bear & Peacock in Winter Park and Domu in East End Market both held soft openings this week, while Create Your Nature officially opened. \n\"We've been testing things like table service,\" Smith said. \"Some of the local McDonald's really are on the leading edge.\" \nThe burgers are also being tested in the Pittsburgh area. \nSmith expects the Grand Mac and Junior Mac to be a temporary offering that occasionally reappears on the menu, similar to the McRib. \n\"I think this will be the first time some people ever try a Big Mac,\" Smith said. \"Some have always thought it was too big and others say they wanted it to be bigger.\" \nor 407-420-5664; on Twitter @kylelarnold",

      "text": "  After a McDonald's employee stole money from the till, three of his co-workers were determined to get it back. Now one of them has been charged with first-degree robbery after the original thief was robbed at gunpoint, according to court charges. The trouble began when an employee at the McDonald's on East Lake Street in Minneapolis was caught on video stealing $783 in cash from the register on Oct. 22. A police investigator called the worker that day, but didn't reach him. Then, on Oct. 25, the worker called the investigator to say he didn't have the money any more. Because his fellow employees had taken it at gunpoint. According to the complaint, the store manager and two other employees, wearing their McDonald's uniforms, went to the thief's house. He told police that one of the employees pulled up his shirt to reveal a gun, then pulled the gun and held it by his side. He kept his hands up while one of his co-workers went through his pockets. An officer later interviewed the unnamed manager, who admitted that she and two employees went to their co-worker's home to retrieve the money, the complaint said. The manager said they were able to get $43 from the alleged victim, of which she kept $13 and her two employees split the rest. Perry Bernard Atkins, 28, has been charged with aggravated robbery. It is unclear if the other two have been charged at this point. BRANDON STAHL",

This time, it’s the company’s signature sandwich, the Big Mac, which is getting both smaller and bigger versions in 2017. McDonald’s tested the Mac Jr. and Grand Mac earlier this year at 125 restaurants in central Ohio and in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and now Thrillist reports that the Golden Arches will take both of them nationwide early next year. \n\nThe Grand Mac is composed of all the typical Big Mac ingredients, just on a super-sized scale with a third of a pound of beef. That’s compared to the traditional Big Mac, which comes with one fifth pound of beef. \nOn the other end of the spectrum, the smaller Mac Jr. is simply a Big Mac with just one layer. \nPreviously, a franchisee in Ohio said the different sized Big Macs came about based on customer feedback. \nIf the national, limited-time rollout of the new sandwiches goes well, they could become a permanent fixture on the chain’s menu.

      "text": "finally mcdonald's mobile ordering mobile payments fast food food restaurants \nWhile many fast food chains already offer mobile ways to order and/or pay for your food before you ever step foot in the restaurant, McDonald’s has yet to launch its own version of that kind of technology. But the company says it’s now finally getting ready to roll out a new mobile order-and-pay service, slated to arrive next year. \nMcDonald’s told Business Insider that the new technology will begin rolling out next year in the U.S. and international markets like Australia, Canada, France, and the UK. It’ll be available at 20,000 to 25,000 restaurants worldwide, by 2018, a spokeswoman said. \nThe appeal here is the same both for customers and the company: mobile ordering can cut wait times and ensure that customers’ orders are accurate. \nThough it’s getting into the game now, some experts say McDonald’s has missed out by taking so long to launch mobile order-and-pay. \n“This isn’t new technology, it’s something that should be fairly standard nowadays,” Neil Saunders, CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, told BI. \nWe first heard rumors that McDonald’s was testing an order/payment app back in 2014 , but it’s unclear if the tech the chain tested then will be similar to the final product.

Guy led the 'Hoos with 13 points in Virginia's Blue-White scrimmage last month. \nGuy is slim at 6'3'' 165 pounds but he has outstanding skills. \nUVa coach Tony Bennett says, \"We're excited about him because he's a wonderful young man. He brings a flair to the game. He can fly off screens, hit shots. He's got a real good pep to his step. I guess you'd say, and we're hopeful that in the right opportunities, he's going to thrive. Its not a matter of if. I believe its when, and its just when they're ready. Its a lot. I don't ever expect a whole lot. Hopefully, I'm pleasantly surprised by the freshman, but you don't know what you're going to get\". \nGuy could give the 'Hoos a boost Friday with Mamadi Diakite and Austin Nichols both out.

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\n Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs David Koechner Boston Red Sox Alex Rodriguez Albert Almora",

Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's.

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs Jason Heyward Alex Rodriguez Albert Almora Boston Red Sox",

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs David Koechner Albert Almora Jason Heyward Boston Red Sox",

Gottfried STAFF WRITER | The Record \nWé McDonald is in the Top 12. The 17-year-old “The Voice” competitor and Paterson resident easily clinched her spot on Monday night’s live playoff show. TYLER GOLDEN/NBC We McDonald on \"The Voice.\" \nMcDonald, who graduated last year from Passaic County Technical Institute in Wayne, performed “Home” by Stephanie Mills from “The Wiz.” Fans voted via Twitter and the show’s official app to save her spot on Team Alicia Keys. The live voting was a new feature for the playoff rounds, and the contestants were whittled down from 20 to 12. \nLast week, McDonald, who started college at William Paterson University in the fall, told The Record that she felt the show was “in the early stages” and that “there’s still a lot more to be done.” \n“The Voice” won’t air tonight due to election coverage, but will resume Nov. 14. The Top 12 will continue to battle it out for the top spot and the grand prize of a record contract.",

      "text": "Lauren-Paige Smith  By: Chan Yuan \n\nA teenager in the United Kingdom, received a fine after being caught feeding a bird a French fry.\n\n19-year-old Lauren-Paige Smith of Swansea, said that on Friday around 1:30 p.m., she bought a meal at McDonald's.\n\nAs she was eating, a bird came next to her. Smith decided to feed it a French fry. A government worker watched her, and decided to give her a ticket for littering.\n\nSmith became angry as the bird ate the entire fry and did not drop anything on the floor. The council worker, who was not identified, gave her a 25 pound ($31) fine.\n\nSmith refused to pay the fine and was dragged to court, where she is facing a fine of up to 100 pounds ($124). Smith expressed her anger on Facebook.\n\n“As if Swansea is trying to make me go to court over feeding a bird a f***ing McDonald’s chip. Hardly littering when there was nothing left on the floor, you wouldn’t fine people at Roath Park feeding birds so f**k off trying to make me pay fines then taking me to court, lividddd,” Smith wrote on Facebook.

      "title": "McDonald's Sues Historic Italian City Florence for $20 Million",
      "text": "McDonald’s is suing the Italian city of Florence for $20 million in damages after the fast-food giant was refused a licensing application in the shadow of the city’s famous cathedral, Il Duomo.\nFlorence’s center-left mayor initially turned down the application requesting approval for a new site in the historic Piazza Del Duomo in June, reports The Guardian, following changes to the city’s licensing laws earlier in 2016. A month later, a technical panel tasked with protecting the city’s historic heart doubled down on the decision.\n“McDonald’s has the right to submit an application because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no,” Mayor Dario Nardella said, speaking to Florence’s City Council, adding that the move was part of a bid to support “traditional business.”\nFlorence is one of Europe’s most popular tourism destinations, and the Piazza Del Duomo, where McDonald’s mcd was hoping to set up its golden arches, is its most visited tourist site. Meaning “Cathedral Square,” the Piazza contains several ancient buildings whose provenance dates back a millennium.\nIn January, Florentine city fathers introduced new licensing designed to protect historic sites, as well as keep authentic Tuscan goods and businesses at the heart of the historic square, fighting a recent reported proliferation of backpacker-focused businesses.\nWhen news broke that McDonald’s was planning on opening its tenth restaurant in the city, citizens sprung into action, with 24,000 Florentines signing a petition protesting the fast-food chain’s plans.\nFor more on McDonald’s, watch Fortune’s video:\n“We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected,” said a statement released by the fast-food chain. “But we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without helping anyone.”\nSpeaking in the Wall Street Journal, Florence’s deputy head of tourism and economic development Giovanni Bettarini said, “It’s a not a blanket rejection of McDonald’s. It’s just a rejection of that specific project.”",

      "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — First came McDonald’s. Now comes the gym.\nAnytime Fitness is the latest tenant to sign on to McMahon Marketplace, the growing development at the southeast corner of McMahon and Unser. The gym — planned for a lot just south of the McDonald’s — should open early next year.\nIt may not be the only activity seen at the site next year.\nAlbuquerque real estate firm Peterson Properties in August acquired another seven acres at the intersection to go with the four it already had. It now owns everything within McMahon Marketplace except the CVS and land at the property’s southern edge expected to bring a Taco Bell, according to Doug Peterson, a principal with the family-owned firm. The idea is to add approximately 45,000 square feet of new buildings, some of which could start going up late next year.\nThe mix will likely include more restaurants and retailers but the company may also recruit medical and child care providers. Negotiations have begun with some potential tenants, though Peterson said nothing is firm yet.\nPeterson Properties has been involved at McMahon Marketplace since 2005 and already spent an estimated $7 million on land acquisitions and construction. It built the shops structure housing ChocGlitz & Cream, Crackin’ Crab and others in 2013. It added the McDonald’s in 2015.\nPeterson said tenant interest in the area and Presbyterian’s development of Rust Medical Center prompted the company to expand its holdings at the corner. The hospital, which opened in 2011, has helped spur activity, though Peterson said his family originally staked a claim there because of the residential growth.\n“We maintain good relations with those neighborhoods there and they want to see a quality development and new types of businesses out there,” he said.\nAnytime Fitness will make McMahon Marketplace its sixth metro location. Franchisees Doug Wood — the Sandoval County sheriff — and partner Lucy Romero are behind the new 6,300-square-foot location, which AIC General Contractor has already begun building. Wood said he expects the 24-hour gym to open in January.",

Its buildings include the domed Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Giotto bell tower, the Opera del Duomo Museum, and the St. John Baptistery.’",

      "text": "McDonald's sues Florence for €18m for blocking restaurant on historic plaza  07   McDonald's is suing Florence for €18m after it was blocked from opening a restaurant on one of the Italian city's most historic plazas, BBC News reports. \nThe fast-food giant had its plans for an outlet on the Piazza del Duomo rejected by Florence's mayor in June. \nThe decision was upheld in July by a technical panel in charge of preserving the city's ancient heart. \nBut McDonald's, which modified its proposals to fit with city guidelines, has now launched a bid for damages. \nThe chain is claiming it has been discriminated against, and wants to recoup the €17.8m (£15.9m; $19.7m) it estimates it will lose over the next 18 years, according to Italian newspaper Firenze Today. \nRight to say no \nIt argues it put forward a plan to \"operate respectfully towards the local policies, even accepting to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation\". \n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald's told the BBC in a statement. \nBut Florence's mayor Dario Nardella says they were not prejudiced in rejecting the bid to open a branch on the piazza, famous for its Gothic and Renaissance architecture. \nHe told the city council earlier this year: \"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.\" \nThis is the second high profile spat over an Italian location this year for McDonalds. Last month it was reported that cardinals at the Vatican had been angered by plans to open a branch in a piazza next to Saint Peter's Square. Related links:",

      "text": "McDonald’s to Debut New Big Mac Sizes Next Year New Big Mac sizes are made for customers who might want less or more 0 Nov 8, 2016 | 4:23 pm By \nMcDonald’s \nMcDonald’s has been serving the Big Mac since 1967. \nBig Macs just got a little better with the debut of two new Big Mac sizes to be released early next year. The menu extension of the 50-year-old McDonald’s classic will be offered nationwide for only a limited time. More on McDonald’s 11 Things You Didn't Know About McDonald's \nThe fast-food chain will offer a Mac Jr. and a Grand Mac: the Mac Jr. will be a single-layer Big Mac made to be easier to eat on the go, and the Grand Mac will have two all-beef patties and weigh a third of a pound, National Restaurant News reported. \nAlthough the national debut is set for 2017, the new Big Macs will be available later this month at select locations in Florida and Pittsburgh. \n“We listened to our customers, who told us they wanted different ways to enjoy the one-of-a-kind Big Mac taste,” McDonald’s chef Mike Haracz said in a statement. \nThe new Big Mac sizes are only a few of the latest efforts of the McDonald’s Corporation to keep its momentum in the competitive fast-food industry. More than a year ago, the company introduced the successful all-day breakfast menu and it also plans to relocate its headquarters to Chicago from Oak Brook, Illinois. Rate this Story",

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs Jason Heyward Alex Rodriguez David Koechner Boston Red Sox",

      "title": "McDonald’s Sues City of Florence for $20 Million After Plans for a Restaurant Are Blocked",
      "text": "American food giant McDonald’s is suing the city of Florence for turning down the company’s application for a new restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo at the city’s center for €18 million ($19.7 million).\nThe US company had applied to open a new restaurant in the cities most famous square and one of the most visited tourist sites in Europe. After Florence’s rejection of the application in order to preserve the cities rich cultural atmosphere, McDonald’s announced legal action seeking compensation for loss of future earnings after having altered their proposal in an attempt to fit in with the city’s guidelines. The restaurant chain are claiming discrimination.\nRelated: Gaetano Pesce’s Exhibition in Florence Takes a Bizarre Twist With False Claims of Artist Death \nThe fast-food chain told the BBC: “We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone.”\nRelated: Uffizi Gallery Director Denies Hosting Wild Bachelor Party at Historic Palazzo Pitti \nHome to the famous Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence’s 800-year-old cathedral, and widely recognized as the birthplace of the Renaissance period, the city was named in 1982 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural and historic significance. Prestige brought by this status raises awareness among citizens and governing bodies to preserve the heritage of the city, and conserve cultural richness.\nThe city mayor, Dario Nardello, said in a statement: “McDonald’s has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.” Mr Nardello added, “we don’t have any prejudice” against McDonald’s, noting that the company already has restaurants opened elsewhere within the city.\nRelated: Botticelli Masterpieces at Florence’s Uffizi Gallery Bask in New Light \nThe decision to prevent the restaurant from opening so close to this historic location is significant in a climate of tourist-friendly venues and restaurants compromising what some see as the aesthetic value of other poignant locations around the world. For example, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt can be photographed from a branch of American restaurant chain, Pizza Hut.\nThe post McDonald’s Sues City of Florence for $20 Million After Plans for a Restaurant Are Blocked appeared first on artnet News .",

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\n Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs Jason Heyward Albert Almora David Koechner Alex Rodriguez",

      "text": "Fast-food titans such as McDonald's ( MCD ) and full-service restaurants like Buffalo Wild Wings ( BWLD ) should be quaking in their boots after Election Day. Arizona and Colorado voted Tuesday to incrementally increase their state minimum wage to $12 an hour from about $8 an hour by 2020. Maine also approved a hike to $12 an hour from $7.50 by 2020. Washington's minimum wage will rise to $13.50 an hour by 2020, from $9.47 presently. These states aren't alone in their tougher stance on the minimum wage. Earlier this year, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law raising the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. The statewide minimum wage will increase to $10.50 an hour from $10 on Jan. 1, 2017, then up to $11 an hour on Jan. 1, 2018. From there it will increase by $1 annually until reaching $15 an hour on Jan. 1, 2022. Last September, New York state approved a measure to increase the minimum wage for employees of fast-food restaurants to $15 an hour over the next few years. The law gradually raises the minimum wage to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018. On Long Island and in Westchester County, the wage would rise to $15 by the end of 2021. The minimum wage only would rise to $12.50 in the rest of the state by 2020, with further increases tied to inflation and other economic indicators. Higher minimum wages likely will trickle back down to diners in the form of higher prices for hamburgers to steak dinners, possibly with detrimental effects to restaurant companies. \"If a worker is now paid $8 an hour and the new minimum wage goes to $12 an hour, the increase in wage would mean the cost per full-time employee would increase about $9,000 per year. If the restaurant had 10 employees in this situation, the cost would increase by $90,000 per year,\" explained Stockton University professor of finance Michael Busler, who added that the higher costs may cause some operators to close their doors. After all, why run a chaotic business like a restaurant if the profit potential is virtually nonexistent? The natural response to higher costs -- raise menu prices to compensate -- could be no magic elixir as it would likely cause consumers to pull back on their visits. Pointed out Busler, \"Many fast food restaurants currently have a $1 menu, making it affordable for many lower-income earners to eat at these restaurants. The $1 menu would increase to the $1.39 menu, putting pressure on consumers. Many lower-income earners would not be able to afford to eat there.\" A McDonald's franchisee TheStreet talked with flat out admitted that a minimum wage of $15 an hour would be \"catastrophic,\" as he would be unable to raises prices enough to offset the higher expenditure. According to a study by Purdue University's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 1.54 million people working in food preparation and serving related occupations make at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Raising their hourly wages to $15 -- a 107% increase -- would cause prices to rise an estimated 4.3%. That means a $3.99 Big Mac would cost around $4.16, and an average fast food meal costing $7 would go up to $7.31. Darden's ( DRI ) popular never-ending pasta bowl promotion, which is currently priced at $9.99, would break through the important $10 mark. If fast food workers received $22 an hour (an epic 203% pay raise) -- which is the average wage for Americans in the private industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- restaurant prices would rise 25%.",

      "text": "McDonald's ( MCD ) is showing encouraging signs that a bottom has been reached. The stock has recovered nicely from Friday's selloff and now appears headed for a healthy rebound. If the stock is able to build on yesterday's trendline break investors should be very encouraged.\nA day after MCD's powerful post-Brexit rally peaked near $129 the stock took a devastating hit. On July 26 the stock fell nearly 4.5% on extremely heavy trade. This earnings -inspired breakdown, MCD's biggest single day loss of the year, sparked a brutal downtrend.\nThe stock took out the Brexit low four weeks later and, after a month and a half of sideways action, fell to fresh 2016 lows in mid-October. Once below major support near the $112.85 area further downside was limited. With a divergent MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) developing and selling pressure beginning to ease, this was a very positive development.\nThis week MCD has retaken the $113 area. This area, which marked the early 2016 lows, could have provided very heavy resistance in the near term. With the stock now above this level, multiple support layers are in place.\nPatient MCD investors should take a more positive view of the action as a result. The stock should be considered a buy on weakness. Initial support runs from the $113.30 to $112 area. On the upside, MCD has struggled with its declining 50-day moving average since early September. Moving past the 50-day will be an important hurdle.",

      "text": "Rome (AFP) - Hard on the heels of stoking anger over plans to open a restaurant in the Vatican, McDonald's has filed a $20-million lawsuit against Florence for blocking a proposed outlet in the city's most revered square. The US fast-food chain told AFP Monday it was claiming 17.8 million euros ($19.65 million) in damages after the city rejected an application to open an outlet in the historic Piazza del Duomo, one of the most visited places in Europe.\nMcDonald's said the suit was being filed with the administrative court, which arbitrates in governance disputes in Italy. The firm gave no other details.\nFlorence's centre-left mayor, Dario Nardella, turned down McDonald's application in June, in a decision that was confirmed the following month by a technical panel in charge of preserving the city's ancient heart.\n\"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no,\" Nardella told the city council, saying he wanted to support \"traditional business\" in the area.\n\"We don't have any prejudice\" against McDonald's, Nardella said, noting that the company had opened restaurants \"in other parts of town.\"\nAccording to several reports in the Italian media, McDonald's is particularly aggrieved in the case of Florence as it had promised to make major changes to its business model to fit in with local regulations.\n- Cardinals in a tizz -\nWorried about the proliferation of fast-food outlets catering to backpackers in the city of Michelangelo, Florence introduced new licensing regulations in January requiring restaurants in the historic heart to use \"typical products\" either of the city or from the Tuscany region.\nThe Piazza del Duomo -- \"Cathedral Square\" -- is a treasure of Gothic and Renaissance architecture. Its buildings include the domed Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral, the Giotto bell tower and the St. John Baptistery.\nLast month, the daily La Republicca reported that plans to open a McDonald's in a piazza next to Saint Peter's Square in Rome had angered cardinals who live above the proposed site.\nThe scheme is \"by no means respectful of the architectural traditions of one of the most characteristic squares which look onto the colonnade of Saint Peter's,\" it quoted Cardinal Elio Sgreccia as saying.\nIn their expansion into historic locations in Europe, McDonald's and other fast-food chains often encounter opposition on cultural or architectural grounds.\nMany disputes, though, end in a compromise, in such areas as menu choice, litter control and the design of the business facade.",

      "text": "Dunkin’ Donuts, Honda, and McDonald’s are all gigantic brands with huge reputations. However, each of them has something else in common. They have each partnered with a sports franchise in a brilliant play to boost the emotional engagement with the team’s fans.\nEach program targets specific team fans and celebrates that connection with a reward. Dunkin’ Donuts gives DD Perks® rewards program members coffee for $.87 after every win during the season in honor of Tight End, Rob Gronkowski (#87) as part of their relationship with the New England Patriots. Honda paid for parking for all the fans that drove Hondas to a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim game. McDonald’s and the Philadelphia Eagles have several programs in play, starting by giving away $5,000 in tokens to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), for fans to use to see the last exhibition game. McDonald’s also has text-to-win sweepstakes to win tickets and sidelines passes, lunch with one of the Eagles team players, dinner with coaches, and more, all season long.\nMcDonald’s has also taken their relationship with the Philadelphia community a step further. Philadelphia area McDonald’s donate 100% of the income generated from coffee sales to a local youth homeless shelters. McDonald’s also has an Archways to Opportunity program that helps their employees continue their education, whether that means learning English, finishing secondary school or earning their college degree. In nearby Delaware, McDonald’s owners across the state have a Coffee with a Cause program that uses 50% of the net coffee sales to support a charitable organization chosen in the area by owner/operators.\nThese specific efforts to connect with local communities achieve three brilliant goals:\nEmotional Engagement with Customers: Associating your brand with a sports team that has devoted fans or a program that “gives back” to the community creates a positive association with your brand in these customers’ subconscious that they remember later when making buying decisions. Employee Engagement: Your employees are people, and likely support the same team or local causes. It’s fun for employees to have a promotion that makes Customers happy. It also feels good to have a higher purpose and do good for others. These positive feelings tend to spread. I always say, “happy employees make happy customers.” Promoting an Image of Corporate Responsibility: More customers are concerned about how their brands fit into the overall picture of social responsibility; having a campaign that connects to one of these important principles further solidifies your brand’s emotional bond with the individual. Best of all, it works. When the “Helpful Honda Employee” told one of our team members that Honda drivers parked free, she was surprised and delighted. It created a positive memory for her. She doesn’t remember who the Angels played or who won the game, but she remembers that Honda picked up the parking.\nHappy memories are essential to your Customer Experience. In my latest book, The Intuitive Customer: 7 imperatives for moving your Customer Experience to the next level, co-author Professor Ryan Hamilton of Emory University and I talk about the importance of memories for your Customer Experience. Our 7th Imperative is:\nRealize that the only way to build customer loyalty is through customers’ memories. \nIn other words, when a customer chooses to come back to you, it’s not because of the experience they had with you. It’s because of the experience they remember they had with you.\nWhat you remember about an experience depends on how intense the stimulation is. Happy surprise is a keen emotion, so it creates a lasting impression. However, emotions work the other way, too. Negative emotions can also create glaring memories. No one wants negative feelings creating the memories about your Customer Experience.\nCustomers today are bombarded with brand images and messages nearly everywhere they turn, which can lead to them giving yours the Heisman. Fans have intense feelings that create memories about their favorite teams. Associating your brand with these powerful feelings creates emotional engagement with your brand, too. These positive emotions can create positive memories about your brand that score big with customer loyalty.\nTo learn more about these fascinating and compelling concepts for yourself and business, please register for our 3 part Training Course based on our latest book: The Intuitive Customer: 7 Imperatives for moving your Customer Experience to the next level (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016) for only $59! \n",

      "text": "McDonald’s gets the boot from famous Florence tourist location By Kevin Allen   The city of Florence, Italy, denied McDonald’s from opening one of its fast food restaurants at its famous Piazza del Duomo. Now, the company is firing back. \nMcDonald’s filed an €18 million lawsuit in an Italian court, which claims discrimination. \nIn the lawsuit, McDonald’s says it planned to \"operate respectfully towards the local policies, even accepting to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation.\" \nFlorence mayor Dario Nardella was the key decider in denying McDonald’s licensing application. RELATED: The 2017 Social Media Conference for PR, Marketing and Corporate Communicators at Disney World. \nFrom Nardella: McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no. \nFast-food chain reps issued a response to BBC : We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone.",

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs David Koechner Alex Rodriguez Boston Red Sox Albert Almora",

(Photo courtesy Flickr/ Tammy Lo ) YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Tammy Levent \nMcDonald’s, purveyors of inexpensive hamburgers with catchy names, is suing Florence, Italy. \nBBC.com reports McDonald’s feels pretty raw by how it has been treated by the same city in which it has recently attempted to build a restaurant. According to the report, city officials have thought better about including a fast-food joint in its historic Piazza del Duomo, a decision that has led to an International legal kerfuffle. \nMcDonald’s standpoint is that it’s tried its best to tailor a location that would fit into the scope and sensibility of the famous area. And now it’s out for money, €17.8 million (or $19.7 million), according to BBC.com. \nREAD MORE: ‘Snakes on a Plane’ Just Got Too Real \nThe website quotes a McDonald’s statement that cites discriminatory action by city officials for its legal suit that reaches nearly $20 million in damages: “We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone.” \nWe know what you are thinking. The post quotes an earlier statement from mayor Dario Nardella that may echo your own current thoughts on the matter: “McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no.” \nAn earlier issue between Vatican cardinals taking umbrage with a planned McDonald’s at that iconic setting is also noted. McDonald’s, like other ubiquitous brands around the world, doesn’t seem all that content to merely be on most street corners, because it looks as though some want to be on all of them. \nWe certainly understand and encourage you to eat what makes you happy, even while traveling. However, and perhaps, some places should be devoid of modern signs of commerce if only to maintain the majestic effect of classic architecture. \nApologies to anyone who is prone to sudden and uncontrollable Big Mac attacks while traveling.",

      "text": "McDonald's has scrapped its \"Create Your Taste\" customized burger program and will instead test a mix-and-match meat and toppings plan that's easier to manage. McDonald's calls the new program, which will be tested nationwide in select markets including Chicago, \"Signature Crafted Recipes.\"\nCreate Your Taste was a two-year-long test that brought make-your-own burger kiosks to select McDonald's locations around the country. It was the first time McDonald's experimented with a custom sandwich in an effort to compete with so-called \"better burger\" chains like Five Guys that have grown in popularity. It was also an experiment in new ordering technology for the world's largest burger chain.\nThe make-your-own-sandwich ordering kiosks generally received positive customer reviews online. Some customers even tested outlandish combinations and posted videos of their experiences on YouTube.\nBut the custom burgers tended to be more expensive, when a number of toppings were added, compared with other items on the menu. And it was also time-consuming: While the average McDonald's meal is delivered in about 90 seconds, Create Your Taste orders could take five to eight minutes.\nIt was also costly to the restaurant operators. The kiosks cost about $125,000 per restaurant, according to McDonald's spokeswoman Becca Hary. The kiosks will remain and be available for customers ordering the new Signature Crafted options.\nSignature Crafted, available in the Chicago area at 10 E. State St. and at a restaurant in Downers Grove, is a customized burger plan with fewer, and more focused, options. Instead of being able to choose any bun, meat or topping, the Signature Crafted plan offers a choice of topping \"bundles\" on crispy or grilled chicken or a burger patty, with three choices for a bun.\nThe topping bundle choices include maple bacon dijon (maple-flavored bacon, Dijon mustard and caramelized onions), pico guacamole (guacamole and buttermilk ranch dressing) and sweet BBQ bacon (bacon, caramelized and crispy onions). All options come with white cheddar cheese.\nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @SamWillTravel \nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune",

Ellen Schrantz of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents premium food delivery services like Yelp, TripAdvisor and Amazon, says it's not possible to know how many individuals have been penalized by companies for unfavorable reviews after unknowingly signing contracts that banned them. Yelp generates revenue by selling advertising on its sites, where it has greater than 25 million critiques of a range of native companies and providers - from plumbers and shoe-repair retailers to eating places and nightlife choices. Many European nations - including Britain, France and Germany - forbid smoking in all public locations. I assume it is funny that in Germany they're referred to as Wiener (after Vienna) and in Austria they're known as Frankfurter, although each call the brief ones Würstchen as properly. I loved dwelling in Germany and I am so lucky to have experienced places like Berchtesgaden and others in Germany and all over Europe. Walking through Mooloolaba one can hear a various spectrum of fascinating languages pouring from the cafes, eating places and at the seaside. In the brief term costs are more likely to rise and will even disappear off the menu altogether until London's high restaurants can source an alternate supply. The facilities on these giant cruise ships will differ but most of them these days can have a gym, plenty of swimming pools, a spa, buying, a on line casino for those wishing to gamble, a number of theaters, quite a few bars, and plenty of food courts, eating places and other locations for one to indulge in what appears to be the primary activity on a cruise, eating. The actual sequence of gun and bomb assaults on the live performance corridor, a sports activities stadium and restaurants in the French capital that left no less than one hundred twenty useless is still http:// pixelsand.motleycoder.com/f orum/discussion/689279/%EF%BB%BFback-after-50-years-to-garmisch-germany … . You can shop till you drop in ultra-luxury stores, take a excessive-speed bullet train, or eat and drink all night at one of many many restaurants and clubs. They have at all times been often called quality provider (Made in Germany) for kitchen hardware and that is why I determined to buy my first stress cooker from WMF. I actually loved visiting this space of Germany during my journey to Europe several years ago. This is one other area that provides stunning surroundings and there are plenty of eating places the place you can have a nice meal when you are sampling your wine. Four new eating places made their one-star debut in the guide: Band of Bohemia, GreenRiver, Roister and Smyth. Revenues at eating places in Japan fell 0.9 percent in October, the primary drop in eight months on a same-store basis, in keeping with the Japan Foodservice Association. It turns into a feast on tables all all through Germany once grown and harvested every Spring. Since it was asparagus season, and asparagus is a bit of a national religion in Germany when it is in season, I after all advisable that we have asparagus.

Sysco has performed evaluations of thousands of its food distribution contracts to search out methods to extend gross sales. Both bills would ban enterprise contracts for goods or providers that don't enable adverse or truthful critiques and provides the Federal Trade Commission enforcement over the issue.

The remaining 1,500 eating places in its network are located within the UK, Germany, Japan and few other international locations. This includes invites and opinions of restaurants, cafes, bars, launches, occasions and merchandise. During the Middle Ages, the nation was divided into many small, aggressive feudal states and principalities; these unstable occasions inspired the development of safe and fortified castles in Germany. I returned to Germany the summer time of my Senior yr with a variety of faith and some hundred dollars (not enough for a return trip). Germany has many great issues to supply and is a really engaging location for foreigners, especially in view of the world crisis. German language searches in Germany have been solely a complete of seventy five thousand for a total of 40 terms. Stephan Martinez of neighborhood bistrot Le Petit Choiseuil, who took the initiative for the project, stated the gathering anticipates the regulation however that participating restaurants are happy that somebody collects their waste and places it to good use. A 2005 legislation that forbids smoking in public places ( however specifically excludes cafes and restaurants) would be reinforced from January 1, 2008 to require larger restaurants to separate their dining areas 50-50 between smoking and non-smoking sections.

      "text": "McDonald’s is filing a lawsuit against the city of Florence after the historic Italian city rejected an application for a restaurant in its historic Piazza del Duomo, home to Brunelleschi's Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral and one of the most visited destinations in Italy.\nClaiming discrimination, the fast food mega-chain is suing the city for 18 million euros (about $10 million) – the revenue the company estimates will be lost over the next 18 years. Meanwhile, the mayor of Florence, the center-left Dario Nardella, is maintaining his position that the city was within its rights to reject the proposal in the name of historic preservation.\n\"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no,\" Mayor Nardella told the city council . Another council in charge of maintaining the city’s ancient center also rejected the proposal a month later.\nRecommended: 10 weirdest global fast foods\nItaly’s first McDonald’s opened near Rome’s famous Spanish Steps in 1986 and since then dozens have sprung up along the peninsula.\nBut recently, the American restaurant chain has experienced more pushback from the Mediterranean nation. Earlier this year, cardinals fought efforts to open a restaurant in Rome near the Vatican’s Saint Peter’s Square. A McDonald’s in the area would be \"by no means respectful of the architectural tradition of one of the most characteristic squares which look onto the colonnade of Saint Peter’s,\" said Cardinal Elio Sgreccia in a statement .\nThe fast food chain has faced many challenges integrating its brand into historic and sacred corners of the world. In China, there was outrage when the chain opened outside a historic villa in the city of Hangzhou that once housed prominent leaders. Similarly, Paris pushed back when a trade deal threatened to bring McDonald's to the Rue Montorgueil , which for more than 800 years was a covered food market that carries a significant culinary legacy.\nHowever, the disputes often do not end in a hard \"No,\" but with a compromise worked out between the company and city regarding menu items, cleanliness, litter control, and architectural continuity.\nAfraid of an onslaught of fast food chains catering to the city’s increasing number of backpacking travelers, Florence introduce a rule that restaurants along the historic Piazza del Duomo must use “typical products” – traditional Tuscan ingredients – in order to keep a certain level of authenticity in the city’s central square.\nIn the lawsuit, McDonald’s argues that it fit its business model to these requirements, including plans \"to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation.\"\nWhen its application was still rejected, the company sued in Italy's administrative court, which moderates government disputes.\n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald's told the BBC .\nMeanwhile, Florence has held its stance that it has the right to decline such applications and that doing so was not done as an act of discrimination.\n\"We don't have any prejudice\" against McDonald's, Nardella told the city council .\nThe mayor added that the chain has other locations elsewhere in the city, including locations near the Santa Maria Novella transportation hub and another near the Galleria dell' Accademia, where tourists flock to see Michelangelo’s famous David statue.\nRelated stories\n10 weirdest global fast foods Millennials shun Big Macs: Will their tastes change McDonald's menu?

      "text": "ELECTION 2016: McDonald runs up 13 point re-election victory   8:00 PM Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the county’s only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPLYMOUTH – Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the county’s only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \n“At the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers,” said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonald’s campaign. “Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive.” \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriff’s office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesday’s election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \n“I wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change,” said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. “Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes – maybe some of those will be adopted.” \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the county’s correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \n“I certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what we’re up to,” he said. “It certainly doesn’t mean it’s perfect – nothing ever is – and we’re going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12.”",

Size of straw doesnt make a difference BTW..Also, The Mountain Dew's at Taco Bell seems to be the best.No one else outside of other YUM! brands carries Dew, so kinda hard to not win that one. But at least some of the Freestyles up here carry Mello Yello, so I have something.\\still sad that Sun Drop apparently has left the New England marketNot entirely true. Arby's is not a YUM! Brand, but still carries Pepsi/Dew. Besides, the reason for Taco Bell's superior Dew can easily be attributed to two words: Baja Blast. Arby's, unfortunately, is a destination restaurant in New England. There's only like a dozen of them, and most are in malls. As for BB...not a fan.",

      "text": "McDonald's puts 'Signature Crafted Recipes' on deck By Chicago Tribune  18   8 minutes ago CHICAGO — McDonald's has scrapped its “Create Your Taste” customized burger program and will instead test a mix-and-match meat and toppings plan that's easier to manage. McDonald's calls the new program, which will be tested nationwide in select markets including its hometown of Chicago, “Signature Crafted Recipes.” Create Your Taste was a two-year-long test that brought make-your-own burger kiosks to select McDonald's locations around the country. It was the first time McDonald's experimented with a custom sandwich in an effort to compete with so-called “better burger” chains like Five Guys that have grown in popularity. It was also an experiment in new ordering technology for the world's largest burger chain. The make-your-own-sandwich ordering kiosks generally received positive customer reviews online. Some customers even tested outlandish combinations and posted videos of their experiences on YouTube. But the custom burgers tended to be more expensive, when a number of toppings were added, compared with other items on the menu. And it was also time-consuming: While the average McDonald's meal is delivered in about 90 seconds, Create Your Taste orders could take five to eight minutes. It was also costly to the restaurant operators. The kiosks cost about $125,000 per restaurant, according to McDonald's spokeswoman Becca Hary. The kiosks will remain and be available for customers ordering the new Signature Crafted options. Signature Crafted is a customized burger plan with fewer, and more focused, options. Instead of being able to choose any bun, meat or topping, the Signature Crafted plan offers a choice of topping “bundles” on crispy or grilled chicken or a burger patty, with three choices for a bun. The topping bundle choices include maple bacon dijon (maple-flavored bacon, Dijon mustard and caramelized onions), pico guacamole (guacamole and buttermilk ranch dressing) and sweet BBQ bacon (bacon, caramelized and crispy onions). All options come with white cheddar cheese. More Business",

McDonald's Customer Sings Order to Drive-Through Staff UP NEXT VIDEO McDonald's Customer Sings Order to Drive-Through Staff. Source: Storyful McDonald's Customer Sings Order to Drive-Through Staff \nAnd while some might argue all coke tastes the same, others would say that McDonald’s have perfected their mixture for the soft drink. \nFor those who have ever wondered exactly what goes into making it so damn good, the Gods at McDonald’s explained just how complex the process is in achieving the perfect taste. Turns out the formula for getting the McDonald's coke right is quite complicated... Source: iStock. \nAccording to its website, McDonald’s follows the steps set out by Coca-Cola to ensure its flavor tastes the same as the contents within a bottle. \nWhile other fast food chains might deliver the coke in plastic bags, McDonald’s opts for stainless steel tanks to lock in the freshness. \nIn addition, the liquid is circulated through a chilled tubing system to prevent the drink from every going stale. \n“The water and Coca-Cola syrup are pre-chilled before entering our fountain dispensers with the ratio of syrup set up to allow for ice to melt,” the fastfood giant wrote on their site.“We also keep our fountain beverage system cold so your drink can always be at the peak of refreshing.” Mmm refreshing.

      "text": "McDonald’s is filing a lawsuit against the city of Florence after the historic Italian city rejected an application for a restaurant in its historic Piazza del Duomo, home to Brunelleschi's Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral and one of the most visited destinations in Italy.\nClaiming discrimination, the fast food mega-chain is suing the city for 18 million euros (about $10 million) – the revenue the company estimates will be lost over the next 18 years. Meanwhile, the mayor of Florence, the center-left Dario Nardella, is maintaining his position that the city was within its rights to reject the proposal in the name of historic preservation.\n\"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no,\" Mayor Nardella told the city council . Another council in charge of maintaining the city’s ancient center also rejected the proposal a month later.\nRecommended: 10 weirdest global fast foods Italy’s first McDonald’s opened near Rome’s famous Spanish Steps in 1986 and since then dozens have sprung up along the peninsula.\n10 weirdest global fast foods But recently, the American restaurant chain has experienced more pushback from the Mediterranean nation. Earlier this year, cardinals fought efforts to open a restaurant in Rome near the Vatican’s Saint Peter’s Square. A McDonald’s in the area would be \"by no means respectful of the architectural tradition of one of the most characteristic squares which look onto the colonnade of Saint Peter’s,\" said Cardinal Elio Sgreccia in a statement .\nThe fast food chain has faced many challenges integrating its brand into historic and sacred corners of the world. In China, there was outrage when the chain opened outside a historic villa in the city of Hangzhou that once housed prominent leaders. Similarly, Paris pushed back when a trade deal threatened to bring McDonald's to the Rue Montorgueil , which for more than 800 years was a covered food market that carries a significant culinary legacy.\nHowever, the disputes often do not end in a hard \"No,\" but with a compromise worked out between the company and city regarding menu items, cleanliness, litter control, and architectural continuity.\nAfraid of an onslaught of fast food chains catering to the city’s increasing number of backpacking travelers, Florence introduce a rule that restaurants along the historic Piazza del Duomo must use “typical products” – traditional Tuscan ingredients – in order to keep a certain level of authenticity in the city’s central square.\nIn the lawsuit, McDonald’s argues that it fit its business model to these requirements, including plans \"to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation.\"\nWhen its application was still rejected, the company sued in Italy's administrative court, which moderates government disputes.\n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald's told the BBC .\nMeanwhile, Florence has held its stance that it has the right to decline such applications and that doing so was not done as an act of discrimination.\n\"We don't have any prejudice\" against McDonald's, Nardella told the city council .\nThe mayor added that the chain has other locations elsewhere in the city, including locations near the Santa Maria Novella transportation hub and another near the Galleria dell' Accademia, where tourists flock to see Michelangelo’s famous David statue.",

Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPLYMOUTH – Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the county’s only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \n“At the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers,” said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonald’s campaign. “Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive.” \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriff’s office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesday’s election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \n“I wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change,” said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. “Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes – maybe some of those will be adopted.” \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the county’s correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \n“I certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what we’re up to,” he said. “It certainly doesn’t mean it’s perfect – nothing ever is – and we’re going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12.”",

      "text": "ELECTION 2016: McDonald runs up 13 point re-election victory Wednesday Nov 9, 2016 at 8:00 PM Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the county’s only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPLYMOUTH – Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the county’s only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \n“At the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers,” said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonald’s campaign. “Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive.” \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriff’s office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesday’s election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \n“I wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change,” said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. “Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes – maybe some of those will be adopted.” \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the county’s correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \n“I certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what we’re up to,” he said. “It certainly doesn’t mean it’s perfect – nothing ever is – and we’re going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12.”",

      "text": "McDonald's is Bring Back the Cult Favorite Mcrib Sandwich By: Katherine Pendrill   mcdonalds & chewboom After disappearing from the McDonald's menu several times, the McRib Sandwich has made a return at select locations this fall. Despite originally being introduced nearly 30 years ago, the specialty sandwich has become a lasting fan favorite among McDonald's customers. Now a select few will have a chance to sink their teeth into the meaty sandwich for another season. The McRib Sandwich is a messy concoction made from a boneless pork shoulder patty that has been slathered in tangy BBQ sauce and served on a hoagie-style bun. The meat is also topped with tart pickles and slivered onions for a satisfying crunch. While the cult favorite sandwich will not be available nation-wide, fans can use the online McRib Locator to find out where to get their hands on the elusive dish.",

( Bayou Billionaires/Facebook ) Valerie Dowden Wells, right, and her three children. ( Bayou Billionaires/Facebook ) (Newser) – A star of CMT's short-lived reality TV show Bayou Billionaires has died in an apparent murder-suicide. Police say Valerie Dowden Wells, 47, was attempting to exit a McDonald's parking lot in Shreveport, La., when she was shot multiple times in her car around 4pm Monday. Her car then \"rolled out of the parking lot,\" police tell the Shreveport Times . Authorities identified the shooter as Robert Gaddy, 46, who was found suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a nearby parking lot, reports the Washington Post . Both Wells and Gaddy were pronounced dead at a hospital. Police, who haven't yet nailed down a motive, say the pair knew each other since childhood and may have been \"formerly intimate.\" However, Wells' 15-year-old daughter, Nikki, tells People that her mother had recently started dating Gaddy, who was jealous that Wells continued a cordial relationship with Nikki's father. \"This is really hard on us and her children … No parents should have to go through this,\" say Wells' parents, Kitten and Gerald Dowden, who secured a reality TV deal after they discovered their home sat on a lucrative natural gas deposit, the fourth largest in the country, per the New York Daily News ; Bayou Billionaires last aired in 2012. Wells, a single mother of three with multiple sclerosis, \"was the strongest person I knew,\" says her daughter. \"She was my beautiful mother and I was her sparkle child … We knew we loved each other very much.\" My Take on This Story Show results without voting |",

      "text": "Why McDonald’s Is Suing This Italian City for 18 Million Euros By Follow @munchies \nThe city of Florence is known for many things. Terracotta-tiled cathedrals, Botticelli paintings, wine, awe-inspiring Renaissance architecture … \nAnd now, it could be known as the city that got sued by McDonald’s for millions of Euros. \nIt was reported this week that the fast food chain would be suing the Italian city for 18 millions Euros after it was blocked from opening a restaurant on one of its historic plazas, the Piazza del Duomo. \nBack in June, McDonald’s had plans to build a restaurant on the famous Renaissance piazza rejected by Florence’s mayor. The decision was upheld in July by a technical panel in charge of preserving the city’s historic areas. READ MORE: McDonald’s Realises Now Is Not a Great Time to Have a Creepy Clown as Your Mascot \nIn response, McDonald’s modified its plans for the restaurant, which it says fit with Florence’s city guidelines and “operate respectfully towards the local policies, even accepting to introduce typical local products in our offer.” \nThe chain is now claiming it has been unfairly discriminated against and is launching a bid for damages, attempting to recoup the 17.8 million Euros it says it will lose over the next 18 years. \nThat’s a lot of Quarter Pounders. \nIn a statement to the BBC, McDonald’s said: “We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone.” \nMayor of Florence Dario Nardella, however, feels differently. He said that the city was not prejudiced in rejecting the burger chain’s plans to open a new branch, telling the city council earlier this year: “We also have the right to say no.” \nYou may find it hard to say no to a Chicken Legend with extra barbecue sauce when the 3 AM munchies hit, but it seems Florence hopes to stand more firm.",

      "text": "Edit Module 5 Things You Might Not Know About the Krocs of McDonald’s Lisa Napoli’s Ray & Joan dives into the lives of the longtime McDonald’s owner and his wife. By Sarah Watts Ray and Joan Kroc with the San Diego Chicken, a mascot of the Padres. Photo: Bettmann Collection/Getty Images Published today at 11:29 a.m. 1 Joan was a trailblazer. \nThanks to a bizarre corporate policy, women weren’t allowed to work at McDonald’s until the mid-1960s. But when Joan’s first husband, Rawland Smith, bought a franchise, she ran the restaurant’s day-to-day operations anyway. 2 The Krocs’ marriage started as an affair. \nRay fell for Joan when he saw her playing piano at a lounge in St. Paul in 1957. After more than a decade of openly pining for each other, the two dumped their spouses and ran off to Vegas. 3 Ray kept looking for the next big thing. \nOnce McDonald’s became a hit, Kroc got bored. He considered building amusement parks and invested in pet motels before buying the San Diego Padres on a whim in 1974. (The Cubs, his first choice, weren’t for sale.) 4 They knew how to use their cash. \nRay donated to charities wherever he opened a franchise. And Joan had her own projects: Having lived with Ray’s drinking problem, she started Operation Cork, a program for families of alcoholics. And the Kroc Center in Chicago was one of 26 community hubs built with a $1.5 billion donation to the Salvation Army. 5 Joan didn’t skimp on herself, either. \nThere was her $16 million Gulfstream jet (cheekily named Impromptu) and $32,000 engraved replica of the Declaration of Independence. But her real pride and joy: a $3 million diamond-encrusted Fabergé egg. This article appears in the November 2016 issue of Chicago magazine. Subscribe to Chicago magazine .",
