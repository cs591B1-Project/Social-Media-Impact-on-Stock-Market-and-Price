      "text": "The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming head count and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks, according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves.\nThe decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. Federal regulation in the United States do not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com, plow money into drone delivery.\n\"Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" a spokesperson for X wrote in an email. \"What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\"\nIn August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech.\nRobotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables.\nAlphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee.\nA Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment.\nSimilarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer.\nThe status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokesperson declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions.\nAstro Teller, the longtime chief of X, is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and \"really dramatically, magically, change the world.\"\nHowever, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received \"90-day notices,\" which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision.\nLast November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a \"commercial business up in running in 2017.\" It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions.\n\"You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery,\" said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells. \"Nobody knows how long it's going to take.\"\nBloomberg",

In all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. The company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. For the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Most Popular",

      "text": "Finally, Starbucks Reveals 2016 Holiday Cups By Facebook PHOTO: Starbucks \nNothing says holiday season is here like Starbucks ' red cups. The special edition holiday cups are such an essential part of the most magical time of the year that, this year, people started talking about them even before Halloween. That was in part because Starbucks released a green cup , presented as a \"symbol of unity,\" that many mistook as their holiday cup. Sarcastic outrage over the cup turned into actual outrage, which eventually led to someone leaking a picture of Starbucks' alleged holiday cup on Reddit. No one takes holiday cups more seriously than Starbucks fans. Now, though, everyone can relax—and embrace the holiday spirit—because Starbucks has just revealed their holiday cup lineup for 2016. Facebook PHOTO: Starbucks \nThis afternoon, Starbucks unveiled the collection at Brookfield Place in New York, and it does not disappoint. For starters, there are more designs than days in the week, so you're going to want to collect them all and alternate daily. The most familiar design is the one with branches growing from the center mermaid logo, which an employee posted to Reddit . Continuing with that secular theme, there's a cup crisscrossed in string lights, one covered in snowflakes, and another dotted with snowy trees. There's also a wreath-enveloped mermaid logo with a deer. Then there's a handful of more abstract or geometric patterns that conjure the holiday season with red and white colors. Facebook PHOTO: Starbucks \nTake a look and plan your first choice accordingly because the cups are hitting Starbucks stores tomorrow, November 10. Keywords:",

      "text": "Starbucks Holiday Red Cup 2016 Starbucks Doesn't Just Have 1 Red Cup This Year — It Has 13 November 9, 2016 by Hedy Phillips 383 Shares \nStarbucks today announced that this year's traditional red cup will be something completely different from anything it has done in the past. Instead of releasing one red cup for the season, Starbucks will instead have 13 different cups. What is perhaps the most exciting part of this new idea this year, though, is that each cup was designed by customers from around the world. The artists hail from six different countries and all walks of life, but the collection of cups \"expresses the shared spirit of the season,\" Starbucks said in a statement. \nAt an event today in New York to announce the new cups, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz acknowledged the backlash the brand received last year over the holiday red cup and said, \"Unbeknownst to us, there were a number of people who decided that Starbucks perhaps was not in the Christmas spirit. That created quite a storm.\" But what those plain red cups allowed was for the world to use them as a blank canvas to share their stories, which they did in droves. In eight days, Starbucks received 1,200 submissions under the hashtag #RedCupArt, with beautiful drawings done in white. \n\"Their inspiration came from nature or seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic, while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook,\" Starbucks said in a statement. \nGet a sneak peek of the cups in the photo above, and find them all in your local Starbucks starting tomorrow.

      "text": "Zoe Bain Sometimes, you need fake drama to distract you from real drama. Enter: Starbucks’ new holiday cups, which people are sure to have some strong feelings about. Remember all that cup drama from last week ? Well, we're here to debunk all of the myths and introduce all 13 (YES, 13!) holiday cups. They will be available starting tomorrow for your Instagramming pleasure.So here's the deal: First the coffee chain launched green unity cups , which to our dismay still managed to cause an internet uproar. But, everything was still going to be okay, because red cups were coming. Finally, possible cup designs started popping up online , and it looked like there were multiple varieties, and we weren't sure WHAT to believe. Now we finally have answers, people. There are 13 total red-cup options (did we mention one of them is iced?!), which were created by customers around the world. Drawing on white cups has always been a tradition, so Starbucks started a red-cup contest last year, and thus this year's designs were born. Since it's not the holidays without some red-hued controversy, we're sure there will be a whole new ridiculous Twitter war to laugh about tomorrow. Looking forward to collecting them all, Pokémon-style. For now, click through to find your faves. Begin Slideshow",

      "text": "Starbucks' new cups Starbucks \nThe holiday season has officially begun — at least at Starbucks. \nThe coffee chain debuted not one but 13 new red holiday cup designs on Wednesday. Starbucks will begin serving beverages in the new cups on Thursday morning. \nSince Starbucks launched holiday cups in 1997, its red cups have become a holiday mainstay. \nLast year, Starbucks faced backlash when the company debuted minimalist red cups that some complained weren't \"Christmas-y\" enough. After evangelist and internet personality Joshua Feuerstein posted a video on Facebook protesting the cups, the outrage — and outrage at the outrage — quickly grew, with hundreds sharing their views on social media. \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz referenced the controversy at an event in New York City on Wednesday where the new cups were revealed. \n\"Should we just go back to last year and come out with a great red cup... and perhaps start another firestorm?\" Schultz said. \"We didn't think that was such a good idea.\" \nStarbucks \nSo, the company turned to customers for inspiration. The 13 designs are inspired by customers' photos of their decorated red cups, posted on Instagram last year. \nThe red cups are Starbucks' second seasonal cups of 2016. \nIn the week or so leading up to the election, Starbucks debuted a green cup that featured an illustration showing the faces of more than 100 people, drawn with a single continuous line. The cup was intended to encourage unity during what Schultz called a \" divisive time in our country.\" \nInstead, many customers were critical of the cups. While some people were simply confused about the color, others accused the coffee chain of \"political brainwashing.\" \nDespite social media blowback, Starbucks has long maintained that its cups are an apolitical holiday tradition. \nBut Schultz has long been an outspoken figure when it comes to politics. In September he endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. \nOn Wednesday morning, Schultz sent a solemn note to his company's more than 120,000 US employees saying he was \"stunned\" by Donald Trump's election and encouraging the chain's workers to move \"onward together.\"",

Owner, Howard Raucous LLC @ ChrisMatyszczyk WRITE A COMMENT Remember this boring old thing last year? CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nAbsurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \nSo about those green unity cups that Starbucks released. \nHow did they work? \nI suspect not as well as Starbucks had hoped, given some of the tweets I've been seeing in the last 24 hours. \nStill, just like presidents, along comes another one. Another cup, that is. \nActually, that's not quite true. \nYou see, Starbucks didn't want to have the same hooh, hah and brouhaha it had last year over its plain red holiday cup. \nSo it's releasing 13 new designs. Yes, 13. \nIsn't that unlucky for some? Not according to Starbucks. It says it asked customers to provide this year's designs. And it's chosen only the finest ones. \nYou might wish to peruse these 13 cups and wonder what some of the less fine ones will have looked like. \nThe chosen ones, you see, well I suspect they might generate some controversy of their own. \nA couple look like a brain scan of a migraine, one slightly less intense than the other. \nOne has Christmas lights on it, but the first time I looked I thought it was barbed wire. \nNaturally, that one came from someone in New York. \nAnd Good Lord, there's even a special one with a wooden wreath for cold drinks. \nOddly, I do imagine that at least a couple of Starbucks's cold drinks taste like sweetened wood. \nIt's unclear, though, which cups you'll find where. \nThe company says: \"13 customer designs were selected from six countries to represent the collective spirit of the holidays around the world. Their designs will be showcased on the holiday cups served in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries.\" \nI can just imagine the scene now. \nI'll walk into my local Starbucks and baristas Kurshina and Marie will be pulling two fighting customers apart, as they tear at each other's hair. \nShe got the barbed wire cup! Why did I only get the birch forest? \nAbout that birch forest cup. If you ask me, it looks a little like English wallpaper circa 1969. \nStill, you'll be delighted that Starbucks is going back to being festive after last year's plain excursion. \nOh come, then, all ye faithful. And be art lovers, not fighters. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Nov 9, 2016 Advertisement",

      "text": "In trade-dependent Washington, where the sale of Microsoft software, Boeing jets and Starbucks coffee to other countries helps fuel the regional economy, a Trump presidency could have large impacts.\nGiven President-elect Donald Trump’s statements against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other trade pacts, “it’s pretty clear that we are not going to see any new trade agreements in the near future,” said Debra Glassman, senior lecturer at the University of Washington Foster School of Business.\nShe predicts there will be no ratification of the TPP, no conclusion to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, and possibly a return “to an era of greater protectionism.”\n“Countries will look out for their own interests. This will result in a patchwork of trade barriers — and that’s difficult for businesses. For every market they sell into, there will be different rules,” she said.\n  Though Glassman is not predicting any specific effects on Washington state, “the thing about trade is that any change in trade has winners and losers. You might protect a certain set of manufacturing jobs but you’d lose jobs in transportation and logistics.”\n“There’s going to be a reallocation of jobs across industries if we move back to a more protectionist international system,” she said.\nChris Mefford, president and CEO of economic development consulting firm Community Attributes, said, Trump’s criticism of the Ex-Im Bank threatens “a huge asset that the Boeing Company relies on.”\n”I don’t think he gets the role of trade in our global economy,” Mefford said. “He’s alienated key global trade partners including Mexico and Canada.\nMefford also said he believes Trump’s comments on diversity, immigration and women could make it more difficult to attract work talent from around the world. \n“These are real, real issues. These are not just moral high ground issues,” he said. \nJanet I. Tu: 206-464-2272 or jtu@seattletimes.com . On Twitter @janettu .

JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

      "text": "« A SAFE PREDICTION: … November 9, 2016 \nHE HAS NO CLUE THAT HE HELPED MAKE IT POSSIBLE, DOES HE? Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Is ‘Stunned’ by Donald Trump’s Win : \nCEO Howard Schultz has made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. \nIn a letter to staff on Wednesday, Schultz said he was gobsmacked by the president-elect’s victory but said Americans had to respect the results. \n“Like so many of our fellow Americans—both Democrats and Republicans—I am stunned,” Schultz wrote. “We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.” \nI know, Howard. I too was shocked by Hillary’s divisive “deplorable” and “irredeemable” references and the equally guttural language of her closest supporters. Almost as shocked as I was last year when a CEO thought he knew more about American race relations than his customers, and was free to hector them with an evangelic fervor . So I’m sure we’ll overcome the vitriolic division of Hillary and the media’s crude tribal politics as well. True fact, @Starbucks : Liberals once believed people shouldn’t be valued for the color of their skin. #RaceTogether pic.twitter.com/6qAl4sPWjg \n— Jeff Jacoby (@Jeff_Jacoby) March 22, 2015 \nUPDATE: “When you give yourself and your political party over entirely to left-wing identity politics, issues of class become invisible to you, and you end up forgetting that you ever knew people like the white working-class and rural people of the Rust Belt. You lose elections that way. I do not like identity politics. I believe it is dangerous, especially in a pluralistic democracy like ours. But look, if that’s how the left is going to rig the system, then it should not be surprised when white people get tired of it, and decide to play by the same hardball rules.”",

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones.

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" \nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

      "text": "Just hours after election results were in, naming Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States, Starbucks CEO and chairman Howard Schultz sent a powerful email to the coffee chain's 170,000-plus partners, candidly sharing his thoughts on the election results—and how he believes the company should respond in the four years ahead.\n\"Like so many of our fellow Americans–both Democrats and Republicans–I am stunned,\" he wrote. \"We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\"\n Schultz—who publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton, telling Mad Money host Jim Cramer she's \"the best choice\" this past September—has spoken repeatedly about how divisive this particular election season has been, encouraging people to see past their party affiliation and other differences. In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Starbucks also released a limited-edition green cup , featuring a single-line sketch connecting drawings of 100 people from all walks of life, as a reminder of community and compassion.\nGetty Mike Pont Rather than focus on his disappointment in his preferred candidate losing the race, Schultz urged Starbucks employees to \"honor the democratic process,\" writing that it's \"our responsibility as citizens to give [Trump] the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.\"\nThis isn't the first email Schultz has sent employees regarding the election. Just a few days before Super Tuesday, he wrote to them, saying he felt \"a bit anxious\" about the vote and asked everyone to share \"kindness, compassion, empathy\" and love, reports CNNMoney . He did not tell them who to vote for.\nStarbucks Here's the complete email, titled \" Onward Together ,\" which was sent out around 9:30 a.m.:\nDear partners,\nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned.\nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.\nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.\nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism.\nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans.\nI am so very proud to be your partner.\nOnward,\nHoward\nThis isn't the first time Schultz has entered the political fray— he endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency in 2008 and 2012—and it likely won't be his last. He hasn't made any public plans to run for president himself, though he also hasn't ruled out running in the future. \"Never say never,\" he told CNN in September.\nFrom: Delish\n Share Tweet Email",

      "text": "Last week the internet, and I, embarked on a very important investigation: Will Starbucks have red holiday cups in 2016? It was an emotional ride — from green unity cups to leaked photos of red cups — all we wanted were answers.\nWell, I'm proud to say our investigation ends here, you guys. In 2016, there will be 13 holidays cups made up of 12 red cups, and one cold drink cup. Thirteen cups! Thirteen chances for a perfect #RedCupSeason Instagram starting Nov. 10.\nThe cup designs came from the #RedCupContest in 2015, that launched after Starbucks received major backlash for their red cups. The contest asked that customers design their own holiday cup and, little did they know, their designs had the chance to be one of the 2016 cups.\n The new red cups are adorable and everything you want to sip your peppermint mocha from while wearing your oversize scarf and puffer coat.\nDo enjoy your first look at the 2016 Starbucks holiday cups:\n1.\nStarbucks 2.\nStarbucks 3.\nStarbucks 4.\nStarbucks 5.\nStarbucks 6.\nStarbucks 7.\nStarbucks 8.\nStarbucks 9.\nStarbucks 10.\nStarbucks 11.\n12.\nStarbucks 13.\nStarbucks Thank you for sticking with me on this journey to the red cup.

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups.

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

      "text": "Starbucks is giving a sneak preview of the 13 new designs set to adorn their red holiday cups, starting Thursday.\nThe designs include Christmas lights, candy canes, snowflakes and a reindeer, to name a few. Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries.\n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer.\nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.”\nIt's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \n\nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them.\nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here .\nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday:\n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n ",

In all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. The company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. For the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" ",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

Starbucks unveils 2016 holiday red cups https://t.co/ZVy32ZUCHI Meet the designers too https://t.co/fo4rBYYiOR #RedCups pic.twitter.com/oMgV510Hr3 \n— Starbucks News (@Starbucksnews) November 9, 2016 \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year’s controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.”",

      "text": "By Tanya Ghahremani 4 hours ago \nIf you were one of the few who missed Starbucks' annual red holiday cup, good news: It's back, and complete with a major plot twist. During a press conference, Starbucks revealed to a room full of journalists, including Bustle, that their long-awaited Starbucks red holiday cup would actually be 13 red cups in 2016, with each having been designed by a different artist from around the world as part of their holiday cup design challenge in Dec. 2015. \n\"We hope that this year's red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,\" Starbucks global chief marketing officer, Sharon Rothstein, said of the unveiling. \nEach cup differs greatly, but the common theme amongst them is apparent: unity, love, joy, and the holiday spirit. All important facets of the holiday season, especially in 2016. \nAccording to Starbucks' CEO Howard Schultz at the event, the artists behind the designs come from six different countries, including the U.S., Canada, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, and Russia. Designs range from bold, like the Birch Forest design by Chloe, who hails from Plainfield, Illinois, to soft and fairytale-like, like the Poinsettia design by Christina from Bakersfield, California. There's even a design for iced coffee cups. \nThe red holiday cups will be available in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores across 75 different countries on Nov. 10. \"Birds & Flowers\" ",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. AP Photo/Joseph Pisani Stumble \nNEW YORK -- Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks’ holiday cups this year, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. In all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nThe company was surprised by last year’s controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. “It’s just a cup,” he joked. For the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” © 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year’s controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” Share",

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" \nThree days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10.\nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump , now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\n   WATCH   Starbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n“It’s just a cup,” he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "The 101 Most Delish Thanksgiving Appetizers Starbucks CEO's Statement About The Election Will Make You Cry \nHoward Schultz discusses his \"stunned\" reaction to Trump's presidency—and delivers a powerful message on how employees should respond. Most Popular By Candace Braun Davison Nov 9, 2016 Just hours after election results were in, naming Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States, Starbucks CEO and chairman Howard Schultz sent a powerful email to the coffee chain's 170,000-plus partners, candidly sharing his thoughts on the election results—and how he believes the company should respond in the four years ahead. \"Like so many of our fellow Americans–both Democrats and Republicans–I am stunned,\" he wrote. \"We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Schultz—who publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton, telling Mad Money host Jim Cramer she's \"the best choice\" this past September—has spoken repeatedly about how divisive this particular election season has been, encouraging people to see past their party affiliation and other differences. In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Starbucks also released a limited-edition green cup , featuring a single-line sketch connecting drawings of 100 people from all walks of life, as a reminder of community and compassion. Getty Mike Pont Most Popular Rather than focus on his disappointment in his preferred candidate losing the race, Schultz urged Starbucks employees to \"honor the democratic process,\" writing that it's \"our responsibility as citizens to give [Trump] the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.\" This isn't the first email Schultz has sent employees regarding the election. Just a few days before Super Tuesday, he wrote to them, saying he felt \"a bit anxious\" about the vote and asked everyone to share \"kindness, compassion, empathy\" and love, reports CNNMoney . He did not tell them who to vote for. Starbucks Here's the complete email, titled \" Onward Together ,\" which was sent out around 9:30 a.m.: Dear partners, Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. As Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. We can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. Today, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. I am so very proud to be your partner. Onward, Howard This isn't the first time Schultz has entered the political fray— he endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency in 2008 and 2012—and it likely won't be his last. He hasn't made any public plans to run for president himself, though he also hasn't ruled out running in the future. \"Never say never,\" he told CNN in September. Follow Delish on Instagram . ",

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs  01 am 11/10/2016 12:01am Share In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

By choosing several motifs, the company has for the first time abandoned its 24-year-old one-cup campaign approach, Mashable reports.\n“This year, […] we decided to do something quite different,” said CEO Howard Schultz to a crowd at the official launch in Manhattan on Wednesday. “With everything that’s going on in the world, and everything that’s going on in our country, we have a lot to be thankful for,” he said, on the same day that Donald Trump was elected President.\nThe highly decorative red and white cups were picked from a crowd-sourced selection of over 1,000 customer designs on Instagram last year, and will officially hit 25,000 Starbucks locations in 75 counties on Nov. 10.\nStarbucks unveils 2016 holiday red cups https://t.co/ZVy32ZUCHI Meet the designers too https://t.co/fo4rBYYiOR #RedCups pic.twitter.com/oMgV510Hr3 \n— Starbucks News (@Starbucksnews) November 9, 2016 \n\n \nEarlier this week, Fortune’s Lucinda Shen reported that aside from the 13 cups, the coffee giant would also be standing by its non-denominational plain red cup -- only this year, with a customer-friendly sweetener: anyone who orders a holiday drink from Nov. 10-14 between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. will get a free holiday drink.\nFor more on Starbucks, watch Fortune’s video: \n\n\"We hope that this year's red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,\" said Starbucks’ global chief marketing officer Sharon Rothstein in a press release.",

Joseph Pisani AP Photo 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nInstead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.

      "text": "Email \nStarbucks is giving a sneak preview of the 13 new designs set to adorn their red holiday cups, starting Thursday. \nThe designs include Christmas lights, candy canes, snowflakes and a reindeer, to name a few. Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Share See comments NEW YORK — \nInstead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nRed and white, of course \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with 11 of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. \nThe one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nAlso, Election Day cup \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups for the holidays.

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. Share this: ",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday.\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year‚Äôs plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani)\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump , now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Related Coverage Starbucks rolls out ‘unity’ cup ahead of Election Day \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.

They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups. \n\nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani . \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.

The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.

(Photo: Starbucks) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nNEW YORK -- It might not sound like that big of a deal, but Starbucks has rolled out the latest edition of what has become a tradition -- its holiday cup designs. \nDon't look now, but the holidays are almost upon us. And one way to tell, besides colder days and holiday decorations going, will be the colorful cups. Starbucks is bringing them on in a bid to spread some holiday cheer and to ring up sales. \nStarting Thursday. the Seattle-based coffee giant will begin serving its beverages in one of 13 “distinct cups” created by artists from around the world. \nPaper cups aren't usually the kind of thing that instill customer loyalty, but Starbucks has learned the hard way. When the company came out with its green pre-holiday cup last week, the Internet was outraged. Thinking it was a replacement for the famous red cup, users took to Twitter to voice their complaints. The uproar even made it into a segment on CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \n\"The holidays don't start until you've had your first red cup at Starbucks, \" says Nancy Poznoff, Starbuck's vice president of marketing \nThe new cups are a twist on Starbucks usual red cup holiday design which feature a red background behind the Starbucks logo. \nAfter last year’s red cups inspired customers to draw on them, the company launched an Instagram campaign looking to encourage people to share their work with the world. In just eight days 1,200 designs poured in from 13 different countries. The company took 13 submissions and made them into this year’s cup collection, company officials say. The cups will be offered in all 25,000 Starbucks locations around the world. \nIn addition to releasing the red cups on Thursday, the company will also be launching its annual \"buy one, share one\" promotion where those that buy a drink between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. will get a second one free. The promotion will run through Monday. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) N EW YORK (AP)  Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup  bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below  drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known  they wanted red cups.",
