      "text": "Xbox Insider Program Announced By Microsoft For Xbox Feedback 12:33 pm By Julian Horsey \nMicrosoft has this week revealed plans for its new Xbox Insider Program which will replace the Xbox Preview Program and brings with it a number of new features, as well as new opt-in opportunities for gamers using the Xbox platform to provide feedback on the direction of the Xbox platform. \nMicrosoft is looking for the Xbox community to help provide feedback on games, app previews and system updates, and explains that since the launch of the Xbox Preview Program in February 2014, millions of votes have helped shape and improve the Xbox experience for gamers. \nMajor Nelson explains a little more about what you can expect from the newly renamed Xbox Preview Program which is now referred to as the Xbox Insider Program. \nThis new name reflects how we are expanding to offer opt-in opportunities to provide feedback on Game and App Previews alongside System Update previews. \nNext, we have an update to the Xbox Preview Dashboard that has been rebuilt from the ground-up based on fan feedback. A few highlights include: \n▪ A new name – the Xbox Insider Hub ▪ Personalized to give you more relevant announcements, quests, and Insider content opportunities to get early access to select games and apps ▪ A new UI, inspired by the New Xbox One Experience, makes it easier to find the right info and provide more robust feedback ▪ The Xbox Insider profile card where your contributions in the program come front and center ▪ Support for multiple users on a console to participate and provide feedback \nWe’re starting to roll these changes out today to a small number of preview members who have provided the most feedback since the inception of the Xbox Preview Program. If you have your Xbox One console in Instant-on mode and you have the Xbox Preview Dashboard app installed, then you don’t have to do anything – the app will update automatically overnight. If you want to see the changes sooner, you can check for updates by going to My games and apps, and then looking at the updates section. Over the next few weeks, all existing Xbox Preview members will get access to the new Xbox Insider Hub. \nOur final change is that the Xbox Insider Program will soon be open to all Xbox users. More fans will have the ability to provide feedback directly from their Xbox One consoles. The Xbox Insider Hub will provide great opportunities to try out games, apps, and other console experiences. Note that Xbox system updates will currently be limited to those already testing them (not open to new members), as we still have a huge number of volunteers already doing a great job testing and providing feedback.",

      "text": "Donald Trump Elected President of the US Is Bad News for Apple and Microsoft GO Trump criticized the tech industry several times before Nov 9, 2016 12:42 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Donald Trump is the new President of the United States even though only a few people actually expected this to happen, and now many people involved in the tech field are wondering how the government’s relationship with large technology companies can change over the course of the next four years. Unfortunately, Donald Trump becoming President of the United States isn’t quite the best news for Silicon Valley, mostly because the Republican criticized tech companies several times for building products overseas, as it’s the case of Apple and its iPhone. The San Bernardino saga Furthermore, Trump had often condemned the likes of Apple and Microsoft for not working closely with the US government in a number of very controversial cases, such as the San Bernardino iPhone when the FBI requested Apple to break into the phone used by one of the December 2015 shooters. Although Apple strongly opposed to the request and pledged to offer full privacy to its customers, no matter who they are, several government officials blasted the firm, saying that it puts the national security at risk by protecting terrorists. Trump was obviously one of the main critics, pointing out with pretty harsh words that if he were to be the President, Apple was not allowed to do such a thing. “Who do they think they are? They have to open it up,” Trump said. “I think security, overall, we have to open it up and we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense.” Donald Trump, however, owns Apple stock worth millions of dollars, but this hasn’t stopped him from calling a boycott of products manufactured by the Cupertino firm. The Apple boycott and backdoors “Apple ought to give the security for that phone, OK? I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number,\" he said, adding: \"I just thought of it. Boycott Apple,” he said. Oddly enough, Trump also turned to the Internet to condemn Apple for its refusal to break into the terrorist’s phone, but tweeted the harsh words with an iPhone. It’s not a secret that tech giants supported each other in the fight against the US government and some took decisions that directly impacted Trump. Microsoft, for example, refused to support the Republican National Convention with a cash donation earlier this year, choosing instead to contribute with technology. Several organizations requested other companies, including Apple and Google, to follow Microsoft’s lead, and it goes without saying that Donald Trump has no reason to be pleased with it. And last but not least, Donald Trump said several times during the presidential race that he wanted American companies to focus on American facilities and employing American workforce, and with the likes of Microsoft, Google, Apple and others having thousands of employees overseas, it’ll be interesting to see how this relationship develops. Donald Trump promised in his speech this morning that he’ll be the president of every American and will fight “to make America great again. Tech companies headquartered in the US have been saying pretty much the same thing with other words for a while now, but a dispute between the two sides is just a matter of time, especially after January when Donald Trump officially becomes the President of the United States.

      "text": "Microsoft Finally Fixes Critical Windows Security Flaw Made Public by Google GO Look for MS16-135 to remain protected against this flaw Nov 9, 2016 07:53 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft rolled out this month’s Patch Tuesday fixes only a few hours ago, including an update that addresses the Windows security flaw that search giant Google made public last week. Google discovered an unpatched vulnerability in Windows and after notifying Microsoft, it decided to make it public, adding that exploits were already spotted in the wild. Google’s security effort has a policy that gives companies 7 days to fix found security flaws, and in the case of Microsoft, the public disclosure was made after 10 days. Microsoft blamed Google for posting details online, explaining that with this decision the company made Windows users vulnerable to attacks and promised to release a fix on Patch Tuesday. Today, this fix is finally available in the form of MS16-135 , an update that oddly enough is labeled as important, even though Microsoft itself confirmed that there were attacks launched against this vulnerability. “This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system,” Microsoft says in the description of the update that’s flagged as a “security update for Windows kernel-mode drivers.” Fancy Bear attacks Microsoft previously said that a Russian hacker group called Strontium, also known as Fancy Bear, attempted to exploit the security flaw, revealing that it recorded low-volume spear phishing attacks specifically aimed at taking advantage of unpatched systems. The firm recommended users to switch to Microsoft Edge, which was already secure against the flaw. “We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Microsoft’s Terry Myerson said last week. Users are recommended to prioritize deployment of this update even if it’s labeled as important, and Microsoft explains that a system reboot is required to complete the install.",

      "text": "Microsoft is splitting the Xbox Preview Program into two options, one of which is called the Xbox Insider Program that will soon be open for all owners. The second program, Xbox One Update Preview, is only for testing system updates. More Just as with the Windows Insider program for Windows 10, Microsoft calls on adventurous customers to test new builds of the Xbox One operating system. The company launched the Xbox Preview Program in February of 2014, and since then, it has incorporated feature requests and provided means for voting on potential feature additions to improve the Xbox One experience for all owners. Now, more than two years later, Microsoft is overhauling the program.\nMicrosoft’s head of the Xbox preview program, Emily Hanson, said on Monday that it’s now called the Xbox Insider Program, which falls in line alongside the Windows Insider Program. The name change reflects the program’s expansion beyond offering just previews to system updates with the ability to offer feedback on preview builds of apps, games, and other “experiences.”\nRelated: Xbox One Holiday Gaming Preview\nWith the new program name comes an update to the Xbox Preview Dashboard. According to Hanson, this was rebuilt “from the ground up” to reflect user feedback. The changes start with a new “Xbox Insider Hub” name, a more personalized approach, and a new user interface inspired by the New Xbox One Experience. The update will also provide the ability for multiple users on a single console to provide feedback.\n“We’re starting to roll these changes out today to a small number of preview members who have provided the most feedback since the inception of the Xbox Preview Program,” Hanson said. “If you have your Xbox One console in Instant-on mode and you have the Xbox Preview Dashboard app installed, then you don’t have to do anything — the app will update automatically overnight.”\nIf you haven’t jumped on the Xbox One preview bandwagon, the renamed program provides an additional benefit: an open door for all Xbox One owners. That’s right: Microsoft will provide the Xbox Insider Hub to all Xbox One gamers “soon” for testing new games, apps, and other console “experiences.” What the general base won’t test are new builds of the Xbox One operating system.\nAs shown in Microsoft’s FAQ here , the Xbox Preview Program was split into two offerings: the Xbox Insider Program and the Xbox One Update Preview. The former provides previews for games, apps, new “experiences,” and system updates. The former program focuses only on previewing system updates for the console.\nBased on that information, current Insiders can test apps, games, experiences, and system updates whereas the upcoming new Insiders can only test apps, games, and experiences when the program launches for the masses. The second program, which appears separately in the Xbox Insider Hub app, seems to focus on gamers who only want to test system builds.\n“Xbox Insiders become eligible for previews based on their interests, previous activities in the program, tenure as an Xbox Insider, Xbox Insider XP, and other factors,” the FAQ states. “If you previously participated in the Xbox Preview Program, you can rejoin the Xbox One Update Preview at any time by selecting it from the Insider content list in the Xbox Insider Hub.”\nWith the introduction of the two programs, Microsoft is providing Xbox One owners several ways they can participate in software testing. When the Xbox Insider Program actually rolls out to all Xbox One owners is unknown for now, but hopefully it will be long before Microsoft serves up the Creators Update for Windows 10 in spring 2017.\nUpdate: The Xbox One’s N64 emulator is already gone The best Xbox One compatible Xbox 360 games Xbox Game Preview, ID@Xbox titles coming to Windows 10 this year",

      "text": "Fon and Microsoft teamed up to make purchasing pre-paid plans for hot spot access easier on Windows 10 devices by incorporating Windows Store credentials. Customers can now select a Fon hot spot and automatically purchase a pre-paid plan. More In the run-up to the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft has launched a November Bug Bash for Windows Insiders. If you’re unfamiliar, a Microsoft Bug Bash is a weeklong event during which members of the Windows Insiders program team up to discover and take down bugs lurking in different corners of Windows 10.\nInsiders will be able to use the internal Feedback Hub to choose a number of “Quests,” which will lead them to perform tasks like testing the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or use Microsoft Edge for web browsing. Using familiar MMO terminology, Microsoft has spiced up what is essentially just a standard bug hunt.\nAny bugs that pop up during those quests are reported to Microsoft whose engineering team will be working overtime to, well, bash them.\nRelated: Off the grid gaming: Microsoft shows gamers how to play Windows Store games offline.\nUnfortunately, the focus on the November Bug Bash means this latest Insider Build won’t feature much in the way of new functionality, instead it provides users a way to help out with the Windows 10 development process. Not quite as fun as running an instance in World of Warcraft , but a little more productive.\nLuckily, if you’re a bug-hunting aficionado, this latest Bug Bash likely won’t be the last before the Windows Creators Update goes live early next year. According to MS Power User , we could see at least two more forays into the bug-infested depths of Windows 10.\nIt’s no surprise that the the upcoming Creators Update will be the focus of the Windows Insider program in the coming months, as Microsoft gets it ready for prime time. Instead of testing incremental updates, Insiders will help shape the next major update for Windows 10.\nThe Creators Update will reportedly feature a revamped Paint app, and many other features tailor-made for creative professionals. We first saw the update teased at Microsoft’s event in late October, which saw the introduction of the Surface Studio .\nYour friends and family come first in the Windows 10 Creators Update Microsoft to hold its next ‘bug bash’ on November 8-13 to help disinfect Windows 10 Many Windows 10 users won’t see Anniversary Update until November",

      "text": "svenska Microsoft Taps Whitlock as Launch Partner for Microsoft Surface Studio Microsoft's most powerful desktop and collaboration device has hit the market, and Whitlock was chosen to drive adoption with large enterprises and higher education.   RICHMOND, Va. , Nov.   Whitlock, a video collaboration company, announces it will serve as a primary reseller and integrator for the new Microsoft Surface Studio, a 28\" desktop and collaboration device released on October 26 th by Microsoft. \"Microsoft approached our team for perspective on the professional market for the Surface Studio as we have been a leading partner and integrator for the Microsoft Surface Hub ,\" states John \"Jack\" Steinhauer, Whitlock Executive Vice President. \"We view the Surface Studio as an impressive and complementary solution to the Surface Hub, delivering the same power to the desktop or smaller huddle spaces across the enterprise.\" \"Whitlock was chosen as an important channel for selling into the corporate market based on their expertise, relationships and proven experience with the Microsoft Surface Hub,\" explains Calin Turcanu, Senior Director of Surface Commercial. \"They offer a national and global footprint, along with established relationships with our distribution partners as well.\" Present at the launch event in NYC, Whitlock has already shared the Surface Studio with key customers in the region, and has started to take the device on tour to select cities across the U.S. \"Our traditional corporate customers are very excited by the capabilities, flexibility and durability of the Surface Studio,\" says Whitlock's EVP, \"and Higher Ed leaders are intrigued with the device as a new option for lecterns in classrooms.\" Microsoft developed the Surface Studio as a new class of device for creative professionals, architects, engineers and executives, but also for one-to-two-person collaboration spaces. It further offers a unique solution for digital signage in a corporate setting, or in retail stores with the high-end graphic and interactive capabilities. The 28-inch PixelSense™ Display immerses the user in 13.5 million pixels of pure, true-to-life color, and the Zero Gravity Hinge allows the screen to effortlessly adjust to match a need for annotating or designing on a nearly horizontal plane. When the screen transitions from Desktop Mode to Studio Mode, it sits at a 20-degree angle, similar to a standard drafting board, making it ideal for inking or small group brainstorming. Surface Studio starts at $2,999 estimated retail price (ERP) USD. Whitlock has a limited supply available now, and is also accepting pre-orders online.

      "text": "dell stack \nDell and Intel set out in mid-2014 to develop an entire ecosystem based on Microsoft’s Continuum. The project, referred to internally as Dell Stack, was to center around a 6.4-inch, full-HD mini tablet designed to serve as your desktop, laptop and tablet. \nAs Venture Beat’s Evan Blass reports , the idea was to streamline the transition that the average user makes between their multiple computing devices a handful of times a day (or in the case of business users, numerous times on a daily basis). Rather than moving files to and from devices or to and from the cloud, data would remain on the core handheld device as it transitioned from use case to use case. \nModern ARM-based processors are plenty quick but for a serious full ecosystem replacement, only an x86-based CPU would suffice. The duo planned to use an x86 chip from Intel’s Kaby Lake Y-series of low-power-consumption, dual-core, laptop-class processors mated with up to 8GB of RAM and as much as 256GB of local flash storage (with a microSD card slot for expansion). \nThe publication says the original plans for the tablet called for a 6.4-inch display and a chassis measuring less than nine millimeters thick. At some point, it grew to a seven-inch tablet, like to provide more real estate to improve cooling. \nSo, what’s the status of the project now? \nAccording to documents Venture Beat looked at, the first devices weren’t even scheduled to hit the market until spring 2017. There’s a possibility it’s still in the pipeline but it quite possibly could have been shelved when Intel cancelled its Atom chips for mobile devices earlier this year. Another very real possibility is that Dell may have put the project on hold in the wake of HP launching the Elite x3 , a 3-in-1 Windows 10 mobile smartphone whose use cases are extremely similar to the Dell Stack.

      "title": "Why Slack should worry about Facebook, Microsoft and Google",
      "text": "Collaboration Why Slack should worry about Facebook, Microsoft and Google The market for enterprise messaging and collaboration apps is bigger and more crowded than ever before. Experts tell CIO.com why the market is bustling now, where it’s heading and why Slack now faces stiff competition.   Facebook \nSlack may soon be careening back to earth following a meteoric rise that saw the messaging app become one of the most popular and revered in business. That’s because in the last 30 days two of the world’s largest and most influential technology companies have set their sights on Slack and the burgeoning, increasingly crowded collaboration market. \nWorkplace messaging and communications apps have been vying for enterprise adoption for years, but various macro trends have come together to create a greater opportunity and interest in the collaboration space, according to Vanessa Thompson, research vice president at IDC’s collaboration and communities program (CIO.com and IDC are both owned by International Data Group.). The ubiquity of cloud and mobile technologies combined with a decline in annual productivity per working hour among U.S. workers has carved out a new space for apps like Slack, Workplace by Facebook, Microsoft Teams and others to make a move. Incumbents battle against Facebook and Slack \nIn many cases, the communications needs of employees are not being met by the tools provided by their employers, says Raul Castanon-Martinez, senior analyst at 451 Research . “Vendors know there is great potential and the market is up for grabs.” New entrants Slack and Workplace by Facebook are at one end of the spectrum while incumbent providers of collaboration and business communications such as Atlassian, Avaya, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, SAP and others are updating their offerings with integrated mobile messaging and artificial-intelligence (AI) driven chatbots, according to Castanon-Martinez. \n“Business workflows and business communications are coming together in ways that were not possible before,” he says. Advances in AI and natural language processing enable workflow automation, which empowers workers to be more productive on the device and app of their choice. “Enterprise workflows are now coming to their smartphones and employees will be able to focus on the task at hand rather than having to jump around between their smartphone, laptop and between applications,” Castanon-Martinez says. \n[ Related: Microsoft Teams targets Slack in crowded collaboration market ] \nThese new and reinvigorated apps are also filling gaps in the market of collaboration and communications products, according to Adam Preset, research director, Gartner . “We have big, well-known vendors in consumer and enterprise areas bringing their resources to bear to try to create a single, multipurpose instrument for the modern worker's inputs and outcomes,” he says. \n“Working from anywhere means rethinking how to work together. It means smaller chunks of information delivered faster, but continuously,” Preset says. “Messaging as a technology is a key underpinning. The rise of messaging and messaging apps for personal use informs what kind of communication we might like to see in the workplace.” There isn’t a single enterprise vendor sitting on the sidelines of this market anymore, but it’s a dynamic market that may not last in its current form, according to Preset. “Consolidation around mega-vendors is a well-established pattern.” Can Slack hold on to its lead? \nWhile the incumbents are prepping for the challenge, Slack and Facebook have earned the distinction of being taken seriously, Castanon-Martinez says. Facebook owns the three top messaging apps in the world and Slack is “perhaps the best example of a tool that has penetrated the enterprise because employees actually like to use it,” he says. The competitive landscape for Slack has also shifted as it moves beyond its core messaging app into a central hub for enterprise productivity. “This is a big challenge for Slack, but the company has jumped ahead of the incumbents so they still have the lead.” \n[ Related: Boost your productivity with these seven apps ] \nHowever, because Slack is a singular product it lacks the suite of enterprise tools that companies like Microsoft, Google and others can provide. Packaging collaboration and messaging apps with other apps for productivity is “absolutely critical” for companies to achieve scale and long-term growth, says Melissa Incera, associate analyst for collaboration and business applications at 451 Research. \n“Collaboration is the point where personal and group productivity meet,” Incera says. “The better these tools integrate with and support personal work habits, the more people will use them. In this sense, Microsoft has a huge advantage because its productivity applications are already so engrained in corporate culture.” \n[ Related: 6 Slack alternatives worth a look ] \nEnterprise IT shops and procurement departments also prefer shopping from a single vendor because it’s more efficient for licensing and can create a lighter operational burden, says Preset. “The more enlightened organizations are, the more they're willing to dive deeply into investigating what's best for end users to accomplish their work,” he says. “However, the practical reality is that we don't need the best all the time, and sometimes we can't afford the best. Sometimes all we need is good enough.” Google is the wild card \nNow that Microsoft Teams, an app Microsoft has been developing for the past 18 months, is on the scene, one of the biggest remaining wild cards is Google. The company currently maintains at least eight different messaging apps. It plans to shift its consumer-centric Hangouts app towards the enterprise, just as it’s starting from scratch with two new apps for consumers: Allo and Duo. \n“Google's advantage has been its user experience, its cloud nativity and, more recently, its analytic capabilities, but it has really struggled to upend Microsoft's hold on the office productivity space,” Incera says. “The repositioning of Hangouts and G Suite is indicative of some larger priority shifts for Google as it recognizes a need to address the business use case apart from its consumer experience.” \n[ Related: Facebook at Work finally launches as ‘Workplace’ ] \nIDC’s Thompson also believes Google will introduce a more refined and sophisticated app that meets the communications needs of its existing enterprise customers. The company has added features to some of its apps in G Suite that take advantage of artificial intelligence and organize tasks around teams such as Team Drive, a new capability in Google Drive that brings content ownership, sharing and management up to the team level with more controls. \nGoogle could still revamp Hangouts or extend Google Spaces to provide an experience that’s similar to the newest options in the enterprise collaboration app space, according to Preset. “There is more than one way to successfully accomplish work. Google doesn’t have to make a Slack clone,” he says. “What they have to do is ensure that the same kinds of outcomes achievable in Slack or Microsoft Teams or Workplace by Facebook are possible for those who have chosen the Google way.” This story, \"Why Slack should worry about Facebook, Microsoft and Google\"  ",

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 9, 2016 4:20 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nEarlier this year, Microsoft made a splash at its Ignite conference for IT professionals when it announced that it has been racking cards of programmable chips together with servers in its cloud data centers. \nThe chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), can be reconfigured after being deployed to optimize them for particular applications such as networking and machine learning. \nNow, Microsoft is investing in tools that would allow customers to program the FPGAs, said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise division, during a talk at the Structure conference in San Francisco. \nUsing those tools could help increase performance of workloads that the chips are deployed to tackle. Guthrie said he hopes businesses will see performance improvements between two or three orders of magnitude using FPGAs compared to CPUs or GPUs. \nThere are issues with giving people raw access to the FPGAs, though. \n\"When something goes wrong, you really need to be able to debug that quickly,\" Guthrie said.\"Because it's hardware, it could brick the machine, there are lots of things that we've had to learn how to protect against.\" \nThat said, there's an advantage to be gained from using FPGAs for business applications. \nThe FPGAs are being used to power Azure's Accelerated Networking feature, as well as Microsoft products like Bing. They have the ability to radically speed up some computation. \nDoug Burger, a Microsoft researcher who helped spearhead the FPGA project, said the company's entire deployment could be used to translate all of English-language Wikipedia in a tenth of a second. \nActually writing code for the FPGAs would likely appeal to a small subset of businesses. But for those companies that want access, Microsoft's cloud platform could become a more interesting choice. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Data Centers Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon get $2B in data center tax breaks; economic benefit unclear Some 27 states have established incentive programs specifically for data centers, according to a report from Good Jobs First. Here's what that means for local economies. By Alison DeNisco | November 9, 2016, 4:00 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/scanrail \nThe data center industry is booming, and tech giants are increasingly receiving large incentives packages from state and local governments in exchange for building their data centers in the area. But whether these centers create jobs and benefit local economies remains in question, according to a recent report from national policy resource center Good Jobs First. \nGoogle, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon alone have been awarded more than $2 billion in subsidies combined, according to the report \"Money Lost to the Cloud: How Data Centers Benefit from State and Local Government Subsidies.\" While the number of construction jobs generated for each facility is comparable to building a factory or distribution center, an operating data center creates an average of just 30 to 50 permanent jobs, the report stated. For larger facilities, that number rises to up to 200 jobs. \n\"The question is, how many long-term jobs are being created, and how many are accessible to people from the region? Do people from the region have skills to apply for them?\" said Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst at Good Jobs First and the author of the report. \nSEE: Why data centers fail to bring new jobs to small towns \nThe US is home to 44% of the world's data centers, leading every other country, the report found. And 27 states have established incentive programs specifically meant to draw data centers in, the report found. \n\"The incentive packages can be quite outlandish—far exceeding any reasonable economic justification,\" Todd L. Cherry, director of the Center for Economic Research and Policy Analysis at Appalachian State University, told TechRepublic for another story on data centers and job creation . \"This is a form of what we call 'the winner's curse.' When governments engage in a competitive bidding process over an uncertain benefit, the one that wins is the one that overestimates the benefit.\" Tax breaks and transparency \nThe most important factors for companies considering creating a data center are a stable climate, and access to inexpensive energy, Tarczynska said. That means any area of the country prone to earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes is out, and many rural areas are in. \nElectric power is the largest operating expense for data centers, reported at 70% to 80% of the operating budget, the report stated. Increasingly, companies including Facebook under pressure from environmental groups are looking to access renewable energy for their data centers, Tarczynska said. \nA large data center can cost up to $1 billion to build, the report found. That cost might include land acquisition, facility construction, infrastructure upgrades such as utility hookups, and servers and other equipment. Purchase of mechanical equipment such as computers and cooling rooms, and power equipment such as generators and transformers, are the biggest initial costs. Construction can average $1,000 to $2,000 per square foot, the report found. Data Center Must-Reads Ebook: IT leader’s guide to making DevOps work \nTherefore, the amount of property and other taxes the company pays could be very large. The problem is many of those taxes are being abated, Tarczynska said. \nCompanies might chose two locations in different states, and have each government bid against each other. For example, in September, Facebook engaged in a bidding process between New Mexico and Utah for the opportunity to host its new data center. The New Mexico town of Los Lunas agreed to give up property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments from Facebook starting at $50,000 and going as high as $500,000. In June, the town approved an ordinance allowing for the issuance of up to $30 billion in industrial revenue bonds in efforts to draw the company's business. \n\"These facilities receive a huge amount of tax breaks from state and local governments,\" Tarczynska said. \"There are public costs to those facilities.\" \nOnly 15 states provide easily available online reporting of costs for data center-specific programs, the report found. Many states do not consider these to be economic development incentive programs, but rather something written into the tax code, which invokes various confidentiality laws, Tarczynska said. \nBut that will soon change: A new Governmental Accounting Standards Board rule will require states, cities, counties and school districts to release fiscal reports on tax incentives, starting in 2017. New York City released its findings early: The city lost $3 billion in 2016 to corporate tax breaks for housing and economic development projects. \n\"It's quite a big development, and will help the public and researchers understand what is going on when it comes to tax breaks,\" Tarczynska said. The growth of \"megadeals\" \nThe report also examined 11 \"megadeals,\" or economic development incentives of more than $15 million, that states and local governments offered to tech companies. \nThe average cost of one job in those deals was $2 million in tax breaks. \"This is a huge amount of money being paid for the creation of each individual job,\" Tarczynska said. \"It's important to think about the opportunity cost—what else could be done with that money?\" \nHowever, Mehdi Paryavi, chairman of the International Data Center Authority (IDCA), argues that it's incorrect to compare the size of the data center to the number of jobs created. These data centers are similar to farms, in that they take up a lot of square footage, but don't require hundreds of employees. Benefits of data centers \nTech companies building data centers in rural areas purchase land and develop it, and employ both contract and long term employees—a benefit for those areas, said Paryavi said. \n\"When the Apples and Googles step into a troubled economy, the only thing they can do is help it,\" Paryavi said. \"These guys are coming in and investing millions of dollars. Trusting that your county and state has legislation that protects that investment, why not have their business? It's revenue you didn't have before.\" \nThough the quantity of people working at data centers is less than at a factory, the quality of the positions and work is much higher, Paryavi said. There are also a number of jobs created indirectly, such as those for architects, for the companies that manufacture cooling supplies, and those that maintain generators and replace batteries. \"Those companies are all prospering because of new investments these companies are making with their data centers,\" Paryavi said. \nInternational competition is also a large reason why states should encourage data center development, Paryavi said. \"We have already lost all of our manufacturing to abroad, because incentives outside our borders were better than incentives within the borders,\" Paryavi said. \"Do we want to give away or data center business as well, or provide the right incentives so the Apples and Facebooks will be loyal and have long term plans with us?\" \nThe average lifespan of a data center is 10 years, Paryavi said. \nOne thing is certain: It's unlikely that we'll see data center construction stop any time soon. \"It's an industry in a growing mode—data centers are necessary facilities for companies to operate,\" Tarczynska said. \"There are going to be more and more of them as the need for providing backup on data grows.\" The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Some 27 states have established incentive programs specifically meant to lure data centers, according to a recent report from Good Jobs First. While tech giants Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon alone have been awarded more than $2 billion in subsidies for data centers, each facility creates under 200 jobs on average, the report found. Data center proponents argue that the jobs created are high quality and high salary, and that tax breaks for these facilities help keep these jobs in the US.

      "text": "report malware 1 screenshot A free and open source implementation of Microsoft's NET Framework that complies to the ECMA standards for the C# and the Common Language Runtime Mono is a powerful and flexible project specially made to help developers create cross platform applications. Helps you create cross-platform applications The aim of Mono is to run Microsoft .NET applications cross-platform and deliver better development tools to developers. Besides running on Mac OS X, Mono is also compatible with Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris and Android platforms, as well as game consoles such as Wii, Xbox 260 and PlayStation 3. Thus, Mono comes with both developer tools and the infrastructure required to run .NET client and server applications. Between Mono’s components you’ll find the C# compiler, the Mono Runtime that implements the ECMA Common Language Infrastructure, which also includes a Just-in-Time and an Ahead-of-Time compiler, a library loader, a threading system, garbage collector and interoperability functionality. Improve your productivity and focus on developing your app In addition to the above mentioned components, Mono also includes the Base and Mono Class Library, a set of classes that provide a foundation onto which you can build apps. It is worth mentioning that all Mono languages benefit from most features of the runtime, such as the automatic memory management, generics, reflection and threading. Hence, you can easily focus on writing the app instead of writing the system infrastructure code. Thanks to the Common Language Runtime, you can choose the preferred programing language and interoperate it with code written in other CLR languages. For instance, writing a class in C#, inherit from it in VB.Net and using it in Eiffel could not be easier. Script and embed your apps with ease On top of that, developers have the option to use the Mono runtime to script their applications by embedding it inside other apps, in order to allow the managed code and scripts to run in a native application. All things considered, if you are interested in developing cross-platform applications and you are looking for free and open-source development platform capable to help you achieve your goals, Mono might just be the answer for you.

      "text": "Microsoft patches 68 vulnerabilities, two actively exploited ones Two of the patched flaws are already being exploited and three have been publicly disclosed More like this Use   IDG News Service | Nov 9, 2016 4:31 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft has patched 68 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office, Edge, Internet Explorer and SQL Server, two of which have already been exploited by attackers and three that have been publicly disclosed. \nThe patches are covered in 14 security bulletins , one dedicated to Adobe Flash Player which is upgraded through Windows Update in Windows 10 and 8.1. Six of the bulletins are rated critical and eight are rated important. \nAdministrators should prioritize the Windows patches in the MS16-135 bulletin, because they address a zero-day vulnerability that's already being exploited by a group of attackers known in the security industry as Fancy Bear, APT28 or Strontium. \nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2016-7255, was publicly disclosed by Google last week, only 10 days after notifying Microsoft about it. This caused a bit of friction between the two companies. \nGoogle gives vendors only seven days to fix vulnerabilities or to publish mitigation advice if those flaws are found to be exploited in active attacks. Microsoft disagrees with that policy and feels that Google's decision to make details about this vulnerability public put customers at increased risk. GET YOUR DAILY SECURITY NEWS: Sign up for CSO's security newsletters \nAnother Windows security bulletin that should be prioritized is MS16-132 . It's rated critical and fixes multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities, including another zero-day flaw that, according Microsoft, is already being exploited by attackers. \nThe vulnerability is located in the Windows font library and can be exploited through specially crafted fonts embedded into websites or documents. Successful exploitation allows attackers to take full control of the affected systems, Microsoft said in the security bulletin. \nThree other critical vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Edge, covered in the MS16-142 and MS16-129 bulletins, have been publicly disclosed before being patched. However, according to Microsoft they haven't been exploited in attacks yet. \nThe Office security bulletin, MS16-133 , is rated as important, but covers remote code execution vulnerabilities that can be exploited through specially crafted documents. \n\"Since Office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environments I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as ‘Important',\" said Amol Sarwate, director of the Vulnerability Labs at security vendor Qualys, in an analysis of the patches. \nMicrosoft SQL Server administrators should prioritize the MS16-136 bulletin which covers vulnerabilities in the RDBMS engine, MDS API, SQL Analysis Services and the SQL Server Agent. \n\"SQL Server vulnerabilities are relatively rare and although there is no remote code execution, attackers can gain elevated privileges which could allow them to view, change, or delete data and create new accounts,\" Sarwate said.

      "text": "Doug Burgum, a former Microsoft executive and lifelong resident of North Dakota is now that state’s governor-elect. Burgum, a Republican, defeated a lightly funded Democrat, Marvin Nelson, and Libertarian Marty Riske by a wide margin, according to local news reports. \nBorn into a farming family in Arthur, Burgum attended North Dakota State University then Stanford Business School before founding Great Plains Software in 1981. He took that company, which specialized in accounting software, public in 1997 before selling to Microsoft msft four years later for $1.1 billion. He then led Microsoft’s business software charge before leaving in 2007. Burgum also helped fund the revitalization of downtown Fargo working with The Kilbourne Group, a company he founded.\nBurgum, who has never held public office, decided to run last year after the incumbent governor Jack Dalyrimple, a personal friend, decided not to re-up.\nFor more on Burgum, read “ This state could benefit from a former Microsott exec’s tech smarts. “ \nThe state which for years benefited from an energy boom in its northwestern region has seen harder times lately due to lower oil prices. There is a real need for diversification in that economy, Burgum told Fortune in an interview early this year, and that is something he thinks he can bring to bear as governor.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nBurgum also surprised many observers last May when he endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , citing the now president-elect’s outsider status as an advantage in an era where “the status quo isn’t working for many Americans.” Burgum also stressed his own business background as an advantage in helping the state negotiate a shifting economy.",

      "text": "Home / News / Software News / Microsoft finally fixes Windows flaw behind last week’s Google beef Microsoft finally fixes Windows flaw behind last week’s Google beef \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nMicrosoft has finally repaired the security flaw that led to a public spat with Google last week. \nIn a security bulletin issued today, Microsoft revealed that it had fixed a “critical” flaw that was being actively exploited by hackers. \n“This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows,” reads the bulletin . “The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.\" \nThe issue first came to public attention after Google revealed it had uncovered the flaw on October 31. Google actually warned Microsoft about the flaw privately, telling the software giant that it knew the exploit was being used by nefarious parties. In a blog post, Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard, of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, wrote: \n“After seven days, per our published policy for actively exploited critical vulnerabilities, we are today disclosing the existence of a remaining critical vulnerability in Windows for which no advisory or fix has yet been released. The vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited .” \nIt continued: “The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape.” \nThen, in a statement to VentureBeat, Microsoft revealed that it wasn’t happy with how Google handled the situation: \n“We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk. Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.” \nOn November 1, Microsoft Windows and Devices boss Terry Myerson acknowledged that Microsoft had recently detected a “low-volume speaker phishing campaign” from an “activity” group it called STRONTIUM – though the group is widely known as ‘Fancy Bear’. The group, which Microsoft blamed for exploiting the flaw, has previously been linked to the Russian government, and is accused of being behind the recent US election hacks. \nIn a blog post, Myerson wrote: \"STRONTIUM is an activity group that usually targets government agencies, diplomatic institutions, and military organisations, as well as affiliated private sector organisations such as defence contractors and public policy research institutes. Microsoft has attributed more 0-day exploits to STRONTIUM than any other tracked group in 2016.\"",

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 9, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Comments \nEarlier this year, Microsoft made a splash at its Ignite conference for IT professionals when it announced that it has been racking cards of programmable chips together with servers in its cloud data centers. \nThe chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), can be reconfigured after being deployed to optimize them for particular applications such as networking and machine learning. [ The InfoWorld review roundup: AWS, Microsoft, Databricks, Google, HPE, and IBM machine learning in the cloud . | TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nNow, Microsoft is investing in tools that would allow customers to program the FPGAs, said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft’s cloud and enterprise division, during a talk at the Structure conference in San Francisco. \nUsing those tools could help increase performance of workloads that the chips are deployed to tackle. Guthrie said he hopes businesses will see performance improvements between two or three orders of magnitude using FPGAs compared to CPUs or GPUs. \nThere are issues with just giving people raw access to the FPGAs, though. \n“When something goes wrong, you really need to be able to debug that quickly,” Guthrie said.”Because it’s hardware, it could brick the machine, there are lots of things that we’ve had to learn how to protect against.” \nThat said, there’s an advantage to be gained from using FPGAs for business applications. \nRight now, the FPGAs are being used to power Azure’s Accelerated Networking feature, as well as Microsoft products like Bing. They have the ability to radically speed up some computation. \nDoug Burger, a Microsoft researcher who helped spearhead the FPGA project, said that the company’s entire deployment could be used to translate all of English-language Wikipedia in a tenth of a second. \nActually writing code for the FPGAs is something that would likely appeal to a small subset of businesses.

      "text": "In a wide-ranging interview, Steve Ballmer this week was asked to explain what went wrong with Microsoft's smartphone business. He pointed to skepticism over iPhone carrier subsidies, but I have another idea.\nAs someone who was burned by the iPhone, I know why Microsoft screwed up. Since I was unable to secure any hands-on time with the iPhone prior to its release, I based the criticial columns I wrote about the device (April 2007: The iPhone Can't Live Up to Its Hype ) on the fiasco I saw with Microsoft phones.\nOnce I got my hands on an iPhone, my tune changed fast; I had to admit the device was a world changer. Not so for Microsoft; Ballmer had nothing good to say. It was peculiar. What was Ballmer not seeing?\nI am now convinced it had to do with Ballmer's personality and nothing more. Steve Ballmer, I will argue, is a neat freak. He is organized. Button down. He may yell and scream and seem slovenly, but really, he's just boisterous.\nHe probably had a Palm Pilot with a stylus, which were all the rage back in the day. When you visited many random Silicon Valley corporate headquarters, the reception desk would have a bowl of free styli for you to take, compliments of the house. \"Take a few\" was a common refrain; I still find them randomly around my house.\nUnlike the rest of us, Ballmer is probably the type of guy who never lost his stylus and scoffed at the notion of a touch-screen iPhone. Thus, he could not really understand its genius.",

      "text": "More \n\nToday we continue our walk through of setting up your new Microsoft Team site and after creating your team and adding channels for them to use the next step is to bring in data from other sources to make that information available in channels on your team site. \nConnectors are exactly what the name sounds like. They allow you to connect to various data sources and services and then automatically bring that information into a channel for your team to use. \nCurrently there are about 80 of these Connectors available for Microsoft Teams so here is a quick sampling of what you can use already on your team site: RSS Feeds to bring on content from a website. Bing News allows you to search for keywords and get alerts when they show up in the search engine. Twitter allows you to track mentions for certain accounts and also track hashtags. GitHub for collaborating on code based projects. Zendesk for managing trouble tickets and customer support. Google Analytics for tracking website traffic. \nOf course that list just scratches the surface of what is available and the list will get longer as developers begin building their own Connectors for their services. \nThe process of adding a Connector to one of your Microsoft Teams Channels will be the same for most services. After selecting to add your service you will be prompted to validate your credentials as necessary and then presented configuration options for that service. \nThis gallery will show you the process for adding an RSS feed to one of your Channels.",

      "title": "DxWnd improves classic PC game compatibility",
      "text": "DxWnd is a free program for Microsoft Windows operating systems designed to run fullscreen processes in windowed environments, and to manipulate those environments for better compatibility among other things.\nIf you have ever tried to run a classic PC game that runs fullscreen on a modern computer running Windows, you may have experienced several issues doing so provided that the game ran at all.\nFrom running too fast over low resolutions that look awful fullscreen to input or other compatibility issues. There is a lot that can go wrong. While there is Gog , a site dedicated to making classic PC games work on newer versions of Windows, the games it supports are limited and while compatibility is ensured, room for improvement is still there.\nDxWnd \nThe program is fully portable which means that you can run it from any location once you have downloaded the archive and extracted it to the local system.\nIt ships with profiles for a couple of games, e.g. Warcraft 2 Battlenet Edition, but the chance is high that the games that you want to control are not listed yet.\nA right-click in the interface and the selection of add from the context menu opens a massive configuration window that is used to add games to the program.\n\nYou need to add a name and path at the very least to get things going and this may be enough sometimes to play the game. The real strength however comes from millions of options and switches the application ships with.\nHere is a short list of options that it provides:\nSet screen resolution, color management and color settings. Configure input related settings, e.g. cursor visibility, slow down mouse polling or enable virtual joystick. Limits frames per second or system speed. Enable a huge list of compatibility features that include faking the Windows version, enabling Gog support, tweaking I/O settings, fixing colors, suppressing IME and a lot more. Select the DirectX version hook, emulation, and Direct3D tweaks on three tabs. Once you have added the game, you may run it by right-clicking it and selecting run from the context menu. The context menu offers other options beside that such as modifying the preferences, duplicating the settings, or exporting the configuration file.\nYou may want to take a look at the global settings first before you run games. They let you set various hot keys for handy functions.\n\nWant to slow down time or speed it up, toggle fps or limit textures? This can be done in the global settings menu.\nClosing Words DxWnd has been designed with games in mind, but it should work with any fullscreen application. The program offers a wide variety of compatibility options to improve classic game support on new machines running Windows.\nWhile it may take some tinkering to get it right considering that the configuration options are huge, it may be one of the best options to play classic games without compatibility issues.\nNow You : Do you play classic PC games on modern machines?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post DxWnd improves classic PC game compatibility appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Windows Is Not Genuine Scam Microsoft Windows Is Not Genuine Scam Also Known As: ShareCash ransomware Written by Tomas Meskauskas on Wednesday, 09 November 2016 06:42 AM \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\" virus removal guide What is \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\"? \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\" is a fake error message which locks victim's computer screen and states that the operating system (Windows) is not genuine. In order to return system to the previous state, victims must enter a Windows product key. Nevertheless, be aware that \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\" error (screenshot below) is fake. This error states that the system can only be restored by entering an activation key. However, note that entering a genuine key will not work. The displayed pop-up window contains a link (\" Click here to get your key \") which supposed to lead to a survey, which victims must complete in order to receive a \"product key\". However, the link currently redirects users to a pay-per-download website (\" ShareCash \" - completely legitimate and not related to this virus whatsoever) instead. In order to download a text file (which supposedly contains the product key) victims must pay a certain fee. Such behavior is rather uncommon for viruses like \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\". Most state that the system is infected (or damaged in any other way) and encourage victims to call \"Certified Technicians\" in order to receive help solving the problem. However, all these claims are merely attempts to trick victims into paying for the services that are not needed. You should never attempt to contact these persons, nor pay for any services (or, in this case, for a download). It is more than likely that you will be scammed. There are dozens of fake errors similar to \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\". Examples include Your Computer May be At Risk , Microsoft.Inc Warning! , Your Windows Has Been Banned , and many other. As mentioned, every single one attempts to scare users and trick them into paying. These viruses might be distributed alongside with adware/malware applications. However, cyber criminals usually spread them via malicious files attached to email spam, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks (Torrent, eMule, etc.) and other third party software download sources (free file hosting websites, freeware download sites, etc.), fake software updaters, and trojans. For this reason, you should never open any files received from suspicious/unrecognized email addresses. Moreover, never download any programs from unofficial sources. It is also noteworthy that cyber criminals are capable of exploiting software's bugs/flaws to infiltrate the system. For this reason, keeping installed applications up-to-date and using a legitimate anti-virus/anti-spyware suite is also very important. The key to computer safety is caution. \"Microsoft Windows is not genuine\" error message: \nThis copy of Microsoft Windows is not genuine.To use all Microsoft Windows features, such as all updates from Windows Update; get the latest updates; and receive product support, your copy of Microsoft Windows must be validated as genuine.As a new step to security (to continue using Microsoft Windows), we require you to complete a survey for a new product code.

      "text": "Microsoft's Scorpio will make it possible for developers to make games for just one platform: the UWP. That should mean better PC ports for Windows gamers and even the potential for console versus PC wars like never before. More Microsoft is looking to turn its upcoming Xbox Scorpio into a keystone in its Universal Windows Platform (UWP) system, having it play those games at up to 4K resolutions natively. This means no more console exclusives from Microsoft, as any game developed for the UWP platform will work on Windows 10 PCs, Scorpio, and the Xbox One without much difficulty.\nMicrosoft’s UWP system has been a major drive for a while now, with the idea being that it creates a single ecosystem that spans consoles, PCs, mobile and even the HoloLens augmented reality headsets. Scorpio will be a major component in that mix, as it will not only deliver monstrous power for console gaming, but also act as a developmental platform for games and experiences on other hardware, too.\nThis is because Scorpio is a clever piece of kit. As explained by Windows Central sources , Scorpio will be able to mimic an Xbox One at a hardware level, so developing games on a Scorpio will make it incredibly easy to test those titles on an Xbox One too. We’re told that this system has an internal code name: Project Helix.\nRelated: Microsoft’s Phil Spencer teases the pricing window of 2017’s Project Scorpio\nWhile great news for developers, this also means that we may finally see an end of poor quality PC ports. By bringing the Scorpio up to the (purportedly) 6 teraflops level, it is just as capable as many decent gaming systems, so games developed for either should work fine on the other. Even a couple of years down the road when PC hardware has advanced beyond it again, the fact that Scorpio is built on the UWP should mean that upgrading the visuals and frame rates for PC gamers will be much easier than before as well.\nOf course releasing games through the Windows Store hasn’t gone so well in every instance . Microsoft may need to get people over that problematic stigma before the UWP platform is completely embraced, but with the way Scorpio is being positioned, that might be easier than we’d have expected. It’s also possible that Microsoft doesn’t try and target the PC gaming space as much as it tries to augment the Xbox market with additional PC play and features.\nIf it tries to take the fight to Steam to push people to its store instead, it will need to step up its game.\nDell preps its own Surface Studio-inspired creativity workstation A wireless solution for the HTC Vive could be ready in time for Chrismas Ed Boon hints at PC release for 'Mortal Kombat XL'",

      "text": "A patent that was made public last week seems to suggest that Microsoft is working on ways to enhance the conversational abilities of Cortana by giving her greetings a bit more of a human touch. More Microsoft developed its personal assistant, Cortana, as a method of making its computers and smartphones a little bit more personal. Now, a new patent may have unveiled how the company plans to make the virtual assistant engage in more natural conversation with users.\nIn April, Microsoft filed for a patent with the title Providing Personalized Greetings on a Digital Assistant. The purpose of this technology is seemingly to allow Cortana to deliver more personalized greetings based on user-specific and contextual pieces of information, according to a report from MS Power User .\n“A goal of the personalized greeting system described herein is to mimic a human experience with the user,” reads the application, which was made public on November 3. “Providing the same greeting to the user twice in one day is not typical of how the user would be greeted by a human.”\nMore: Some Windows Insiders report Cortana is getting some secret upgrades\nThe documentation goes on to give an example where Cortana might peek at a user’s personal information in order to give them a happy birthday message on the appropriate date. The patent also describes a mechanism where the assistant would know not to repeat that message a second time, even if the user had transitioned to another Windows 10 device.\nA ranking system would be used to prioritize different greetings based on information related to the user’s interests. News content like the performance of a particular sports team, or a local weather forecast, would also feed into the range of greetings Cortana would have access to.\nIt certainly seems like Cortana is set to receive an upgrade to her conversational skills in the not-too-distant future — but it’s less clear when this functionality will be introduced. It’s possible that it could be part of the Creators Update scheduled for March, but we already know that Microsoft has more than one major Windows 10 update planned for next year, so we might have to wait a little longer.\nSome Windows Insiders report Cortana is getting some secret upgrades Everything you need to know about Google Assistant Many Windows 10 users won’t see Anniversary Update until November",

      "text": "  \nIn our modern world where cyber breaches are becoming ever so more common, cyber security is very important. It is fitting then that Microsoft has just announced that it has launched a new Security Updates Guide in order to provide its customers with better security updates information. \nThe new guide marks the company’s commitment to bringing comprehensive security updates to customers and comes after many asked for better access to update information, and simpler ways to customize and view security related information. The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) investigates all reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services, and provides this information as part of the ongoing effort to help you manage security risks and help keep your systems protected. \nSeen here , this month’s Security Updates Guide is now in a single destination. According to Microsoft, the new portal will “let customers search security vulnerabilities in a single online database.” Uses for the portal include: Sort and filter security vulnerability and update content, for example, by CVE, KB number, product, or release date. Filter out products that don’t apply to you, and drill down to more detailed security update information for products that do. Leverage a new RESTful API to obtain Microsoft security update information. This eliminates the need for you to employ outdated methods like screen-scraping of security bulletin web pages to assemble working databases of necessary and actionable information. \nIt is worth noting that Security updates will continue to be pushed on both the Security Bulletin and the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. According to Microsoft, after the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, update information will only be pushed to the Security Updates Guide.  ",

      "text": "\nBack in 2003, the city of Munich announced its plans to switch from Microsoft Windows to Linux on 14,000 PCs which were under usage at municipal government. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer flew to Munich to meet the mayor to reverse their decision. But they declined Steve Ballmer’s request and completed their plan in December 2013. The sad news is that the end users were not so happy with Linux and the government was also not happy with the price savings it offered when compared to Windows.\nToday, TechRepublic reported that Munich is planning to move back to Microsoft Windows and Office on its PCs. As per the report commissioned by current mayor Dieter Reiter, they have started a project to make Windows 10 and Microsoft Office available to employees as a choice when they choose their PC. If majority of the users liked Windows over Linux, they will investigate whether it makes economic sense to continue using Linux as a client operating system.\nThe city’s human resources department (POR) is particularly critical of LiMux, saying that since 2006 when the POR started using LiMux and OpenOffice, later switching to LibreOffice, that “the efficiency and productivity of the POR-supported workplaces has decreased noticeably” – referencing crashes, display and printing errors.\n“Even 10 years after the start of the LiMuX migration, the users and users of the POR are dissatisfied,” says the letter, claiming that, even after updates, LiMux and LibreOffice are “far behind the current technical possibilities of established standard solutions”.\nRead more about this story here . Recently, we reported that Microsoft has reached an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Defence to deploy Windows 10 on all the PCs of ministry’s civil and military employees. Looks like Windows on the desktop is becoming stronger than ever. What do you think?",

      "text": "As investors navigate through Donald Trump's shocking victory against Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election, there may already be potential winners and losers within the technology universe. Behemoths with international revenue streams are likely to be hurt by the Trump presidency while cybersecurity stocks can anticipate a boost, according to industry analysts.\nShort-term, movements in currency will affect companies with international revenue streams, Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson said by phone, adding that this has been a point of contention since the Brexit vote for companies with exposure to the pound. Salesforce.com ( CRM ) , for instance, translates its European revenue to the pound.\nNelson explained that long-term, potential changes to international trade agreement may hurt hardware manufacturers that source components from overseas such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) .\n\"While it may take time for the election results to change the overall demand environment, given valuations of many growth software names, we think the software market could trade with a multiple to the market,\" wrote RBC Capital Markets analysts Matthew Hedberg and Ross MacMillan in a note Tuesday night.\nTrump's victory may lead to a short-term pause in IT spending against the backdrop of weak equity markets, Hedberg and MacMillan further noted.\nTrump's exclusionist philosophy could bode well for U.S.-centric software companies such as Intuit ( INTU ) , Ultimate Software Group ( ULTI ) and Paylocity Holding ( PCTY ) , according to the analysts. On the flip side, it could hurt geographically diverse behemoths like Microsoft, Oracle ( ORCL ) , SAP ( SAP ) and VMware ( VMW ) .",

      "text": "Microsoft Testing \nIt’s fun taking something for a test drive. \nIn a society that thrives on instant feedback, the opportunity to give people early access to the latest operating system or software build is invaluable to the tech industry. Insider programs and previews are an accepted means of making sure that everything is good to go, with the leading brands relying on outside feedback to find and fix bugs. \nThrough its existing Insider programs, Microsoft has actively sought out the help of the “technically-able” to install and play with preview versions. Both Windows and Office Insider programs have recruited millions of non-developers who are eager to take future products for a test drive and stay ahead of the game. \nThis week, Microsoft added two more elements to its suite of Insider programs—Xbox and Skype. \nAccording to Microsoft’s Major Nelson blog , the Xbox Insider Program will be available to all Xbox One owners, with the program initially rolled out to people who have provided the most feedback through Microsoft’s existing Xbox Preview Program. The preview program was launched in February 2014, but focused mainly on system updates and not games or apps. \nA two-year successful feedback rate for the preview program is the main reason for it morphing into the Xbox Insider Program. Microsoft said that the change in name reflected how important the Xbox was to the company, with the program now personalized to the individual tester. Listen to the Voice of Your Customers Improve Your Customer Experience With App Store Analytics Get It Now \nThe upgrade shifts the onus from just system updates to include selected games and apps. A new user interface will make it easier for testers to find the right information and provide “robust feedback,” Microsoft said. The Xbox Insider Program will not be limited to single users on a console but will provide support for multiple feedback channels. \nXbox Insiders are eligible for previews based on a number of factors that include previous activities, tenure in existing preview programs and their overall interests. Anyone who was registered to the Xbox Preview Program will be automatically upgraded to the new Insider Program. \nTesters who have their Xbox One in Instant-on mode and have the Xbox Preview Dashboard app installed will not have to do anything, as the app will automatically update. The system updates are limited to those already testing them and are not open to new members (for the moment). \nMore details on the Xbox Insider Program can be found here . Early Feedback Is Essential Part Of Testing \nThe Skype preview program is slightly different. ARS Technica reported that the program is more draconian than the other Insider programs as it requires people to actually sign up as opposed to turning on a button in the operating system. \nAccording to the Skype Community page, Skype Insiders will have early access to software and service updates that will encourage Skype to “iron out any quirks before we release them broadly.” \nTesters will have to agree to the Skype Insider Program Terms when they sign-up, which then allows them to install the Skype Insiders app. Once people are signed up, they will have to abide by what appears to be a non-disclosure agreement as the Skype team wants to keep any potential improvements to itself. \n“As a Skype Insider you can become part of the Skype journey. We are working hard to improve the way you communicate with those who mean most,” said the Skype Team. “Whether it’s a group video call, 1-1 audio call or just sending the latest Moji, we are focusing on improving the ease of use and reliability of Skype, but we need your help.” \nFull details of the Skype preview program can be accessed here . \nInterested in staying up to date with daily or weekly ARC articles?

Jackal shields are not different for Major and Minor, and do not change color as they get damaged (which were probably problems that the bitmaps and animations weren't loaded, from a release-time perspective), stationary shields have a different appearance, the reflection of some weapons reduced their strength, and Shades change as well.

      "text": "Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan (Investor's Business Daily) \nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which is perpetually in the spotlight, now has one more reason to be in the news. Ireland is set to formally table its appeal against the multi-billion-euro fine imposed by the European Commission on the company in late August this year. \nIrish Finance Minister Michael Noonan reportedly told a European Parliament Committee that the appeal would be submitted on Thursday, given his government's fundamental opposition to the European Commission's determination. In September, the Irish Cabinet said it would join forces with Apple in taking on the Commission's verdict. The Case History \nFollowing a three-year investigation, the European Commission has deemed that the Irish government has granted undue tax benefits of up to 13 billion euros to the U.S. technology giant. According to the Commission, the allowance is illegal and is against the spirit of the EU state aide rules, giving Apple the advantage of underpayment on taxes relative to other companies. \n\"Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies — this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014,\" Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said in a statement. \nApple had said then it will fight the case. Why Irish Heart Is Bleeding For Apple \nGranted, the development would engender resentment in Apple and probably among its stakeholders, too. Why should Ireland take up cudgels on behalf of Apple? The logic is this: Ireland has vested interest in keeping multi-national companies on its shores and consequently is out to defend the tax regime that has lured many foreign companies into its soil with favorable tax deals. This in turn has kept the domestic economy chiming with more jobs and investment. \nAt time of publication, Apple was down 2.21 percent at $108.61. \nImage Credit: By MaryG90 (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 or GFDL] via Wikimedia Commons © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Q. I’ve always used a Windows desktop for all my business needs. My heart is with Microsoft Office, and I need to upgrade my computer, but I really dislike Windows 10. Aside from buying a Mac with Microsoft Office, can you suggest any alternatives that won’t break the bank? A. If you do not care for Windows 10 but want to stick with Microsoft Office, the Mac and the macOS version of Office would probably provide the most familiarity. But if the Mac option is too expensive and you dislike Windows 10 enough to avoid it completely, you might consider switching to an alternative operating system, like a computer running Linux or a Google Chromebook . These systems often have the advantage of being less expensive than standard PC or Mac hardware, but they may require an internet connection to perform many functions. Photo The free Office Online extension in the Google Chrome store provides a shortcut menu for files stored on Microsoft OneDrive. Credit The New York Times The desktop version of Microsoft Office is available only for Windows and Mac, so if you pick a different computer platform, you will need to find an alternative to Office. The web-based Office Online software works in many browsers — including Firefox for Linux and Google Chrome — but it does not include the full range of features found in Microsoft Word or the other applications in the traditional desktop suite. If you rely on tools in the full Office package, you may want to sample the online edition to see if it will meet your needs. Other office-software suites are available, too. If you absolutely want to install the programs on your computer and not have to rely on browser-based versions, LibreOffice is available for many Linux variations (like Ubuntu and Linux Mint ), as is Apache OpenOffice . Both suites can open, edit and save files in Microsoft Office formats, although you may see some quirks with document conversions. If you do not mind browser-based programs, Google Docs and Zoho Docs are two options that also offer free online storage for your files. Both can open and edit Office files and let you get to your stored files from mobile devices. Standard file formats like JPG photos, MP3 audio files and PDF documents work on just about any desktop or mobile operating system these days. However, if you use other programs and less-common file types on your current Windows machine (aside from Microsoft Office), be sure to check for equivalents on the new system of your choice. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

      "title": "Why Microsoft is going all-in on AI",
      "text": "Why Microsoft is going all-in on AI Microsoft has positioned artificial intelligence as being as important as Windows, Office and Cloud. Here's why.   7:14 AM PT   \nMicrosoft is betting on artificial intelligence (AI) with the creation at the end of September of a new AI and Research Group. This newly formed group brings together Microsoft's research organization and more than 5,000 computer scientists and engineers focused on AI and is now the fourth major division in the company, on par with the Windows, Office and Cloud divisions. \nThe job of the AI and Research Group will be to work on four overarching initiatives: Harnessing AI through agents such as Cortana, the company's digital personal assistant Infusing AI into Skype, Office 365 and every other Microsoft application Making cognitive capabilities such as vision and speech and machine analytics available to external developers Using Azure to build a powerful AI supercomputer in the cloud to provide \"AI as a Service” \n[ Get ready for the bot revolution ] AI tidal wave \nWhen Microsoft talks of \"infusing\" every application with AI, it's reminiscent of the famous \"Internet Tidal Wave\" email Bill Gates sent to all staff in 1995. In it, Gates outlined his desire to focus the company's efforts on the internet with immediate effect and told them to \"assign the internet the highest level of importance\" in everything that they did henceforth. \nIs the creation of the AI and research group effectively a \"tidal wave\" message? Does Microsoft boss Satya Nadella believe that AI should be assigned the highest level of importance to everything the company does? \nRob Sanfilippo, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft and former Microsoft employee, doesn’t think so. \"Nadella is certainly trying to make some marks on the company and AI is the latest mark he is trying to make, but no, this not as much a pivotal moment as the Gates email and the internet,\" says Sanfilippo. \nHis reasoning is that AI has become over-hyped. \"I don't entirely believe all the prognostications that have been made about AI. Some of it is real and will be successful, but some things will never come to fruition,\" he says. \nAnd although Microsoft has talked enthusiastically about agents and bot frameworks, the practical value of these technologies is doubtful, he believes. \"These are really just bits of technology that look good in demos,\" he says. The Cortana problem \nMicrosoft seems to be banking on Cortana being one of the key ways its customers access AI in the future. (The company also offers Cortana Intelligence Suite for businesses and developers to add machine learning, image recognition and other intelligent capabilities to their own applications.) \nThe problem, Sanfilippo says, is that Cortana is not actually very good at what it does. \"I do think there are problems with Cortana,\" he says. \"It came from an Xbox character, and then it became a phone entity, and then it came to Windows 10. It looks good, but it is very weak and in the real world it has not had the adoption that Microsoft claims.\" \nAnecdotally, Sanfilippo suggests that many people find Cortana gets in the way of work and does not actually do what they want. \"Eighty percent of the time it just searches the web for what I want. It bugs me that Microsoft talks about it as a success when most people probably just get annoyed by it,\" he says. \nThe danger for Microsoft is that a rival assistant such as Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant becomes the de-facto standard way for end users to access AI services and enterprise AI systems. If that happens, Cortana could become the digital assistant equivalent of Windows Phone: a largely irrelevant entity that few people use and even fewer developers bother integrating with. \nSanfilippo points out that many investments in AI have been written off in the past, so there's a very real risk that Microsoft could abandon Cortana in two or three years' time. Strong in the cloud \nThe good news for Microsoft is that even if Cortana is relatively weak, it has a very real competitive advantage in the cloud, where it can harness the computing power of Azure to do intensive computational AI work (such as translating all 1,440 pages of War and Peace from Russian to English in 2.5 seconds.) It can also offer this power to third parties. \nAnd with its $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn, Microsoft also has access to a social graph of over 425 million business users. This puts it in a strong position when it comes to offering services based on the combination of AI and social networks — for example by providing customers with a personal newsfeed based on the projects they are working on, or enabling Office to suggest experts to connect with via LinkedIn. Fear of missing out \nDavid Schubmehl, a research director at IDC, takes a more sanguine view of Microsoft's AI efforts, and says that AI – agents and all – will be central to everything that Microsoft does in a relatively short space of time. \"I think as time goes on all enterprise software will have AI functionality, and we are already seeing the green shoots of that,\" he says. \nBut, like Sanfilippo, he thinks that some of what Microsoft is saying is motivated by the desire to ensure that it doesn't get left behind. \"Four years ago IBM was the only one doing cognitive and AI. Then Google talked about embedding AI into everything. Then Salesforce made its Einstein announcements and Oracle talked about Adaptive Intelligence. That's why Microsoft has established this new division — but I do think it sees AI as where the computing world is moving to.\" \nMicrosoft got left behind when the mobile computing revolution took off, and it's only now that it has begun recovering from that by concentrating on getting its applications and services on iOS and Android. It may well be that, more than anything else, it's the fear of getting left behind in an AI revolution — if it ever comes to pass — that is what's driving the company to embrace AI technology. \nIn other words, the company may not be absolutely sure that an AI tidal wave is about to hit, but it's determined to be prepared for one, just in case.

      "text": "Share \nToday’s post was written by Ron Markezich, corporate vice president for Microsoft. \nToday, providing security on any front requires a willingness to adopt leading-edge technologies. So it’s great to see the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in the United Kingdom assume a leadership role in their decision to adopt the Microsoft Cloud, as well as Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection and Customer Lockbox from a Microsoft U.K. data center. \nAccording to Mike Stone, chief digital and information officer (CDIO) at the Ministry of Defence, Microsoft cloud services bring world-class reliability and performance to its operations in a way that fits perfectly with its digital transformation agenda: “The MOD chose Microsoft cloud technologies to support our transition to a more cost-effective, modern and agile organisation. Microsoft offers the security, privacy, control and transparency that meets our stringent criteria for cloud services—all available from data centres in the U.K. Additional cloud-based services such as Advanced Threat Protection provide us with complementary capabilities to keep our employees productive and our network secure.” \nMike’s statement resonates with any highly regulated government entity that must find the right balance between enabling employees with anytime, anywhere data access while ensuring security. \nNow that more than 95,000 MOD mailboxes will be protected with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, staff will stay productive and secure around the clock. That’s because, despite the escalating severity and complexity of today’s malware, Advanced Threat Protection offers better protection and control. Additionally, with Customer Lockbox, the MOD gets full visibility and control of their customer data during service operations, which can help them meet compliance obligations. \nAligning its vision for digital transformation with the Microsoft Cloud, the MOD gets the best of both worlds—productivity-enhancing agility in a highly secure online environment. I’m happy to see that by empowering staff to achieve its goals in our rapidly evolving digital world, the MOD is entering a new era of heightened performance—at home and abroad. \n—Ron Markezich",

The malware is called BrowserModifier:Win32/Soctuseer and is be installed when downloading software from third-party websites. \nComputers infected by Soctuseer will show advertisements with discounted or lower prices, related to the product that the user is searching from popular online shopping websites. The advertisements have the attribution name of “Social2Search”. For example, if an user searches for “tablet”, Soctuseer will show pop-up advertisements for tablets on other websites. \nThe malware is able to do its job in all major browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Edge because it uses a NetFilter driver and directly injects a DLL into the browser’s process. Soctuseer also has rootkit capabilities to conceal its presence on a computer. \nMicrosoft discovered 1.2 million computers that are infected with Soctuseer, mainly in the United States, Indonesia and India. \nThese computers were automatically cleaned by the built-in Windows tool Malcious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) during yesterday’s Patch Tuesday. When updates are installed, MSRT automatically scans the computer for malware and removes any malware it finds. Related Forum:",

      "text": "Microsoft Project Scorpio E3 2016 Unveiling Was Prompted by PS4 Pro Leak; Console Can Play 4K UWP PC Games By Bruce Berkowitz ,   08:44 am Microsoft is planning to launch a new console which is currently known as Project Scorpio to rival the PlayStation 4 Pro.(Photo : TechoWin) \nDespite having been previously showed to a few developers, Microsoft was forced to unveil Project Scorpio E3 2016 that can play 4K UWP PC games. This untimely unveiling was prompted by Sony's constant PS4 Pro leaks on the Internet, which was known as \"Neo.\" Advertisement \nNow, Microsoft's Project Scorpio E3 2016 will be hardwired with the ability to play 4K UWP games from the PC with such titles as \"Forza Horizon 3\" and \"Gears of War 4\" as the primary picks. The native reference is in connection with the Windows 10 UWP games being able to run easily on different platforms but not in the 4K resolution. Game developers and console designers only need to create small changes to let UWP games to work on Project Scorpio E3 2016. \nMicrosoft is going to have a one-stop shop development kit when it comes to configuring the Project Scorpio platform. The kit will let developers run games on varied configurations that include an Xbox One mode that will replicate the console's performance. \nMicrosoft also announced that Project Scorpio will be backwards compatible with the Xbox One S and gamers can use the same controllers and tools with the console. PC graphics cards that are priced at around $400 are still struggling with 2160p. That's why the Microsoft Project Scorpio 4K news is very surprising. The resolution is very demanding on the hardware and it's four times as sharp running at 1080p. \nMicrosoft also added during the announcement that the new console will give gamers a new level of experience and Project Scorpio will have a performance target of 60fps. This will give a huge graphic boost to most of today's current video game titles. \nMost UWP games on PC have connection support to Xbox features so there will be less transition work to be done when transferring PC UWP games to new Xbox consoles. The Microsoft Project Scorpio will be able to detect the hardware creating the runtime request and unload the right game assets quickly. \nThe new \"Call of Duty\" game available on Microsoft's Windows 10 store is also using the new Project Scorpio system in preparation for the arrival of the new console. Other games such as \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\" and \"ReCore\" are also using the system on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox One. \n  Related Articles",

      "text": "Wednesday, November 09, 2016 Mohit Kumar Microsoft was very upset with Google last week when its Threat Analysis Group publically disclosed a critical Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2016-7255) that had yet to be patched. The company criticized Google's move , claiming that the disclosure of the vulnerability, which was being exploited in the wild, put its customers \"at potential risk.\" The vulnerability affects all Windows versions from Windows Vista through current versions of Windows 10, and Microsoft was set to issue a fix come this month's Patch Tuesday. So, as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday, Microsoft today patched the security flaw in Windows that was actively being exploited by hackers. According to Microsoft's security bulletin released today, any hacker who tricked victims into running a \"specially-crafted application\" could successfully exploit the system bug and gain the ability to \"install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\" Once exploited, the bug could be used to escape the sandbox protection and execute malicious code on the compromised Windows machine. Rated as \"important,\" the vulnerability was being exploited by Strontium group, also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, and APT 28, in targeted attacks. Fancy Bear is the same group of hackers that has also been accused by the US Intelligence community of hacking the Democratic National Committee , Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta , and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, among others. Besides this controversial flaw exposed by Google last week, the security bulletin also fixes multiple elevation of privilege bugs. Patch Tuesday also contains several critical security patches that affect all versions of Windows as well as other important updates and fixes for both Internet Explorer and Edge. So, I strongly recommend home users and companies to ensure that their Windows PC is up-to-date with all of Microsoft's latest security fixes as of today.",

      "text": "DVD Microsoft’s Black Friday Deal Looks Kinda Desperate \nMicrosoft's strategy to win Black Friday seems to be a bundle that doesn't really make sense. In the UK, you can now buy the Xbox One S FIFA 17 with select Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book models. This is the 500GB bundle that includes a copy of the game, and one month of EA Access, worth £249. Only the mid-to-high range models apply. For instance, for the Surface Book anything above the basic 128GB / i5 – 8GB ram model includes a free Xbox One S. For the Surface Pro 4, you get the bundle with all models also above 128GB, so basically starting with the 256GB / i5 – 8GB ram model, all the way to most expensive one. This offer is valid from now until November 9. \nI don't know about your thoughts, but the Surface Pro 4 and the Xbox One S don't have a lot in common. If the Surface Pro 4 was a more powerful computer that you could play more than basic games on, this might make more sense. But it really isn't, it is not a computer recommended for gamers at all. This is probably only a great deal if you're a wealthy parent looking to buy their child a new computer for university. I mean, as a new student to have both the means to do all my school work and game when I'm done sounds awesome. In addition to getting it all for free from the parents? Hell yes, count me in. Advertisement   \nAs someone who is quite done with school, however, and already has a pretty decent computer to work on, the bundle makes less sense. If I was looking for a computer though, neither the Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book are at all tempting. Both are more or less the same price as a Macbook Air and do almost exactly the same things. I'm also not sure how durable a Surface Pro 4 is in comparison, but that's besides the point. A Chrome Notebook could achieve the same usage and it comes with a keyboard. You'd have plenty of money left over to buy yourself an Xbox One S for under the cost of the bundle Microsoft is offering. \nIt is my opinion that this bundle reeks of desperation to sell both the Xbox One S and Surface Pro 4. The Xbox One S has been doing fairly well, but after the 200 million goal announcement, it is clearly not up to Microsoft's standards. The Surface Pro 4 has had a plethora of decidedly average reviews and even less of a success in sales. This is likely due to the strong similarities between it and the Macbook Air for nearly the same price. \nThat said, the bundle might help Microsoft sell more of both simply because the soccer season just ended last month and the holidays are coming. Soccer fans, to say the least, are quite attached to their sport and what better way to continue the fun than to play FIFA 17 on the Xbox One S? Then play on-the-go with the Surface Pro 4 with Microsoft's new Play Anywhere feature! Except that the Surface Pro 4 is reportedly not great at handling games. It runs hot and slows down frame rate about half an hour in. \nThis bundle is yet another desperate marketing gimmick from Microsoft and has absolutely no chance against Sony's upcoming games and PS4 Pro. I can tell you right now, Sony is going to bundle Horizon Zero Dawn with the PS4 Pro and that game looks phenomoinal no matter what screen you have it on. Mechanical dinosaurs are going to sell that console, not some average computer with a fancy touchscreen. Or soccer for that matter, no matter what season it is. The Xbox One S and Surface Pro 4 bundle might be a one-off deal, but again, judging by that 200 million goal I think Microsoft is going to be taking every chance it can to sell just a few more Xboxs. Even bundling them with vastly unrelated electronics.",

They can tell users to not click links or open attachments until the end of time, but users will still click bad links. That's why admins have to take action to nip problems in the bud before they happen. \nNew endpoint security controls and threat intelligence products emerge every day. With all the complexity, confusion and high price tags surrounding the topic, it pays to be picky. Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) , a free Windows-based security tool, is one of the best options not a lot of people know about. How EMET works \nMicrosoft's EMET helps minimize software security risks for most versions of Windows going back to Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2. The tool adds a layer of security onto programs to prevent the exploitation of both known and unknown ( zero-day ) vulnerabilities. \nEMET's threat mitigation techniques include advanced antimalware controls such as: Attack surface reduction , which allows admins to implement policy-based controls to minimize the vulnerabilities associated with plug-ins such as Adobe Reader and Java; Address space layout randomization , which loads modules into random memory locations to minimize attack predictability; Heap spray allocation security mitigation, which preloads common memory locations to help prevent known shell code from loading; Load library check , which prevents calls to libraries from Universal Naming Convention paths; Memory protection check , which prevents the memory stack area from being an executable area attackers can exploit. \nHere is a look at the EMET menu: A look at the EMET menu \nAdmins can run Microsoft EMET in a stand-alone mode to protect specific executable files or deploy it across their entire network by manually installing it on each system using Windows Group Policy or System Center Configuration Manager . Because it requires such hands-on deployment, it can be hard to deploy throughout an entire large organization. Still, there are plenty of uses for EMET in small and medium-sized businesses as well as niche areas in larger enterprises. \nLike all other security controls, Microsoft's EMET is not a one-stop, quick-fix to Windows risks. Microsoft makes no guarantees that EMET prevents vulnerabilities from exploitation, but it claims it makes attacks less likely. It's still on admins to fix the basic security flaws , such as weak passwords, that keep getting so many people into trouble. Furthermore, Microsoft EMET can cause problems, including app compatibility issues, so be sure to test it in a controlled environment like any other piece of software. \nIf Microsoft's EMET is not a good fit, there are plenty of other advanced malware and threat mitigation products to choose from. The important thing is for admins to be proactive, before security issues become an even greater challenge for their businesses tomorrow.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has recently released build 14929 for the Windows 10 Insider Preview version of the operating system, and wasted no time before starting their newest endeavor. Over the course of the next couple of days, Windows users that are part of the Windows Insider program are invited to participate in a series of quests to help Windows developers identify and clear all the bugs they can find by submitting their findings in the feedback hub. \nThrough a message on Twitter, Microsoft official Dona Sarkar announced that the Bug Bash initiative for Windows Insiders is officially underway and even took the time to mention what parts of the operating system are targeted for heavy surveillance. The elements that she pointed out were Windows Ink, Creating, 3D and last but not least, Developers. \nThe official closing time for Bug Bash will be 11:59 PM PST, November 13 th . According to Microsoft, there will be quests that will have users investigate certain elements of the operating system and help them find the bugs. \nQuests are placed into separate categories, depending on their difficulty and intricacy. While some quests are easier to complete, some might require a little bit more advanced knowledge about the specific niche that the quest is investigating, so users are advised to not attempt taking on quests of difficulty levels they cannot grasp. Microsoft says that a user must be able to troubleshoot their way back to safety if something goes wrong during a quest, so that in the end their system integrity isn’t jeopardized. \nThe quests are scheduled to rotate so that they may be brought back during the weekend for a second round of testing for maximized results. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Update KB3197873 improves security in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2",
      "text": "0 0 \nAnother month, another Patch Tuesday . As usual, Microsoft released many updates for every supported version of Windows. Windows 10 updates perhaps drew the biggest attention, but some older versions of the system received interesting patches as well. \nUsers who are still on Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 received the new security update KB3197873. The update resolves various vulnerabilities in the mentioned operating systems, and improve the overall security. \nHere’s the complete list of resolved vulnerabilities in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2: \nMS16-142 Cumulative security update for Internet Explorer: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-140 Security update for boot manager: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-138 Security update to Microsoft virtual hard drive: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-137 Security update for Windows authentication methods: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-135 Security update for Windows kernel-mode drivers: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-134 Security update for common log file system driver: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-132 Security update for Microsoft graphics component: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-131 Security update for Microsoft Video Control: November 8, 2016 \nMS16-130 Security update for Microsoft Windows: November 8, 2016 \nAs you can see from the changelog, the update improves the security of many Windows features, including Internet Explorer, Microsoft virtual hard drive, Microsoft graphics component, and more.

      "text": "0 0 \nBack in March, Microsoft revealed a few of its devices that would be receiving a Windows 10 Mobile upgrade . So, owners of the Lumia 640 XL should now be pleased to know that their device was among the approved list and should head straight to its system settings to check for the software upgrade that has just been released. \nAT&T first released the news of the update’s approval on their Community Forums page which has now arrived seven months after of the Lumia 640 XL’s release. The AT&T cares Administrator stated that users would need to opt in and download the Windows Upgrade Advisor application to receive the upgrade. The app is used to perform a basic check on the device to enable users to download and install the upgrade. Though AT&T passed the approval in early June, it is still not known why the release took another five months to be released to the Lumia 640 XL . \nBecause of this, users of the handset were not notified about the upgrade finally being available. The news of the Lumia 64o XL upgrade resurfaced within 24 hours of its release in a post on Reddit . But nonetheless, with no official notification generated on the device, many users are still unaware of the newly released update. Seems like Microsoft is waiting for Windows 10 users to find out about the upgrade for on their own. \nThe new OS upgrades the device to version 14393.321, and has flooded the device with tons of new features, \n“Update summary Effective October 27, 2016, AT&T and Microsoft released a software update for the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL. You can download the update via Firmware Over The Air (FOTA). A Wi-Fi connection is required for the update.” \nFor users who still don’t have the Upgrade Advisor running on their devices, head over to this link .",

      "text": "0 0 \nJune’s E3 conference 2016 had gamers jumping with anticipation when Microsoft revealed the possible release of an Xbox Streaming Stick which would let Xbox One owners stream their games to another TV and play them using an Xbox controller. \nEarlier this year, blogger Brad Sams revealed the possible release of Microsoft’s two Xbox streaming devices on his podcast, which would be about the size of a Chromecast and a larger one which would run a scaled-down version of Windows 10 capable of wirelessly streaming Xbox One games and also running simple UWP apps and games. Along with these, the Xbox Streaming Stick was also stated to be capable of streaming Project Scorpio over your home WiFi, presumably via the Windows 10 Xbox app. \nBut not all tech speculations translate into actual products, so it should some as little surprise when Microsoft’s Xbox streaming stick never arrived. It was reported that more than 300,000 pre-orders for the appliance were received after E3 2016, before the ‘Project Hobart’ was suddenly canceled or postponed. \n‘Hobart’ was the codename for Microsoft’s Xbox Streaming stick, and what the internet does best, speculated that the sudden canning of the project has something to do with the release of Playstation 4 Pro. The actual reason for the scrapped Project Hobart remains unknown and Microsoft is yet to make a comment on the matter. All in all Project Hobart ended up on the same mound as the Microsoft’s Surface Mini, which was a 7-inch tablet powered by the unpopular Windows RT and the Microsoft Band 3 . \nProject Hobart, if released, would have been priced $99, comparatively with Amazon’s Fire TV Stick costs $32.99, Google’s Chromecast retails for $35, and the new Chromecast Ultra for 4K streaming is $69 the price seems quite steep but considering the gamers owning an Xbox One, may find it more than reasonable. Given the large disparity in rates between similar products, it almost seems like killing off Project Hobart was a smart move. As for Microsoft, they should clearly focus on introducing more cheaper and reasonable Xbox and Windows 10 products.",

      "text": "Microsoft Cortana — a virtual assistant picking the winner of every NFL game on Bing — had its best week of the season in Week 9, correctly picking 10 of the 13 games on the docket. The solid picking brought its overall record to 74-57 (56%). \nCortana's three misses were the three biggest upsets of the week: the Vikings and Packers wer both home favorites, and the Broncos were a pick-em against the Raiders in Oakland. \nStill, a 10-3 showing marks a notable uptick in success this season for the Microsoft algorithm. We'll be watching to see if it continues to trend in a positive direction. \nThis week, Cortana and Vegas in in total agreement. There are some especially good games, however, including the Seahawks at the Patriots and the Cowboys at the Steelers. In both, the home teams are favored. \nAs always, Cortana only picks the outright winner of each game. It does not make picks against the spread, though we like to include the point spread (in parentheses, courtesy of Vegas Insider ) for comparison. You can find Cortana's predictions by searching \"NFL schedule\" on Bing  (picks made prior to the Thursday night game). \nCleveland Browns at Baltimore Ravens (-10) — Ravens 67% chance to win. Houston Texans (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars — Texans 58% chance to win. Kansas City Chiefs at Carolina Panthers (-3) — Panthers 60% chance to win. Denver Broncos at New Orleans Saints (-2) — Saints 61% chance to win. Los Angeles Rams at New York Jets (-2) — Jets 53% chance to win. Atlanta Falcons (PK) at Philadelphia Eagles — Eagles 63% chance to win. Minnesota Vikings at Washington Redskins (-3) — Redskins 53% chance to win. Green Bay Packers (-2.5) at Tennessee Titans — Packers 53% chance to win. Chicago Bears at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-1.5) — Buccaneers 53% chance to win. Miami Dolphins at San Diego Chargers (-4) — Chargers 57% chance to win. San Francisco 49ers at Arizona Cardinals (-13.5) — Cardinals 79% chance to win. Dallas Cowboys at Pittsburgh Steelers (-2.5) — Steelers 61% chance to win. Seattle Seahawks at New England Patriots (-7.5) — Patriots 64% chance to win. Cincinnati Bengals at New York Giants (-2) — Giants 53% chance to win. NOW WATCH: How Cubs president Theo Epstein ended two of baseball's longest World Series curses \n",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today released another new build of Windows 10 to Windows Insiders in the Fast Ring. The software giant today released Windows 10 Build 14965 to Insiders. As per usual, the latest build of Windows 10 does not bring any major new features but it includes some little improvements for the OS.\nWith the latest build of Windows 10, Microsoft is adding a new virtual touchpad feature which will basically add a virtual touchpad to their system. This feature is mostly for tablet devices connected with external monitors, allowing users to easily be able to control multiple monitors right from their tablet without having to connect a mouse.\nThe build also includes improvements for Sticky Notes, bringing the Insights feature to some countries outside of the United States. The update brings Insights’ Flight Detection feature to Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, India, Spain, France, and some other countries. The update brings some other features of Sticky Notes, which is detailed below:\nWe’ve added email & URL recognition for every locale (except Chinese (simplified or traditional), Korean, or Japanese, which we’re still working on). We’ve added phone number recognition to all English, German, Spanish, French and Italian locales. We’ve added address recognition support for English (Great Britain) and Spanish (United States). We’ve added time recognition (prompting to create a Cortana reminder) to English (Great Britain), English (Australia) and English (India). We’ve added stock recognition (for example, $MSFT) to English (Australia), English (Canada), English (India), German (Germany), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), French (Canada), Japanese (Japan) and Portuguese (Brazil).\nIn addition to this, the update also includes a handful improvements for Windows Ink, adding more apps to the Recently Used feature and improved performance for the Sketchpad. Additionally, the company has also added a shortcut to the new Protector feature, which can now be controlled using your mouse’s scroll wheel.\nThe update, of course, includes the usual bug fixes, but that’s about it. If you are a Windows Insider in the Fast Ring, you should be able to install Windows 10 Build 14965 from Windows Update in the Settings app. The update is available for both PCs and Mobile devices, in case you’re wondering.\n",

      "text": "print \nDenis Poroy/AP \nMicrosoft Cortana — a virtual assistant picking the winner of every NFL game on Bing — had its best week of the season in Week 9, correctly picking 10 of the 13 games on the docket. The solid picking brought its overall record to 74-57 (56%). \nCortana's three misses were the three biggest upsets of the week: the Vikings and Packers wer both home favorites, and the Broncos were a pick-em against the Raiders in Oakland. \nStill, a 10-3 showing marks a notable uptick in success this season for the Microsoft algorithm. We'll be watching to see if it continues to trend in a positive direction. \nThis week, Cortana and Vegas in in total agreement. There are some especially good games, however, including the Seahawks at the Patriots and the Cowboys at the Steelers. In both, the home teams are favored. \nAs always, Cortana only picks the outright winner of each game. It does not make picks against the spread, though we like to include the point spread (in parentheses, courtesy of Vegas Insider ) for comparison. You can find Cortana's predictions by searching \"NFL schedule\" on Bing (picks made prior to the Thursday night game). Cleveland Browns at Baltimore Ravens (-10) — Ravens 67% chance to win. Houston Texans (-1.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars — Texans 58% chance to win. Kansas City Chiefs at Carolina Panthers (-3) — Panthers 60% chance to win. Denver Broncos at New Orleans Saints (-2) — Saints 61% chance to win. Los Angeles Rams at New York Jets (-2) — Jets 53% chance to win. Atlanta Falcons (PK) at Philadelphia Eagles — Eagles 63% chance to win. Minnesota Vikings at Washington Redskins (-3) — Redskins 53% chance to win. Green Bay Packers (-2.5) at Tennessee Titans — Packers 53% chance to win. Chicago Bears at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-1.5) — Buccaneers 53% chance to win. Miami Dolphins at San Diego Chargers (-4) — Chargers 57% chance to win. San Francisco 49ers at Arizona Cardinals (-13.5) — Cardinals 79% chance to win. Dallas Cowboys at Pittsburgh Steelers (-2.5) — Steelers 61% chance to win. Seattle Seahawks at New England Patriots (-7.5) — Patriots 64% chance to win. Cincinnati Bengals at New York Giants (-2) — Giants 53% chance to win.",

      "text": "Question: Nick, Microsoft did an automatic update install on my Windows 10 computer and now none of my Sticky Notes appear. I did some searching on the net and found the file that is supposed to contain my past Notes. Double clicking does not open them. I went to the Windows store and installed their Stickies and restarted, but still none of my past Notes appear. Is it possible to get those missing Notes back? And before you ask, no I did not make a backup. There does not seem to be an obvious way to do it ... or to print them out. — Bill, Rochester\nAnswer: Oh, Bill, so many, many people are having a problem with Sticky Notes since the latest updates! The problems seem mostly to center around bad fonts, wide margins, not bulleted or number lists any more, keyboard shortcuts not working, and — most extreme — the whole thing disappearing.\nWith the last update, Sticky Notes stopped being a “regular program,” and became an “app.” Which means it’s a whole new program, which means that the data are in a whole new place. Which, just in case it’s still there for you, is at C:\\Users\\<yourusername>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows Sidebar\\Settings.ini — there may be several settings files in there. Start with the newest one. Open the file in Notepad (right-click on the file name, select “Open With” from the drop-down menu, and select “Notepad). Look for PrivateSetting_Notes.gadget — Your Notes will be under that Section as :\n0=”<first note>”\n1=”<second note>”\nand so on.\nIf that section is not in any of the settings file, I’m afraid you’re out of luck. According to Microsoft support, they are “aware of the issue” and are “working on a fix.” So, you’ve got that going for you.\nGentle Readers: Just a note of caution: Don’t go mucking about in those subdirectories I sent you through above. That can lead to more trouble (including unbootable or unstable systems). If you do muck about in them, don’t write me.\nQ: Nick, Long time listener, first time caller. I have a 4-year-old Dell Optiplex 3010 with a Core i5 processor running Windows 10. Ever since that huge update came out a couple of weeks ago, the computer doesn’t seem to know what to do after an update is installed. I get stuck with a black screen and the six little dots going around in a circle for ever. I’m talking hours if I let it. Once the hard drive activity stops I power it down and restart and everything seems to be fine. The status always says the update installed successfully. I defragged the hard drive (it really needed it) and no sign of any malware of any kind but no change. Everything seems to be fine otherwise. Suggestions?\n— Jeff, Rochester\nA: *Pops the champagne.* The first thing to check, Jeff, is that you have enough disk space free for the updates. You need at least 16G for the larger updates, and 20G is preferable.\nIf that doesn’t work, Windows includes a built-in troubleshooter that may be able to help fix a stuck update. It’s the easiest method to try, so go ahead and run it first. The troubleshooter performs three actions:\n1) It shuts down Windows Update Services.\n2) It renames the C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution folder to C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution.old, essentially clearing the Windows Update download cache so that it can start over.\n3) It restarts the Windows Update Services.\nThis troubleshooter is available on Windows 7, 8 and 10. You’ll find it in the same place on all modern versions of Windows.\nTo run the troubleshooter, hit Start, search for “troubleshooting,” and then run the selection that search comes up with. In the Control Panel list of troubleshooters, in the “System and Security” section, click “Fix problems with Windows Update.” In the advanced settings, make sure that the “Apply repairs automatically” check box is enabled, click “Run as administrator” and then click Next. Giving the tool administrative privileges helps ensure that it can delete files in the download cache.\nThe troubleshooter works through its process and then lets you know whether it could identify and fix the problem. Most of the time, the troubleshooter can successfully remove or finish a stuck update from the queue. Go ahead and try running Windows Update again. Even if the troubleshooter says it couldn’t identify the problem, it’s possible that the actions of starting and stopping the service and clearing out the cache did the trick.\nThis is the system software equivalent of turning it off and then on again. Don’t laugh at me; if it works, it works!\nNick Francesco, a.k.a. Ask Nick, offers simple answers for your computer questions.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 6 minutes ago with 1 comment \nMicrosoft today released a new Windows 10 Insider Preview to the Fast ring; this week's build is 14965, and it's available for both PCs and phones. It's a preview of the recently announced Creators Update , formerly only known by its codename, Redstone 2. \nOne might have speculated that there would be no new build this week, as Microsoft kicked off its Creators Update Bug Bash on Monday . It doesn't end until the 13th, and the company said that it would focus on build 14959, which was last week's Preview . \nHere's what's new: \nControlling external monitors from tablets just got easier (PC): You can now drive content on a second display from your tablet without ever having to attach a mouse. The virtual touchpad lets you do more with a tablet and a second screen – just connect to another monitor, PC, or TV, go to Action Center and tap on the “Project” Quick Action to extend your screen. Use it just like you would a physical touchpad to control content on the connected screen. To enable it, press and hold on the taskbar and select “Show touchpad button”. A touchpad icon will now appear in the notification area (just like Windows Ink Workspace does), and tapping on it will bring it up the virtual touchpad. \nYou’ve seen the work we’ve been doing for precision touchpad customization with the last few builds, and the virtual touchpad is no exception. While the virtual touchpad is open, go to Settings > Devices > Touchpad and you’ll be able to tweak the touchpad settings to your preferences. \nSticky Notes update (PC): Windows Insiders in the Fast ring will receive will receive Sticky Notes app update to version 1.2.9.0 today and we’re very excited to share what it includes! We’ve expanded our support for Insights to many more languages and regions, with even more to come in further updates, stay tuned! Specifically, with this version: \nWe’ve added flight detection for Germany (Germany), in more English locales (Canada, Great Britain, India, Arabia), Spanish (Spain & Mexico), French (France, Canada), Italian (Italy), Japanese (Japan), and Portuguese (Brazil). \nWe’ve added email & URL recognition for every locale (except Chinese (simplified or traditional), Korean, or Japanese, which we’re still working on). \nWe’ve added phone number recognition to all English, German, Spanish, French and Italian locales. \nWe’ve added address recognition support for English (Great Britain) and Spanish (United States). \nWe’ve added time recognition (prompting to create a Cortana reminder) to English (Great Britain), English (Australia) and English (India). \nWe’ve added stock recognition (for example, $MSFT) to English (Australia), English (Canada), English (India), German (Germany), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), French (Canada), Japanese (Japan) and Portuguese (Brazil). \nIf Insights in Sticky Notes isn’t turned on automatically for you, tap “…” > Settings gear > “Enable insights”. Note: The language and region used to detect Insights in Sticky Notes is based off of the active keyboard. We’re currently investigating some issues where Insights may not show up as expected if you switch keyboards while typing in Sticky Notes. \nWe’ve fixed some issues with Undo and Redo (CTRL + Z/CTRL + Y) while typing, so they’ll now do so more reliably. \nWe’ve improved the performance of text input while typing. \nIt’s now easier than ever to get the latest Sticky Notes app updates. When our next update is available, we’ll show an in-app prompt so all you have to do is click ‘Update’. \nWe’ve also done a whole lot of UI/UX polishing and performance improvements that we hope you enjoy. \nWe’re been making a bunch of improvements based on your feedback, and have more to come, so let us know what you’d like to see next! In recent versions of Sticky Notes, we’ve added support for many of your favorite keyboard shortcuts, including CTRL + B (bold), CTRL + I (italic), CTRL + N (new note) and CTRL + D (delete note), added a new context menu for easy copy/paste, reduced the minimum note size for typists, as well as generally improved our reliability and performance. \nWindows Ink Workspace Improvements (PC): This build includes a number of improvements to the Windows Ink Workspace. \nWe increased the number of Recently Used apps shown in the Windows Ink Workspace to 6, and added a link to quickly access your pen settings. \nWe’ve improved the performance of loading Sketchpad when there’s a lot of ink present on the sketch. \nWe’ve updated the new protractor, so that you can use the scroll-wheel on your mouse to shrink/expand it (depending on the direction of the scrolling). \nWe fixed an issue where, when using Sticky Notes in the Windows Ink Workspace, the background would ding when tapped. \nWe fixed an issue where inking and resizing the protractor at the same time would result in Sketchpad crashing. \nWe’ve updated the “Pen & Windows Ink” Settings for pen users to now include a link to the handwriting training tool – simply click on “Get to know my handwriting” to launch it. We’ve also improved how we learn from your handwriting samples – try it out and let us know what you think! \nEnhancing the Address Bar in Registry Editor (PC): We were really excited to hear how excited you were about the new address bar in Registry Editor, and based on your feedback, we’ve already incorporated two new features: You can now use CTRL + L to set focus to the address bar – while we already supported ALT + D, we recognize that some people prefer this keyboard shortcut instead, so now you have the option to use either one You can now use shorthand notation for HKEY names – you told us that when sharing registry paths you always use shorthand notation (HKCU) instead of typing out the full HKEY name (i.e. HKEY_CURRENT_USER), so we should support them in the address bar, and you know what? We agree! You can now just use “HKCR”, “HKCU”, “HKLM”, and “HKU” instead of typing or pasting the respective full name “HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT”, “HKEY_CURRENT_USER”, “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE”, or “HKEY_USERS” into the address bar. \nImproving Your Hyper-V VM experience (PC): Following the new VM scaling options mentioned in last week’s build, we’ve fixed an issue where depending on the zoom level selected, the VM window might not be created large enough to avoid scrollbars, despite their being enough space for it. We also updated the logic so that when you pick a particular zoom level, that zoom level preference will be preserved for the next VM connection. Along the way, we fixed an issue where the title bar of a maximized VM window would be occluded when taskbar had been set to on top. \nAs you can see, while there is quite a bit that's noted here, it's nothing particularly major. For example, we still don't have the Continuum improvements that were announced at Microsoft's Ignite 2016 conference this year . \nLanguage packs for this build are being slightly delayed, so if you have additional language packs installed, it's recommended that you hold off on installing 14965.

      "title": "Microsoft’s $15 DVD Player app for Windows 10 gets a new update",
      "text": "\nLast year, Microsoft released its new Windows DVD Player app for Windows 10 PCs. The company’s DVD Player app is not available for free — instead, you’ll have to pay $15 to be able to install it on your PC. Today, the company released a fairly major update to the app to those in the Windows Insider program’s Fast Ring. The update includes some much-needed features — firstly, it can now automatically detect and read a DVD when you insert it in the PC. Previously, users apparently had to manually tell the app to look for a new disc which is pretty weird. The update also makes the playback bar “simpler” and “easier” to use which hides the less used actions in an ellipsis menu. The user interface of the playback bar has also been improved to make it look similar to the playback bar on the Movies & TV app.\nIn addition to this, the update includes a number of other improvements which are listed below:\nNow when you insert a DVD into the drive while the app is running, it will automatically read the DVD. No longer do you have to manually tell the app to look for a disc in the drive. Playback bar is simpler and more polished so that it’s easier to use. Less used actions are now hidden under the “…” menu The closed caption button is included in the playback bar The look and feel is modeled after the Movies & TV app Playback bar is now disabled when there is no DVD in the drive. If your DVD drive region does not match the region set in Windows, the app will prompt you to change the region of your DVD drive to continue. Basic keyboard interactions are now supported: double-clicking on the video will go full screen, escape will exit full screen, spacebar will pause/play. We improved the keyboard navigation and made Narrator strings clearer. If you have the N SKU of Windows installed, the app will recognize the lack of Media Foundation Package and prompt you to install it. Once again, the latest update for the Windows DVD Player app is only available to those part of the Insider Programs’s Fast Ring. If you are interested in trying the app out, you can get it from the link below for $14.99:\nWP-Appbox: Windows DVD Player ($14.99, Windows Store) → \n",

      "text": "  \nRon Markezich, the corporate vice president for Microsoft, has taken to the Office blog to detail how Microsoft’s cloud services are enabling the digital transformation at the UK’s Ministry of Defense. \nOverall, the post addresses how a government entity such as the Ministry of Defense can find the right balance between enabling employees with anytime, anywhere data access while also ensuring security. \nOther areas covered include the fact that thanks to Microsoft’s Cloud Services, more than 95,000 UK Ministry of Defense mailboxes will be protected with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, and the fact that staff will stay productive and secure around the clock. Of course, Microsoft’s Advanced Threat Protection, Customer Lockbox at a UK data center, are also addressed. A statement in the post from Mike Stone, chief digital and information officer (CDIO) at the Ministry of Defence also reflects how Microsoft’s Cloud Services fit with the Ministry: \n“The MOD chose Microsoft cloud technologies to support our transition to a more cost-effective, modern and agile organisation. Microsoft offers the security, privacy, control and transparency that meets our stringent criteria for cloud services—all available from data centres in the U.K. Additional cloud-based services such as Advanced Threat Protection provide us with complementary capabilities to keep our employees productive and our network secure.” \nTo learn more about Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, and the Microsoft Cloud be sure to check out our news hubs for the subject here and here .

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago \nMicrosoft today released this week's Fast ring build, which was Windows 10 Insider Preview 14965 for both PC and Mobile. The build contains a number of new features, although it's mostly minor stuff. \nThe company notes that it kicked off its Bug Bash for the Windows 10 Creators Update this week. If you're interested, head over to the Feedback Hub and get started on some Quests. \nAs usual, there's a long list of fixes, improvements, and known issues for today's build. Here's what got fixed and improved in Windows 10 for PCs build 14965: \nWe have fixed the issue causing Internet Explorer to crash a few seconds after launch. \nWe fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the “Prendre une ” (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. \nWe’ve made some graphics improvements so the system will now respond better when WIN + L is pressed while playing a full screen game. \nWe’ve updated the ALT + F4 Shutdown dialog to better respond to DPI changes when connected to an external monitor. We also fixed an issue where the tooltips for the taskbar notification area items would be incorrectly sized after a DPI change until rebooting the machine or otherwise signing out and back in. \nWe’ve fixed an issue where File Explorer might crash when creating or renaming a folder on a network share. \nWe fixed an issue resulting in the text on the Outlook Calendar tile on the Start menu being slightly fuzzy. \nWe fixed an issue where deleted files might reappear in File Explorer with a 0 byte size. \nWe fixed an issue resulting in a Windows Default Lock Screen window sometimes appearing after logging in. \nWe fixed an issue resulting in File Explorer crashing after right-clicking an app in Task Manager and selecting “Open File Location”. \nWe’ve updated our migration logic so that going forward from Build 14965, preferred UAC settings, startup shortcuts, and File Explorer folders that had been pinned to the Start menu will all now be preserved across upgrades. \nWe fixed an issue resulting in vertical lists written in XAML, such as those found in Groove Music, unexpectedly animating in from the side. \nWe fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed “Create an appointment” then clicked on the resulting suggestion to “Create an appointment”. \nWe fixed an issue where in Microsoft Edge, after cancelling a file download, the progress bar for the next file downloaded might appear to be stuck at the point at which the old file’s download was at when it was cancelled. \nWe fixed an issue that could result in the Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) periodically showing the candidate window in the upper left corner of the desktop and not being able to enter text into the Office 2016 apps and some other text editors. \nHere are the known issues: \nDouble-clicking on an Excel document to open it from File Explorer will crash Microsoft Excel. The workaround is to open the document from within Excel. \nMicrosoft Studios games like Microsoft Sudoku, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and Treasure Hunt may freeze at the splash screen on launch. \nAs you can see, neither of the two known issues seem particularly major. Dona Sarkar notes that language packs for this build are being slightly delayed. If you have additional language packs installed on your machine, it's recommended that you hold off on checking for updates. \nIf you're on the Fast ring, you can grab today's Insider Preview build by heading over to Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update -> Check for updates. If not, go to the Windows Insider Program tab and click Get started. When your PC restarts, go back and make sure that you're on the Fast ring. Tags",

      "text": "“Surface Pro 4 is everything I never knew I needed and can’t live without now!”\nI met Skimm’bassador Kathy Capeluto recently through our partnership with popular e-mail news brief theSkimm , but she’s been a diehard Surface Pro 4 fan since she got it last year as a birthday present from her family. She jokes that it was somewhat fated because Surface Pro 4 and Book came out on October 26 th – her birthday – but it might have had something to do with the above Tweet.\nKathy had an old Mac from college that needed upgrading, so she was looking around for a suitable replacement. When she saw her friend using a Surface Pro 3, she was intrigued. Her friend loved that it was a full computer but portable enough so that she could get clients to sign contracts right on screen, wherever they were. While Kathy didn’t need that, she did see the possibilities for her crafting.\n“When I first started using Surface Pen, I shrieked with joy and immediately went to hug my mom to thank her for the gift she unknowingly gave me: my time back!”\nWhile Kathy is a proud member of corporate America, she fully believes in the power of Work Craft Balance . She shared that for her, it’s less about “work life balance” than “work craft balance” because crafting has been a part of her life for as long as she can remember. In fact, Kathy took a sabbatical from work in which she explored crafting more professionally.\nKathy ultimately decided that crafting is the perfect creative outlet to complement her day job. Having a touchscreen on a full computer is game-changing because she can ideate and create on her Surface. It saves her hours of work she would’ve had to do by hand, and lets her manufacture products with industry quality. She explained, “I draw on my Surface and then upload my work into the Cricut Design Space plug in, where I can clean up the images with ease thanks to the Surface Pen. Then my Cricut (imagine a printer that has a blade instead of an ink cartridge, and can cut cardstock, vinyl, and other materials) brings the digital shape to life.”\nKathy’s photo booth props designed on her Surface Pro 4, and then cut on her Cricut.\nKathy’s photo booth props designed on her Surface Pro 4, and then cut on her Cricut.\nThanks to her Surface (and Cricut), Kathy has a successful side business and seasonal Etsy shop. Kathy appreciates how she can take a picture on her iPhone, which immediately uploads to her OneDrive cloud storage so she can quickly edit it on her Surface and post to Etsy. She marvels about her Surface Pro 4 “it’s so fast and responsive.”\nBeyond crafting, Kathy always takes her Surface with her on work trips because it’s so much lighter than her work laptop. “When I had to take an extended trip to Colombia, I just worked off my Surface the entire time.” It is also especially useful when she needs to entertain her nephew and Goddaughter.\nKathy’s Goddaughter and nephew watching a movie.\nThe one flaw with Kathy’s Surface is that it lets her indulge her multitasking tendencies — while she cuts a design for an order, she can also be knee-deep in a black hole of YouTube videos, and simultaneously work on an Excel sheet organizing corporate metrics. She jokes that “multitasking is a myth but I can’t help myself, especially with my Surface.”\n 17 am",

      "text": "Former Microsoft executive Doug Burgum is North Dakota’s next governor The Republican was the CEO of Great Plains Software, which Microsoft bought in 2002. Doug Burgum for North Dakota Another businessman-turned-politician was elected Tuesday, though with significantly less controversy. Former Microsoft executive Doug Burgum won his bid to become the governor of North Dakota , fueled by a socially moderate, fiscally conservative campaign. Burgum, who sold his Great Plains Software business to Microsoft in 2002 for $1.1 billion, laid out his plans in a January email interview with Recode . “The role of governor is the closest thing to a CEO job in government,” Burgum said. “I have spent my working life attracting capital and talent to North Dakota.” Here’s an edited transcript of that interview. Recode: What made you want to run for governor? Doug Burgum : The private sector, free markets and technology are all huge positive forces that have literally helped change the world. I am grateful to have been able to spend my life as an entrepreneur in the global software industry. The role of governor is the closest thing to a CEO job in government. I have spent my working life attracting capital and talent to North Dakota. I am interested in working where I can have the biggest impact on my home state, and the role of the governor in North Dakota, among other duties, is to be the lead ambassador and cheerleader for attracting human and financial capital to the state. I have no desire to be a politician. I do want to be an elected leader. Are there lessons from your career as an entrepreneur that you feel guide your political philosophy? Yes. Competition drives innovation, lowers cost, speeds delivery and more. Most government services are monopolies, or near monopolies, and therefore have lacked the market forces that produce better solutions. And most government agencies are lagging behind private industry in technology adoption. There are big opportunities to re-invent government service delivery at all levels. Which is hardest, running your own business, working for Steve Ballmer or running for office? Each of these represent unique joys and challenges! I ran Great Plains for 18 years, worked with Steve for six and a half years, and have been running for office for 16 days. The biggest change across all three of these over the last 30 years is the nonstop, 24-hour role that social media plays in building brand, driving opinion and engaging with customers (voters). What do you make of the Republican presidential race? It has been great for TV ratings and for people who own media outlets in Iowa and New Hampshire. It remains to be seen if the process produces a viable national candidate who will be competitive in the fall. Today’s campaigns and candidates are a product of a convoluted, legacy, state-by-state primary process that would possibly not exist if one was tasked to start from scratch to invent a new process for identifying and vetting the very best individuals to serve as president of the United States. How can technology help solve some of the issues facing North Dakota? Every industry in North Dakota (and everywhere else) is facing accelerating change. Moore’s law, super-cheap storage, increasing bandwidth infrastructure and a proliferation of super low-cost, highly accurate automatic data sensors are transforming every process and workflow. There has been a truism in the tech world that “every company needs to become a software company, or be disrupted by one.” I believe this is absolutely true. We have a global oil surplus today because of the rapid advancements in technology. This stands in stark contrast to a multi-decade narrative that we were “running out of oil.” In energy exploration, some of these technologic advances that have contributed to the unforeseen abundance, such as deep horizontal drilling, were pioneered in the Bakken formation in North Dakota. Technology ranging from self-driving tractors with GPS precision, real-time soil analysis (to reduce fertilizer needs) and continued advances in hybrid seed technology are reshaping production agriculture. Health care delivery markets and systems have been completely distorted by government regulation and mandates, making our health care system less productive. These productivity losses will be compounded by demographics: We have more caregivers (doctors and nurses retiring) and more patients aging, so this will put additional pressures on our health care systems. The only way out of this productivity inversion for health care is to streamline operational workflows with automatically generated data. And our North Dakota education system, which needs to serve a significant rural as well as increasing urban population, will need to accelerate its efforts to raise outcomes to ensure students of all ages have the skills they need to be competitive in a global economy. What role is technology playing in your campaign? Our campaign team is like a lean tech startup today. We are into rapid prototyping and continuous improvement and building community. There are so many low-cost amazing tools, solutions and platforms — from social media, to fundraising, to building websites, to CRM, to accounting and more — to help us share our messages. Anything else that you want to make sure people know? I am running as a moderate on social issues and as a fiscal conservative in a state that is socially conservative but has seen government spending rise more rapidly than even our fast-growing economy (fueled by the oil boom and billions of dollars of revenue surpluses at the state level). This race will be decided on the June 14th primary. recode_divider",

      "text": "The power of protection. Stay safe online with award-winning software. Click here to save 50 percent. \nLast week, we reported here at komando.com about Google's public disclosure of a zero-day vulnerability in Windows that is already exploited by hackers. This privilege escalation bug is said to be exploited through Flash Player and win32k.sys system call bugs that allow malicious code to escape Windows security sandboxing. \nYesterday, as promised, Microsoft finally issued a patch to fix the flaw as part of its regular Patch/Update Tuesday set of software security updates. \nThe tech company released 14 bulletins, including six vulnerabilities with a \"Critical\" rating and eight rated as \"Important.\" Critical Updates \nMS16-129 is a set of critical patches for multiple memory corruption and information disclosure vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Edge browser. The most severe of these bugs could allow an attacker to execute remote code and take control of a machine. \nMS16-130 addresses an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Input Method Editor and the Task Scheduler. It also patches a hole that allows remote code execution by loading a specially crafted image file from a website or an email attachment. \nMS16-131 and MS16-132 are fixes for Microsoft Video Control and Microsoft Graphic Control bugs that could allow an attacker to execute remote code by exploiting object handling in memory via poisoned website or an email message. \nMS16-141 plugs vulnerabilities in Flash Player for Internet Explorer 10, 11 and Microsoft Edge that could allow remote code execution. \nThe sixth critical update, MS16-141 , resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution by viewing a poisoned website. Important Updates \nInterestingly, Microsoft's patch for the zero-day flaw that Google disclosed was only rated \"Important.\" MS16-141 fixes the privilege elevation in win32k.sys as revealed by Google's security team. It also patches information disclosure exploits in Windows kernel-mode drivers. \nMS16-134 patches a bug that allows elevation of privilege when the Windows Common Log File System driver improperly handles objects in memory. This flaw could allow an attacker to take full control of a machine via a malicious application. \nMS16-136 likewise fixes elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL server. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify user accounts in a machine. \nMS16-137 resolves flaws in Windows Authentication Methods that could allow elevation of privilege and denial of service. \nMS16-138 is a security update for Virtual Hard Disk Driver flaws that allow an attacker to access and manipulate files without permission. \nLastly, MS16-139 addresses an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Kernel API and MS16-140 patches a flaw that allows a local attacker bypass security by installing a modified boot policy. \nFor a summary of these security bulletins, check Microsoft's TechNet page . \nHow to update Windows \nMost Windows machines are set to download and install updates automatically by default. If you haven't changed your automatic update settings then you should be fine. \nBut if you want to check, here's how: \n\n\nOn Windows 10, click Start (Windows logo), choose \"Settings,\" select \"Update & Security,\" then on the \"Windows Update\" section, click on \"Advanced Options.\" (Note: the \"Windows Update\" section is also handy for showing you updates that are currently being downloaded or applied.) Under \"Advanced Options,\" just make sure the drop down box is set to \"Automatic.\" \nIf you have an older Vista or Windows 7 system, check out our tips on how to set up and check Windows Updates . Adobe \nIn related news, Adobe likewise issued security patches for Flash Player and Adobe Connect as part of their own Patch/Update Tuesday release. \nThe Flash Player security update fixes nine critical vulnerabilities ( APSB16-36 ) that could allow remote code execution. \nFlash Player holdovers should update to Flash Player 23.0.0.207 for Windows and Mac and 11.2.202.644 for Linux. The Flash Player plugins for Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge will automatically update to 23.0.0.205 via these browsers' Flash Player update mechanisms. \n--> Click here to use our Adobe Flash Update Tool guide for download and install instructions. \nThese updates follow the emergency updates that Adobe issued for Flash Player two weeks ago to fix zero-day flaws, including the bug that was reportedly the vector for the Windows win32k.sys exploit. \nAn update to Adobe Connect was also released to fix a validation vulnerability in its events registration module. Adobe Connect will be upgraded to the newest version automatically. \nFor further reading, check out these related articles:",

      "text": "Microsoft has just released a new Windows 10 preview build for Windows insiders enrolled in the fast ring, giving them the chance to try out a few more features that are supposed to be part of the final version due in early 2017. Windows 10 build 14965, which is a preview of the Creators Update, comes with a virtual touchpad that makes it possible for users to move content on a second display from a tablet without the need for a mouse. All you have to do is to connect to another monitor, PC, or TV, and in Action Center tap the Project quick action to use it. There’s a new “Show touchpad button” option that enables this feature. The Sticky Notes app has also been updated to version 1.2.9.0 and it comes with plenty of new features, including support for Insights to many more languages and regions, including Germany , Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese. The app has also received plenty of bug fixes, and Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program,...",

      "text": "Staying ahead of the curve with Microsoft software is as easy as joining one of its many Insider Programs and now you can do the same with Skype. Users on iOS, Android, OS X and Windows can all join up to get the updates before anyone else. More Skype users on Windows, Android, iOS, and OS X will now be able to test out new features for the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service as part of a new Insider program, exclusively for Skype. Announced shortly after Microsoft’s debut of the new Xbox Insider Program, Skype joins much of Microsoft’s major software platforms, to enable more frequent updates with better-tested features.\nThe idea behind the Insider Program is a simple but effective one: have a section of the user base opt-in to be beta testers before a worldwide rollout of software updates. That takes some of the pressure off of Microsoft’s internal testing teams, letting more features roll out on a speedier basis, without risking more bugs and flaws in the software.\nIt’s a scheme that’s worked very well with Microsoft’s Windows 10 as well as its Office software suites, and now we can expect the same sort of benefits for Skype.\nRelated: Microsoft’s Office Insider now has its very own Insider Fast Ring\nSkype users can now sign up to become part of the Insider program and will gain early access to features and performance improvements. While it’s likely they will have to contend with a few more bugs, reporting them early will help Microsoft iron those out before extending broader availability.\nAs The Verge points out, this scheme is already yielding early releases for Insiders. Users on OS X will find themselves able to use a new search tool for emoticons, to make sifting through them that bit easier. Call forwarding and voicemail options have also been expanded on the platform, while Android and iOS users should find a few early release bug fixes in their Insider releases.\nAnother takeaway from this news is that Microsoft is taking Skype seriously. At a time when it is refocusing and consolidating its efforts, clearly it’s doubling down on Skype as its communication tool of choice. Skype now joins the firm’s other mainstream products with its new Insider Program, and it will be interesting to see how the service evolves going forward.\nPaying is for suckers: Here’s how to use Microsoft Office for Free Duolingo’s bot with help you learn a language the natural way – by using it Google Play Store's Early Access feature gives beta apps a chance at exposure",

      "text": "  45 minutes ago / 356 Views \nMicrosoft has cut the price of the original Xbox One on the Microsoft Store website . \nThe Gears of War: Ultimate Edition has been cut by £70 from £249.99 to £179.99. The Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege bundle has been cut by £100 from £299.99 to £199.9 9. The 500GB Xbox One with Kinect has been cut by £100 from £299.99 to £199.99. \nThe price cut is probably a means to clear out stock as Microsoft focuses on promoting the Xbox One S. \n ",

      "text": "(Photo via Sound Transit). Seattle-area tech titans like Microsoft, Amazon, and Expedia want to see the region’s transportation infrastructure double over the next 25 years. It appears their wish will come true.\nThe most recent figures have the $54 billion Sound Transit 3 (ST3) ballot measure passing with more than 55 percent of the vote. The initiative would add 62 new miles of light rail linking Tacoma, Federal Way, Redmond, Kirkland, Issaquah, Seattle’s Ballard and West Seattle neighborhoods, and Everett. ST3 will also expand existing bus and train service and add parking.\nThe map below shows the proposed transit additions.\n\nBig tech companies, which are actively reshaping Seattle’s DNA through aggressive hiring and growth, helped fund the ST3 campaign. Microsoft donated $300,000, Amazon $110,000, Expedia $150,000, and Bill Gates $100,000, according to data from Washington’s Public Disclosure Commission .\nExpedia and Amazon, in particular, are actively transforming Seattle in a number of ways.\nIn three years, Expedia will move 3,500 employees from its current headquarters in Bellevue, Wash. to a massive new campus on Seattle’s waterfront. The relocation plan invoked the ire of longtime Seattleites concerned about the region’s growing traffic problems.\nIt’s the same reason Amazon, headquartered in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood, is often the subject of scorn. The e-commerce giant is gobbling up office space and adding employees at a breakneck pace, contributing to a rapidly growing population in Seattle.\nUber — which is headquartered in San Francisco but has a big presence in Seattle — publically endorsed ST3 in an unusual move for the transportation giant.\nThese companies, and the tech industry at large, have a lot to gain from a more mobile Seattle — both in terms of employee comfort and brand reputation.\nFor better or worse, their financial contributions to ST3 are just one of the many ways they will reshape Seattle.",

      "title": "Microsoft releases new Windows 10 preview with improvements to Sticky Notes, Windows Ink, and Registry Editor",
      "text": "Microsoft today released a new Windows 10 preview for PCs and phones. This is the second build ahead of the company’s Windows 10 Creators Update , coming in “early 2017,” and it brings improvements to controlling external monitors from tablets, Sticky Notes, Windows Ink Workspace, the Registry Editor’s address bar, and Hyper-V.\nWindows 10 is a service , meaning it was built in a very different way than its predecessors so it can be regularly updated with not just fixes but new features too. While Microsoft has released many such updates to date, the Creative Update will be a major one and follows the Windows 10 Anniversary Update , released in August 2016.\nFirst up, it’s now possible to control an external monitor from a tablet without attaching a mouse. Just connect a monitor, PC, or TV, go to the Action Center, and tap on the “Project” Quick Action to extend your screen. The virtual touchpad (press and hold on the taskbar and select “Show touchpad button”) lets you control content on the connected screen.\n\nJust like with Windows Ink Workspace, a touchpad icon will now appear in the notification area for the virtual touchpad. Speaking of Windows Ink Workspace, this feature has its own improvements:\nIncreased the number of Recently Used apps shown in the Windows Ink Workspace to 6, and added a link to quickly access your pen settings. Improved the performance of loading Sketchpad when there’s a lot of ink present on the sketch. Updated the new protractor, so that you can use the scroll-wheel on your mouse to shrink/expand it (depending on the direction of the scrolling). Fixed an issue where, when using Sticky Notes in the Windows Ink Workspace, the background would ding when tapped. Fixed an issue where inking and resizing the protractor at the same time would result in Sketchpad crashing. Updated the “Pen & Windows Ink” Settings for pen users to now include a link to the handwriting training tool and improved the learning from handwriting samples. Next up, Sticky Notes has been updated with the following:\nSupport for many more languages and regions. Fixed some issues with Undo and Redo (CTRL + Z/CTRL + Y) while typing. Improved the performance of text input while typing. New in-app prompt for updates. UI/UX polishing and performance improvements. The new address bar in Registry Editor has gained two new features based on tester feedback. You can now use CTRL + L to set focus to the address bar (in addition to ALT + D) and use shorthand notation for HKEY names (HKCU instead of typing out the full HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKCR for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKCU for HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKLM for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and HKU for HKEY_USERS).\nFor Hyper-V, Microsoft fixed issues where depending on the zoom level selected, the VM window might not be created large enough to avoid scrollbars, and where the title bar of a maximized VM window would be occluded when the taskbar had been set to on top. Also, when you pick a zoom level, that preference will now be preserved for the next VM connection.\nThe desktop build includes the following improvements and bug fixes:\nFixed the issue causing Internet Explorer to crash a few seconds after launch. Fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the “Prendre une <photo/video/selfie>” (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. We’ve made some graphics improvements so the system will now respond better when WIN + L is pressed while playing a full screen game. We’ve updated the ALT + F4 Shutdown dialog to better respond to DPI changes when connected to an external monitor. We also fixed an issue where the tooltips for the taskbar notification area items would be incorrectly sized after a DPI change until rebooting the machine or otherwise signing out and back in. We’ve fixed an issue where File Explorer might crash when creating or renaming a folder on a network share. Fixed an issue resulting in the text on the Outlook Calendar tile on the Start menu being slightly fuzzy. Fixed an issue where deleted files might reappear in File Explorer with a 0 byte size. Fixed an issue resulting in a Windows Default Lock Screen window sometimes appearing after logging in. Fixed an issue resulting in File Explorer crashing after right-clicking an app in Task Manager and selecting “Open File Location”. We’ve updated our migration logic so that going forward from Build 14965, preferred UAC settings, startup shortcuts, and File Explorer folders that had been pinned to the Start menu will all now be preserved across upgrades. Fixed an issue resulting in vertical lists written in XAML, such as those found in Groove Music, unexpectedly animating in from the side. Fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed “Create an appointment” then clicked on the resulting suggestion to “Create an appointment”. Fixed an issue where in Microsoft Edge, after cancelling a file download, the progress bar for the next file downloaded might appear to be stuck at the point at which the old file’s download was at when it was cancelled. Fixed an issue that could result in the Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) periodically showing the candidate window in the upper left corner of the desktop and not being able to enter text into the Office 2016 apps and some other text editors. Today’s update bumps the Windows 10 build number for PCs from 14959 (made available to testers on November 3) to build 14965.\nThis build has two known issues:\nDouble-clicking on an Excel document to open it from File Explorer will crash Microsoft Excel. The workaround is to open the document from within Excel. Microsoft Studios games like Microsoft Sudoku, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and Treasure Hunt may freeze at the splash screen on launch. If you’re OK with the above and want to get build 14965 now, head to PC Settings, select “Update and recovery,” then “Preview builds,” and then click the “Check Now” button.\nThe corresponding Windows 10 Mobile build also includes new features and improvements, but Microsoft still doesn’t have a device to champion it.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "title": "Don’t Hold Your Breath for an Xbox Streaming Stick",
      "text": "Prior to E3 earlier this year, rumor had it that Microsoft would announce an Xbox-branded streaming stick -- something in the vein of a Chromecast or Amazon Fire Stick. But it didn't. Instead, we got an announcement of the high-powered Project Scorpio with nary a streaming stick in sight.\n\nIt ends up that the streaming stick seems to have been pulled last minute, according to Windows Central , and we may never hear of it again.\nThe streaming stick, known internally as Project Hobart, was reportedly all set for announcement and even launch. Microsoft had reportedly ordered 300,000 of them for manufacture, and they would have sold for $99 a pop. It would have streamed Xbox One and Scorpio to and ran Windows apps.\nMORE: Best Streaming Players and Sticks \nBut when details about Sony's PlayStation Pro (then under the codename \"Neo\") started leaking, Microsoft apparently had a last-minute change of plans. Hobart was shelved, and, according to Windows Central's source, the company decided to talk about Project Scorpio far earlier than it originally intended.\nThat left no room for an introduction to Hobart, which appears to have been canned. It's not clear why the announcement of Scorpio precluded any talk about Hobart, or if there was a greater shift in Microsoft's thinking.\nThe stick is the latest casualty in Microsoft's strategy to get into IOT, wearables and devices other than Xbox and PCs. Earlier this year the company announced it won't be releasing the Band 3 , putting an end to its fitness aspirations. Microsoft is also apparently killing the Lumia line of smartphones with no Surface Phone in sight.\nSee Also : 11 Shows to Watch If You Loved Stranger Things \nChromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick: Face-Off PS4 vs. Xbox One: Which Console Is Right for You?

      "text": "CHANNEL: Digital Workplace Microsoft users who create an Office 365 Group automatically get a SharePoint team site, too. PHOTO: Ruslan Burlaka \nNow you can create connected SharePoint Online team sites in seconds, Microsoft promises. Acting on a promise it made in August, Microsoft is introducing SharePoint and Office 365 team sites integration. \n\"No matter where users create an Office 365 Groups group (from Outlook, Microsoft Teams, Yammer and more), they will consistently get a full-powered, modern SharePoint Online team site,\" Microsoft explained in a blog post. \nAs of today, the functionality is available to all First Release customers. It will be gradually rolled-out to other Office 365 customers over the coming weeks. Joining Office 365 Groups, SharePoint \nOffice 365 Groups is a service that enables teams to come together by creating a single team identity and a single set of permissions across Office 365 apps. \nSharePoint team sites provide a place where teams can communicate, share documents and work together on projects. They are easy to use and enable users create a site for every project the team is working on. \nTeam sites are accessible on all kinds of devices so can be used by mobile workers too. \nHere's how the new integration works. When someone creates an Office 365 Group, the service will automatically create a SharePoint team site (with the appearance controlled by the team site administrator) that can include pages, lists, libraries and team news. \nThis is just the latest upgrade to team sites, which also received new document editing and collaboration capabilities at in August . That upgrade also introduced several changes to web parts, enabling users add documents, videos, images, site activities, Yammer feeds, as well documents. \nMicrosoft indicated there are even more upgrades to come. SharePoint 2016 Feature Pack 1 \nThe team sites upgrade is part of a wider set of upgrade announcements from Microsoft for SharePoint. \nThe company also unveiled Feature Pack 1 for SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Online. While a lot of the improvements this time around are for administrators, there are also a few for business users — including one that makes hybrid cloud and on-premises deployments easier to control. \nOf note in this respect is SharePoint Insights, a new hybrid feature that aims to provide better management of hybrid environments by offering access to reports and dashboards in Office 365. \nIn addition Hybrid Taxonomy, which has been released in preview, enables users to bring their taxonomy store to Office 365. Using it, enterprise will be able to create a single-source for developing and managing Terms, Term Sets and Groups through a single Managed Metadata Service. \nOther changes worth noting is the new design for OneDrive for Business that provides a cleaner and easier to use user experience through one click access to commonly used functions like edit, upload and share. \nMicrosoft has also made file management a lot easier with the introduction of drag-and-drop features for folder management that works a lot like it does with folders on PCs.",

      "text": "Advertisement \nIt seems like Microsoft is planning to Insider All The Things these days. \nRight now the Redmond company has Insider programs for some of their biggest products such as the Windows Insider Program , the Office Insider Program and the recently announced Xbox Insider Program . \nThe basic premise is that you gain access to early versions of these products for the purpose of testing them and providing feedback. Some of that feedback is collected through telemetry automatically and other items can be submitted by testers as they use the software. \nIt seems this Insider thing has become the trend these days across the tech industry but here is the reality - Insiders are really just a fancy name for beta testers. \nThe big change these days is the automatic telemetry collection which is required for participation in these Insider programs. Before companies like Microsoft had this telemetry capability they depended upon the testers to submit feedback manually but many of those individuals would never submit one piece of feedback despite using the beta software. \nObviously, this telemetry collection is working because whether an Insider ever submits one manual piece of feedback the company is still collecting telemetry from them to see how they are using the service and if it experiences any issues. \nNow more products and services are getting their own Insider programs at Microsoft and the latest to join the fray is the Skype Team . \nThe goal of the Skype Insider Program is very much like similar offerings: You will have early access to Skype software and services updates and improvements. You will be able to give early feedback on these improvements and as well as help us iron out any quirks before we release them broadly. On top of that you will be able to submit your suggestions on what you would like to see in the Skype app in the future \nIf you are interested in providing specific feedback or just letting the team collect telemetry you can sign up today to participate . \nHow many Insider programs are you participating in these days? \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

As with most of the test builds of the Creators Update so far, there are relatively few new features in today's test build. \nFor PC testers, Microsoft did add to this build the ability to more easily control external monitors from tablets by not requiring users to attach a mouse. There are some Sticky Note updates, including support for \"Insights\" in more languages. Microsoft also improved Windows Ink Workspace in this build with various tweaks. \nMicrosoft also made a number of additional, smaller fixes to both PC and Mobile test builds with 14965. And as usual, there are known issues for both PC and Mobile , itemized in the November 9 blog post about the new build. \nMicrosoft officially christened Redstone 2 as the Creators Update on October 26. \nOfficials said to expect the Creators Update release , due in the Spring of 2017 ( March, 2017, is the ship target , my sources have said) are a number of new 3D-enabling capabilities and Windows Holographic shell integration. The Creators Update also will include new enterprise security capabilities in the form of \"Project Barcelona,\" which uses Windows 10 containers to isolate and remove threats, as well as improvements to how users can access their most frequent contacts through Windows MyPeople . \nIn other Windows 10 news, Microsoft rolled out new cumulative updates to all the various flavors of Windows 10 as part of this week's Patch Tuesday. Microsoft updated the 1507, 1511 and 1607 builds of Windows 10. The list of what's new for each is available on t his Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Update history page . More Windows 10",

      "title": "MParallel: batch processor with multi-threading support",
      "text": "MParallel is a free command line program for Microsoft Windows devices that enables you to run multiple tasks you specify in parallel.\nIt is probably best to start with a few examples to showcase how powerful MParallel actually is. At a basic level, you could run multiple commands that you can execute from the command line in parallel.\nThink of five ping commands to different destinations for example that can run in parallel.\nFrom there, you may explore advanced options like finding all jpg images in a directory and converting them to png format using ImageMagick, or doing the same for video files.\nMParallel \nThe program ships as a portable program. Simply download the latest archive for your operating system -- there is a 32-bit and 64-bit version, and the source code -- and extract the archive when the download completes.\nOnce done, you may want to run the command mparallel.exe --help to display the list of supported options.\nYou will notice that there are quite a few that it supports. Generally speaking, it is necessary to begin the command with the program's parameters before you add the programs that you want executed.\nThe command MParallel.exe --count=3 ping.exe -n 16 fsf.org : ping.exe -n 16 gnu.org : ping.exe -n 16 w3c.org begins with --count=3 which tells MParallel that there will be three commands that you want run in parallel.\nThis is a basic example, and there is a lot more that you can do. For instance, instead of specifying commands directly, you could tell the program to look for them in a text file instead. This can be useful if you want lots of commands to be executed, or better editing and management options for those commands.\nYou'd achieve that by using --input=commands.txt, and adding each command to a line in the text file.\nA slightly more complicated command is the following one: dir /b *.jpg | MParallel.exe --shell --stdin ---pattern=\"copy {{0}} {{0:N}}.png\" \nThis uses the dir command to find all .jpg images, to run MParallel and rename the files to .png. Not something that you want to do, but it showcases several new options such as running shell commands, and using pattern.\nThe package ships with two example command files that you may look at for additional examples. The first uses MParallel in conjunction with ImageMagick to convert jpg images to png files, the other FFmpeg to convert avi files to mp4 files.\nClosing Words MParallel is a mighty program that may take some getting used to time but if you worked with the command line or batch files before, you should feel at home right away. Probably the biggest advantage of it is that it lets you run commands in parallel which should speed up execution significantly on modern systems.\nNow You : Do you use the command line at all?\n \n \nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post MParallel: batch processor with multi-threading support appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "title": "Microsoft says it's fixed the latest Surface Pro 3 battery issues with new firmware update",
      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIt's been a while since Surface Pro 3 owners received a new firmware update. The last one to roll out was on August 29 , which Microsoft said delivered a fix for earlier battery life issues on its high-end Windows 10 tablet. But a few weeks later, in mid-October, fresh complaints about battery life problems emerged from users who hadn't been affected by the earlier issues. \nThe first round of complaints focused on Surface Pro 3 tablets that shipped with batteries manufactured by Simplo, but the newer issue affected LGC batteries instead. Many of those affected said the LGC batteries were draining within a couple of hours from a 100% charge, but some reported that their batteries weren't charging at all , and others said they were completely unable to use their Surface Pro 3 unless it was plugged in. \nMany users were convinced that the LGC battery problems were caused by the firmware update that resolved the issue for the Simplo batteries - a claim that Microsoft refuted. The company told Neowin on September 22 that it was working on identifying the cause of the problem, and developing a fix. Now, almost seven weeks later, that fix is finally available. \nA new system firmware update, dated November 7, is now available for the Surface Pro 3. On its Surface Update History page , the company says that the update \"corrects the firmware component that functions as a 'fuel gauge' so that the battery capacity is accurately reported\". \nIn a more detailed explanation of the cause of the problem, Microsoft said: \nOn a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices, an error condition occurs that causes the full charge capacity of the battery to be misreported to the operating system and device firmware. When this condition occurs, the system no longer charges the battery to its full actual capacity, and the Surface is unable to function on battery power. \nThink of this like a fuel gauge in a car, where the car looks to the fuel gauge to determine how much to fill the tank. In this case, if the fuel gauge isn’t working right, the car would also not be able to fill the tank—even though the tank is fine. \nIt said that its latest firmware update \"allows the Surface to once again leverage the maximum charge of the battery\", adding: \nOnce this fix is applied to a Surface Pro 3, the reported full charge capacity will self-correct over the next several charge and discharge cycles. Surface Pro 3 devices that previously experienced the problem can now operate on battery power, and the issue won’t occur on devices that haven't experienced the issue. \nTo install the update, go to Start > Settings > Update & security > Windows Update , and select Check for Updates . This should bring up System Firmware Update - 11/7/2016 , allowing you to install the update. \nBefore installing, you should ensure that your Surface Pro 3 is plugged into AC power directly, not via the Surface Docking Station, and that all USB devices and external monitors are disconnected. Microsoft warns that you should \"not disconnect from AC power while the system firmware update is being applied.\" Once the update is installed, you'll be returned to Windows, but Microsoft adds that \"you'll need to do another restart for the new battery logic to take effect.\" \nMicrosoft emphasized that the batteries in affected tablets \"weren't damaged in any way\". The company also said that to ensure \"the most reliable operation\", the new update should be installed on all Surface Pro 3s, but added that \"the new battery driver logic will only take effect on the limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices impacted by this issue\".

      "text": "Reddit \nMicrosoft has announced some big changes to its Xbox Preview Program. First and foremost, it’s no longer being called the Xbox Preview Program, but rather the Xbox Insider Program. Microsoft says this change is being made to reflect “how we are expanding to offer opt-in opportunities to provide feedback,” on the Xbox platform. \nWith this change in name comes changes to the way the Insider Program works. The Xbox Preview Dashboard has been renamed the Xbox Insider Hub, and it offers new features like a new UI and support for multiple Insiders to give feedback from the same console. It’ll also offer personalized announcement so Insiders can find content that’s relevant to them. \nThe changes to the Hub are rolling out now to a “small number” of users who have given a significant amount of feedback in the Xbox Preview Program. If you have your console set to instant-on mode, there’s nothing else you to do to get the update – the Xbox Preview Dashboard will be updated to the Insider Hub automatically. This update will eventually become available to all existing Xbox Preview users in the coming weeks. \nFinally, that expansion Microsoft mentions is a rather big one, as it’s now allowing all Xbox One owners to opt-in to the Xbox Insider Program. Those interested in participating simply need to download the Xbox Insider Hub and begin opting into previews. Microsoft notes that Xbox system updates won’t be available to new Xbox Insiders, only those that have been testing them as part of the Xbox Preview Program. \nStill, even without the ability to test system updates, you’ll be able to preview new apps or games that are still in development. If you’re interested in signing up for the program but need to know more, Microsoft has put together a handy little FAQ that answers all sorts of questions about it.",

      "text": "Microsoft Confirms Acquisition of Cloud Security Company Adallom Advertisement \nEver since Cloud computing came along, many business and IT management-types have wrestled with feelings of insecurity: Are we secure? How do we know? How do we measure? \nThat depends in large measure on the vendors who are managing your status in the Cloud, and their implementation of and adherence to best practices, as well as their adoption of prudent new practices as those come along and evolve. \nOur feelings of security, and our success in the security realm, also depends on our understanding of just what the Cloud represents, and the degree of reliance we place on any particular piece of the Cloud. \nWe can focus on some basic security considerations here, and I think this audience knows what Cloud computing is. However, we can briefly consider Cloud computing to be: 1) Platform as a Service (PaaS); 2) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); and 3) Software as a Service (SaaS). \nThere are distinct business advantages in shifting the burden for capital expenditures and associated maintenance to an outside entity – to include a reduced burden for number of staff, and the “inside” need to maintain that staff’s currency for changing and evolving environments. Of course, reductions of staff are not necessarily good for IT department members (and certain allied business staff), but we must acknowledge what the business edge is going to consider. \nThe chief concern for any organization, and therefore any IT senior staff who may be considering general recommendations or specific responses to business questions, is that whenever control of anything goes outside of your “four walls,” you lose a large measure of control. We all rely on outside providers and the overall infrastructure of the internet, but as one example: A server in your server room, under the watch of your own internal staff, is not the same as an amorphous server “in the Cloud”– no matter how trusted and/or large the vendor, no matter how solid their reputation. True, for outside elements, you can bear down on providers, you can make contracts as tight as you can possibly make them. But, on the day you experience equipment failure, data loss, data breach, etc. – and a resultant loss of your own ability to deliver service, content, access… to your customers, members, constituents, staff – none of your “remote” oversight much matters in that moment . \nNothing beats internal security (if you’re doing things right). You can readily survey and adapt security for inside elements – you’re in direct control, in any direct moment. Also, you directly access and manage the personnel who manage security and the aforementioned platform(s), infrastructure, and software. You can assess any breach potentials and make corrections of course on your terms, on immediate terms, on as strict of terms as you like. You can establish your regularized schedules of oversight. Cloud elements require trust, and a relinquish of control. \nOn the other hand, it has been argued that Cloud providers have a natural incentive to mount trust, and to brand Cloud computing with security. No doubt – but any provider has the incentive for providing reliability as a matter of securing reputation and staying in business. \nRemember this: \nIn the realm of risk, unmanaged possibilities become probabilities… \n“Risk” is the operative word here: You must actively manage against the possibility of security breaches, or episodes of inoperability, for anything the Cloud is delivering to you, for you, or operating on your behalf. Most data and security breaches are due to human error – and “outages” are security breaches in my mind. If you have an outage of any sort, your business or any particular element can hardly be called “secure.” Therefore, awareness and common sense are key in bringing best practices and wholly new practices in the realm of insuring your piece of the Cloud. \nIf you’re in the Cloud or taking any element, or additional elements, to the Cloud – it might do to have a regularized security meeting with the allied vendors. Make the schedule to be whatever suits you: Annually, semi-annually, quarterly… insist that your vendors make a presentation to you for where security measures stand, how they’ve evolved from the last meeting (improvements), and what the projections are for the future and what can be expected as reportage at the next meeting. Continue this cycle in perpetuity. \nWhat imaginative, evolving, practices are you bringing to your extended environment in terms of vendor accountability? Is your Cloud security forecast sunny… or cloudy?",
