      "text": "It’s been roughly five years since the final “Harry Potter” film rolled across big screens everywhere, yet the franchise is still a beast — one with a great deal of earning power.\nThis weekend, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” will look to conjure box-office success, with the same magic that has enthralled fans for almost two decades.\n“Fantastic Beasts” is the first film in a five-film franchise adapted from J.K. Rowling’s 2001 book by the same title. In it, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne plays eccentric wizard Newt Scamander, who arrives in 1920s New York with a suitcase of magical creatures. A chunk of the film is spent tracking down some of the creatures that escape the case, but “Fantastic Beasts” is more than that. The film, like many of its “Harry Potter” predecessors, mixes hilarity with relevant themes that make for a deeper, more nuanced narrative.\nMovie Trailer: 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' (2:34) Watch the new film trailer for \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" starring Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander. The movie takes place in New York's secret community of witches and wizards 70 years before Harry Potter starts school at Hogwarts. Photo: Warner Bros.\nSee also: Financial wizard Daniel Radcliffe hasn’t spent his ‘Harry Potter’ money\nBox Office analysts forecast \"Fantastic Beasts” — stamped with a $180 million production budget — will bring in $82 million for Time Warner Inc.’s TWX, +1.74% Warner Bros. in its opening weekend. Warner Bros. is reportedly guiding for an opening closer to $70 million. The eight “Harry Potter” films averaged $103 million during their debut weekends, with the finale “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2” opening to $169.2 million. But “Fantastic Beast” isn’t quite a “Harry Potter” film.\n“There is virtually no concrete connection to the existing Harry Potter universe we all know and love,” wrote analysts at Box Office. “Warner Bros. had already announced plans for a second and third installment, also to be written by Rowling. Is Warner Bros. counting chickens before they hatch?”\nMaybe so, but just about all things wizarding world of Harry Potter have been a success; from Rowing’s Pottermore website, giving fans updates and deeper insights in the wizarding world, to this year’s “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” West End play and script book.\n“We’re very excited about ‘Fantastic Beasts.’ We think [it] will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms.” Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes Scholastic Corp. SCHL, +0.99% which has published all seven “Harry Potter” books plus “Cursed Child,” told investors that the latter helped more than double fiscal first-quarter revenue in the children’s publishing and distribution segment.\nCheck out: Harry Potter is about to upend the publishing business in a whole new way\n“Sales of the initial print-run demonstrate the continued strong enthusiasm and excitement for all things Harry Potter,” Scholastic Chief Executive Richard Robinson said during the company’s quarterly conference call.\n“We are looking forward to the release of the ‘Fantastic Beasts’ original screenplay by J.K. Rowling late in the second quarter, as well as licensed publishing related to the film and the original ‘Harry Potter’ movies.”\nComcast Corp. CMCSA, +1.07% is still reaping benefits from the “Harry Potter” craze as well, thanks to the Harry Potter world theme parks at its Universal Studios parks and resorts. During the company’s most recent quarterly conference call, Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh said theme park revenue increased more than 60% driven by the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction opening in Hollywood. And two years ago Universal’s Orlando, Fla., park expanded its Harry Potter attraction.\n“We’re very excited about ‘Fantastic Beasts,’” Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said during the company’s quarterly conference call on Nov. 2. “We think [it] will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms.”\nWeekend top 10 box office estimates Rank Title Distributor Weekend estimate (millions) Estimated domestic gross (millions) Rotten Tomatoes rating 1 “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” Warner Bros. $82.0 $82.0 83% 2 “Trolls” 20th Century Fox $21.5 $120.8 74% 3 “Doctor Strange” Disney $20.0 $184.6 90% 4 “Arrival” Paramount Pictures $15.7 $47.5 93% 5 “The Edge of Seventeen” STX Entertainment $11.0 $11.0 93% 6 “Hacksaw Ridge” Lions Gate $7.4 $43.8 85% 7 “Almost Christmas” EuropaCorp $6.8 $25.5 48% 8 “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” Sony Pictures/TriStar $4.5 $4.5 48% 9 “The Accountant” Warner Bros. $3.1 $82.3 51% 10 “Bleed for This” Open Road Films $3.0 $3.0 69% BoxOffice.com, Rotten Tomatoes While all but expected to finish No. 1 at the box office, “Fantastic Beasts” isn’t the only film opening in theaters this weekend.\n“The Edge of Seventeen,” STX Entertainment’s coming-of-age comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld, is expected to break the weekend’s top five earners and bring in $11 million in its opening, according to Box Office forecasts. The film cost just $9 million in production costs.\n“Going up against ‘Fantastic Beasts’ is a tough order for any of the wide releases this weekend, but ‘Edge of Seventeen’ could be hurt more by the competition,” Box Office analysts wrote. “[Though] this has some of the makings of a sleeper hit, a movie that doesn’t debut high but keeps audiences coming into theaters long-term through word of mouth.”\nAlso read: Netflix’s new show ‘The Crown’ ushers in a new era of content spending\nMiles Teller stars in Open Road Films’ boxing biopic “Bleed for This” based on boxer Vinny Pazienza. The film, which carried a $6 million production budget, is expected to pull in $3 million in its opening.\n“Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” from Sony Pictures’ SNE, +0.82% TriStar label, is expanding last week’s limited New York and Los Angeles release and is expected to earn $4.5 million. Also opening this weekend are smaller films “Manchester by the Sea,” which has garnered some early Oscar buzz, and “Nocturnal Animals.”\nFilm Trailer: 'Manchester by the Sea' (2:24) Watch the film trailer for \"Manchester by the Sea,\" starring Michelle Williams, Casey Affleck, and Kyle Chandler.

That would be a 20% improvement from last weekend and up more than 7% compared with last year’s $145.8 million when Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.’s LGF, +1.07% “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2” opened during the same weekend.\nThe overall box office has brought in $9.7 billion so far this year and is up nearly 4% in the year to date.\nMore from MarketWatch Donald Trump's Influential Son-in-Law Proposed Passenger Jet Could Reach Supersonic Speeds Should Parents Engage Their Young Teen in Arguments?",

      "text": "Two of the biggest media companies in the world, Walt Disney Co ( NYSE:DIS ) and Time Warner ( NYSE:TWX ) , are responsible for much of the video entertainment we consume today, whether it be on television or in the movie theater.\nTime Warner's empire includes the Turner channels, TNT, TBS, CNN, and TCM, as well the valuable HBO, and Warner Bros. studios. Disney claims its famous parks and resorts, including Disney World and Disneyland, a host of media network such as ABC, ESPN, and the Disney Channel, its studio arm, which includes Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm, and consumer products such as toys and its retail stores.\nBoth stocks have faced similar challenges recently with the rise of cord-cutting, but have mostly traveled in tandem for the last five years, as the chart below shows.\nTWX data by YCharts\nStill, there are some important differences between the two companies that could cause their paths to diverge in the coming years. Let's take a closer look at what each company has to offer.\nImage Source: Motley Fool.\nThe House of Mouse Disney is much more than the traditional assets associated with that name these days. In fact, the company's most important property may be ESPN, the sports media powerhouse and the most valuable cable network, which charges subscribers upwards of $7, far more than any other cable channel.\nHowever, Disney stock has struggled since CEO Bob Iger acknowledged last summer that the network was losing subscribers. Following its earnings report earlier this month, the stock briefly sold off after Nielsen reported the company had lost 621,000 subscribers in just October, a figure Disney disputed. But Iger reassured investors that ESPN was just going through a transition phase, and that it still had a viable future ahead of it. So-called skinny bundles have mitigated subscriber losses, and the company sees a promising future connecting to customers digitally and through mobile devices -- and Iger said ESPN translates well to mobile.\nOutside of ESPN, results remain strong. Adjusted EPS grew 12% last year, and Iger's strategy of acquiring studios with intellectual property like Pixar, Marvel, and LucasFilm, which the company can then leverage into movies, rides, and toys, has been overwhelmingly successful and is a unique asset of Disney's. While growth is expected to be slow for the current year, the long-term picture still looks solid.\nImage Source: Motley Fool.\nYet another merger Time Warner shares spiked in October when it said it would be acquired by AT&T ( NYSE:T ) for $85 billion, or $107.50 a share. An acquisition seems like a fitting coda for a company that is perhaps best-known for a series of mergers, starting with Time Inc and Warner Bros., which then merged with AOL in what's recognized as one of the worst mergers of all time. Time Warner later dumped AOL and Time Inc, which owns several newsmagazine outlets.\nTime Warner shares jumped more than 10% on the news over a two-day period, but still trade at a substantial discount to the buyout price -- nearly 20% less. That's a sign that the market believes regulators could block the deal. Before being elected president, Donald Trump said he would not allow the tie-up, and that decision is seen as an indicator of his attitude toward big business mergers. Even if it passes, the deal will face substantial regulatory scrutiny before it's cleared.\nLike Disney, Time Warner faces a substantial threat from cord-cutting, as about 80% of its operating income comes from its cable networks. It's already gone over-the-top with HBO Now, though reports indicate that the streaming service has been slow to add subscribers. The company's willingness to sell itself to AT&T also seems to be an indication that CEO Jeff Bewkes believes the company is better off joining with a service provider like AT&T that can connect Time Warner's content directly to customers. In other words, the stock may struggle to reach $107.50 without it in his view. In the recent earnings report, Bewkes said, \"Combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategies.\"\nThe offer from AT&T is half-cash, half-stock.\nDisney by a whisker Both stocks are facing similar secular challenges, and are valued at nearly the same P/E ratios. But Disney's wealth of intellectual property and its ability to leverage that content with its theme parks, toy licensing, and video entertainment makes it a stand-out company in the media industry. Though the decline of ESPN will present short-term headwinds, the company's other businesses appear to have solid growth ahead of them.\nTime Warner's stock could pop if the merger with AT&T is approved, but its long-term prospects look dimmer as it's even more dependent on the traditional Pay-TV ecosystem.\nDisney looks to be the better buy here.",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes expects the 'Harry Potter'-adjacent film to be a global hit across all platforms\nIt's been roughly five years since the final \"Harry Potter\" film rolled across big screens everywhere, yet the franchise is still a beast -- one with a great deal of earning power.\nThis weekend, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" will look to conjure box-office success, with the same magic that has enthralled fans for almost two decades.\n\"Fantastic Beasts\" is the first film in a five-film franchise (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-more-films-in-harry-potters-world-will-benefit-time-warner-2016-10-14) adapted from J.K. Rowling's 2001 book by the same title. In it, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne plays eccentric wizard Newt Scamander, who arrives in 1920s New York with a suitcase of magical creatures. A chunk of the film is spent tracking down some of the creatures that escape the case, but \"Fantastic Beasts\" is more than that. The film, like many of its \"Harry Potter\" predecessors, mixes hilarity with relevant themes that make for a deeper, more nuanced narrative.\nSee also:Financial wizard Daniel Radcliffe hasn't spent his 'Harry Potter' money (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-daniel-radcliffe-hasnt-spent-his-harry-potter-money-2016-10-06)\nBox Office analysts forecast \"Fantastic Beasts\" -- stamped with a $180 million production budget -- will bring in $82 million for Time Warner Inc.'s (TWX) Warner Bros. in its opening weekend. Warner Bros. is reportedly guiding for an opening closer to $70 million. The eight \"Harry Potter\" films averaged $103 million during their debut weekends, with the finale \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\" opening to $169.2 million. But \"Fantastic Beast\" isn't quite a \"Harry Potter\" film.\n\"There is virtually no concrete connection to the existing Harry Potter universe we all know and love,\" wrote analysts at Box Office. \"Warner Bros. had already announced plans for a second and third installment, also to be written by Rowling. Is Warner Bros. counting chickens before they hatch?\"\nMaybe so, but just about all things wizarding world of Harry Potter have been a success; from Rowing's Pottermore website, giving fans updates and deeper insights in the wizarding world, to this year's \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" West End play and script book.\nScholastic Corp. (SCHL), which has published all seven \"Harry Potter\" books plus \"Cursed Child,\" told investors that the latter helped more than double fiscal first-quarter revenue (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/scholastics-revenue-boosted-by-harry-potter-play-2016-09-22) in the children's publishing and distribution segment.\nCheck out:Harry Potter is about to upend the publishing business in a whole new way (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-newest-harry-potter-is-a-play-thats-expected-to-sell-like-a-book-2016-07-29)\n\"Sales of the initial print-run demonstrate the continued strong enthusiasm and excitement for all things Harry Potter,\" Scholastic Chief Executive Richard Robinson said during the company's quarterly conference call.\n\"We are looking forward to the release of the 'Fantastic Beasts' original screenplay by J.K. Rowling late in the second quarter, as well as licensed publishing related to the film and the original 'Harry Potter' movies.\"\nComcast Corp. (CMCSA) is still reaping benefits from the \"Harry Potter\" craze as well, thanks to the Harry Potter world theme parks at its Universal Studios parks and resorts. During the company's most recent quarterly conference call, Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh said theme park revenue increased more than 60% driven by the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction opening in Hollywood. And two years ago Universal's Orlando, Fla., park expanded its Harry Potter attraction.\n\"We're very excited about 'Fantastic Beasts,'\" Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said during the company's quarterly conference call on Nov. 2. \"We think [it] will be a global hit, not just at the box office, but in consumer products and across all platforms.\"\nWeekend top 10 box office estimates Rank Title Distributor Weekend estimate (millions) Estimated domestic gross (millions) Rotten Tomatoes rating 1 \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" Warner Bros. $82.0 $82.0 83% 2 \"Trolls\" 20th Century Fox $21.5 $120.8 74% 3 \"Doctor Strange\" Disney $20.0 $184.6 90% 4 \"Arrival\" Paramount Pictures $15.7 $47.5 93% 5 \"The Edge of Seventeen\" STX Entertainment $11.0 $11.0 93% 6 \"Hacksaw Ridge\" Lions Gate $7.4 $43.8 85% 7 \"Almost Christmas\" EuropaCorp $6.8 $25.5 48% 8 \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk\" Sony Pictures/TriStar $4.5 $4.5 48% 9 \"The Accountant\" Warner Bros. $3.1 $82.3 51% 10 \"Bleed for This\" Open Road Films $3.0 $3.0 69% BoxOffice.com, Rotten Tomatoes\nWhile all but expected to finish No. 1 at the box office, \"Fantastic Beasts\" isn't the only film opening in theaters this weekend.\n\"The Edge of Seventeen,\" STX Entertainment's coming-of-age comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld, is expected to break the weekend's top five earners and bring in $11 million in its opening, according to Box Office forecasts. The film cost just $9 million in production costs.\n\"Going up against 'Fantastic Beasts' is a tough order for any of the wide releases this weekend, but 'Edge of Seventeen' could be hurt more by the competition,\" Box Office analysts wrote. \"[Though] this has some of the makings of a sleeper hit, a movie that doesn't debut high but keeps audiences coming into theaters long-term through word of mouth.\"\nAlso read:Netflix's new show 'The Crown' ushers in a new era of content spending (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-is-pouring-money-into-some-of-tvs-most-expensive-shows-2016-09-28)\nMiles Teller stars in Open Road Films' boxing biopic \"Bleed for This\" based on boxer Vinny Pazienza. The film, which carried a $6 million production budget, is expected to pull in $3 million in its opening.\n\"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,\" from Sony Pictures' (6758.TO) TriStar label, is expanding last week's limited New York and Los Angeles release and is expected to earn $4.5 million. Also opening this weekend are smaller films \"Manchester by the Sea,\" which has garnered some early Oscar buzz, and \"Nocturnal Animals.\"\nThe top 10 films from the weekend are expected to garner $175 million, projects Box Office. That would be a 20% improvement from last weekend and up more than 7% compared with last year's $145.8 million when Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'s (LGF) \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 2\" opened during the same weekend.\nThe overall box office has brought in $9.7 billion so far this year and is up nearly 4% in the year to date.\n-Trey Williams; 19-16 0653ET\n ",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes expects the 'Harry Potter'-adjacent film to be a global hit across all platforms\nIt's been roughly five years since the final \"Harry Potter\" film rolled across big screens everywhere, yet the franchise is still a beast -- one with a great deal of earning power.\nThis weekend, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" will look to conjure box-office success, with the same magic that has enthralled fans for almost two decades.\n\"Fantastic Beasts\" is the first film in a five-film franchise (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-more-films-in-harry-potters-world-will-benefit-time-warner-2016-10-14) adapted from J.K. Rowling's 2001 book by the same title. In it, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne plays eccentric wizard Newt Scamander, who arrives in 1920s New York with a suitcase of magical creatures. A chunk of the film is spent tracking down some of the creatures that escape the case, but \"Fantastic Beasts\" is more than that. The film, like many of its \"Harry Potter\" predecessors, mixes hilarity with relevant themes that make for a deeper, more nuanced narrative.\nSee also:Financial wizard Daniel Radcliffe hasn't spent his 'Harry Potter' money (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-daniel-radcliffe-hasnt-spent-his-harry-potter-money-2016-10-06)\nBox Office analysts forecast \"Fantastic Beasts\" -- stamped with a $180 million production budget -- will bring in $82 million for Time Warner Inc.'s (TWX) Warner Bros. in its opening weekend. Warner Bros. is reportedly guiding for an opening closer to $70 million. The eight \"Harry Potter\" films averaged $103 million during their debut weekends, with the finale \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\" opening to $169.2 million. But \"Fantastic Beast\" isn't quite a \"Harry Potter\" film.\n\"There is virtually no concrete connection to the existing Harry Potter universe we all know and love,\" wrote analysts at Box Office. \"Warner Bros. had already announced plans for a second and third installment, also to be written by Rowling. Is Warner Bros. counting chickens before they hatch?\"\nMaybe so, but just about all things wizarding world of Harry Potter have been a success; from Rowing's Pottermore website, giving fans updates and deeper insights in the wizarding world, to this year's \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" West End play and script book.\nScholastic Corp. (SCHL), which has published all seven \"Harry Potter\" books plus \"Cursed Child,\" told investors that the latter helped more than double fiscal first-quarter revenue (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/scholastics-revenue-boosted-by-harry-potter-play-2016-09-22) in the children's publishing and distribution segment.\nCheck out:Harry Potter is about to upend the publishing business in a whole new way (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-newest-harry-potter-is-a-play-thats-expected-to-sell-like-a-book-2016-07-29)\n\"Sales of the initial print-run demonstrate the continued strong enthusiasm and excitement for all things Harry Potter,\" Scholastic Chief Executive Richard Robinson said during the company's quarterly conference call.\n\"We are looking forward to the release of the 'Fantastic Beasts' original screenplay by J.K. Rowling late in the second quarter, as well as licensed publishing related to the film and the original 'Harry Potter' movies.\"\nComcast Corp.

      "text": "Good afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Welcome back — after a much-needed Thanksgiving respite — to another edition of the Swerve newsletter. As President-elect Donald Trump continues to put together a cabinet, the incoming administration has been fairly quiet on a potential approach to AT&T Inc.’s T, +0.65% proposed $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc. TWX, +2.53% which Trump earlier vowed to block. The separate companies, however, have continued to make moves and news, and there’s plenty else happening in the broader media and entertainment landscape. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media .\nStandard-issue scrutiny: AT&T executives reportedly met with members of Donald Trump’s transition team, which told the telecom company its proposed merger would be scrutinized without prejudice, according to James Fontanella-Khan and David Crow at the Financial Times . Executives are apparently confident the deal can pass regulatory review. The report put shares of Time Warner on a path toward a 15-year high in Thursday trades.\nCandid news network: Despite the insults Donald Trump has hurled at the cable news network CNN, Turner Broadcasting Chief Executive John Martin isn’t batting an eye at Trump’s claims. “Please — ‘failing?’ ” he asked at a recent Recode event in New York. “I think [Trump] really cares about what CNN is saying.”\nI thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016 Martin said he couldn’t have been prouder of how CNN covered the election, before speaking about his parent company’s proposed tie-up with AT&T. Asked if AT&T could take a selfish approach to Time Warner’s HBO — which has been one of the concerns surrounding the deal — Martin said, “That’s a moronic thought.” He did concede there could be exclusive forms of content for AT&T subscribers, according to the Hollywood Reporter .\nAT&T coming online: AT&T pulled back the curtain on its much-talked-about over-the-top online live TV streaming platform DirecTV Now earlier this week. DirecTV Now had been heralded as an industry-shifting addition to the landscape, but the new service came on the scene more in line with existing offerings, as MarketWatch reported . And some analysts think the service will cannibalize traditional cable subscriptions.\nAnd DirecTV’s zero rating, meaning the service won’t count against AT&T customers’ data caps, raises concerns of stifling net neutrality , writes T.C. Sottek at the Verge. The FCC sent AT&T a letter over worries of that zero rating in November. The company argues that the practice benefits customers, the Wall Street Journal reported .\nDisney’s decade-old blueprint: Walt Disney Co.’s studio arm is on its way to posting the most successful year in film for a Hollywood studio, thanks to a dependable rotation of production studios in Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animations. The company is reaping the benefits of a strategy that began a decade ago with the $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar in 2006 and continued with deals for Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 .\n“This is the first year where all five brands have films being released in the same calendar year and what you’re seeing is the strategy [Bob Iger] certainly teed up through those acquisitions,” head of distribution at Walt Disney Studios, Dave Hollis, told MarketWatch .\nJudging competition: AT&T and Time Warner are on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s schedule for Dec. 7. The subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights will examine the competitive impact of the AT&T–Time Warner merger at 10 a.m. that Wednesday. A webcast will be available for the meeting on the committee’s website.\nAcquiring apps and audience: CNN has bought video-sharing startup Beme in a deal valued at about $25 million, as Wall Street Journal reporter Steven Perlberg wrote . The social-media app, created by popular YouTube star Casey Neistat, will allow CNN to tap into its large, young and digital audience.\nDownload complete: Netflix is rolling out a download feature for some of the platform’s movies and TV series. The new feature gives viewers — finally — a way to stream content on the go when cellular and/or wireless connections are spotty or even nonexistent.\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "AT&T is reportedly feeling confident about its ability to buy Time Warner after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team—even though Trump himself vowed to block the merger during his campaign.\n\"Donald Trump’s transition team has reassured AT&T that its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner will be scrutinized without prejudice,\" the Financial Times reported yesterday. \"After talking with the president-elect’s team, AT&T executives are confident that their deal has a good chance of passing regulatory scrutiny, people informed about the conversation said.\"\nTime Warner, the programming company that owns CNN and HBO, is a separate entity from Time Warner Cable, the ISP that was recently purchased by Charter Communications.\nTrump railed against AT&T's proposed purchase of Time Warner during a campaign speech in October. “As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said at the time . In that speech, Trump complained about the media's coverage of his campaign. Further Reading Trump, our next president, promised to block AT&T/Time Warner merger \nBut it wouldn't be a surprise to see Trump back down from his pledge to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger. AT&T is encouraged by Trump appointing \"former competition officials with a hands-off record on antitrust enforcement\" to his transition team, AT&T sources told the Financial Times. \nThat includes former Federal Trade Commission member Joshua Wright, who criticized \"[t]he new anti-merger fervor\" in a recent New York Times opinion article , saying that anti-merger sentiments are based on a false presumption that mergers always lead to higher prices instead of cost savings and product improvements.\nAs he prepares to shift the Federal Communications Commission from Democratic to Republican control, Trump has also appointed advisors who want to reduce regulatory burdens on telecom companies. That's likely good news for telecom companies that want to increase consolidation and face fewer consumer protection regulations.\nWhile it isn't 100 percent certain that the FCC will have a chance to review AT&T/Time Warner, a liberal Justice Department and FCC could be expected to scrutinize the deal on several grounds. As we've written in previous articles, owning Time Warner would give AT&T incentive to raise the prices that its rivals (such as Comcast, Charter, and Verizon) pay to distribute Time Warner programming on their cable TV systems, which could indirectly raise consumers' TV bills. AT&T could also harm online video services that compete against DirecTV by charging them higher prices for content or refusing to license videos. As it does with DirecTV, AT&T could favor Time Warner video on its mobile network by letting it stream without counting against the data caps applied to video services like Netflix.\nThough President Obama's FCC allowed AT&T to buy DirecTV last year, it prevented AT&T from buying T-Mobile in 2011 and Comcast's attempt to buy Time Warner Cable in 2015 . The FCC also recently said that AT&T may be violating net neutrality rules by allowing DirecTV video to stream without counting against mobile data caps while charging other companies for the same privilege.\nBut under Trump, those net neutrality rules could be overturned , and AT&T could end up securing another big merger approval.",
