      "text": "Business Ford Motor to raise $2.8 billion debt to fund new technology A Ford logo is seen on the grill of a 2015 F-150 truck outside the New York Stock Exchange in the Manhattan borough of New York. Photo: Reuters Published: 12:20 AM, December 6, 2016 Updated: 7:30 AM, December 6, 2016 \nDETROIT - Ford Motor Co <F.N> will raise $2.8 billion in long-term debt, according to a filing with U.S. securities regulators, funds which a senior executive said on Monday will help fund investments in new technology including self-driving cars. \nJoe Hinrichs, Ford president of the Americas region, said the funds would largely go for investment in new technology including electric vehicles, self-driving vehicles, and mobility efforts such as ride-sharing and ride-hailing. \n\"It’s an opportunistic time,\" Hinrichs told Reuters in an interview on Monday morning. \"It’s a supportive marketplace for long-term debt given where rates are, and we want to make sure that throughout the cycle of the industry we have the flexibility to do what we need to do and want to do, especially in the emerging part of the business.” \nIn a late Monday afternoon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford said it will raise $1.5 billion in 10-year notes with a yield to maturity of 4.356 percent and $1.3 billion of 30-year notes at 5.291 percent. ( http://corporate.ford.com/investors/reports-and-filings/sec-filings.html ) \nHinrichs, who has led Ford's Americas region for four years, said Ford has the manufacturing flexibility to make more of its Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large SUVs as the two models undergo their first total makeover in 14 years. \nHinrichs did not say how many of the new models it hopes to sell. \"Suffice to say it is a big opportunity for us,\" Hinrichs said of the new versions of the large SUVs. \nGeneral Motors Co <GM.N> has dominated the large SUV part of the U.S. auto business in recent years, although Ford invented the segment about two decades ago. \nThis year, through November, GM's four large SUVs have outsold Ford's two entries more than 3-to-1. But Ford's big SUV sales are up 33 percent this year, to GM's rise of 18 percent. \nIt is too early, Hinrichs said, to determine the impact of any changes that may come to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which President-elect Donald Trump has said he will renegotiate. \nLast week, as the U.S. unemployment rate showed a nine-year low, economists said the path is clear for an interest rate hike this month by the Federal Reserve.

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Christina Rogers\nFord Motor Co. will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business, tapping debt markets for the first time in nearly four years to fund investment in new technologies.\nThe No. 2 U.S. auto maker disclosed the debt issuance in a regulatory filing Monday and said it would take advantage of favorable market conditions to raise money for \"general corporate purposes.\"\nOnce awash in debt, Ford paid down its obligations in the years following the financial crisis to revitalize its balance sheet. General Motors Co. and Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, filed for bankruptcy in 2009 to erase billions of dollars in debt.\nAll three companies have taken on new debt in recent years even as profits soar. GM earlier this year issued $2 billion in new debt to shore up its pension plan for U.S. hourly workers.\nThe last time Ford issued new automotive debt was in January 2013, when it raised $2 billion in 30-year notes at 4.75%. Ford had $24.3 billion in automotive cash and $13.1 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter 2016.\n\"Consistent with our recent investor day presentations, we continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility,\" the company said in a statement.\nFord is moving to diversify its operations beyond its core business of building and selling cars, moving into new areas, such as ride-hailing and car-sharing, in a bid to catch up with deeper-pocketed Silicon Valley rivals trying to change the way consumers think about getting around.\nIn recent months, the car company has announced a series of new ventures aimed at broadening its mission, including purchasing a van-shuttle service in San Francisco and taking a stake in laser-sensor maker Velodyne Inc. which supplies components for autonomous cars.\nFord's Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview Friday the company plans to continue this strategy of betting small sums on startups and tech firms that can help it bolster expertise in emerging areas.\n\"We're always looking for appropriate partners but it comes down to what capabilities do we need,\" Mr. Fields said.\nThe company has also committed to spending $4.5 billion in the next three years to expand its lineup in electrified-vehicles and plans to release a fully autonomous car with no brake pedals or a steering wheel in 2021.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker's capital spending is expected to rise to 5.6% of revenue in the next two years from 4.9% in 2016, as Ford steps up investment and acquisitions related to new businesses.\nCorrections & Amplifications: Ford Motor will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Ford raised the $2.8 billion on Monday.

      "text": "Comments 'I think it's impossible to imagine ... if you've been subjected to the violence and seen the evil Dolores has seen, the pendulum wouldn't swing the other way,' says Lisa Joy of Dolores' action. \n\" Westworld \" isn't returning with the second season until 2018, but showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy are here to address some questions left open in the season finale. Among the shocking twists was when Dolores ( Evan Rachel Wood ), who is now fully conscious, killed Robert Ford ( Anthony Hopkins ) and shot the humans at the party. Asked if Ford is really dead, Nolan tells Deadline, \"Well, that version of Ford is dead.\" Responding to a similar question about whether or not Hopkins will be in season 2, Nolan coyly says to THR, \"I think with this show, you want to assume nothing.\" Of the violent scene, Joy says it's inevitable considering the situation that Dolores has been put through. \"I think it's impossible to imagine ... if you've been subjected to the violence and seen the evil Dolores has seen, the pendulum wouldn't swing the other way, as we see it starting to do in the finale,\" she explains. \"The question will be when the dust settles and the pendulum stops swinging, who will Dolores be?\" With the hosts now gaining consciousness, it will start revolution against their human oppressors. Joy says of this storyline, \"The control vs. chaos reminds me of the Langston Hughes poem, about what happens to a dream deferred. We've set this up as Dolores living in a dream, but it's someone else's dream. She can't live her own life. Then, at the end, we see. It explodes and goes out with a bang.\" The first season finale also sets up season's 2 expanding world with a scene in which Maeve ( Thandie Newton ) saw a floor full of Samurai warriors. \"We never had any intention of staying in one place. We don't want to shoot on the same sets for 10 years. We want to blow the sets up and move onto another piece of the story,\" Nolan says. Joy chimes in, \"We will ultimately encounter other worlds. Just when and where remains to be seen.\" Nolan adds, \"There are other places here. This park contains multitudes. We hope to explore that in the seasons going forward.\" \"Westworld\" ratings hit season high with the Sunday, December 4 episode, drawing 2.2 million viewers. It's up 7% from the penultimate episode. \n© AceShowbiz.com More Westworld News",

      "title": "Ford Is Set To Raise $2.8 Billion -- WSJ",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nFord Motor Co. will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business, tapping debt markets for the first time in nearly four years to fund investment in new technologies.\nThe No. 2 U.S. auto maker disclosed the debt issuance in a regulatory filing Monday and said it would take advantage of favorable market conditions to raise money for \"general corporate purposes.\"\nThe move comes after several years of banking big profits on increasing sales of trucks and sport utilities. The company has signaled it expects increased pressure as the U.S. light-vehicle market plateaus, regulatory costs increase and the race to make cars more autonomous heats up.\nOnce awash in debt, Ford paid down its obligations in the years following the financial crisis to revitalize its balance sheet. General Motors Co. and Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, filed for bankruptcy in 2009 to erase billions of dollars in debt.\nAll three companies have taken on new debt in recent years even as profits soar. GM earlier this year issued $2 billion in new debt to shore up its pension plan for U.S. hourly workers.\nThe last time Ford issued new automotive debt was in January 2013, when it raised $2 billion in 30-year notes at 4.75%. Ford had $24.3 billion in automotive cash and $13.1 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter 2016.\n\"Consistent with our recent investor day presentations, we continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility,\" the company said in a statement.\nFord is moving to diversify its operations beyond its core business of building and selling cars, moving into new areas, such as ride-hailing and car-sharing, in a bid to catch up with deeper-pocketed Silicon Valley rivals trying to change the way consumers think about getting around.\nIn recent months, the car company has announced a series of new ventures aimed at broadening its mission, including purchasing a van-shuttle service in San Francisco and taking a stake in laser-sensor maker Velodyne Inc. which supplies components for autonomous cars.\nFord's Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview Friday the company plans to continue this strategy of betting small sums on startups and tech firms that can help it bolster expertise in emerging areas.\n\"We're always looking for appropriate partners but it comes down to what capabilities do we need,\" Mr. Fields said.\nThe company has also committed to spending $4.5 billion in the next three years to expand its lineup in electrified-vehicles and plans to release a fully autonomous car with no brake pedals or a steering wheel in 2021.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker's capital spending is expected to rise to 5.6% of revenue in the next two years from 4.9% in 2016, as Ford steps up investment and acquisitions related to new businesses.\nCorrections & Amplifications: Ford Motor will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Ford raised the $2.8 billion on Monday.

      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nFord Motor Co. will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business, tapping debt markets for the first time in nearly four years to fund investment in new technologies.\nThe No. 2 U.S. auto maker disclosed the debt issuance in a regulatory filing Monday and said it would take advantage of favorable market conditions to raise money for \"general corporate purposes.\"\nThe move comes after several years of banking big profits on increasing sales of trucks and sport utilities. The company has signaled it expects increased pressure as the U.S. light-vehicle market plateaus, regulatory costs increase and the race to make cars more autonomous heats up.\nOnce awash in debt, Ford paid down its obligations in the years following the financial crisis to revitalize its balance sheet. General Motors Co. and Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, filed for bankruptcy in 2009 to erase billions of dollars in debt.\nAll three companies have taken on new debt in recent years even as profits soar. GM earlier this year issued $2 billion in new debt to shore up its pension plan for U.S. hourly workers.\nThe last time Ford issued new automotive debt was in January 2013, when it raised $2 billion in 30-year notes at 4.75%. Ford had $24.3 billion in automotive cash and $13.1 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter 2016.\n\"Consistent with our recent investor day presentations, we continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility,\" the company said in a statement.\nFord is moving to diversify its operations beyond its core business of building and selling cars, moving into new areas, such as ride-hailing and car-sharing, in a bid to catch up with deeper-pocketed Silicon Valley rivals trying to change the way consumers think about getting around.\nIn recent months, the car company has announced a series of new ventures aimed at broadening its mission, including purchasing a van-shuttle service in San Francisco and taking a stake in laser-sensor maker Velodyne Inc. which supplies components for autonomous cars.\nFord's Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview Friday the company plans to continue this strategy of betting small sums on startups and tech firms that can help it bolster expertise in emerging areas.\n\"We're always looking for appropriate partners but it comes down to what capabilities do we need,\" Mr. Fields said.\nThe company has also committed to spending $4.5 billion in the next three years to expand its lineup in electrified-vehicles and plans to release a fully autonomous car with no brake pedals or a steering wheel in 2021.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker's capital spending is expected to rise to 5.6% of revenue in the next two years from 4.9% in 2016, as Ford steps up investment and acquisitions related to new businesses.\nCorrections & Amplifications: Ford Motor will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Ford raised the $2.8 billion on Monday. (12/05/2016)\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 06, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

By Eric Goldman \nWarning: Full spoilers for the Westworld: Season 1 finale follow. \nWestworld’s first season has come to a close, and suffice to say, fans can’t wait to see what happens next – though they will indeed have to wait, unfortunately, as the show isn’t likely to rerurn until 2018 for Season 2. In the meantime though, I spoke to the show’s creators, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy – who co-wrote the season finale, with Nolan directing as well – to discuss the big reveals that occurred and what it means for the future. \nNolan and Joy weighed in on what we learned, what it could mean and more, including how they felt that some of their big reveals were being predicted online by a passionate group of Westworld fan theorists. \nIGN: I know you guys are going to have to evade some of my questions but I'm going to try, dammit! It felt like Ford was obviously very aware of what was about to happen at the end, but we should not take it that he in any way programmed Dolores to kill him, right? This was still her decision; just one that he was pretty sure was going to happen? \nJonathan Nolan: Yeah, or otherwise it betrays his point. There's a distinction there -- and it's a distinction that we're fascinated with and have been from the beginning -- between dictating someone's behavior and understanding it. And understanding it to a sort of grandiose level. That sort of plays in the space of fate and predestination and all these sorts of interesting things which are somewhat metaphysical with human beings, although not necessarily -- and we'll get back to that -- but with hosts are very literal. They're programmed to do things. And even within the program space in which they are improvising, in theory there's a sense, especially if you're the creator, in knowing where that's going to go… It's a conundrum of generating a truly random number generator, which is an interesting problem within mathematics and programming, because you need random numbers to have truly random behavior. It's actually very difficult. But yeah, in this moment, we're playing here with the distinction between Ford controlling what's going to happen and Ford understanding what's going to happen. \nIGN: Let me get out of the way, because it’s already been a theory from some fans - could there have been any host swap shenanigans or can you say that that was definitely the real Ford at the end? \nNolan: That was definitely a real Ford. \nIGN: Of course, the reveal about Ford leads us down other paths and questions. Should we assume he is behind re-programming Maeve? \nNolan: That's the strong implication of her storyline, is that it has been a feature of his overall plan here. Bernard has shown us -- and I'm sure all the lovely people over at Reddit have transcribed -- the programming of her plan. And the next step of her plan is not what she does at the end of the finale. What we're seeing there is both the kind of gut-wrenching realization that so much of the journey we've been on with her has been facilitated by Ford, who has apparently re-programmed her storyline toward a different narrative and also facilitated the overall security system cutting her a little a slack and letting her slide by. He has total control over this place, he's so absolute. We want to believe that what's happening here is free will and that belief is challenged. For me, that last moment with Maeve where she decides to get back off the train... We changed our approach in terms of shooting it. Everything that's taken her onto the train throughout the entire season has been steady cam or studio mode, and when she makes that decision and we pull her back on the train and for the first time and for the first time in the series, we're seeing handheld photography, which begins to suggest that we're entering a new phase with them. We just want to underline that visually a little bit. \nIGN: Before we move on, you did say “apparently” Ford is the one who reprogrammed her, so is there wiggle room there going into the next season? \nNolan: I just don't think the audience should assume anything. \nIGN: You mentioned Reddit in relation to the show. This the era of not just the internet but of social media and message boards and crowdsourcing theories. The show had a lot of fan enthusiasm from the second it premiered with everyone theorizing about it. Was the downside of that that some people are going to come up with the right answers? Did it bother you or did you kind of expect it going along the way? \nNolan: No, it's incredibly gratifying and exciting when people are... I mean, what you're doing there is writing in a language and code simultaneously for both the small portion of the audience -- which I fit into -- that loves to play with it and who loves to do the math on that and also the larger audience, equipping them so that when the turn comes, when Dolores realizes that she's made this tragic mistake of conflating two moments in her life and one person as two people, that it makes sense. That they felt it on a gut level. So a lot of things that are layered in there are for people to absorb on a subconscious level, and you know there is a certain portion of the audience absorbing it on a conscious level. I think the only bummer was that thought that was coming out of Reddit then finding its way not into articles, because for my entire career I've been lucky that people have spent the time to write articles about, \"Hey, what's really happening in this film or this series?\" That's incredibly gratifying and lucky for me. But usually that stuff is under a sort of spoiler heading. Here, it was trickier because these are theories and in so many of these shows the theories don't really add up to much. Here they add up to everything. The difference between a theory and a spoiler is tricky. Again, the only bummer for us was then seeing some of those \"theories\" winding up in headlines where the audience can't possibly avoid that. \nSomething that we're hoping in the second season is we might generally encourage reading about the show and writing about the show -- now that we all know that yes, the things we're putting in the show definitely always add up to something -- to try to help the audience protect that. Ironically, if we'd written these things as novels first, a la Game of Thrones, the audience would know that they weren't theories and would be helping protecting that experience for the rest of the audience. \nIGN: That's very true. \nNolan: Maybe we'll write the next season as a novel first and then the show after. [Laughs] \nIGN: You guys had the super fun reveal of this other park with the SW initials. Is it Samurai World, Shogun World? And did you know from the start you where going to introduce other parks just as the film had? \nNolan: We knew from the beginning we were going to introduce other parks. We knew from the beginning because the beautiful playful, somewhat incestual relationship between the great westerns and the great easterns of the '50s and '60s -- specifically, the Kurosawa films that were then remade as Magnificent Seven and all the delicious, my favorite Sergio Leone westerns, Yojimbo becoming a A Fistful of Dollars, etc. Given the nature, the meta nature of the narrative here, that it had to be… That Shogun would have to be the next world that we stepped into. Also, my personal collection of samurai swords was always something we could use. \nIGN: So Shogun World? Is that the name? \nNolan: You'll have to stay tuned. \nIGN: Elsie and Stubbs' fates were very ambiguous when last we left off with them. Are those two questions that we might get answers to fairly quickly in the next season? \nLisa Joy: Yeah, I think in the next season we'll definitely be exploring any loose ends that were left. Stubbs and Elsie are some of our favorite characters and so we deserve to know what happened to them, and we will. \nIGN: We know the basics now, but there are still specifics about William and Logan as young men left unexplained. Will Jimmi [Simpson] and Ben [Barnes] be a part of the show next season now that we know the true nature of who William is? \nJoy: [Dramatic pause] I think we're going to have to wait and see. \nIGN: \"Dramatic pause\" is going in the article for that one. \nJoy: He could ride that horse naked for… I don't know [how long]! [Laughs] \nIGN: The way the season ended with this double whammy of Dolores and Maeve's actions, even if things are contained quickly, it’s hard to imagine business as usual at the park next season. Safe to say a different dynamic is coming? \nJoy: I think any time you think that on this show something might be business as usual, go the opposite direction. \nIGN: Now that we’ve seen how the park functions normally, are you excited to approach the story from a different angle? \nJoy: Yeah, I think the possibilities of experimentation and reinvention in this series is part of what drew us to Westworld. It all happened from a very organic place. The first season was devoted to the emergent consciousness in these hosts. And now that they have their consciousness, now that they can hear their inner voice speaking to them, the question is, what are they going to do? \nIGN: We didn't go outside the park this season, beyond what was beneath it. Will we eventually venture elsewhere? \nJoy: I have a lot of faith in the hosts and their ability to unearth the mysteries of their universe in time. The question is just, how much time and which hosts shall blossom first? \nEric Goldman is Executive Editor of IGN TV.

      "text": "Print \nIt’s about time. The new Raptor, based on the current-generation Ford F-150, was unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show in January 2015. Almost two years ago. And the automaker has been teasing us with regular press releases since then, unveiling each nut and bolt of the vehicle at a time. \nThe wait’s finally over. This week, The Car Guide will be visiting the Anza-Borrego State Park in Southern California. That’s a desert, where the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor will feel right at home. \nGone are the 411-horsepower, 6.2-litre V8 and about 500 pounds of extra flab. The new Raptor features a lighter aluminum body as well as a twin-turbo, 3.5-litre V6 that develops 450 hp and 510 lb.-ft. of torque. It’s connected to a newly developed 10-speed automatic transmission. The truck is both more powerful and more fuel-efficient. \nThe Raptor also features an exclusive, torque-on-demand transfer case and a six-mode drive system for making this badass pickup the most capable off the beaten path. A long-travel suspension, redesigned FOX Racing Shox and new BFGoodrich KO2 tires also help. \nStay tuned for our report on the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor this week. Once we get all the sand out of our shoes and put the dust off our shorts. Related content",

      "text": "Published on December 6th, 2016 | by James Ayre 0 \nDecember 6th, 2016 by James Ayre The CEO of Ford, Mark Fields, has been quoted in a recent interview as saying that there’s no market for electrified cars — meaning that the company’s head thinks (or claims) that there’s no market for conventional hybrids, as well as for all-electrics and plug-in hybrids. I wonder what Toyota would have to say about that? Editor’s Note: And I guess Mark thinks ~400,000 Tesla Model 3 reservations are phonies? (Those were some convincing-looking robots in the reservation lines!) The interview (with Bloomberg ) also noted that Fields has already reached out to President-Elect Donald Trump, with the idea being that Ford would work to keep jobs in the US if the Trump Administration ends up pursuing various policies that Ford is keen on seeing implemented. These policies reportedly include loosened vehicle emissions standards, “clarified” safety regulations for self-driving vehicles, and various types of “tax reform,” as well as currency manipulation rules. A very unsurprising list there — typical modern corporate desires. And people wonder why we cover Tesla so much here at CleanTechnica . … If it weren’t for Tesla, the electric vehicle market as it now exists wouldn’t even be around. There is demand for electrified vehicles now, despite the comments by Fields. They may not hold a particularly notable market share as of yet, but then new technologies never do … until (and if) they reach a tipping point and displace older modalities. Is that tipping point approaching now? We’ll probably get a better idea of where things stand over the next 2–3 years as long-range all-electrics begin hitting the market. The year 2020 should be interesting as well, as that’s the year that Toyota will reportedly start mass producing long-range EVs , and several automakers plan to release long-range models around that time. Green Car Reports provides more: “Fields is concerned that current emissions standards will force automakers to produce hybrids and electric cars they won’t be able to sell, although it is the California Air Resources Board — not the EPA — that sets numeric requirements for sales of zero-emission vehicles. A July Technical Assessment Report issued by the EPA and other regulators found that automakers could meet existing national emission standards primarily by further improving the efficiency of internal-combustion engines.” Continuing: “Despite its plans to lobby for lower emissions standards, Fields said Ford remains committed to a previous goal of spending $4.5 billion on electrified vehicles by 2020, and offering some form of electrification on 40% of models globally. … Fields said the company acknowledges climate change as a threat (contrary to various statements by the president-elect), and wants to reduce its environmental impact.” So, there’s an acknowledgement of the massive problems that will accompany worsening anthropogenic climate change, but no interest in changing actual behavior/actions. That puts Fields and Ford in line with the vast majority of other people in the world currently — after all, who wants to give up vacations on the other side of the world from where they live? People deserve everything they have, why give it up? Isn’t that the conventional wisdom? To be fair to Fields, though, he probably just figures that although worsening climate change will literally mean death, starvation, drowning, mass migration, social breakdown, mutual scapegoating, and very nasty geopolitical conflicts for most people, it won’t affect him much, as he’s rich. I wonder if that’ll work out for him? Related Stories:",

      "text": "/ Home / News / Rumors In the United States, Ford and Ram Truck don’t have a mid-size pickup to call their own. Other than the tried-and-tested Frontier, the market currently offers the Tacoma, Colorado, Canyon, and the unibody Ridgeline. Mind you, the two manufacturers that got out of the game want back in, especially the peeps over at Ford. Mike Manley, the head of Ram Truck, let is slip that a revival of the Dakota is “ an opportunity for the brand .” In Ford’s case, sources close to the automaker told autoevolution that it’s true the Ranger is on track to return to the USA. Justo Armando y Belgrano, the New Programs project leader over at Ford Argentina, is one of the linchpins that are vital to the U.S.-spec Ranger. Managing the development and leading the build events for the “New Ranger (P375 ICA)” is how Belgrano rolls and, if all goes according to plan, the Ranger will start production in 2018 for the 2019 model year, at the very latest. Ford North America already laid the groundwork for the pickup’s arrival in the U.S. by signing an agreement with the United Auto Workers. According to it, the Wayne plant in Michigan will move production of the Focus and C-Max to Mexico, retool, then start from square one with the Ranger. No later than 2020, the next-generation Bronco will also start production in Michigan. Made until 2011 for the 2012 model year, the U.S. version of the Ranger was phased out because of the financial crisis that hit the United States hard at the end of the 2000s. Also, the advent of EcoBoost engines in the F-150 for the 2011 model year convinced many prospective customers of the Ranger to switch over to the bigger, more capable F-Series full-size workhorse. But that was then. Having seen that GM’s gamble on smaller trucks paid off with the Colorado and Canyon , FoMoCo is looking forward to grabbing a piece of the pie with a feature-packed lifestyle vehicle such as the new Ranger. Considering that General Motors' mid-size pickup trucks are available with a Duramax diesel, it’s highly likely for Ford to modify the 3.2-liter TDCi oil-burning engine in the European-spec Ranger for the U.S. Ranger. 2019 Ford Ranger US Ford Ranger production Ford diesel pickup truck",

      "text": "  Ford GT Testing At High-Speeds Proves Turbos Were A Mistake by Gabe Beita Kiser   It's hard to play \"Name That Exhaust Note\" when all you hear is a breeze. There’s something overpowering about Ford’s new GT that prompts drivers who get inside to reach for the throttle and experiment with the limits of the car. While the far-fetched statement remains unconfirmed, Ford claimed that the GT would have the best power-to-weight ratio of any car ever. That claim could have something to do with Ford’s own test drivers being pulled over for speeding in GT test mules because who wouldn’t want to conquer the tarmac with 600 turbocharged horsepower at the beckon call of your right foot? This driver sure didn’t. As a part of Ford’s teaser campaign for the GT, one of the V6-powered machines was sent down a test track at blistering speeds to prove to muscle car enthusiasts that yes, aerodynamics do actually count for something. However, the GT in the video doesn’t sound too aerodynamic. Either that or maybe its engine has had its voice completely cut out by the turbochargers because even with flying buttresses removing excess wind blockage from the body, the GT sounds like a jet about to take off. There is virtue in stealth, but we can assure Ford that most gearheads could care less for it. In either case, we can at least get an idea of the GT’s capabilities by watching the video.",

      "title": "Comment on Alliance Seeks Help From Congress To Block EPA From Finalizing 2025 MPG Requirements by Alan",
      "text": "48 mins ago by Jay Cole 4 Comments According to Alliance member Ford, and its CEO Mark Fields, people don’t really want the plug-in vehicles that the EPA and CARB are mandating (InsideEVs/Alex Wai) \nAfter years of being unable to sway the US government into their way of thinking, the “ Alliance of Automakers ” thought that a new administration would be the perfect opportunity to not only shoot down future C02/MPG mandates that call for a 54.5 fleet MPG average by 2025 (~38 mpg in real world terms) , but also possibly to get CARB back under their control. \nIt didn’t work out that way, and now they are looking for another way…any way, to wrestle back the power. Alliance: More trucks…less EVs! The Alliance had sent off a letter to the Trump administration about crushing CAFE and CARB just 48 hours after the election was over. However, the EPA realized there was still time on the current administration’s clock, and pushed out its review and recommendation to finalize the CAFE standards three weeks later on November 30th (~17 months ahead of the deadline to do so), which started a 30 day clock for public comment, before the Obama administration can give it “final approval” on December 30th. \nThe first response to all the happenings, was automotive CEOs like Ford’s Mark Fields publicly lashing out at the EPA , saying they had performed “ eleventh-hour politics” and “short-circuited a data-driven development of regulations”, while urging the Trump administration to “continue the dialog as planned”. \nBut apparently the strong talk was not adequate enough, as the “ Alliance ”– which is really just a shell entity so major automakers don’t have to use their own name directly (looking at you General Motors, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, VW, Mazda, Volvo, FCA (Fiat), Jaguar, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota ), have sent up a “Hail Mary” pass to try and stop the action – because undoing it, if enacted, is no easy thing – lots of paperwork, and lots of legal action lawsuits from environmental groups. Alliance wants Congress to attempt to block the final approval of the EPA review to lock in 2025 fleet MPG standards \nOn Monday, the Alliance asked congressional negotiators to add language, as a condition of an upcoming short term budget resolution, that would prohibit the Obama administration from giving “final approval” on the new regulation before it leaves office on January 20th. Only 1 OEM of the top 6 automakers in the US is notably absent from participation in the Alliance \nGloria Bergquist, a spokesperson for the Alliance stated: \n“EPA’s sudden and controversial move to propose auto regulations eight months early — even after Congress warned agencies about taking such steps while political appointees were packing their bags — calls out for congressional action to pause this rulemaking until a thoughtful policy review can occur.” \nTruthfully, the new administration has a lot of changes they want to bring about, and this particular one may not be a priority for them, as it would begin a very public feud with a lot of concerned parties that will subside – so the Alliance will likely have difficulty getting any language added to the funding bill, which will arrive next week. \nIf Congress is swayed, and does show the initiative to add the tough language as a condition of the funding, President Obama still does not have to sign it, but rather he could veto it. At this point, the future funding of America isn’t really Obama’s concern anymore, as he will be leaving office on January 20th.",

      "text": "Decoding Mainstream Automakers’ November US Sales Data PART 3 OF 9 How Ford’s Newly Launched Vehicles Drove November Sales By John Parker | Dec 5, 2016 11:02 pm EST Ford’s monthly sales \nRecently, Ford (F) has been struggling to revive its home market sales. To attract more customers, Ford launched several new vehicles in the US. Its November sales figures show that many of these newly launched vehicles have helped the company boost sales. Strength in newly launched models \nHigh demand for the Ford Super Duty truck, the new addition to the automaker’s F-Series, boosted its sales in November, as we discussed in the previous article. However, the Super Duty truck was not the only newly launched vehicle to do so. The newly released Lincoln brand models also seem to be gaining strength in the US market. \nIn November, vehicle sales for the Lincoln brand rose 19% YoY to 9,429 vehicle units. Higher demand for the newly launched Continental, MKX, and MKZ models were the primary drivers for this double-digit brand sales growth. Other key highlights \nLast month, the company sold about 60,079 Ford brand SUVs in the US market. This reflects positive YoY growth of ~20%. Sales of Ford’s key utility vehicle models such as Explorer, Edge, and Expedition increased YoY by 14%, 32%, and 75%, respectively. \nFor automakers ( IYK ), utility vehicles tend to have higher margins than small cars. In Ford’s case, higher utility vehicle sales could be helpful in protecting its margins. \nUS sales of heavyweight vehicles such as utility vehicles and trucks have risen significantly. This sales trend has benefited mainstream automakers such as Ford, General Motors ( GM ), Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ), and Toyota ( TM ). \nContinue to the next part for a look at General Motors’s US sales in November. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IYK\",\"GM\",\"F\",\"FCAU\",\"TM\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"iShares Dow Jones US Consumer Goods(ETF)\",\"General Motors Company\",\"Ford Motor Company\",\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.\",null]} X",

      "text": "Tweet \nAn evolving lineup that matches consumer demand is the hallmark of any healthy automaker, and Ford has no problem dropping unpopular models. \nThat’s the message delivered by Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of the Americas, who hinted that changes could be in store for the company’s car lineup in the face of a crossover and SUV-hungry marketplace. \nSpeaking with Automotive News yesterday, Hinrichs said the automaker’s main focus is on growing its SUV portfolio. \n“Over time, there should be some pruning of the portfolio to support growth in other areas,” he said. “We certainly intend to have a strong car base as well; we don’t know where the market’s going to go. But there will be some pruning over time as there should be in a nameplate and portfolio.” \nHinrichs’ comments come at a scary time for the traditional passenger car. Once the reigning queen of the automotive landscape, the segment has nosedived as more and more consumers choose boxy, do-everything utility vehicles. Sales of midsize cars are down 12 percent year-to-date, representing just 12 percent of the market. Compact cars saw their sales slip 5.5 percent YTD, while subcompacts fell 2.9 percent. \nOverall, the passenger car market has retracted by 9.1 percent in 2016. \nAt Ford, the small-car numbers aren’t any better. Actually, they’re worse than the industry average. Through the end of November, Focus sales are 17.2 percent lower than at this time last year, while the Fiesta is down 26.1 percent. Fusion and Taurus sales have fallen 10 and 11 percent, respectively. \nUnfortunately, Hinrichs wasn’t dishing details on Ford’s plan to firm up its passenger car line. The company already builds the Fiesta in Mexico, with the Focus tapped to join it very soon. Already, there’s a plan afoot to simplify Focus production , lowering costs on top of the savings realized by Mexican production. \nThe slow-selling C-Max hybrid will soldier until both it and the Focus vacate the Michigan Assembly Plant in 2018, with its role replaced by the upcoming Model E electric. Overseas, Ford broadened the Fiesta’s appeal by introducing lifestyle-oriented variants of the next-generation model, including a faux crossover Active model. We’re not sure yet whether the next-gen Fiesta is America-bound, but “soft-roader” variants of small cars are a growing niche. \nAs for the Fusion, it’s still a strong contender in the shrinking midsize segment. That leaves the Taurus, known mostly for its law enforcement fleet sales, as a potential candidate for the chopping block. Well, the retail version, anyways.",

      "text": "Prairie View Wins Ford HBCU Community Challenge First-place win includes $75K in grants and scholarships A- A A+ \nPrairie View A&M University, whose diverse team made up of black, white, Hispanic, and East Asian students, illustrates how diversity wins—literally. \nThe team of four chemical engineering students won Ford Motor Co.’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge, wowing the judges with an app that allows homeowners to monitor water and energy use in real time. \nSecond place went to Hampton University, which won $15,000; and third, to Johnson C. Smith University, which won $10,000. The Hampton team devised a program that tracks sea levels—useful for communities that experience periodic flooding. Johnson C. Smith students developed a project that raises freshwater fish for home consumption. \nI spoke with Raj Register, Ford manager of multicultural communications, to learn more: \nBlack Enterprise: What is the purpose of the Ford HBCU Community Challenge? \nRegister: The Ford HBCU Community Challenge is an extension of one of the Ford Fund’s signature educational programs, The Ford College Community Challenge. The program, conducted in partnership with the Tom Joyner [Morning Show] and Rickey Smiley Morning Show , encourages HBCU students to design community projects that address pressing community needs. \nWith the theme of “building sustainable communities,” students are encouraged to creatively address a tangible, unmet community need that touches at least one of four areas: mobility, alternative energy, sustainability/water, or systematic approaches to meeting community needs. Students who submit ideas to the Ford HBCU Community Challenge develop team work as they develop their plan and practice public speaking skills. \nBE: How does the challenge work? Can any HBCU submit to it? \nRegister: The challenge is national and open to any historically black college or university. Students are encouraged to create a group of up to four people to ideate an innovative proposal, while concurrently developing relationships with nonprofit organizations in their community, to support the implementation of the winning project. \nThe challenge is open for eight weeks and boasts strong innovative and pioneering proposals each year, which ultimately benefit at a minimum three communities a year. Students will work with their local community partner to implement their program and to track progress through the app. \nBE: Any other comments about the program? \nRegister: Since the inception of the program in 2013, the Ford HBCU Community Challenge has contributed $400,000 in scholarships, grants, and implementation funds. Each first-place team receives student scholarships, project implementation dollars, and scholarship funds for the HBCU, to assist in helping both communities and students go further. In addition, each second- and third-place winning HBCU receives funds to implement their projects. \n\nTo learn more, follow #FordHBCU. ﻿",

      "text": "Published on December 6th, 2016 | by Steve Hanley 2 December 6th, 2016 by Steve Hanley \nIn December, 1996, General Motors began leasing its innovative EV1 to customers in California. The EV1 generated a great deal of interest in electric cars but there was a reason why it was only available in California. The California Air Resources Board had promulgated regulations requiring manufacturers to sell zero emission cars if they want to continue doing business in the state. \nCalifornia has been the largest car market in the US for decades. As distasteful as the zero emissions rules were to car makers, they could not bring themselves to ignore California, so they did the next best thing. They created so-called “compliance cars”— vehicles that met the letter if not the spirit of the regulations. They were intended for sale only in California at first, but they were later made available in other states that adopted the CARB regulatory scheme. \nFor General Motors, the EV1 was how it planned to appease the CARB gods. People who leased one raved about its abundant power and nearly silent operation. But that didn’t stop GM from joining with other car makers to attack the rules CARB set down. The industry argued that electric cars were too expensive, there was an inadequate network of charging stations, and there was little demand among the general public for electric cars. Ultimately, the car companies prevailed and the rules were rescinded. \nAs soon as that happened, GM stopped building the EV1. When the outstanding leases were up, it quietly collected all of the cars and took them to a crusher where they were destroyed. There was a huge public outcry at the time, giving the lie to the claim that nobody wanted to buy an electric car. (See the movie Who Killed The Electric Car ?) People who had leased an EV1 were particularly upset and went around acting like someone had just shot the family dog. \nThat’s pretty much how things remained until Martin Eberhard created a marriage of lithium ion battery cells with the tzero sports car, an event that led more or less directly to the start of Tesla Motors. Today, Tesla has sold nearly 200,000 premium electric cars at prices comparable to the best luxury sedans from Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. In addition, some 380,000 people worldwide have plunked down $1,000 to reserve a Tesla Model 3, the midsize car due to go into production late next year. So much for their being no demand! \nIn addition, Tesla has reached into its own pocket to create a worldwide network of charging stations to address the concern that people who drive an electric car have that they will run out of battery power while away from home. \nNone of that has stopped Mark Fields, CEO of Ford, from puckering up to plant a big wet kiss on The Donald. Fields wants Trump to eviscerate the current emissions and fuel economy rules imposed by the EPA. Tired of all the sniveling by the manufacturers , the EPA last week went ahead and formalized an extension of those rules until 2025. “We can’t make any money!” Fields screams while the US auto industry is powering toward another year of strong sales. \nFields trots out the same tired shibboleths used by the industry 20 years ago to rail against electric cars — they are too expensive, there is no charging infrastructure, and nobody wants to buy the damned things in the first place. Nowhere in Field’s plaint is there any mention of the environment and how fossil fuels imperil the entire population of the world with premature death and disease. “Profits before people” has been the rallying cry for business in the United States ever since “Engine Charlie” Wilson told Congress in 1953 , “For years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa.” \n20 years on from the EV1, are electric cars any closer to public acceptance than they were in 1996? Despite the pulings and dark mutterings from Fields and his colleagues, the answer is a resounding “Yes!” The major German manufacturers have decided to dig deep to create a network of high power chargers in Europe (Ironically, Ford of Europe is part of that group.) Car companies all over the globe are racing to bring electric cars to market. That includes plug-in hybrids which some people think should not be called electric cars at all. \nThe Chevy Bolt is on its way to showrooms in California and Oregon as we speak. Mercedes is ramping up is EQ electric car division . Volkswagen is planning its own electric car brand known as I.D . In the end, what will put electric cars over the top is not range or price. The second revolution that is building strength every day is the shift from private car ownership to car sharing networks of autonomous driving cars. While a self driving car does not need to be electric to function, the two technologies go together like peanut butter and jelly. \nThe electric cars of today are like the early flip phones. Connected, self driving cars will be like iPhones. Once people experience the convenience and low cost associated with not owning a car at all and merely renting one on an as needed basis, there will be no turning back. Elon Musk has every intention of making the Model 3 the first new car every introduced with self driving capability from day one. The rest of the industry will be racing to catch up with Tesla once again. \nThe 20 year anniversary of the EV1 may look like not much as changed, but by the time its 30 year anniversary rolls around, the world of cars will have unalterably changed and there will be no going back. \nSource: AutoGlog , Green Car Reports \nNote to our readers: Recently I received a message from the management company that owns Gas2. It said a reader complained that I am too strident in my disdain for Donald J. Trump and asked me to tone down my remarks in the future. Here is my response: If you have the courage of your convictions, put your feelings in the comments section where you and I can have the advantage of feedback from other readers. Don’t go crawling up the back stairs trying to influence my stories. That is exactly the kind of insidious intimidation that is the hallmark of Trump and his minions. \nKnow this: I do not respond to cowards who hide behind their anonymity. If you have something to say, put it out there where everyone can see it and respond. Perhaps I am too strident and if so, the community will let me know. Don’t go sneaking around behind my back. I have no respect or time for someone who behaves in such an underhanded, puerile fashion. \nAnd here’s something else for you to consider. My colleague Jo Borras believes we have a moral obligation to resist Donald Trump and his lunatic ideas which endanger the environment and every living soul on earth as vigorously as possible. I couldn’t agree more. Share:",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind   \nDuring his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump regularly criticized Ford for moving manufacturing jobs out of the United States and over the border to Mexico. Mark Fields, the Blue Oval’s chief executive, has announced he’s ready to work with the incoming Trump administration if the right conditions are met. \nRetaining jobs in the U.S. is possible if operating costs are kept in check, Fields said in an interview with Bloomberg . He explained Ford advocates for currency manipulation rules that ensure free and fair trade, tax reform, and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles. The executive also added he plans on asking Trump to make looming fuel economy and emissions standards more lenient. \nMore: Germany urges the EU to ban new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars in 2030 \nNotably, Fields blasted the recent regulations that force automakers to sell a certain number of electrified cars. He pointed out that the segment is still small even though massive investments have been made to bring electrified cars to the market, and to build the infrastructure required to keep their battery packs topped up. \n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry. Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent,” he affirmed. \nFiat-Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne famously echoed Fields’ sentiments two years ago when he lamented the group lost $14,000 on every electric 500e it sold. He called it a compliance car built only to satisfy the capricious demands of California regulators, and he flatly urged motorists not to buy it. \nEven if Trump’s policies are favorable, Ford will move forward with its plans to shift Focus and C-Max production from Michigan to a new factory in Mexico in 2019, according to Green Car Reports . Ford has pledged the plant will stay open and promised no jobs will be eliminated. And, the company remains on track to introduce an all-electric model tentatively called Model E in 2019 . \nTrump hasn’t responded to Fields’ comments. Also watch:",

      "text": "Ford Wants Donald Trump To Soften Fuel Economy Rules | By Share Ford chief executive Mark Fields says the American automaker intends on lobbying President-elect Donald Trump to soften strict fuel economy rules to better reflect market demand. During an interview with Bloomberg , Fields said that as it stands, the CAFE standards require carmakers to produce more electric vehicles and hybrids than is warranted by customer demand. He says that there simply aren’t enough customers interested in electrified vehicles for such fuel economy rules to be enforced.“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry. Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent,” Field claimed. “At the end of the day, you’ve got to have customers, so obviously there would be pressure on the business if there’s not a market.” In the lead-up to the U.S. election, Fields and Trump butted heads over the President-elect’s assertion that the brand was planning on completely abandoning U.S. production and local jobs in favor of Mexico. Nevertheless, after the election, Ford confirmed that it would work closely with Trump moving forward with policies which will impact the automobile industry. Given Trump’s climate change skepticism, it seems possible that he might lower CAFÉ standards, especially after a major automotive lobby group also urged trump to soften these rules.

And smart mobility projects are intriguing but are in their infancy.\nBut what if the world's largest automotive market -- China -- loosens up its policies to incentivize more profitable truck sales? Ford and GM make a vast majority of their profits in the U.S., and much of that is due to high transaction prices and margins for full-size trucks.

      "text": "\n-We recently spent time around a nearly production-ready prototype of the Ford GT supercar , during which we learned how engineers tuned the car’s chassis and aerodynamic package to morph to the driver’s needs with the twist of a steering wheel-mounted dial. Here’s an in-depth explanation of exactly what will happen when the lucky GT owner cycles through each of five modes. \n- \n-Let’s start with the least-aggressive setting, Wet . Here, the suspension is in Normal, its second softest setting, with 4.7 inches of ground clearance and the option to hit the Comfort button for even softer damping. Throttle response is lazier to prevent unintentional wheel spin; the ABS and stability-control systems are at their most sensitive.\n-Next up is Normal mode. The suspension, ride height, and aerodynamics are unchanged from Wet mode, but throttle response is sharper and the stability control reins are looser compared. Transmission shifting strategies remain at their default.\n- \n- How the GT looks in Wet, Normal, and Sport mode, with normal ride height and the rear wing stowed. -One click more calls up Sport mode. The ride height stays the same, but the dampers firm up. In this mode, the GT’s “anti-lag” feature kicks in to manage throttle position and fuel delivery to keep the turbos spooling, eliminating lag even at low rpm. The seven-speed dual-clutch transmission adopts a more aggressive shift strategy, using accelerometers to detect spirited driving and call up the right gear for maximum thrust at corner exit. In addition, the stability control and ABS loosen their grip a bit more.\n-Up until this point, the car’s movable aerodynamic elements haven’t, well, moved. To ensure aerodynamic balance while the wing is in its stowed (and thus low-downforce) position, shutters in the nose of the car open up to allow air to bypass the downforce channels that run through the chassis via a low-pressure shunt pathway.\n- \n- The GT in Track mode, sitting 4.7 inches lower and with all aero deployed. -When the driver clicks into Track mode, the full aero suite is activated as the suspension drops the ride height by 2.0 inches. The shutters in the nose flip closed, diverting air entering the front of the car into the high-pressure downforce channels. The resulting front-axle downforce is balanced by the rear wing, which rises up via hydraulic actuators to act on the rear axle.\n-Other changes are going on with that rear wing. While the top surface of the wing is flat when stowed, small Gurney flaps are exposed on either side of the center brake light as the wing changes its attitude and elevates. In addition, a cam system inside the wing changes the shape of the airfoil, optimizing airflow to generate even more downforce. In Track mode, the wing also doubles as an air brake, flipping to a vertical attitude under heavy braking to increase drag.\n- \n- The wing in air-brake mode. -The final mode, dubbed Vmax , calls up the lowered ride height and firmer damper settings of Track mode, but leaves all the aero devices in their lowest drag settings—the front air shutters open up to divert airflow away from the downforce channels, and the rear wing stays in its lowered position. Raj Nair, director of product development and chief technical officer at Ford, wouldn’t directly say what kind of top speed the GT is capable of in Vmax mode, only admitting that it’s “above 200 mph.”\n-It’s worth noting how quickly these aero changes occur. Both the adjustable suspension and the rear wing actuator are powered by the GT’s old-school hydraulically assisted power-steering system. As such, everything moves with an urgency you don’t see in systems actuated via air or electric motors. Here’s a real-time demonstration in GIF form:\n- \n-And another, showing how the Gurney flap extends at the rear of the wing as it elevates when switching into Track mode:\n- \n-And fear not, showoffs: The rear wing still will raise up even if you haven’t dropped the car down into its super-low Track suspension setting. In Normal mode, the wing goes up at 90 mph and down at 81; in Sport mode, the wing rises at 71 and stows at 45. Even better, you can raise the rear wing to its full plumage when parked. But be warned: it’ll retract as soon as you drive off—unless you’re in Track mode.\n- - - This Is the Letter Folks Got When Their 2017 Ford GT Application Was Approved - Here Are Some of the People Ford Accepted/Rejected for GT Ownership - Ford GT Full Coverage: News, Photos, and More - - - \n- A version of this story originally appeared on Road & Track . \n- ",

      "text": "Ford: Eagles' Reich says losing getting to Carson Wentz Updated: December 6, 2016 — 3:19 PM EST 0 Share Bob Ford \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. \nIt was that aura of readiness that led the team to trade Sam Bradford a week before the start of the regular season and dismiss the necessity of using Chase Daniel for even a brief babysitting period. \nre is a toll being taken. \n\"For a while, I thought he seemed unflappable,\" Reich said Tuesday. \"Now, in some of the more recent losses, do you sense that this is, 'OK, he's feeling this one, he's feeling this one.' Yeah, we're all feeling it.\" \nIt is an unfair measure, for a lot of reasons, to say Wentz couldn't keep pace with Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers and Andy Dalton in these last three games. None of them look around the huddle and see the same anchors that weigh down Wentz, but quarterbacks are wired to feel responsible, regardless of the circumstance. \n\"I think he was that young, nave, in a good sense, but still very mature guy who came in and it was like, 'Nothing is going to get this guy down,' \" Reich said. \"But it wears on you. It wears on you. Losing wears on you in this league.\" \nVeteran quarterbacks, even successful ones, aren't immune to that, either, but rookies are just learning to handle the adversity. They can try to do too much. They can, as Wentz did against the Bengals, throw deep down the middle despite the presence of two safeties and suffer the predictable result. \n\"I've seen the best of them get broken down. The most confident quarterbacks in the world lose their confidence and get battered, OK?\" Reich said. \"Every quarterback tries to do too much, especially when you're not generating the points that we want to generate. Are there going to be times when you try to do too much? Yes, absolutely. Has it happened? Yeah, but I don't think it's happened as much as it could have, to be honest with you. I think he's handled it pretty well.\" \nWhen the Eagles headed into Seattle with a 5-4 record, the team was averaging 25 points per game. Subtracting the four touchdowns scored by the defense and special teams, the offense was still averaging 22 points. Since then, the Eagles have been held to 15, 13 and 14 points, and have been outscored 49-17 in the first halves of those games. It's no wonder Wentz has tried to carry things by himself on occasion, or that he has been affected by the losses. \nHe'll only be a rookie for another four games (and only 23 for another three weeks), and all of this will get easier eventually. Not the grind of coming up short or the weight of expectation on the quarterback. But dealing with it all will be easier the second time around and beyond.",

      "text": "Ford Shows 2017 GT Undergoing High Speed Testing | By Share Ford is continuing to tempt the world with its new 2017 GT supercar before customer deliveries of the model commence next year. In the almost two years since the GT’s dramatic debut at the Detroit Auto Show in 2015, Ford has released very few details about the American-born supercar. In fact, we still don’t have exact performance specifications about the model as Ford continues to hold its cards close to its chest. Nevertheless, Ford has just released a short clip of the supercar undergoing high-speed testing in the U.S. at a banked circuit and its makes us want one even more. According to the brand, the 600+ hp 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 powering the GT will allow it “to hit extraordinary speeds”. Just how fast will those speeds be? Well nobody outside of Ford knows but a figure near the 200 mph mark seems probable. It isn’t yet known when Ford will reveal the 2017 GT in production guise let alone give members of the press the chance to drive it. However, with the Detroit Auto Show 2017 fast approaching, we may not have to wait long. VIDEO",

      "text": "Business News | Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 5:25pm EST Ford stockpiles best-selling F-150 trucks to test new transmission left right A 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck is displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. on January 11, 2016. REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo 1/2 left right 2017 Ford F-150 trucks are seen at a storage lot in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. on December 5, 2016. REUTERS/Joe White 2/2 By Joseph White | DETROIT \nDETROIT Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters. \nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday. \n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said. \nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co ( GM.N ) is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales. \nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. \nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row. \nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000. \nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. \nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp. \nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s. \nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter. \nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year. \nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\" \n(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Tom Brown) Next In Business News",

      "text": "DETROIT: Ford Motor Co is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters.\nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday.\n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said.\nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales.\nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks.\nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row.\nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above US$50,000.\nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data.\nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp.\nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s.\nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter.\nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year.\nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\"\n(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Tom Brown)\n- Reuters\nEmail More",

      "text": "Back to Top Post by cortinaryan on Nov 20, 2016 21:52:20 GMT I have changed the route that I am going down with my project and I am now fitting a turbo diesel so I have for sale two ford modular V8s 4.6 2v. One is a complete engine and auto box from a 1995 Lincoln town car Limousine with a full wiring loom and ecu. The other engine is from a 1999 GT Mustang. This engine had low oil pressure but I only needed it for the later PI heads that are fitted to it. These will make the early engines 280 BHP minimum. There is a lot of info on these engines and with cams and a bit of tweaking , 400 BHP is quite obtainable. Also with it is a brand new fuel pump, 4 new lambda sensors, a pair of exhaust flanges, a Haynes manual and a 'how to rebuild a 4.6' guide book. These engines are becoming very popular in the states as a cheaper alternative to the LS motor as such plug and play wiring looms are available and aftermarket retrofit kits for 60s mustangs. Ford 4.6/5.4 EFI wiring harness kit Telorvek design | eBay I am looking for £800 for the lot. I am in Bristol but I can deliver it up to around 50 miles.

      "text": "By Joseph White\nDETROIT, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters.\nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday.\n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. \"We continued building but we're holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,\" Hinrichs said.\nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales.\nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks.\nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row.\nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000.\nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data.\nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp.\nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s.\nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter.\nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year.\nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\"\n(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Tom Brown)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "‘Westworld’ season 1, episode 10 (finale) review: Dolores faces herself, Ford’s last stand   \nWe have reached the end of the road as we face the “Westworld” season 1 finale. We have so many questions and with this being the last episode for a long time (there is a season 2 coming, but it looks like not until 2018), we aren’t sure how many will be answered. Let’s see how it all ends. \nDolores was once told by Arnold that if she made the journey to the center of the maze (her own consciousness) that they would set her free, but Ford stopped it from happening. In retaliation, Arnold had given her a gun, forcing her to kill all the other hosts in the park so that Ford couldn’t move forward with the park. She remembers standing in a town of dead bodies and Teddy rampaging through the town killing people. Turns out, Arnold had programmed her to be Wyatt at that time, so that she and Teddy would wipe out the town together. After she was done, Arnold made Dolores kill him, Teddy and herself so that nothing could be undone by Ford. What Dolores didn’t realize is that she had found William before that point and he became an investor in Westworld allowing it to be reopened. \nLearning that William and the Man in Black are the same person wasn’t too much of a surprise considering that these rumors had been floating around the internet since the show started. He tells Dolores that after he was separated from her all those years ago , he did go looking for her, , but he never found her and instead found something else – that he was not the good person he thought he was. William continued his journey to find Dolores and eventually he did, but she had been reprogrammed at that point and didn’t remember him, breaking what was left of his heart. \nAfter a final showdown between Dolores and the Man in Black, she is left bleeding on the ground. Teddy shows up and is convinced by her to take her to the place he always promised to bring her instead of to a doctor – She is ready to face death. As it turns out, when Dolores and Teddy get to the beach and she finally draws her last breath, it is revealed that this was all part of a new storyline that Ford is presenting to the board of directors (who are forcing him to resign). Later Ford speaks to Dolores and reprograms her to become Wyatt once again, only this time she is going to have an army of AI’s at her disposal. All this time we thought Dolores was the hero, but now she has become the villain as she walks up to Ford during his resignation speech and kills him in front of all the directors as the rest of the AI horde swarm the celebration killing everyone. We thought that AI’s couldn’t kill the newcomers, but clearly they can if Ford wants them too. \nNow that Maeve has had the surgeries she needed she’s ready to escape the park. She has made some changes to the personalities of some of the other hosts to do what she wants (Hector and the girl with the snake tattoo in particular) and made security easier for her to get through. When Maeve learns that someone named Arnold accessed her code and made a few changes, she realizes that getting out into the real world isn’t going to be as simple as she thought. Maeve has Felix fix Bernard/Arnold and she learns from him that these feelings she has of wanting to flee Westworld were actually a new storyline that someone programmed in her. She is struggling with the idea that these haven’t been her decisions. After a massive shoot out, she reaches the train to leave, but the thought of her daughter brings her back into the park. \nWhat was very interesting was seeing Maeve enter a division of the facility that was housing AI’s that were warriors from a completely different time period. Is this going to be the story for season 2? We have heard that this season is wrapped up and that season 2 will be a brand new story, so we are thinking that maybe we just got a glimpse of what’s to come. Either way, this was a spectacular first season and the wait for more episodes is going to feel painfully long now that we know just how great this show is. Episode grade: B+ \nWhat did you think of the “Westworld” season 1 finale and what do you want to see happen next season? Leave us a comment in the box below with your thoughts.

      "title": "Ford stockpiles best-selling F-150 trucks to test new transmission By Reuters",
      "text": "This article has already been saved in your Saved Items © Reuters. A 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck is displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit \nBy Joseph White \nDETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (N: F ) is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters. \nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday. \n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said. \nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co (N: GM ) is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales. \nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. \nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row. \nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000. \nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. \nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp. \nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s. \nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter. \nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year. \nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\" Ford stockpiles best-selling F-150 trucks to test new transmission ",

      "text": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland — Because the late Bill King has been close to Cooperstown before, even his most vocal supporter knows he needs to keep his optimism in check.\nKen Korach, who served as King’s partner on A’s broadcasts for 10 years, is trying to pretend that the Ford C. Frick Award announcement scheduled for Wednesday morning is just another winter meetings transaction.\n“I’m almost to the point where I’m not thinking about it right now,” Korach said. “We’ve been down this road before and we’ve been disappointed. And if it doesn’t happen, it’s going to be disappointing again.”\nStill, there is at least a glimmer of hope.\nKing is one of eight finalists for the Frick Award, which is presented annually by the Baseball Hall of Fame. The honor salutes excellence in baseball broadcasting and the others on the short list are Mike Krukow, Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats.\nThe Hall of Fame expects to announce the winner at 8 a.m. PT on Wednesday.\nAnd while Korach is steeling himself against more heartache, no one has spoken more passionately or written more eloquently over the years about why King finally deserves recognition.\nHe campaigns hard in part because it’s something King himself would never do.\n“Whenever we talked about (the Frick Award) when he was still alive, he was his usual self-depreciating self,” Korach said of King, who died in 2005.",

      "text": "You are here: Home » Manufacturing » Ford stockpiles 2017 F-150s to test new transmissions December 6, 2016 @ 5:22 pm Comments Joseph White \nHave an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nDETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive said. \nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas, said in an interview on Monday. \n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. \"We continued building but we're holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,\" Hinrichs said. \nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales. \nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and SUV market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. \nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row. \nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000. \nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5-liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. \nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, up 5.5 percent from last year, according to the Automotive News Data Center. \nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s. \nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months, down 2 percent from last year. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter. \nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the U.S. are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year. \nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\"",

      "text": "Mark Turgeon talks Georgetown win \nIt is uncertain that Ford or Hodges will declare for the draft. If they do, one expert gives his opinion. The Hokies still have a game to play in 2016, the Belk Bowl in Charlotte. The N.F.L. draft is months away, but it’s never too early to try and read the tea leaves. Isaiah Ford is rewriting the record book at Virginia Tech, but might declare for the draft after another monster season. Bucky Hodges adjusted to his new role as WR, but I expect him to move back to TE in the N.F.L.. Hodges has caught 7 TDs on the season, and is a match up nightmare. If Ford decides to make the leap, it will be interesting to see where he is selected come draft time. If Hodges decides to forego his senior year, I feel he will be certain early round pick. Hodges sheer size and speed will make the scouts swoon. I caught up with N.F.L. draft expert Chris Landry, and picked his brain about the two Hokies. You can check out Chris’ awesome site by clicking here. Keep in mind that neither player has yet declared. The combine, and pro days are months away. Chris projects both players “will end up with approximately 2nd-3rd round grades.” I think that will change, especially for Hodges, after watching these guys work out. We will keep you posted on any news concerning the status of these athletes. Image:",

      "text": "Adam Dupuis | December 6, 2016 \n\nWhere should we work when we grow up? The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index may help us make that decision. Who comes out on top? Well 517 companies, the most ever, made the perfect score of 100 this year. That's up from last years total of 407. Many companies have been tooting their own horn about this while others are getting noticed by some of the media. Bloomberg.com decided to highlight Wal-Mart as a 100 score winner, up from its score of 90 points for the last two years. \n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. added insurance coverage for transgender workers this year, joining more than 500 companies taking a bigger role in advancing the rights of LGBT employees in a competitive market for labor. \nCompanies from Apple Inc. to Xerox Corp. are pushing to protect employee rights and improve gender equality as some legislative efforts have stalled. In 28 states, it’s still legal to fire a person for being gay, and President-elect Donald Trump has said he will rescind President Barack Obama’s executive orders, some of which aim at workplace diversity. - bloomberg.com \nFortune.com as well highlighted Wal-Mart as the top shock of the 2017 HRC CEI. \nSome are saying Wal-Mart is doing a lot more than just scoring a perfect score on an exam. They are following through and even taking a step forward. \n\nIn a landmark move, however, Walmart chose not to contest [a discrimination suit filed by Jacqueline] Cote and her lawyer’s interpretation of Title VII, Walmart have essentially agreed that LGBTQ+ discrimination falls under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Basically, Walmart have seem to have agreed that sexual orientation discrimination should already be considered a violation of the Civil Rights Act. - hellogiggles.com \n\nThe case involved Cote and her desire to add her wife onto her health insurance policy. This, in the same year where the company has added insurance coverage for transgender employees to their policy, leading to its perfect 100 on the HRC CEI. \nAnother giant company that should be mentioned would be FORD. \nDEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 5, 2016 – Ford Motor Company has once again earned 100 percent – the highest possible score – on this year’s Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBT equality in the workplace. \nFord has received a perfect score every year since 2004. The 2017 Corporate Equality Index rated 1,043 businesses on LGBT-related policies and practices such as nondiscrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs and public engagement with the LGBT community. \n“Ford is committed to creating an environment that promotes diversity and inclusion within our workforce and communities,” said Meeta Huggins, chief diversity officer, Ford Motor Company. “The diverse backgrounds of our employees truly make us a stronger company and we are extremely proud of our policies and programs that support equality.\" - FORD press release. \nCompanies are taking note that a 100 score does get them noticed and making changes like FORD's GLOBE, an employee resource group for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and ally employees. Ford GLOBE began with meetings of the original founders in Dearborn, Michigan in July of 1994. The group quickly grew and called ourselves \"Ford Family\". In September of 1994 two cofounders of the group, Alice McKeage and Rob Matras, wrote a letter to the Vice President of Employee Relations with a copy sent to the Ford Motor Company CEO Alex Trotman to start a dialog on gay, lesbian and bisexual workplace issues. This may be one of the reasons why FORD has had a 100 score the past three years. \nFrom Wal-Mart to vehicles to shoes ... Footwearnews.com has chosen to give a nod to Adidas as a 100 score company. \n“The thing that makes our company great is our people. I am so proud of our people and what we collectively represent,” Mark King, Adidas Group North America president, said in a statement. “Every day, our people come together to challenge each other, challenge the status quo and create things the world has never seen before. We’ve built a culture that celebrates our individuality and recognizes the importance of diverse thinking and new ideas. It’s our people who are responsible for making this company special and creating a bright future together.” - Footwearnews.com \nJust over 1,000 companies were reviewed by HRC. I think it's fun, amazing, and great to watch these companies to exclaim YES! WE SCORED A 100!! A PERFECT SCORE! And we have no problem helping them toot their own horns. \nWill a list like this change your shopping habits? \nShould we use this to support some companies over others? \nKeep up the good work guys and thanks for helping us pick where we will work when we grow up. \nHead over to the Corporate Equality Index for all of HRC's results.",

      "text": "How To Chassis Suspension Adding Maximum Motorsports Caster/Camber Plates are the key to finding the perfect alignment on your Ford Mustang Maximum Angle Of Attack Evan J. Smith Freelancer December 6, 2016 \nMaximizing handling is the goal of many Mustang owners, and achieving truly improved cornering performance, without degrading ride quality, takes well-designed parts that are installed and set up properly. With the goal laid out, many Ford Mustang owners install aftermarket suspension components such as lowering springs and wider wheels and tires as their first modification. \n“There is a couple of reasons why you may need caster/camber plates,” said Brian Gust sales manager at Maximum Motorsports. “Any time you lower the car the tires will tilt in at the top, so even if you’re not doing performance driving, the tires will wear quickly. With the stock plates there is no adjustment. Some people install camber bolts as a solution, but Caster/Camber plates are a much better way to achieve camber adjustment for proper alignment and more even tire wear,” he added. \nThis is a situation we encountered recently, which we remedied a set of Maximum Motorsports Caster/Camber plates designed for the 2015-present S550 Mustang (PN MM6CC-10), which retail for about $247. \nMaximum Motorsport’s caster/camber plates feature a main plate that is precision laser-cut from a very high-grade alloy steel, which is the same alloy used by Ford and other OEMs. They allow both caster and camber adjustment, which lets you to set proper front alignment on standard ride height and lowered Mustangs for best handling performance and tire wear. \nThe wide range of adjustment allows performance enthusiasts to increase negative camber for spirited driving or on-track competition events. “The plates also feature a PTFE-lined spherical bearing mount that eliminates deflection and precisely locates the strut shaft, while still allowing the articulation required for steering and suspension movement,” added Gust. “This improves steering response and dynamic alignment stability by eliminating deflection allowed by the stock rubber-bushed upper strut mount.” \nAnd while the struts must be removed and disassembled, there is no cutting or fabrication required to install the kit. And according to Gust, the kit also retains stock strut dustcovers and all steel components are either zinc plated or powder coated for great looks and long lasting protection. \nAccording to Maximum Motorsports, even Mustangs that are lowered as much as 2.5-inches can benefit from proper alignment using these Caster/Camber plates. Caster and camber can be adjusted separately and they provide 1.75-degrees continuous range of camber adjustment. Frankly, MM adjustable caster/camber plates have been widely used since the early 1990s, when the company first introduced them for the Fox-body Mustang; this is not just a road racing tool, they can be used to correctly align any lowered late-model Mustang or to increase caster, which is advantageous to drag racers. And like the earlier cars, you’ll notice improved tire wear, quicker steering response and better all-around handling on your S550 Mustang. \n1. The factory design of the S550 Mustang does not allow for adjustment of caster or camber. Therefore it is necessary to install caster/camber plates to provide adjustment that’s necessary when lowering your Mustang. \n2. Dennis Ramsey of Ramsey’s Performance in Lutz, Florida, got started by hoisting our 2015 Mustang into the air, removing the front wheels and then removing the brake calipers. It’s important to support the calipers to prevent them from hanging from the brake line. \n3. He then removed the brake rotors along with the two lower 24mm strut bolts. \n4. Ramsey disconnected the front anti roll bar where it mounts to the strut body. \n5. Next he removed the three 15mm upper strut bolts. An extra hand is helpful to prevent the strut from falling out of the car. \n6. With the bolts removed, the strut can was removed from the 2015 Mustang. \n7. The spring must be separated from the strut at this point, which requires a spring compressor to do the job safely. \n8. Ramsey compressed the spring and then removed the strut shaft nut that retains the upper strut plate. The strut was then pulled away from the spring so the Maximum Motorsports caster/camber plate could be installed. \n9. Next the factory strut plate is separated from the bearing/bushing that will be reinstalled with the new caster/camber plates. \n10. With the assembly ready to go, the strut was slipped back into the spring and the Maximum Motorsports caster/camber plate was installed. \n11. Here’s a look into the strut tower where the top of the strut is mounted. \n12. After tightening the strut shaft nut, he installed the assembly into the Ford Mustang. \n13. Ramsey guided the studs into the strut tower and hand-tightened the upper strut nuts. \n14. Next he reinstalled the lower strut bolts and torqued the bolts to 184 ft-lb. \n15. The brake rotor and caliper was then bolted up. Ramsey used thread lock on the caliper bolts and tightened them to 85 ft-lb. \n16. This view shows how the strut and spring sits in the strut tower. \n17. Ramsey ensure that the top of the strut was centered in the opening and then he tightened the three nuts to 46 ft-lb. \n18. While you can get the struts close by eye, it’s necessary to do a proper front-end alignment. We set the Mustang to the factory specs, but you can increase negative camber for improved handling.

      "title": "Explained: The 2017 Ford GT Supercar’s Five Drive Modes",
      "text": "SHARE \nFord recently made available a nearly production-ready prototype of the Ford GT supercar , during which the automaker explained how engineers tuned the car’s chassis and aerodynamic package to morph to the driver’s needs with the twist of a steering-wheel-mounted dial. Here’s an in-depth explanation of exactly what will happen when the lucky GT owner cycles through each of five modes. \nLet’s start with the least aggressive setting, Wet . Here, the suspension is in Normal, its second softest setting, with 4.7 inches of ground clearance and the option to hit the Comfort button for even softer damping. Throttle response is lazier to prevent unintentional wheelspin; the ABS and stability-control systems are at their most sensitive. \nNext up is Normal mode. The suspension, ride height, and aerodynamics are unchanged from Wet mode, but throttle response is sharper, and the stability control reins are comparatively looser. Transmission shifting strategies remain at their default. How the GT looks in Wet, Normal, and Sport mode, with normal ride height and the rear wing stowed. \nOne click more calls up Sport mode. The ride height stays the same, but the dampers firm up. In this mode, the GT’s anti-lag feature kicks in to manage throttle position and fuel delivery to keep the turbos spooling, eliminating lag even at low rpm. The seven-speed dual-clutch transmission adopts a more aggressive shift strategy, using accelerometers to detect spirited driving and call up the right gear for maximum thrust at corner exit. In addition, the stability control and ABS loosen their grip a bit more. \nUp until this point, the car’s movable aerodynamic elements haven’t, well, moved. To ensure aerodynamic balance while the wing is in its stowed (and thus low-downforce) position, shutters in the nose of the car open up to allow air to bypass the downforce channels that run through the chassis via a low-pressure shunt pathway. The GT in Track mode, sitting 4.7 inches lower and with all aero deployed. \nWhen the driver clicks into Track mode, the full aero suite is activated as the suspension drops the ride height by 2.0 inches. The shutters in the nose flip closed, diverting air entering the front of the car into the high-pressure downforce channels. The resulting front-axle downforce is balanced by the rear wing, which rises up via hydraulic actuators to act on the rear axle. \nOther changes are going on with that rear wing. While the top surface of the wing is flat when stowed, small Gurney flaps are exposed on either side of the center brake light as the wing changes its attitude and elevates. In addition, a cam system inside the wing changes the shape of the airfoil, optimizing airflow to generate even more downforce. In Track mode, the wing also doubles as an air brake, flipping to a vertical attitude under heavy braking to increase drag. The wing in air-brake mode. \nThe final mode, dubbed Vmax , calls up the lowered ride height and firmer damper settings of Track mode but leaves all the aero devices in their lowest drag settings—the front air shutters open up to divert airflow away from the downforce channels, and the rear wing stays in its lowered position. Raj Nair, director of product development and chief technical officer at Ford, wouldn’t directly say what kind of top speed the GT is capable of in Vmax mode, only admitting that it’s “above 200 mph.” \nIt’s worth noting how quickly these aero changes occur. Both the adjustable suspension and the rear wing actuator are powered by the GT’s old-school hydraulically assisted power-steering system. As such, everything moves with an urgency you don’t see in systems actuated via air or electric motors. Here’s a real-time demonstration in GIF form: \nAnd another, showing how the Gurney flap extends at the rear of the wing as it elevates when switching into Track mode: \nAnd fear not, showoffs: The rear wing still will raise up even if you haven’t dropped the car down into its super-low Track suspension setting. In Normal mode, the wing goes up at 90 mph and down at 81; in Sport mode, the wing rises at 71 and stows at 45. Even better, you can raise the rear wing to its full plumage when parked. But be warned: It’ll retract as soon as you drive off—unless you’re in Track mode.",

      "text": "Business Ford stockpiles best-selling F-150 trucks to test new transmission A 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck is displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 7:00   \nDETROIT - Ford Motor Co <F.N> is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters. \nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday. \n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said. \nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co <GM.N> is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales. \nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. \nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row. \nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000. \nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. \nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp. \nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s. \nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter. \nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year. \nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\" REUTERS",

      "text": "Ford Could Delay Delivery of 2017 F-150 and Raptor to Test Ten-Speed Trans 2017 Pickups Will Still Hit Dealers Before Year’s End   10 Photos Ford is apparently hanging on to its newest crop of pickups for last-minute testing, if company executive Joe Heinrichs is to be believed. The head of Ford’s American operations said the company would delay delivery of certain 2017 F-150 configurations (and all F-150 Raptor off-roaders) to perform final testing on those trucks’ 10-speed automatic transmissions .   10 Photos Photo 2/10 | 2017 Ford F 150 10 Speed Transmission Reasoning behind the slight delay wasn’t given, although it’s not difficult to understand the automaker’s hesitation in releasing the transmission. The truck market is notoriously difficult to please, and if the new 10-speed (which was jointly developed with General Motors) is in any way unsatisfactory, the company could risk alienating the customer base of America’s bestselling vehicle. However, Heinrichs told Automotive News Ford would still deliver on its promise of having the F-150 and F-150 Raptor in dealer lots by the end of the year.   10 Photos Photo 3/10 | 2017 Ford F 150 Raptor Front Three Quarter In Motion 03 We drove a 2017 F-150 equipped with the second-generation 3.5L EcoBoost V-6 and 10-speed automatic transmission a few weeks ago and found it to be a very capable, smooth machine. The transmission, which can downshift several gears at a time, was responsive, and the transmission didn’t exhibit any untoward gearhunting or shift harshness. Even so, it can only be a good thing if Ford is doing additional testing on its new powertrain, and we hope potential customers like it as much as we did.",

      "title": "Ford Is Stockpiling Its New Pickup Trucks To Test Their Transmission Systems",
      "text": "(DETROIT)--Ford Motor f is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters.\nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford’s automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday.\n“We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,” Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said.\nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford’s shipping delays come as rival General Motors gm is aggressively trying to cut into Ford’s lead in U.S. pickup sales.\nTaking aim at the “Built Ford Tough” ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford’s new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM’s trucks.\nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row.\nFor more on Ford Motor, watch Fortune’s video:\n\nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000.\nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data.\nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp.\nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s.\nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter.\nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year.\nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive , a Houston auto retail chain. “I expect them to be aggressive.”",

      "text": "December 06, 2016 – /PressAdvantage/ – Mojo Global Automotive has announced a positive review from a Ford dealership using their lead generation software. During a three-day campaign, the dealership netted more than $10,000 in new car sales, they state as a direct result of using the lead generation system by Mojo Global.\n“We’re always thrilled to hear positive stories,” says Cory Michael Sanchez, co-founder of Mojo Automotive. “Our website has a number of Mojo Global 5-Star Endorsement stories that show just how effective this system can be for any business.”\nSanchez states that the Ford dealership netted profit as a direct result of using the All-In-One Multi-Channel Predictable Auto Sales Lead Generation System by Mojo Global. He points out that this is just one story, among many others, that shows just how the lead generation system can work.\nThe Ford dealership claims 6 deals closed in 3 days adding Mojo Automotive Lead Generation . Sales for the top three auto manufacturers had dropped in July, which many state is an indication that the auto industry in general is entering the first plateau since the decade which led to the current financial crisis. Auto dealers, according to Sanchez, are solving the problem by using the system from Mojo Global, a fact proven with the current dealership’s profit increase.\nThe automobile dealer ran the three-day campaign using Mojo’s proprietary lead generation system, and saw massive results. The system generated nearly 300 inbound calls, more than 250 of which were unique calls, which directly resulted in net sales of more than $10,000 in those three days alone. The system includes proprietary software that identifies prospects, and sends out thousands of emails, voicemails, and text messages to those prospects. Sales teams are instantly alerted when those prospects are ready to purchase.\n“It’s a win-win for everyone involved,” says Sanchez. “You get leads, good strong leads, and those leads get to purchase what they need. If you want to see results like these, start your free trial today .”\nSanchez states that the system allows sales team to focus solely on closing auto sales deals, while the system takes care of follow up and lead generation. Auto dealers who typically have little success with cold calling can use the system to avoid lulls in sales. More about the system and a look at other success stories can be seen on the Mojo Automotive’s official website.\n###\nContact Mojo Global:\nCory Michael Sanchez\n480.339.4300\nfriends@mojoglobal.com\n5665 N.

Share on Facebook Print RL GNZLZ/FLICKR Ford trucks were the most frequently stolen vehicle in Western Canada in 2016, according to a list published by the Insurance Bureau of Canada By: Ameya Charnalia For Metro Published on Ford trucks were the most frequently stolen vehicles in Western Canada in 2016, according to an annual list published by the Insurance Bureau of Canada. For the second time in a row, Ford trucks were the most commonly targeted vehicle for theft in the western and pacific region, according to a news release issued Tuesday by the IBC. \"After large declines in auto theft activity over the last decade, the number of stolen vehicles has gone up six per cent nationally compared to last year,” said Bill Adams, vice-president of the western and pacific region of the IBC. “In Alberta, we have seen the largest increase in all of Canada with auto thefts up a whopping 32 per cent. Unfortunately, many of the vehicles stolen in this region will never be recovered.\" Adams said criminals tend to favour large, older and high-end Ford F-series vehicles. Stolen vehicles are often shipped overseas, scrapped for parts, or stolen with the purpose of committing auto insurance fraud, the IBC release said. The most frequently stolen Ford truck in Western Canada was the 2006 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4WD Pickup. Editors' Picks ",

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo By Jake Spring | BEIJING \nBEIJING Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) expects China to wait until the last possible moment to announce whether it will extend a tax cut on small engine cars set to expire at year's end and is making contingency plans for various outcomes, an executive said on Wednesday. \nChina's auto industry association, executives and analysts have warned of a potentially steep drop off in sales growth next year if the policy, which halves the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or below, expires as planned at the end of 2016. \nA government official said in October that the country is considering extending the tax, originally instituted in late 2015 to stimulate the market as vehicle sales flat lined amid a weakening economy. \n\"If there is an announcement about a continuation, I would not be surprised if that announcement is made on literally the last day of year,\" Peter Fleet, Ford's head of sales and marketing for Asia Pacific, told Reuters in an interview. \nIn the face of such uncertainty, the U.S. automaker is planning for three different scenarios, he said: the tax cut expires, it is extended at a reduced rate, or continues in full. \n\"We're proceeding on the basis that the purchase tax incentive ends at the end of the year,\" Fleet said. \n\"We'll adjust our plans as quickly as we need to in the new year if there is a different set of assumptions.\" \nFundamental demand for cars will continue to be strong and the tax cut will only result in a marginal change in demand, he said, declining to give exact predictions for 2017 auto sales. \nFord is set to announce November sales results for China at later on Wednesday. \nThe tax cut spurred a strong rebound in the world's largest auto market this year with sales for January to October growing 13.8 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. \nAnalysts predict flat or negative growth in 2017 if the tax cut expires as planned. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Additional reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu) Next In Business News",

      "text": "During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump regularly criticized Ford for moving manufacturing jobs out of the United States and over the border to Mexico. Mark Fields, the Blue Oval’s chief executive, has announced he’s ready to work with the incoming Trump administration if the right conditions are met.\nRetaining jobs in the U.S. is possible if operating costs are kept in check, Fields said in an interview with Bloomberg . He explained Ford advocates for currency manipulation rules that ensure free and fair trade, tax reform, and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles. The executive also added he plans on asking Trump to make looming fuel economy and emissions standards more lenient.\nMore: Germany urges the EU to ban new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars in 2030\nNotably, Fields blasted the recent regulations that force automakers to sell a certain number of electrified cars. He pointed out that the segment is still small even though massive investments have been made to bring electrified cars to the market, and to build the infrastructure required to keep their battery packs topped up.\n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry. Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent,” he affirmed.\nFiat-Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne famously echoed Fields’ sentiments two years ago when he lamented the group lost $14,000 on every electric 500e it sold. He called it a compliance car built only to satisfy the capricious demands of California regulators, and he flatly urged motorists not to buy it.\nEven if Trump’s policies are favorable, Ford will move forward with its plans to shift Focus and C-Max production from Michigan to a new factory in Mexico in 2019, according to Green Car Reports . Ford has pledged the plant will stay open and promised no jobs will be eliminated. And, the company remains on track to introduce an all-electric model tentatively called Model E in 2019 .\nTrump hasn’t responded to Fields’ comments.\nApple is looking into USA manufacturing, and Trump wants to make it happen The fifth member of the Mini lineup will run on batteries when it lands in 2019 Ford's rugged Bronco SUV will return, according to labor leader",

      "text": "By E.J. Schultz   07, 2016 Credit: Ford Motor Company Most Popular \nAs the in-house futurist at Ford Motor Co., Sheryl Connelly's job is to predict the future -- not necessarily about driving or cars, but about how consumer behavior is are changing. Ms. Connelly's findings, however, often have a bearing on how the automaker designs, builds and markets cars. \nA few years ago, for instance, she predicted that there would be a backlash to the fact that technology has enabled people to be constantly connected. \"I said I think by the time the year 2025 comes around you are going to see people looking to their car as a sanctuary. And indeed that is currently our strategy on the interior of our vehicles,\" she said. Cars should \"be a quiet respite from noisy, active world around you.\" \nThe insight is evident in the technology Ford uses to pair bluetooth-enabled devices with in-car entertainment systems. \"Probably the unsung hero of that platform is the do-not-disturb button which allows people to shut off incoming calls [and] shut off reminder notice of emails and text messages,\" she said. \nSo what is on her mind this year? Ms. Connelly, whose formal title is manager-global consumer trends and futuring, outlined some trends to watch in her latest report, called \"Looking Further With Ford.\" The findings are partly based on a custom survey of 8,100 people across U.S., U.K., China, Brazil, India, Spain, Germany and Canada. This is the fifth year that Ford has publicly released the report. Below is a quick look at some of the findings. Ford plans to post the full 2017 trends report at fordtrends.com. \nTrust Is the New Black \nFord began documenting the mistrust of corporations, governments and media in its first trends report five years ago. The situation has gotten worse with the concept of truth now on trial. \"Where truth was once indisputable and often self-evident, today's 'truths' are often heavily influenced by perceptions and reinforced by like-minded viewpoints,\" according to the report. In the survey, 65% of people agreed that \"people today are less likely to consider opposing viewpoints.\" For marketers, this means transparency is more important than ever. \nThe Good Life 2.0 \n\"Bigger isn't always better and ownership isn't equated with happiness,\" the report finds, adding that wealth is an increasingly outdated measure of success. Ford's 2017 trends report Credit: Ford Motor Company \nAt first glance the finding seems to spell trouble for auto marketers because they make money by selling cars to own. But Ford has sought to adapt by marketing itself as a \"mobility company.\" In March the automaker launched a subsidiary called Ford Smart Mobility , whose investments include ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles. \nTime Well Spent \nThe report declares that \"punctuality is a dying art\" and \"procrastination can be a strength.\" This is behind the rising trend of the so-called \"gap year,\" which refers to the year off students take between high school and college. In India, 63% respondents agreed that \"procrastination helps me be more creative or productive,\" according to the survey. In the U.S., 34% of respondents agreed with that statement. \nThe report cited an ad agency in Amsterdam called Heldergroen that has a unique way of encouraging employees to work less: At 6 p.m., \"steel cables hoist the desks into the air\" freeing room for yoga, dance parties and other recreational activities. \n'Decider Dilemma' \n\"Products, services and values are adapting to accommodate a sampling society that prioritizes trying over buying,\" according to the report. In China, 99% of survey respondents agreed that \"the internet creates more choice than I need or want.\" And across all countries surveyed, 49% of respondents ages 18-to-29 said that in the past month \"I have walked away from a purchase decision because there were so many options, I couldn't choose.\" \nFord is affected by the \"decider dilemma\" as people wrestle with a plethora of transportation options, the report notes. The automaker is seeking to address this by becoming more of a transportation consultant. Plans include putting new retail storefronts in urban areas called FordHubs, \"where consumers will be able to explore Ford's latest innovations, learn about the company's mobility services and experience exclusive events,\" according to the statement issued earlier this year.

      "text": "By Jake Spring\nBEIJING, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co expects China to wait until the last possible moment to announce whether it will extend a tax cut on small engine cars set to expire at year's end and is making contingency plans for various outcomes, an executive said on Wednesday.\nChina's auto industry association, executives and analysts have warned of a potentially steep drop off in sales growth next year if the policy, which halves the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or below, expires as planned at the end of 2016.\nA government official said in October that the country is considering extending the tax, originally instituted in late 2015 to stimulate the market as vehicle sales flat lined amid a weakening economy.\n\"If there is an announcement about a continuation, I would not be surprised if that announcement is made on literally the last day of year,\" Peter Fleet, Ford's head of sales and marketing for Asia Pacific, told Reuters in an interview.\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the U.S. automaker is planning for three different scenarios, he said: the tax cut expires, it is extended at a reduced rate, or continues in full.\n\"We're proceeding on the basis that the purchase tax incentive ends at the end of the year,\" Fleet said.\n\"We'll adjust our plans as quickly as we need to in the new year if there is a different set of assumptions.\"\nFundamental demand for cars will continue to be strong and the tax cut will only result in a marginal change in demand, he said, declining to give exact predictions for 2017 auto sales.\nFord is set to announce November sales results for China at later on Wednesday.\nThe tax cut spurred a strong rebound in the world's largest auto market this year with sales for January to October growing 13.8 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\nAnalysts predict flat or negative growth in 2017 if the tax cut expires as planned.

      "text": "ford wants lower mpg standards news Quote: s details c max hybrid More During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump regularly criticized Ford for moving manufacturing jobs out of the United States and over the border to Mexico. Mark Fields, the Blue Oval’s chief executive, has announced he’s ready to work with the incoming Trump administration if the right conditions are met.\nRetaining jobs in the U.S. is possible if operating costs are kept in check, Fields said in an interview with Bloomberg . He explained Ford advocates for currency manipulation rules that ensure free and fair trade, tax reform, and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles. The executive also added he plans on asking Trump to make looming fuel economy and emissions standards more lenient.\nMore: Germany urges the EU to ban new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars in 2030\nNotably, Fields blasted the recent regulations that force automakers to sell a certain number of electrified cars. He pointed out that the segment is still small even though massive investments have been made to bring electrified cars to the market, and to build the infrastructure required to keep their battery packs topped up.\n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry. Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent,” he affirmed.\nFiat-Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne famously echoed Fields’ sentiments two years ago when he lamented the group lost $14,000 on every electric 500e it sold. He called it a compliance car built only to satisfy the capricious demands of California regulators, and he flatly urged motorists not to buy it.\nEven if Trump’s policies are favorable, Ford will move forward with its plans to shift Focus and C-Max production from Michigan to a new factory in Mexico in 2019, according to Green Car Reports . Ford has pledged the plant will stay open and promised no jobs will be eliminated. And, the company remains on track to introduce an all-electric model tentatively called Model E in 2019 .\nTrump hasn’t responded to Fields’ comments.\nApple is looking into USA manufacturing, and Trump wants to make it happen The fifth member of the Mini lineup will run on batteries when it lands in 2019 Ford's rugged Bronco SUV will return, according to labor leader",

Ford Taurus cars are seen during a presentation at the 16th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition in Shanghai \nBy Jake Spring \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (N: F ) expects China to wait until the last possible moment to announce whether it will extend a tax cut on small engine cars set to expire at year's end and is making contingency plans for various outcomes, an executive said on Wednesday. \nChina's auto industry association, executives and analysts have warned of a potentially steep drop off in sales growth next year if the policy, which halves the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or below, expires as planned at the end of 2016. \nA government official said in October that the country is considering extending the tax, originally instituted in late 2015 to stimulate the market as vehicle sales flat lined amid a weakening economy. \n\"If there is an announcement about a continuation, I would not be surprised if that announcement is made on literally the last day of year,\" Peter Fleet, Ford's head of sales and marketing for Asia Pacific, told Reuters in an interview. \nIn the face of such uncertainty, the U.S. automaker is planning for three different scenarios, he said: the tax cut expires, it is extended at a reduced rate, or continues in full. \n\"We're proceeding on the basis that the purchase tax incentive ends at the end of the year,\" Fleet said. \n\"We'll adjust our plans as quickly as we need to in the new year if there is a different set of assumptions.\" \nFundamental demand for cars will continue to be strong and the tax cut will only result in a marginal change in demand, he said, declining to give exact predictions for 2017 auto sales. \nFord is set to announce November sales results for China at later on Wednesday. \nThe tax cut spurred a strong rebound in the world's largest auto market this year with sales for January to October growing 13.8 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. \nAnalysts predict flat or negative growth in 2017 if the tax cut expires as planned.

      "title": "Ford Is Stockpiling Its New F-150 Trucks To Test Their Transmissions",
      "text": "(DETROIT)—Ford Motor f is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters.\nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford’s automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday.\n“We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,” Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said.\nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford’s shipping delays come as rival General Motors gm is aggressively trying to cut into Ford’s lead in U.S. pickup sales.\nTaking aim at the “Built Ford Tough” ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford’s new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM’s trucks.\nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row.\nFor more on Ford Motor, watch Fortune’s video:\nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000.\nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data.\nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp.\nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s.\nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter.\nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year.\nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive , a Houston auto retail chain. “I expect them to be aggressive.”",

The first production-spec 2017 Ford GT goes off the factory line within the next four weeks, and as the Blue Oval makes the final tweaks to its reborn supercar, Ford invited us out to Las Vegas Motor Speedway to snag shotgun and go for a ride. \nParked in a sea of black asphalt with B-1 bombers and other military hardware roaring out of Nellis Air Force Base passing overhead, the Frozen White and Black pre-production GT—fittingly nicknamed “Stormtrooper” by Ford engineers—makes quite the visual impression outside the harsh glow of auto show lighting. Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president of global product development and the man many on the team credit as the father of the GT, and Dave Pericak, the head of Ford Performance, weren’t willing to let us get behind the wheel of the GT. But they did offer a guided tour of the 2017 GT’s bodywork, suspension, and cabin before letting us loose with Le Mans–winning racer Joey Hand on the track. \nAfter talking with Nair and Pericak, it becomes clear that the new GT is a product of lessons learned in the wind tunnel and at the racetrack. The obvious aero tricks include the cabin’s teardrop shape and the GT’s flying buttresses, which hide the piping for the 3.5-liter V-6, the intercoolers, and the twin turbochargers mounted in the rear sponsons. The Ford GT’s Formula 1–style keel is less obvious, but it’s apparent when you look at it from a rear three-quarters angle and notice the asphalt visible through the channel behind the front wheels. \nThe Ford features active aerodynamics, too. Up front, the GT’s air intake hides active grille shutters used to manage air pressure at the front wheels. The car initially made too much front downforce, which any engineer will tell you is a pretty good problem to have. An active rear spoiler balances downforce in the rear. Hydraulically actuated like the suspension, the rear spoiler shoots up like a bottle rocket and has a couple neat tricks. It functions as an air brake under heavy braking, and it actively changes shape while at speed. You read that right. The rear wing has a small cam inside it that changes the air foil and adjusts a small gurney flap up and down at speed as conditions demand to maximize grip and downforce. \nThe Ford GT’s active aero works hand in hand with the GT’s five drive modes (Normal, Wet, Sport, Track, and V-Max), which are accessed via a control knob on the upper left side of the Ford’s F1-inspired steering . There are visual clues you’re in Normal mode, which include a unique instrument cluster display, the GT’s suspension sitting at 4.7 inches of ground clearance, and the rear spoiler deploying at 90 mph and coming back down at 81 mph. Normal mode has an additional Comfort suspension setting, which is activated by a button on the center console, plus a nose-lift function, which is operated in the same manner. Wet mode is based on Normal mode, and it works as you think it would—by softening throttle and transmission mapping for inclement weather. \nThe really cool stuff happens when you twist the dial farther. \nSport mode builds upon Normal mode. It sharpens up throttle response, loosens up traction control restrictions, engages an anti-lag system, and puts the rear spoiler up at 70 mph and down at 45 mph. Track is more intense still; it deploys the rear spoiler, drops the ride height down to 2.7 inches of clearance (startlingly fast at that), and stiffens the GT’s racing-derived suspension, which features inboard-mounted torsion beams and pushrods mated to Multimatic’s trick Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve (DSSV) shock absorbers. The DSSV dampers were seen on the 2014 Best Driver’s Car–winning Chevrolet Camaro Z/28. They have an otherworldly ability of providing a stiff ride for track work with a compliance that takes curbing and bumps without upsetting the car. V-Max cleans up the GT’s aero profile by dropping the rear wing, which allows the Ford to hit its 200-plus-mph claimed top speed. \nWhen Hand fires up a Liquid Blue GT in the road course’s pit lane, it’s time for a ride. Nair says Ford briefly considered fitting a V-8 or even a twin-turbo V-8 into the GT. Instead it opted for the EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission because its smaller package and increased fuel efficiency would make it a more competitive race car—a gamble that paid off when the GT won its class at Le Mans. Ford, frustratingly, still isn’t talking horsepower or torque figures because it’s waiting final EPA certification, but it insists that the GT makes at least 600 horsepower. \nOpen the scissor door, duck, and slip into the cabin. It’s a pretty welcoming place, even if the cockpit is rather snug with Hand and I nearly touching shoulders. The seats are fixed into the carbon-fiber tub, so legroom is a bit precious for this 6-foot-1 scribe, but at least the seat backs recline a bit to up the comfort. (The driver’s seat is fixed, too; the pedals and steering wheel adjust to fit the driver.) The cabin has a very McLaren-like vibe to it with high-quality materials, few buttons, and a driver-focused, business-first layout. Shared parts with other Ford products seem to be few and far between. A couple buttons on the steering wheel, the headlight switch, transmission gear selector, and Sync 3 software are the only obvious exceptions. \nA twist of the dial into Track mode makes the GT hunker down like an Olympic sprinter, and with stab of the throttle, we’re off. The EcoBoost V-6 emits a guttural growl unlike any V-6 I’ve ever heard. It pins me back in my seat as we rocket out of pit lane. Those moaning about the lack of a V-8 option ought to zip it for the time being. From the passenger seat, its thrust level feels off the charts. There’s no turbo lag that I can pick up; the engine pulls strongly through its rev range. Gear changes seem seamless, too. The seven-speed dual-clutch auto responds instantly to Hand’s pulls of the paddles. The Ford GT appears to be incredibly well balanced, too. Just a hint of steering angle had the GT instantaneously pointing toward the next car. As Hand works the GT through corners, it seemingly rotates flat on its axis. The GT feels firm and planted at all times during our stint in the passenger seat, with the traction control system (in its sportiest setting) appearing to be unobtrusive and with the DSSV shocks happily taking a beating from the track’s curbing without upsetting the car in the least. \nJust as quickly as our lap began, Hand pulls the GT back into the pits to wrap up our session. Although it’s nearly impossible to verify without getting behind the wheel ourselves, the 2017 Ford GT seems like it could be every bit as capable as the McLaren 675LT , as engaging as the Ferrari 488 GTB , and as accessible as the Porsche 911 GT3 (all of which Ford benchmarked the new GT against). Even though the first GT delivery is later this month, Ford’s still tinkering away; Nair says the company will spend the next few weeks tweaking the transmission calibration, making the instrument cluster software snappier, lowering NVH on the rear bulkhead, and improving fit and finish. Once that’s complete and the GT is finally EPA-certified, the first $450,000-ish 2017 GT will roll off its Markham, Ontario, assembly line and into the driveway of Bill Ford Jr. before December 31. Ford will get the first GT, but the Blue Oval has committed to a four-year production run with 250 cars built per year. The first year’s run has already been spoken for by a who’s who of celebrities and CEOs. Those not in the first allotment can get their first crack at owning America’s mid-engine supercar when the next batch rolls out in 2018. We just can’t wait to go for a drive. Share this article",

      "text": "Finance Search \nWed, Dec 7, 2016, 10:10 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Ford Accelerates Past 1 Million Sales in China, Posts Record Sales in November Led by Explorer and Edge SUVs Press Release : Ford Motor Company – 5 hours ago Recommend 12.56 +0.12 \nSHANGHAI--(BUSINESSWIRE)-- Ford and its joint ventures in China have sold more than 1 million vehicles in 2016, reaching the milestone one month faster than in 2015. Monthly sales hit an all-time November high of 124,113 vehicles, up 17 percent compared to November 2015. \n“Ford is gaining more momentum in China each month and we are on pace for a record year in China,” said Peter Fleet, vice president of Marketing, Sales and Service, Asia Pacific. “We are seeing increasing demand across our lineup, particularly our full family of SUVs.” \nMonthly sales for Changan Ford Automobile, Ford’s passenger car joint venture in China, totaled more than 96,000 vehicles, up 14 percent compared to November 2015. So far in 2016 CAF has sold nearly 842,000 vehicles, up 14 percent compared to last year. \nNovember’s strong performance was led by SUVs, including the Ford Explorer, with an increase of 73 percent. Sales of the Ford Edge increased 21 percent in November and year-to-date sales more than doubled compared to last year.

      "text": "Ford stockpiles best-selling F-150 trucks to test new transmission Updated: December 6, 2016 — 5:17 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy Joseph White \nDETROIT, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters. \nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday. \n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. \"We continued building but we're holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,\" Hinrichs said. \nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales. \nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. \nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row. \nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000. \nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. \nFord remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp. \nHowever, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s. \nGM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter. \nGM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year. \nDecember is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. \"I expect them to be aggressive.\" \n(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Tom Brown) Published: December 6, 2016 — 5:17 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Photo by Alex Boerner \nT he rows of collard greens at Jenkins Farm owe their tidiness to a 1959 Ford tractor. A walk through the Jenkins farm, tucked just inside the city line in southeast Durham, is a tour of mid-century machinery, names like Farmall, Faerguson, and Ford. Near the '59, a 1952 Ford Golden Jubilee sits waiting for repairs. It was originally on a neighboring farm, purchased new from the Ford tractor dealership less than a mile down the road. Both the neighbor's farm and the dealership are forest now. \n\"This all used to be farm,\" Greg Jenkins says, waving his hand at half of Durham County. The surrounding Lowe's Grove community was so invested in farming that, a century ago, it had a residential farm-life school with two hundred students and North Carolina's first credit union, overseen by the Department of Agriculture. Now the landscape is dominated by strip malls and the Research Triangle Park. Bayer CropScience replaced the actual crops. Except, that is, for the nine acres of collard greens at Jenkins Farm. \nThe Jenkinses survive because, as one woman tells me as she loads her SUV with the massive plants, \"They grow the best collards you've ever had.\" They also sell firewood, sweet potatoes, and pickled vegetables, but collards keep the gravel driveway full of cars, especially the week before Thanksgiving. Locals come regularly, some to haul as much as possible to relatives too far north to be in collard country. Mail-order requests go to New Jersey and California. Their customers, a mix of white, black, and Asian, look like Durham. \nAnd at four dollars per plant, the price for the last decade, Jenkins Farm collards are a better deal than the $66 frozen greens Neiman Marcus will sell you. There's no debate over whether the Jenkins family can grow collards. But what makes them continue when the neighbors have all called it quits? \nBefore I can ask, a customer arrives, and Gene Jenkins, who first farmed this land in 1971, walks her into the field. She totes a plastic bag only slightly smaller than the ones used to store mattresses, and he carries one of the long machetes the family uses to chop the plant from its roots, creating what looks like an oversize bouquet of green elephant ears. Jenkins Farm customers choose their plants, but Gene suggests ones with smaller, more tender leaves. \nWhen his father received a terminal cancer diagnosis and sold his farm in Chatham County, Gene brought his parents to Durham. And there on Jenkins Farm, the first two generations lived and farmed together until his father died in 1990. \n\"I'm sure that being here, in these fields, saved him,\" Gene says. Generation three came soon after the farm started, when Gene's children, Greg and Cindy, were born. Greg married, and his wife, Kim, became the farm's bookkeeper. Greg and Kim's eight-year-old daughter, Langdon, is generation four. Langdon was less than two months old when a Thanksgiving rush hit, so they put her bassinet in the barn and Kim jumped back into the steady stream of customers. \nWhen I ask who cooks the collards on Jenkins Farm, Greg and Kim send me inside the house, where Greg's mother, Tootsie, also known as the Collard Lady, coaxes a pot of greens to a boil. On the counter nearby, turnips rest like a box of new baseballs. Two slabs of fatback wait for their cue. The eggs and fats for her other task before lunch—a pound cake—sit beside the sink, coming to room temperature. \nTootsie worked at the Liggett & Myers factory until she left to be the Collard Lady, full-time farm matriarch. Her guide to greens is less a recipe than a plea for patience. Have the patience to wash the greens two times, maybe more, to remove any grit. Have the patience to let them simmer on the stove as long as they must. Salt and pepper? Sure. Serve with vinegar? It's not her preference, but that's fine. Those things matter so much less than patience. \nBack outside, I still want to know why the family continues to plant and harvest. The work is hard. Both Greg and Kim hold day jobs in addition to farming. Nine acres of crops aren't going to make anyone rich in North Carolina, but an RTP-adjacent tract that size could bring a big return in the current market. The answer comes when Greg mentions organic farming. click to enlarge Photo by Alex Boerner \n\"We make it as organic as we possibly can,\" he says. At first, I'm puzzled. Jenkins Farm isn't chasing trends or selling at markets. Why organic, then? \n\"Because that's the tradition, the way we've always done it.\" Greg recites a long list of natural fertilizers and biopesticides his family has used since \"forever.\" This place, and its crop, lets Greg and his clan reach back generations, keeping them alive, as present as their old tractors. When Greg tells me he is sure his daughter will carry it on, I understand why. I want him to be right. We walk into the field to find my plants. \nBack home, I rinse my greens twice, as Tootsie says. I don't rush them off the stove after an hour, letting another thirty minutes pass. The end result is a pot of dark, tender greens and potlikker worth drinking on its own. Patience pays off. But with as little as I did, I know the true credit goes to Jenkins Farm. After all, they grow the best collards you'll ever eat. \nThis article appeared in print with the headline \"Patience for Potlikker.\"",

      "text": "Jim Donnelly on Jan 21st, 2015 Share \nNed Jarrett at Darlington, circa 1965. Photos courtesy of Ford Motor Company. \nFord Racing has kicked off an occasional series on legendary Blue Oval racing heroes at its website, and the first person to be profiled is 1965 NASCAR Grand National champion Ned Jarrett. That was an incredible year for Jarrett in more ways than one: He came back from a serious back injury within a matter of days, then won the prestigious Southern 500 at Darlington, on a fiery Labor Day weekend, by 14 laps, a record margin of victory that will likely stand forever. \nJarrett was a young guy out of North Carolina when he hooked up with team owner Bondy Long, who acquired Ford factory backing for a championship run in 1965. Despite the near career-ending wreck at South Carolina’s Greenville-Pickens Speedway, Jarrett hung on to win 13 races in 54 starts, with a remarkable 45 top-five finishes. That was more than enough to lock down the title. Jarrett retired from driving shortly thereafter, and has since enjoyed a stellar career as a broadcast racing analyst. His son, Dale, became a NASCAR star in his own right. \nJarrett in his Ford Galaxie at the 1965 Charlotte 400. \nLong and Jarrett are both still hale and hearty, and are planning a reunion this year to mark the 50 th anniversary of their championship season.

      "text": "2015 Ford Edge Titanium AWD Test Drive and Review A DriveWays Review... 2015 Ford Edge. Photo (c) Ford By Frank A. Aukofer About.com Rating \nLike a burlesque dancer with a Ph.D. who runs triathlons, the 2015 Ford Edge teases with looks, intelligence and strength. \nDepending on which personality you choose, it emphasizes lavish luxury, homelike comfort or a sporting experience. \nThe Edge is a midsize crossover utility vehicle (CUV) that dates back to 2006, when Ford punched it into its 2007 utility lineup between the compact Ford Escape and the bigger Ford Explorer . \nA five-passenger, four-door vehicle with front- or all-wheel drive, the first generation Edge has been a steady seller, although sales in 2014 dropped to 108,864 from 129,109 the previous year. \nLikely the Ford folks anticipated familiarity breeding contempt—or at least indifference among some buyers—so the 2015 model is new from the tires up, with an all new body structure and edgy fresh styling. It’s been nearly ready since last summer, when Ford started teasing critics and buyers with tantalizing bits of sight and sound but without allowing anybody to drive it. \nNow that’s all in the rearview mirror as the Edge has completed its full-on debut. The only thing left is to coax people inside for a look and a drive. \nThe new Edge is slightly taller and wider than its predecessor. Overall, it is four inches shy of 16 feet long, has generous space of 114 cubic feet for passengers and a welcoming cargo area of 39 cubic feet. Even the center rear position in the back seat, punishing in most vehicles, is reasonably comfortable. \nTwo new engines anchor the lineup: a 245 hp, 2.0-liter EcoBoost four cylinder and a 315 hp, 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6. EcoBoost is Ford’s term for turbocharging. The third engine is carried over, a naturally aspirated 280 hp, 3.5-liter V6—there for conservative buyers with an affinity for traditional V6 smoothness. \nAll three, even with their disparate personalities, get the power to the wheels through a six speed automatic transmission with a manual shift mode. The difference is how quickly. \nAny enthusiast will gravitate toward the topline Sport model with the 2.7-liter engine. Acceleration is rapid, in the six second range to 60 mpg, and will surprise some hot shoes in sports sedans. \nWith its tall profile, the Sport doesn’t have the corner carving capability of sports sedans and more expensive CUVs. But with its new independent rear suspension system and tightly calibrated electric power steering, it performs competently and securely unless you get ridiculously aggressive.But even the SE, SEL and Titanium models are no slouches. The 2.0-liter engine feels strong off the line, though nowhere near the 2.7. Either cruises sedately at highway speeds. There was no opportunity to test the old shoe 3.5-liter V6. \nIt’s always best to put one’s best foot forward so the Edge introduction emphasized the Sport and Titanium models. The latter comports with Ford’s conviction that many buyers actually want to spend more money on their vehicles, not less. \nThat’s the reason for the Titanium model with all-wheel drive, which starts at $38,490. But the tester was loaded to the roof with equipment that included voice activated navigation, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert, 180-degree front camera with washer, automatic climate control, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, panoramic two panel sunroof, hands-free power rear hatch, SYNC 3 with MyFord Touch communications and entertainment systems, and Ford’s enhanced park assist. \nThe system automatically parallel parks or backs the Edge into a perpendicular space. It also guides the vehicle out of a tight parking space. With all that, the tested Titanium had a suggested price of $43,690. \nAlso available are adaptive cruise control and collision warning with automatic braking; adaptive steering to ease handling and control, and a fuel saving engine stop-start system. \nPut all the safety, parking and economy systems together and you understand the intelligent component of the Edge, complementing the attractive styling and the strength of the powerful turbo engines. \nOn the road, both the Titanium and Sport models delivered quiet comfort, solid straight line tracking and, if not pushed too hard, flat cornering. Ride comfort displayed a balance between stiff and cushy, and there was little wind noise at speed. \nOddly, the Edge doesn’t have much direct competition. Most competitors have three rows of seats like the Edge’s sibling, the Ford Explorer . Direct challenges come from the Nissan Murano and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport . \nOn the stage like our multi-talented burlesque dancer, the new Edge shimmies and shines with a noticeable appeal. \nSpecifications Model: 2015 Ford Edge Titanium AWD four crossover utility vehicle. Engine: 2.0-liter four cylinder, turbocharged, 245 hp, 275 lb-ft torque. Transmission: Six-speed automatic with manual shift mode. Overall length: 15 feet 8 inches. EPA passenger/cargo volume: 114/39 cubic feet. Weight: 4,060 pounds. EPA city/highway/combined fuel consumption: 20/28/23 mpg. Base price: $38,490. Price as tested: $43,690.",

      "text": "As Sheryl Connelly, Ford Motor Company&apos;s in-house futurist, and her team started conducting the research in early 2016 that would yield the just-released Looking Further with Ford 2017 global trends report, the U.S. presidential race had yet to be decided, and Brexit hadn&apos;t happened. \"But we had this sense of a growing restlessness,\" reflects Connelly, who was named one of Fast Company &apos;s Most Creative People in 2013.\nSheryl Connelly And now—in the wake of the election, Britain&apos;s vote to leave the European Union, and other world events—we are indeed entering 2017 facing change and uncertainty. \"Everyone is reassessing their priorities, rethinking what they thought they once knew,\" Connelly says. \nTrust in government, corporations, and media, which was on the decline back in 2013 when Ford first began sharing its trends research with the public, has gone off a cliff. We now live in a world where people—85%, according to Ford—are concerned about their personal data being obtained without their consent, and 80% believe media outlets offer more opinion than they do objective news coverage.\nEighty percent of respondents tell Ford they find social media is more about optics than substance, and 65% agree that people in general are less likely to even consider opposing viewpoints these days. \"We tend to only seek out information that already reinforces what we already believe,\" Connelly says. \"There is less room for discourse, for compromise, and people seem to be increasingly wedded to their point of view and unwilling to entertain any divergent perspective.\"\nMeanwhile, fake news is hard to avoid these days. \"Even when you want to do your due diligence, it&apos;s really difficult to figure out whether you’re reading something that&apos;s authentic,\" Connelly says, noting, \"This is an unexpected by-product of having information at our fingertips all the time.\"\nThere is no denying that technology has improved our lives, but we have entered what the Ford trends report describes as a \"tech spiral\" in which people are also starting to see the downsides of always being connected to devices and a nonstop stream of information and entertainment. Technology is making us obese, according to 77% of those surveyed, while a majority of respondents—78% of women and 69% of men—say technology causes sleep deprivation.\nFord&apos;s latest trends report also reveals that people are redefining what it means to live \"the good life,\" becoming less materialistic and pursuing experiences that make life worth living and staying true to their values. The majority of people agree prosperity is more about happiness than wealth, though the percentages vary depending on what country those surveyed live in. To wit: 82% of respondents in India agreed with this statement, while the percentages fell to 70% of those in the U.S. and 64% of those in the U.K. (Ford studied consumers in nine countries.)\nThe need to belong to a community is also strong all around the globe, and people expect businesses to play a role in that community and give back. In fact, 88% f women and 83% of men are more likely to support companies that prioritize purpose over profit. \"What a company stands for will actually have increasing importance in the viability of their brand,\" Connelly says, noting that the days of corporate social responsibility being an ancillary effort as opposed to a core component in the operation of any business are long over.\nThose looking for a deeper dive into all of the trends Ford sees influencing consumer behavior can read the entire Looking Further with Ford 2017 global trends report online.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. So Long, Material Girl: Millennials Aren’t Impressed By Flashy Spending \nAttitudes toward car and home ownership are rapidly changing in America and globally, with a majority of people saying they value material goods less than they used to, according to a new survey commissioned by Ford f . \nThe Ford Trends Survey 2016 found that 73% of Americans care less about material possessions than they did in the past, and nearly 64% agreed that personal wealth is an outdated measure of success. \nThere were some stark divergences among gender and generational lines. Where more than 85% of women aged 18-29 said they were annoyed by people who were flashy with their money, just 68% of young men did—the lowest number of any sampled cohort. Nearly 77% of young women said they cared less about material goods than they had in the past, while only 56% of young men agreed with that sentiment. \nWhy does this matter to Ford? “There was a saying in the baby boomer generation: ‘A car is the most expensive suit you’ll ever own,'” Sheryl Connelly, Ford’s global consumer trends and futuring manager, explains. “I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a millennial who agrees with that analogy.” \nLike any car manufacturer, ownership trends are important to Ford, whose Lincoln brand has an average ownership age of 61 (the highest in the industry, per a 2014 survey .) And auto industry economists estimate that four millennial customers are required to replace one baby boomer , as nowadays, those under 35 are typically saddled with student debts, are loathe to commit to costly auto loans or leases, or live in urban areas, where public transport and ride-sharing options like Uber negate the need to own a car. For more on consumer trends, watch Fortune’s video: \nFord, on its part, is trying a number of initiatives to get younger drivers engaged in the brand. Its Focus RS and ST models are “hot hatches” aimed squarely at winning over fans of high-performance Honda Civics and their ilk. Its Sync 3 infotainment software is leaps beyond the ill-fated MyFord Touch of nearly a decade ago. And FordPass, unveiled in January at the North American International Auto Show , is a step toward the future, where 113-year-old car companies like Ford are able to become mobility service providers.
