      "text": "Ford Confirms It Will Keep Lincoln Production in Kentucky -- Update November 18, 2016, 12:43:00 AM   By Christina Rogers \nFord Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers. \nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\" \nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said. \nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week. \nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy. \nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment. \nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running. \nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs. \nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said. \nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade. \nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars. \nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. \nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs--a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988. \nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com  18-160043ET  ",

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "Video Buy AP Photo Reprints DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. Ford doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. Company spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. The development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. Bill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): 11:15 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\n___\n8 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker.\nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n___\n7:20 p.m.\nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.\nThat's according to a senior Trump official.\nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition.\nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity.\n— By Julie Pace\n___\n7:10 p.m.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence.\nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust.\nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details.\n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting.\n___\n6:02 pm\nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\"\nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process.\nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information.\nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team.\nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing.\nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\"\n___\n4:26 p.m.\nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration.\nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies.\nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\"\nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.\n___\n3:27 p.m.\nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump.\nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced.\nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"\nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\"\nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.\n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\"\n—By Julie Bykowicz\n___\n3:15\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats.\nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington.\nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\"\nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\"\n___\n3:07 p.m.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill.\nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition.\nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care.\nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can.\nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser.\n__\n2:40 p.m.\nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris.\nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov.\nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\"\nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\"\nThat version was later removed from the website.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n___\n2:15 p.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists.\nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.\n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son — visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here.\nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.\n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\"\nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name.\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower.\nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union.\nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election.\nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n___\n1:40 p.m.\nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump.\nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower.\nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned.\nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\"\n___\n10:47 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\"\nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders.\nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray.\n___\n10:44 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\"\nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor.\nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs.\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.\nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family.\n___\n10:10 a.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon.\nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy.\nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon.\nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\"\nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises.\nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated.\n___\n8:50 a.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration.\nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower.\nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\"\n___\n8:05 a.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\"\nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.\n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday.\n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\"\nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.",

AP \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said on Twitter Thursday night that he convinced Ford executives to keep a production plant from moving to Mexico. \n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" Trump said on Twitter. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nBut there's one problem: Ford never planned to move its Louisville, Kentucky plant to Mexico. \nFord originally had plans to shift production of its Lincoln MKC vehicle from its Louisville plant to Mexico, according to The Courier-Journal, but the shift was not expected to affect employment levels at the plant. \nFord has now opted to keep building the line at the Louisville facility. \nThe company never announced it would be shutting down the plant and moving it across the border as Trump asserted. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Donald Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Ford said in a statement. \nFord announced on Tuesday that it would move production of its Ford Focus line of vehicles from Michigan to Mexico in order to make room at the factory for two new products. There will be no job loss due to the move however, CEO Mark Fields told Reuters. \n\nDuring his campaign Trump railed against American companies that he said outsourced jobs overseas and left some Americans unemployed. \nThe president-elect threatened to put a 45% tariff on goods from China to in an effort to punish companies that build products overseas.",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico - NBC12 - WWBT - Richmond, VA News On Your Side Member Center: Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

      "text": "DETROIT -- President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.\nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail.\nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.\n News Nation/World Associated Press",

      "text": "Ford India will export EcoSport facelift to the US from 2017 November 18, 2016 Exports Ford EcoSport \nAs a part of the Government’s Make in India strategy, Ford India is all set to export India made EcoSport to the US. \nFord is working out a strategy to ship the India-made EcoSport compact SUV into the US, their home country. This will be a huge push to PM Modi’s Make In India campaign as an American car maker will be making cars in India for their home market in the US. \nIt was back in 2014 , that the news about Ford looking at either India or Thailand for importing EcoSport SUV to the US was reported. However latest developments state that the parent company is in final stage talks with Ford India. Equipped with either an award-winning, 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost® engine or 2.0-liter four-cylinder with Intelligent 4WD, all-new Ford EcoSport provides power and control. \nThis will be for the first time that a US automaker will be shipping made-in-India cars back to the US. Ford India already exports the EcoSport to more than 62 countries, but exporting to the US will be something special. The request from headquarters is for about 90,000 units annually – this is more than what Ford sells in India. Ford India is confident of delivering cost, quality and volumes while logistics of shipments out of the country are also efficient and cost effective. They will be ensuring that all products will be of the highest quality, meeting global standards. All-new Ford EcoSport SES features unique interior styling cues such as bold copper accents for instrument and door panels along with sport seats. \nEarlier this week , Ford unveiled their new 2017 EcoSport facelift. It comes with revised exteriors and interiors. Highlight is the addition of a large 8 inch touchscreen infotainment system on the dashboard. The new EcoSport is expected to be launched in India next year. It is believed that the exports of EcoSport facelift will commence first, and then it will be launched in India. You may also like",

      "text": "DETROIT President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.\nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail.\nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer 1 hr ago ( … ) \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.",

But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. About Us",

Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico - WBRC FOX6 News - Birmingham, AL Member Center: Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "DETROIT - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.\nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an email.\nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 per cent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.\n ",

Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n7:20 p.m. \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \nBy Julie Pace \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \nBy Julie Bykowicz \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Friday Nov 18, 2016 at 6:00 AM Tom Krisher,   \nDETROIT (AP) \" President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. About Us",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated 49 min ago ( … ) \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.   \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

Learn more... \nFri, Nov 18, 2016, 3:17 PM SGT - Singapore Markets close in 1 hr 43 mins Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico Reuters – 3 hours ago -0.130 \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Bill Rigby) Insight: British PM's changing vocabulary signals shift from \"hard Brexit\" Reuters - 3 minutes 16 seconds ago There is a recognisable repetition in Theresa May's speeches about Britain's decision to leave the European Union: \"Brexit means Brexit\", making \"a success of it\" and getting \"the best deal\" for Britain are some of her stump phrases.

Learn more... \nFri, Nov 18, 2016, 3:18 PM SGT - Singapore Markets close in 1 hr 42 mins Ford CFO says too early to assess election effect, likes Trump's 'change in tone' Reuters – 13 hours ago Print \nDETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact of the election of Donald Trump U.S. president on its business over the next several years. \nShanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the \"change in tone\" in Trump's comments since his election last week. \nShanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. He said, however, that he is encouraged that the president-elect has said it wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be \"pro-growth, overall.\" \nThe Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow. \nThe market's reaction to Trump's election has not been overly dramatic, which tells him, Shanks said, that there are expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy. \n\"Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let's just wait and see,\" said Shanks. \n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse) Insight: British PM's changing vocabulary signals shift from \"hard Brexit\" Reuters - 4 minutes 39 seconds ago There is a recognisable repetition in Theresa May's speeches about Britain's decision to leave the European Union: \"Brexit means Brexit\", making \"a success of it\" and getting \"the best deal\" for Britain are some of her stump phrases.

      "text": "Reviewing Automakers’ 3Q16 Results in the Wake of the US Election PART 9 OF 12 Why Were Ford’s Margins Alarmingly Low in 3Q16? By John Parker | Nov 15, 2016 12:05 pm EST Ford’s margins \nPreviously, we looked at the key factors that drove General Motors’ ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler’s ( FCAU ) higher margins in 3Q16. At the same time, Ford Motor Company’s (F) net profit margin fell to a level similar to Fiat Chrysler’s. Let’s discuss some key drivers of the company’s fall in profitability. Primary drivers \nFord’s operating margin fell significantly in all of its key markets except for Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The company recently launched its F-Series Super Duty trucks in North America. Expenses related to this launch could also have hurt Ford’s profitability in 3Q16. \nThe company also announced a huge recall of its vehicles for door latch issues in September 2016. This recall cut ~$600 million from the company’s profits. What to expect in the future? \nDespite higher US demand for heavyweight vehicles, Ford couldn’t expand its margins in 3Q16. However, in the future, we can expect Ford’s Super Duty truck to boost its profitability. \nWe shouldn’t forget that Ford’s F-Series pickup trucks have been the US auto market’s ( VCR ) best-selling vehicles for nearly the last three decades. After the company’s modifications to the F-Series trucks’ metal bodies last year, it can likely expect continued high sales, even if oil prices rise in the near term. The current aluminum body version of the F-Series trucks provides far better fuel economy than the competition. \nHowever, Ford’s inability to focus on more profitable retail sales, unlike GM, raises questions. Ford’s profitability from its small car segment could also be at risk due to Donald Trump’s clear mandate in the US presidential election. Read Trump versus Machines: What to Expect in the Auto Industry to learn more. \nRead on to the next article, where we’ll take a quick look at Tesla’s ( TSLA ) 3Q16 earnings highlights. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"F\",\"GM\",\"FCAU\",\"TSLA\",\"VCR\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Ford Motor Company\",\"General Motors Company\",\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.\",\"Tesla Motors Inc\",\"Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF\"]} X",

      "text": "U.S. automaker cites declining auction values for used cars ‘It feels like a world that’s even more volatile,’ CFO says Share on Facebook \nFord Motor Co., cutting its 2017 profit forecast for the second time in three months, said it sees a bumpier future as President-elect Donald J. Trump translates his campaign promises into new policies on trade, tariffs and regulation. \n“It feels like a world that’s even more volatile,” Bob Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, said in a presentation to analysts today. The Trump administration “is going to be an opportunity for substantial change.” \nComplicating matters, those changes are coming just as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a record six straight years of growth -- meaning there’s now a glut of used cars that is hurting profit at its Ford Credit unit. On an optimistic note, Shanks said the automaker does expect Trump to have a “pro-growth” strategy for the economy. That might include easing tough fuel-economy regulations to reflect consumers’ preference for trucks and sport utility vehicles -- instead of electric cars -- in an era of cheap gasoline. \n“If the new government is serious about accelerating and growing in a very healthy way the U.S. economy -- and I believe it is -- I think it will take measures that will enable that,” Shanks said. Hitting Ford with a 35 percent duty on cars it makes in Mexico and brings back to the U.S., as Trump threatened during the campaign, “would be contrary to that.” \nFord is talking to Trump’s transition team, while also speaking with federal regulators about how low gas prices are undermining efforts to get Americans to buy electric cars and hybrids so that automakers can achieve a goal to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. EV Demand Lags \n“There’s been no movement whatsoever for electrified products, which is probably driven by the fact that gas prices are so low,” Shanks said. “It’s just not what any of us had expected, including the government. And it’s going to be very difficult, therefore, to get there without pushing on the customers things they just don’t want.” \nMore immediately, Ford is still adjusting to a slowing auto market -- cutting its forecast for 2017 pretax profits because of declining auction values for used cars. Ford shares fell 1.1 percent to $11.87 in New York and had declined 14 percent this year through Thursday. \nPretax earnings for the automaker’s credit unit next year will be about $1.5 billion, $300 million lower than its previous estimate, the company said Thursday in a regulatory filing. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million due to rising recall costs. The second-largest U.S. automaker reiterated that it expects total company adjusted pretax profit to drop in 2017 as it invests in “emerging opportunities,” and forecast improvement in 2018. \nHertz Global Holdings Inc. last week cut its annual earnings forecast , citing a drop in used-car values, especially for compact and mid-sized cars, which have come under pressure as American buyers shift to pickups and sport utility vehicles. \nFord has undertaken an extensive, expensive effort to transform itself to take on interlopers including Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The carmaker has said it will be selling 100,000 robot taxis -- without a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- annually by 2021. It’s also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its product lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and has begun offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \n“Clearly the investments we’re making in emerging opportunities, whether it’s electrification or autonomy or mobility, will impact our earnings,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Bloomberg TV last month. “Further out, those businesses will start to contribute to the company’s bottom line.” ( Updates with closing share price in seventh paragraph.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Associated Press | \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

      "text": "2017 Ford EcoSport 4WD unveiled at LA Auto Show November 18, 2016 \nIndia launch of the new EcoSport facelift is expected to take place by second half of 2017. \n2017 Ford EcoSport facelift made global debut at the ongoing LA Auto Show. The car on display, is the first-ever 4WD variant of the EcoSport. It will be exclusively offered with a 2.0 liter engine. Other engine option on offer in the US will be a 1.0 liter EcoBoost. \nAs of now, the 4×4 variant of EcoSport facelift is going to be sold only in the US. But considering that the car is going to be built in India and exported to the US , chances are that the new Ford EcoSport 4×4 is also launched in India. \nThe revamped front fascia of the 2017 EcoSport adopts a hexagonal grille which is more tuned towards global design language. The headlamps, bumpers, bonnet and fenders are also reskinned to go with the new grille. The overall front end design has derived inspiration from the new Edge. The profile has stayed intact while the rear fascia gets slightly revised combination lights and more chrome on the tailgate. In addition to this, there are also new front and rear bumpers. \nThe interior is the most significant enhancement by far. New EcoSport ditches the current dashboard design with centre console in favor of an understated yet more upmarket design which is further enhanced by dual-tone black-beige color theme. The steering wheel and instrument cluster are also all-new. All-new Ford EcoSport SES features unique interior styling cues such as bold copper accents for instrument and door panels along with sport seats. \nHigher variants get 8 inch colour touchscreen infotainment system, dual front airbags, projector headlamps, automatic climate control, LED daytime running lights, reverse parking camera, ABS with EBD, etc. \nThe powertrain lineup is expected to be retained as it is. The India-spec car is currently available with two petrol – 1.0L turbocharged EcoBoost and 1.5-litre Ti-VCT – and the lone 1.5-litre diesel engine. You may also like",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated 1 hr ago ( … ) \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By TOM KRISHER, AP Auto Writer \nDETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \nCopyright 2016 by The Associated Press.

      "title": "Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico",
      "text": "Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico By Published   \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production. \nOn Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \n\"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" the President-elect tweeted. \nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president. \nSpokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky\". \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the \"Lincoln plant\" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nIt is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. \nFord has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs. \nFord said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. \nIn 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nSCATHING CRITICISM \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nHe has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico. \nIn April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Ford's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) -- President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won&apos;t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nBill Ford, the company&apos;s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.\nFord doesn&apos;t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn&apos;t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It&apos;s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail.\nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn&apos;t change the company&apos;s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it&apos;s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.\n ",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) A wind turbine near Minneola \nMINNEOLA, Kan. (KSNW) — A new wind farm is being built near Dodge City. The 178 megawatt facility will provide enough energy to power about 54,000 homes for a year. \nIt will be built near Minneola but will bring an economic boom to both Ford and Clark counties. \nConstruction is about a fourth of the way complete on Bloom Wind farm. \nCapital Power, the company building and operating the wind farm, says it will have a significant impact on the local economy. \n“So the benefits to the counties Ford and Clark as well as to Minneola school board is quite significant with more than 1.2 million per year in direct payments to those counties, local landowners, and the school district,” said Michael Sheehan, a representative with Capital Power. \nThe money doesn’t come as taxes. Instead, Capital Power gives an agreed-upon contribution, which is then divided out among local counties, school districts, landowners, and other entities. \n“[It’s] very helpful, especially in these hard economic times for people,” said Ford County Treasurer Debra Pennington, “and I don’t think that people realize the impact that it does give to our community and the benefits that it does give us.” \nIt also brings short-term jobs to the community, during construction. \n“So currently there’s as many as 130 construction workers on site,” said Sheehan. “It would be a mixture of people. So some people would definitely be hired local, from within the counties, from within the state.” \nThe Minneola School District isn’t sure yet how much money it will receive from the deal. They’re still working out the specifics. \nIt does have a plan for how it will spend it. They’ll use the funds to pay down the bonds used to build the high school. \nThe district expects the money to start rolling in late in 2017. Share this: ",

Posted: Thursday, November 17, 2016 10:02 pm | Updated: 10:46 pm, Thu Nov 17, 2016. \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n10:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. But it was unclear where the MKC would be built. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC would stay in Louisville. A spokeswoman wouldn't say whether the SUV was destined for Mexico. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n— By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n—By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov . \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son — visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Associated Press | 0 comments \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Discuss Print",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST):\n11:15 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\n___\n8 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker.\nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n___\n7:20 p.m.\nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.\nThat's according to a senior Trump official.\nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition.\nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity.\n— By Julie Pace\n___\n7:10 p.m.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence.\nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust.\nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details.\n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting.\n___\n6:02 pm\nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\"\nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process.\nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information.\nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team.\nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing.\nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\"\n___\n4:26 p.m.\nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration.\nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies.\nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\"\nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.\n___\n3:27 p.m.\nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump.\nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced.\nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"\nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\"\nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.\n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\"\n—By Julie Bykowicz\n___\n3:15\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats.\nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington.\nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\"\nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\"\n___\n3:07 p.m.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill.\nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition.\nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care.\nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can.\nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser.\n__\n2:40 p.m.\nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris.\nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov.\nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\"\nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\"\nThat version was later removed from the website.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n___\n2:15 p.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists.\nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.\n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son — visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here.\nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.\n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\"\nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name.\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower.\nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union.\nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election.\nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n___\n1:40 p.m.\nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump.\nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower.\nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned.\nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\"\n___\n10:47 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\"\nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders.\nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray.\n___\n10:44 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\"\nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor.\nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs.\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.\nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family.\n___\n10:10 a.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon.\nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy.\nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon.\nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\"\nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises.\nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated.\n___\n8:50 a.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration.\nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower.\nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\"\n___\n8:05 a.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\"\nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.\n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday.\n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\"\nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.",

In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by 0 million to .2 billion. (Reuters) Ford Motor Co on Thursday lowered the 2017 pretax profit forecast for its financial services arm by $300 million due to lower auction values for used vehicles in the United States.\nThe company now expects Ford Credit to record a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion in 2017.\nFord affirmed that it expects full company pretax profit in 2017 to be down from 2016, and to improve in 2018. In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by $600 million to $10.2 billion.\nFord expects its core automotive business to improve in 2017 and 2018. The full company’s pretax profit will be down in 2017, it reaffirmed, due to investment in three areas of the business: electrified vehicles, self-driving vehicles, and shared mobility such as ride-sharing.\nBob Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, told industry analysts in New York on Thursday that Ford is not changing its investment plans in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles because of expected changes to U.S. regulations in a Donald Trump administration.\nShanks also said it was too early to assess the impact of Trump’s election on the No. 2 U.S. automaker.\nDuring the campaign, Trump targeted Ford as an example of U.S. companies moving jobs to Mexico.\nFord, which earlier had said the greatest declines in used vehicle auction values were for small cars, said the trend of significant declines had now spread over more of its product lineup.\nFord shares were down 0.8 percent at $11.90 in afternoon trading.",

      "text": "Ford recalls nearly 412K SUVs to fix fuel leaks WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Automaker Volkswagen says it will shed 30,000 jobs to cut costs as it tries to recover from its diesel emissions scandal and invests more in electric-powered vehicles and digital services. Company officials said at a news conference at headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, that 23,000 of the job cuts will come in Germany. It said the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros a year from 2020. Volkswagen has agreed to pay $15 billion under a settlement with U.S. authorities and owners of some 500,000 vehicles with software that turned off emissions controls. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. The company has said it aims to cut nonessential costs and investments and shift investment toward battery-powered cars and services such as car-sharing and ride-sharing.",

      "text": "Email \nSix inches may not seem like a whole lot in a number of situations, but when you add that half-foot to your typical 1940s-50s half-ton cab, you’re adding in an element of comfort that oftentimes steers many a folk away from building/owning a classic truck in the first place. The real trick is—doing it tastefully without creating a deformed-looking cab. \nInstead of going the roomier 1956 F-100 route to begin with, Minnesotan Warren Herreid’s recently acquired appreciation for the earlier—and more cockpit compact—F-1 pickups led him in that direction when he finally decided it was due time to fulfill his desire to own an old Ford truck. It was a friend’s F-100 (its cab lengthened 6 inches), however, that really inspired him to not only follow through with his search, but to have that “spacious” single-cab cruiser he’d been dreaming about finally come to life. \nStarting with an old military truck that, fortunately, came with an extra cab, Warren had Schwartz Performance in Woodstock, Illinois, handle the F-1’s transformation chores. First, they swapped the truck’s antiquated frame for one of their proprietary G-Machine chassis featuring a coil-over IFS with power rack and 13-inch Wilwood brakes along with a Moser 9-inch and triangulated four-link. Schwartz also squeezed a fresh 5.0L Ford Performance Coyote mod motor between their perimeter ‘rails and tubular upper coil-over mounts. The DOHC four-valve V-8, fitted with a Boss 302 intake system and custom stainless exhaust, mates to the 3.70-geared full-floater rear via a Ford 4R70W four-speed overdrive from Advantage Transmissions (Woodstock, IL). Warren chose to fully conceal the G-Machine chassis’ quartet of Wilwoods with a set of fully polished OE Billets garnished with Ford passenger car hubcaps. The 18-inch wheels mount 255/35R18 Michelins up front, and thanks to the narrowed 60-inch rearend, 12-inch wide rears fit a girthy 355/30R18. \nWhen it finally came time for the exterior sheetmetal work, along with massaging each and every panel above and beyond factory 1952 specs, Schwartz performed the aforementioned stretching of the cab—not by simply adding a 6-inch hump to the rear, rather, lengthening the cab through the floor, doors, and roof sections, allowing the proportions to remain, well, proportionate. In the process, that also required the rear fenders be moved forward an equal amount so as to retain the stock wheelbase. When all was said and done, Steve Nick (Nick’s Customs, also in Woodstock) handled the final bodywork and paint, mirror-finishing the truck in PPG black. A satin-finish-sealed bed wood kit with polished stainless trim strips, nestled between the needed wheel tubs, adds a nice contrasting touch when viewed from above. \nBefore Warren could finally stretch his legs, so to speak, the roomier cab was outfitted with a Dakota Digital VHX instrumentation system, Vintage Air A/C, Flaming River column with a Grant wheel, and a Tea’s bench seat. Shane Cassin (Cassin Customizing, Woodstock, IL) created and installed the F-1’s black leather interior, complete with a black German velour carpet and custom-made door panels. \nA year and a half in the making, Warren Herreid’s F-1 is the perfect example of a successfully—and tastefully—modernized classic truck function and form go hand-in-hand.",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters  26   \nWASHINGTON (Nov 17): U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production. \nOn Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \n\"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,\" the President-elect tweeted. \nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so, under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 — long before Trump announced a run for president. \nSpokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky\". \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the \"Lincoln plant\" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nIt is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. \nFord has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs. \nFord said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. \nIn 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nScathing criticism \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nHe has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico. \nIn April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest US$2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further US$1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move — and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Ford's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "Posted on November 17,   DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. Ford doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. Company spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. The development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. Bill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Share This:",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 4:17 AM Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "text": "Ford recalls nearly 412K SUVs to fix fuel leaks FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Automaker Volkswagen said Friday it will shed 30,000 jobs to cut costs as it tries to recover from its diesel emissions scandal and invests more in electric-powered vehicles and digital services. Company officials said at a news conference at headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, that 23,000 of the job cuts will come in Germany. It said the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. Volkswagen has agreed to pay $15 billion under a settlement with U.S. authorities and owners of some 500,000 vehicles with software that turned off emissions controls. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. The scandal has been a spur for the company to address problems such as excessively top-down management and excessive fixed costs at its manufacturing locations in Germany. The company has said it aims to cut nonessential costs and investments and shift investment toward battery-powered cars and services such as car-sharing and ride-sharing. CEO Matthias Mueller said it was \"the biggest reform package in the history of our core brand.\" In addition to Volkswagen, the company also makes cars under other brands including Porsche, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and Lamborghini. Herber Diess, head of the core Volkswagen brand, said that Volkswagen had let its costs rise and \"lost ground in terms of productivity.\" Volkswagen Group, with its multiple brands, has more than 600,000 employees but the cuts will mainly fall on its 120,000-strong German work force. The company cut a deal with its powerful worker representatives under which future investment would be in Germany and the reduction in staff would rely on voluntary departures such as early retirement, with no firings.

      "text": "November 18, 2016 1:17 AM Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. UPDATED: 11/18/16 12:16 am ET -- adds details \nDETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. had considered moving production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico, but instead the compact premium crossover will remain at the Louisville Assembly Plant, the automaker confirmed Thursday night. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said the Cuautitlan plant was the \"likely\" new plant for the MKC when the automaker's deal with the UAW expires in 2019. \nBut now the automaker plans to build the next generation of the MKC in Louisville, Kelli Felker, Ford's global manufacturing and labor communications manager told Automotive News late Thursday. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump, in a Thursday tweet, said his “friend” Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him and said the company would keep its “Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- No Mexico.” \nBaker said the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \nFord’s Louisville Assembly Plant builds both the Lincoln MKC and Ford Escape. In its 2015 agreement with the UAW, Ford committed $700 million in investments there over the next four years, although the deal said the current MKC “will balance out to allow capacity for Escape.” \nThe president-elect appeared to take some credit for the decision on Twitter. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump said. \n“We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -- and the new Congress -- as they shape the policy agenda for 2017,” Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said in a statement. “We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs -- building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years. Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nFord did not immediately respond to a question about what role Trump played in its decision. \nReuters contributed to this report.

The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.

It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. Get news headlines sent daily   Daily Headlines   \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated 0 \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nFord Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers.\nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover.\nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said.\nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week.\nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running.\nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs.\nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said.\nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade.\nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars.\nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs--a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 00:43 ET (05:43 ",

      "text": "\n(Adds background on Ford plans) \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.

      "text": "print \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "text": "print \n(Adds mention of trend of lower used vehicle auction values spreading over more of Ford vehicle lineup) \nNov 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday lowered the 2017 pretax profit forecast for its financial services arm by $300 million due to lower auction values for used vehicles in the United States. \nThe company now expects Ford Credit to record a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion in 2017. \nFord affirmed that it expects full company pretax profit in 2017 to be down from 2016, and to improve in 2018. In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by $600 million to $10.2 billion. \nFord expects its core automotive business to improve in 2017 and 2018. The full company's pretax profit will be down in 2017, it reaffirmed, due to investment in three areas of the business: electrified vehicles, self-driving vehicles, and shared mobility such as ride-sharing. \nBob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, told industry analysts in New York on Thursday that Ford is not changing its investment plans in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles because of expected changes to U.S. regulations in a Donald Trump administration. \nShanks also said it was too early to assess the impact of Trump's election on the No. 2 U.S. automaker. \nDuring the campaign, Trump targeted Ford as an example of U.S. companies moving jobs to Mexico. \nFord, which earlier had said the greatest declines in used vehicle auction values were for small cars, said the trend of significant declines had now spread over more of its product lineup. \nFord shares were down 0.8 percent at $11.90 in afternoon trading. \n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru and Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Andrea Ricci) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Updated: 4:13 a.m. Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 | Posted: 4:13 a.m. Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER The Associated Press DETROIT — \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated 23 min ago \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated 27 min ago \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) prev next comments WASHINGTON — The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST):\n11:15 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\n___\n8 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker.\nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n___\n7:20 p.m.\nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.\nThat's according to a senior Trump official.\nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition.\nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity.\n— By Julie Pace\n___\n7:10 p.m.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence.\nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust.\nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details.\n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting.\n___\n6:02 pm\nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\"\nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process.\nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information.\nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team.\nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing.\nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\"\n___\n4:26 p.m.\nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration.\nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies.\nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\"\nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.\n___\n3:27 p.m.\nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump.\nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced.\nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"\nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\"\nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.\n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\"\n—By Julie Bykowicz\n___\n3:15\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats.\nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington.\nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\"\nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\"\n___\n3:07 p.m.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill.\nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition.\nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care.\nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can.\nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser.\n__\n2:40 p.m.\nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris.\nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov.\nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\"\nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\"\nThat version was later removed from the website.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n___\n2:15 p.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists.\nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.\n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son — visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here.\nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.\n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\"\nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name.\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower.\nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union.\nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election.\nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n___\n1:40 p.m.\nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump.\nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower.\nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned.\nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\"\n___\n10:47 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\"\nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders.\nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray.\n___\n10:44 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\"\nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor.\nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs.\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.\nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family.\n___\n10:10 a.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon.\nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy.\nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon.\nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\"\nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises.\nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated.\n___\n8:50 a.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration.\nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower.\nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\"\n___\n8:05 a.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\"\nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.\n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday.\n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\"\nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 4:17 AM Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nBill Ford , the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.\nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail.\nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

      "text": "Ford Ka+ Tries Another ST Suit Because, Why Not? | By Share While Ford doesn't seem interested in expanding its ST portfolio below the Fiesta, artists are free to ponder about the possibility of a performance orientated Ka+. Conjured by X-Tomi , it sports a more aggressive design than its regular sibling, with a specific ST grille, slightly modded front bumper, beefier side skirts, tweaked rear bumper and tailgate spoiler, In the (unlikely) event the Blue Oval ever decided to create such a car, it would take the battle to the Renault Twingo GT . This job would require - besides fitting it with a new body kit, upgrading its chassis, suspension and brakes, and naturally a more powerful engine. This shouldn’t be a problem, however, as Ford has a nice range of small-capacity EcoBoost units to pick from. In the meantime, one can go ahead and place a deposit for the regular Ford Ka+ in Europe, which is already available for order , powered by a 70 PS (69 HP) and 85 PS (84 HP) 1.2-liter mill. Prices for the five-door model kick off from €9,900 ($10,930) in Germany. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated 0 \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Tags",

A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. About Us",

      "text": "Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from... | 56 minutes ago | Vote 0 0 Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico — but it wasn’t planning to Donald Trump By Jim Tankersley President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. On Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico Then followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! Ford has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. In a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \"Today, we confirmed with the president-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that president-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" In a followup email exchange, a Ford spokesperson confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. This week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. Trump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. In an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants — most notably, in Kentucky. Ford announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. Bill Ford Jr., the company's executive chair, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\" | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

      "text": "Southfield, Michigan: Ford Motor Co., cutting its 2017 profit forecast for the second time in three months, said it sees a bumpier future as President-elect Donald J. Trump translates his campaign promises into new policies on trade, tariffs and regulation.\n“It feels like a world that’s even more volatile,” Bob Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, said in a presentation to analysts today. The Trump administration “is going to be an opportunity for substantial change.”\nComplicating matters, those changes are coming just as US auto sales are slowing after a record six straight years of growth — meaning there’s now a glut of used cars that is hurting profit at its Ford Credit unit. On an optimistic note, Shanks said the automaker does expect Trump to have a “pro-growth” strategy for the economy. That might include easing tough fuel-economy regulations to reflect consumers’ preference for trucks and sport utility vehicles — instead of electric cars — in an era of cheap gasoline.\n“If the new government is serious about accelerating and growing in a very healthy way the US economy — and I believe it is — I think it will take measures that will enable that,” Shanks said. Hitting Ford with a 35 per cent duty on cars it makes in Mexico and brings back to the US, as Trump threatened during the campaign, “would be contrary to that.”\nFord is talking to Trump’s transition team, while also speaking with federal regulators about how low gas prices are undermining efforts to get Americans to buy electric cars and hybrids so that automakers can achieve a goal to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. \nEV Demand Lags\n“There’s been no movement whatsoever for electrified products, which is probably driven by the fact that gas prices are so low,” Shanks said. “It’s just not what any of us had expected, including the government. And it’s going to be very difficult, therefore, to get there without pushing on the customers things they just don’t want.”\nMore immediately, Ford is still adjusting to a slowing auto market — cutting its forecast for 2017 pretax profits because of declining auction values for used cars. Ford shares fell 1.1 per cent to $11.87 in New York and had declined 14 per cent this year through Thursday.\nPretax earnings for the automaker’s credit unit next year will be about $1.5 billion, $300 million lower than its previous estimate, the company said Thursday in a regulatory filing. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million due to rising recall costs. The second-largest US automaker reiterated that it expects total company adjusted pretax profit to drop in 2017 as it invests in “emerging opportunities,” and forecast improvement in 2018.\nHertz Global Holdings Inc. last week cut its annual earnings forecast, citing a drop in used-car values, especially for compact and mid-sized cars, which have come under pressure as American buyers shift to pickups and sport utility vehicles.\nFord has undertaken an extensive, expensive effort to transform itself to take on interlopers including Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The carmaker has said it will be selling 100,000 robot taxis — without a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — annually by 2021. It’s also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 per cent of its product line-up to electrified vehicles by 2020 and has begun offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco.\n“Clearly the investments we’re making in emerging opportunities, whether it’s electrification or autonomy or mobility, will impact our earnings,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Bloomberg TV last month. “Further out, those businesses will start to contribute to the company’s bottom line.”",

Post to Facebook Ford toTrump: We'll keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told president-elect Donald Trump on Thursday the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville to Mexico.  //usat.ly/2fCHpJQ   Ford toTrump: We'll keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky Brent Snavely, Detroit Free Press 7:32 a.m. EST November 18, 2016 The 19th most unreliable car is the Lincoln MKC, because of electronics, drive systems and power equipment (Photo: Lincoln) \nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford told president-elect Donald Trump on Thursday the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville to Mexico. \nAfter repeatedly bashing Ford for investing in Mexico, Trump took credit in two tweets Thursday night for causing Ford to change its plans for the MKC luxury crossover. \nFord currently makes both the Ford Escape compact sport-utility vehicle and the MKC in Louisville. Ford said last year it planned to move MKC production to another plant so it could increase production of the Escape. The automaker said at the time no jobs would be lost in Louisville because of plans to boost Escape production. \nThe Dearborn automaker also made a commitment in its 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over the next four years. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford's plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was the \"likely\" location for the MKC in 2019. \nBaker did not say why the automaker changed its plans for the Lincoln SUV. She did confirm that Bill Ford spoke with President-elect Trump on Thursday. \n\"Bill shared Ford's continued commitment to invest in the U.S.,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nFord employs about 4,700 people at its plant in Louisville. The vast majority of the vehicles built at the plant are Escape SUVs. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nTrump has repeatedly criticized Ford over the past 18 months for its plans to move the production of its Ford Focus and Ford C-Max hybrids to Mexico even though nearly all other automakers also have built new plants in recent years or are expanding their presence there. \nTrump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., signaled plans to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and proposed a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico as well as other products. \n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show. \nFields also said the automaker sent Trump a congratulatory letter after he won the Nov. 8 election. \nSeveral other top-ranking executives at the Los Angeles Auto Show declined to comment directly on Trump's comments about NAFTA or the tariff. Instead, most automotive executives say it's too early to comment on Trump's comments on the campaign trail because he hasn't formally proposed anything yet. \n\"Well obviously, we are in a transition at the moment. I think it’s important with all of the speculation that’s out there just to see once the transition is finished, what the environment looks like,\" Mike Manley, head the Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said Wednesday. \"Like every other automaker we are in contact with the administration, we welcome that contact, we are looking forward to that continuing and will see what happens.\" \nFord, on Friday, emphasized that it has created 28,000 new jobs and has invested $12 billion in the U.S. over the past five years. \n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team — and the new Congress — as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs,\" Ford said in a statement. \nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Brent Snavely on Twitter @ BrentSnavely .

      "text": "(LINK) \nKentucky Governor Matt Bevin responds: 2 days ago, @realDonaldTrump told me he was working w/ @Ford to keep smaller vehicle production in KY & in USA..Tonight they delivered..TY! \n— Matt Bevin (@MattBevin) November 18, 2016 \nThe deep-dive back story that was only discussed here is below: \nSEPTEMBER 15TH 2016 – This is a really important interview to grasp the scope of the America-First economic challenge in front of Donald Trump and specifically U.S. workers. Unfortunately, what follows below is the best version of the interview we can find and it has edits, significant edits by CNN, to the initial portion of the interview as it originally aired. \nFor those unfamiliar with how structured these types of interviews are, there are a few key aspects worth noting in advance of watching the video: \n♦ CEO Mark Fields is not alone in this interview. Off camera there are key corporate executive advisers, PR, Marketing, HR, Risk Mgmt., etc. positioned to give immediate feedback toward any sound bites that can have an adverse impact on the corporate objectives. There’s a few times when you can see Fields taking cues from those voices. \n♦ The CEO corporate culture (starts in MBA school) teaches executives how to use code words and phrases to avoid pitfalls, and unless you are skilled -or familiar- in detecting the nuance, much of the significant verbiage can be missed. Words and phrases matter. \nThere’s a big difference between a major corporate CEO saying “ investment in North America “, and “ investment in America “. The former references international trade agreements such as NAFTA which apply to Mexico the U.S. and Canada, the latter is directed to the United States. Pay close attention and you’ll note the importance. \n♦ Notice how Mark Fields will not answer key and specific questions directly. Instead choosing to use parseltongue and politispeak coded language. This is a trained skill much like a professional politician is trained in non-answers that leave the viewer/listener the impression of an answer. \n♦ Pay additional attention to phrases such as: \n• “ retained or created jobs “, you’ll notice the similarity to “saved or created jobs” vis-a-vis the Obama stimulus. The use of the phrases holds a similar intent. \n• “ most of our investment is here in the U.S. “, this is a slight-of-word use. Of course Ford has most of their investment here in the U.S., the historic valued infrastructure is part of that phrase. \nThe issue for this conversation is “future investment or reinvestment”, and that’s where you see the verbiage shift (use of) “North America” coming into play. \n• “value market” is the term for cheaper cars. In this example the Ford Focus model. \nNotice also Poppy Harlow was finally able to pin Fields down on “40% labor savings”. That specific number is where you hear the counter Trump approach of a 35% tariff which would eliminate that incentive. If Ford saves 40% labor cost on Ford Focus vehicles by building in Mexico, and they face a 35% Tax upon re-import, the incentive to have Mexican workers build the vehicle is lost. Notice Mark Fields avoids answering that question. \nNotice also Harlow asks about the 40% savings and where that profit is reinvested. Notice how Fields says the monies return to the corporate structure (U.S.A.) where reinvestment determinations are made. However, the reinvestment determination, as previously outlined, is “a North American” and/or “global” determination. Parseltongue. \nOn one hand the CEO states the goal is to remain competitive in the “value market” (ie. cheap car market like Kia etc.), however, at the same time Fields never mentions lowering the price, because it’s the profit margin actually driving the decision – not any consumer savings. The U.S.A market (consumer) will not see Ford Focus vehicles drop in price; instead they’re just made in Mexico at a lower cost. \nThis key distinction is the heart of the Economic Patriotism argument. \nAn argument that Bernie Sanders has made effectively, Donald Trump has also recognized, and one which through the course of time -and history has empirically evidenced- creates terrible long-term consequences for the rapidly diminishing middle class U.S. worker. \nThe economic patriotism distinction is also where traditionally minded conservatives, like myself, have reevaluated the bigger picture and accepted the following: In a global world the concept of traditional economic models (for free-market capitalism) are no longer working on behalf of the United States of America – because there is no national pride or incentive attached to the end goal, profit. \nPaul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recalled that John Maynard Keynes once was challenged for altering his position on some economic issue: \n“When my information changes,” said Keynes “ I change my mind. What do you do Sir?” \nWhile I have never agreed with Keynesian economic theory, Keynes attributed quote itself is never more apropos than today’s 2016 American economics argument amid various conservatives. What good is Mark Levin’s definition of conservatism, when there’s no middle class America left to conserve? \nWhat good are George Will’s free market theories when the end result is the outflow of American wealth into poorer, less economically developed countries, while we EBT ourselves into a national debt crisis because we are trying to sustain the diminished value of the American worker? A d v e r t i s e m e n t \nNot only is this historic approach now rapidly becoming the pathway into an unrecoverable American economic death spiral, it is also global wealth distribution done by Wall Street, not Main Street. \nThe result, our result, is an ever expanding, seemingly impossible to stop, wealth gap, creating an unnatural and profoundly unhealthy class system, in America, between the “Rich” and “Poor”. \nWe do not need socialism to fix the problem, we need economic patriotism from industrial giants, Main Street, who value the principles behind putting American-workers-First. \nNow, watch the video [*Note* ignore the pontificating liberalism of Poppy Harlow or you’ll miss important stuff]: \nFord is willing to spend $1.6 BILLION to create 2,800 jobs in Mexico, to save 40% on the price of their “value product line” of automobiles. \nIf a Ford Focus costs $8,000 to manufacture (in Mexico). How many Focus’s would they need to sell at an additional 40% profit margin to make up for their initial investment of $1.6 BILLION. Do the math, and you’ll realize why I shall never again purchase a Ford vehicle. \nFord CEO Mark Fields, like many modern vulture capitalists, is a globalist – not an America-First CEO.",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 4:17 AM Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) – President-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won’t move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump said in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. But company spokeswoman Christin Baker says she doesn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan.\nThis embed is invalid",
