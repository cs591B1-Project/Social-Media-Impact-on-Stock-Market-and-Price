      "text": "Comment Apple is offering free battery replacements to affected iPhone 6S users. It was previously reported that the China Consumers Association began investigating complaints of iPhone 6S randomly shutting down in China. LWYang / Flickr \nApple has previously issued lower service charge for affected iPhone 6 Plus users over multi-touch issues. Now, the tech company is offering free battery replacements for some iPhone 6S devices. It had been reported that a Chinese consumer protection group has begun investigating complaints of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S unexpectedly shutting down. Apparently, the problem occurs even if the said phone has over 50 percent battery life. \nApple posted on its website that there is a very small number of iPhone 6S devices with this issue. The tech giant insists that these affected devices were manufactured back in September and October 2015. Apple added that it's only within a limited serial range. Though Apple does confirm that there is a problem, it did not specify exactly what causes it. This is what the China Consumers Association (CCA) has requested from Apple other than elaborating its actions regarding the problem, according to the Computer World . \nConsumers are advised by Apple to visit an Apple Retail Store or any Apple Authorized Service Provider. The phone's serial number has to be checked to ensure that it does have to be replaced. Likewise, the phone itself will be examined to confirm that it is eligible for Apple's replacement program. The said service is actually free of charge. \nApple also reminded those who have already bought a battery to replace their affected phone. The company should be contacted for a refund. Users are also reminded that this program does not extend the initial warranty coverage of iPhone 6S devices. \nIt should be noted that those who have complained said they had tried to turn their phones but were not successful. According to The Wall Street Journal , the CCA also added that even upgrading the system to the latest iOS would not prevent some iPhone 6S devices from randomly shutting down. \nThis is the second time that Apple has offered a repair program within a week. Apple also announced that iPhone 6 Plus users with multi-touch of flickering display issues will receive a discounted $149 service charge. That's compared to the usual price of $329. The tech company claimed that the said issue is caused by dropping the phones multiple times on a hard surface. Apple is also offering reimbursements to those who have paid for the original price. Though some have claimed that it's an engineering defect. \nUnlike the unexpected shutdown of iPhone 6S, the multi-touch issue with iPhone 6 Plus goes way back in October. The Business Insider had reported about people who were frustrated that Apple would actually charge them.",

      "text": "Reddit \nFollowing a report in September that Apple was considering an acquisition of supercar manufacturer McLaren, the company has told Reuters that discussions and meetings did take place, but did not get as far as a formal bid. There wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition. \nThe company had said previously only that it was not currently ‘in discussion with Apple about any potential investment.’ \nApple appears to have significantly retreated from its rumored plans to make an Apple Car , partially shuttering the project in September before apparently switching tack in October, focusing on testing the feasibility of an autonomous driving platform rather than an entire car.

      "text": "If you’re an iPhone 6 Plus owner, you may have come across the iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problem . The touchscreen problem aka the \" Touch Disease \" occurs after one too many drops of the phone, resulting in an unresponsive touchscreen with a grey line visible at the top of the display. \nThe main cause of the \"Touch Disease\" is due to a lack of underfill between the iPhone’s touch ID and the solder joints. This makes the phone more flexible, but also more susceptible to impact. \nWhile Apple is not quite ready to take full responsibility for this problem, it has set up the Multi-Touch Repair Program to handle the problem . \n\nBring the problematic iPhones to either an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, and should the iPhone 6 Plus itself be in good condition, Apple will be able to repair the phone for a service price of USD149 . \nFor those who have already repaired their phones earlier, Apple will readily reimburse the difference in service fee. \n20 Most-Wanted Apple Watch Tips and Tricks \n20 Most-Wanted Apple Watch Tips and Tricks Have a question on how to do something on your new Apple Watch?

By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 21, 2016 6:44 pm Apple is expected to overhaul the iPhone 8’s design next year given its the 10th anniversary of iPhone in 2017. (Representational image of iPhone 7 Plus) \nApple iPhone 8 is far from its release but the tech industry is already interested in what the Cupertino giant will be offering in 2017. An earlier report from Nikkei had shared a statement from a Sharp executive (Sharp is an Apple supplier) who said that the 2017 iPhone will be adopting an OLED display. However, the latest report from Bloomberg suggests Apple might not have enough suppliers to satiate the demand for these OLED panels. \n“ The trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won’t have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company, ” the report points out. \nThe four major suppliers of OLED panels include Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and Japan Display Inc. According to the report, though Apple has tied-up with Samsung for OLED technology, the South Korean company itself might not produce enough to meet the demand. \nDo note, Samsung makes OLED panel for its own smartphones as well and might struggle to keep up up Apple’s demands, which spikes during holiday season. The report highlights, “ Apple shipped about 75 million iPhones in the 2015 holiday quarter, and some analysts estimate that as many as 90 million could be sold in the last three months of 2017.” \nApple is expected to overhaul the iPhone 8’s design next year given its the 10th anniversary of iPhone in 2017 (the first iPhone was launched by Steve Jobs in 2007). Apple iPhone 8 is said to come in two variants based on the screen size: 5-inch and 5.8-inch. \nThe Bloomberg report quotes KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said Apple could use OLED technology for only one of its models of iPhone 8 and go with older LCD for other ones due to production shortage. “ The combination of Apple’s stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, ” Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit told the site. \nReports suggest, Apple will go for a radical design change for iPhone 8 that will have edge-to-edge display or bezel-less design. The Cupertino giant is expected to ditch the aluminium metal casings in favour of an all-glass design for the 2017 iPhone. The device is said to feature glass backs developed by Biel and Lens. The glass front and the glass back will be held together using a metal frame. The iPhone 8 will have a front-facing virtual home button instead of a physical one. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

Some eager iPhone fans arrived to queue at 4am on Thursday morning to be the first to purchase Apple's new products, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with iOS 8 featuring 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. (Photo by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images) Cole Bennetts Next \nApple will offer free battery replacements after reports of iPhone 6 devices unexpectedly shutting down. \nThe company reported a \"very small number\" of the phones might shut down unexpectedly. The company wrote in a news release that the issue is not a safety concern and impacts some devices built between September and October 2015. \nThose with the issue are asked to visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider with the device's serial number in order to get a free battery replacement. \nBefore getting the battery replaced, those with the issue are asked to back up the phone's data. For more details, click here . \nLast week, Apple offered to fix iPhone 6s Plus devices that were impacted by the \"touch disease,\" according to ZDNet.com . The issue impacts phones that have been dropped on hard surfaces and makes the screen unresponsive. \nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.",

      "title": "Apple doubles down on running with Nike-edition smartwatch – The Denver Post",
      "text": "By Anick Jesdanun, The Associated Press\nNEW YORK — Apple isn’t the first to add GPS functionality to a smartwatch, but it’s the first to make something that feels like a running watch.\nAnd the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch.\nI’ve found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I’m running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I’m running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more.\nI’ve logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I’ve also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it’s essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I’m not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs.\nRelated Articles November 20, 2016 What an iPhone could cost in Donald Trump’s America November 15, 2016 U.S. urges stronger security for internet-enabled devices October 27, 2016 Apple unveils redesigned MacBook Pro October 27, 2016 Apple adds keyboard touch functions to Mac in major refresh THE IMPORTANCE OF GPS\nThe original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS.\nThough GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts.\nWhile Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life.\nIMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL\nSeries 2 watches start at $369, though it’s $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original:\n• Apple’s Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn’t use to, even with access to the phone’s GPS.\n• You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn’t help when you were running laps or loops that weren’t precisely that length.\nNIKE EXTRAS\nNike’s app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates.\nNike excels in trying to motivate you even when you’re not running. It will keep asking “Are we running today?” by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month’s total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it’s time to run.\nThough the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price.\nBEYOND RUNNING\nCyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn’t measure how fast you’re pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don’t allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap.\nWHAT’S STILL MISSING\nRecording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown.\nAnd while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone’s Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that’s Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up. Strava’s still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn’t have one at all.\nFor these reasons, I’m sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220.\nAnd while it’s a minor annoyance, both Apple’s and Nike’s app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit “start.” (At least with Nike’s, you can disable the countdown deep in the phone settings.)\nDO YOU NEED APPLE WATCH?\nBecause this review is focused on runners’ needs, I haven’t gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don’t offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don’t need the “smarts,” a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple is seemingly getting out of the router accessory business, ‘disbanding’ the division inside the company according to Bloomberg . This means Apple will no longer develop its $99 AirPort Express , $199 AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule products . The report says Apple is reallocating employees to focus on its core consumer products that generate the vast majority of its revenue. \nThe newest AirPort devices are more than three years old, so the future of the products has been in doubt for a while. Sales revenue of AirPort products must pale in comparison to Apple’s other lines, which are counted in the tens of billions of dollars. \nThe AirPort lines have also been seeing discounts in recent weeks , suggesting that they are coming to an end-of-life. Routers are not the only thing Apple has been getting out of recently; it also has exited the standalone external display business . \nThe pathway for customers of AirPort products is unclear (assuming the report is accurate). Apple may partner with a third-party company to offer recommended replacement routers in the same way it partnered with LG to produce the 4K and 5K USB-C displays for the new MacBook Pro. \nAs well as being a WiFi router, Apple’s AirPort Express includes a 3.5mm aux jack to turn standard speaker systems into AirPlay receivers for music. As AirPlay is a proprietary technology, discontinuing the AirPort Express would leave a gap in the ecosystem. Perhaps Apple could develop a simpler AirPlay speaker adaptor that didn’t include the WiFi antennas and acted solely as a way to stream music a la Chromecast Audio. \nThe strategy decision does not appear to mean that people lost their jobs but they have been reassigned to other teams, including the Apple TV group. \nAs it stands right now, all three Apple AirPort WiFi products are still in stock on Apple’s own store. The report did not suggest a timeframe for when to expect them to be discontinued officially. We’ll wait and see if Apple follows up with an official statement on the future of the lines. Guides",

      "text": "Apple Abandons Development of Wireless Routers Mark Gurman November 21, 2016 — 7:00 AM EST Company recently exited external computer monitor business Apple disbands its router division, reassigns engineers Photographer: Peter Belanger via Apple \nApple Inc. has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company’s focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter. \nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn’t been publicly announced. \nApple hasn’t refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn’t currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans. \nRouters are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. Apple currently sells three wireless routers, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule. The Time capsule doubles as a backup storage hard drive for Mac computers. \nThe products, which cost $99, $199, and $299, respectively, make up a small slice of Apple’s revenue and are part of Apple’s “other products” category on its financial statements. The category, which includes the Apple Watch and Apple TV, generated $11.1 billion in fiscal 2016, or about 5 percent of total sales. \nExiting the router business could make Apple’s product ecosystem less sticky. Some features of the AirPort routers, including wireless music playback, require an Apple device like an iPhone or Mac computer. If the company no longer sells wireless routers, some may have a reason to use other phones and PCs. \nThe core of the technology in routers comes from chipmakers such as Broadcom Ltd. that advance Wi-Fi technology through developing the fundamental components. While router makers can differentiate the design of their products, the number of antennas and the software that controls them, they reliant on advances first made by chipmakers to be able to offer new, higher-performing models.

Apple, which has charged more for its routers, has focused more on integrating control of its devices into its computer operating system and industrial design. The company’s decision to leave the business may be a boon for other wireless router makers.\nEarlier this year, Apple stopped making its own external monitors and in October introduced a new strategy by selling new high-resolution screens for professional users with LG Electronics Inc.

Apple Watch Users Can Compete in the Thanksgiving Day Challenge The contest is available in the U.S. only by Bryan M. Wolfe November 21, 2016 \nThanksgiving Day in the United States has never been a day when exercise is a priority. Cupertino hopes to change this by dangling a special workout achievement in front of Apple Watch users. \nOn Thursday, Nov. 24 only, Apple Watch users in the U.S. can earn a special achievement that’s shaped like a turkey. The Thanksgiving Day Challenge will be awarded to anyone who records at least 5K (3.1 miles) through a run, walk, or wheelchair workout. The distance may be recorded through Apple’s Workout app or any third-party app that integrates with HealthKit. \nWant more motivation? If you receive the special 3-D achievement badge, you’ll also receive an iMessage sticker that you can share with others to celebrate your accomplishment. \nThis is the first time Apple has offered an achievement badge tied to a special day or event. Perhaps, we’ll see other special badges in the coming weeks. Super Bowl LI is on Sunday, Feb. 5, Apple. View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Bloomberg: Apple scraps wireless router development (Seeking Alpha) \nWhile iPhone ASP may have already peaked, its unit sales may peak in FY 2018, Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report. He added that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) does not seem to have “the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services , messaging),” and would probably become even more reliant on the iPhone. \nUerkwitz expects the stock to generally underperform the market over the next decade. He maintains a Perform rating on the company. Shrinking Product Differentiation \nApple may not be able to meaningfully increase iPhone prices beyond the next cycle. “Fewer hardware breakthroughs are available today that can trigger favorable mix shift,” Uerkwitz wrote. He added that the performance gap and hardware differentiation between iPhones and high-end Android phones would continue to shrink, restricting Apple’s ability to raise prices. \nUerkwitz expects iPhone unit sales to peak at 245 million in FY 2018. “We believe tailwinds from first-time buyers and switchers are no longer material. And we expect the overall replacement cycle to be longer due to weaker carrier-provided incentives and a more diverse installed base.” \nSimilar problems are likely to affect the iPad and Mac as their differentiation gaps shrink. “We see plenty of competitors that can seriously harm Apple’s ecosystem with software and services,” the analyst commented further. \nImage Credit: By MNXANL (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for AAPL",

      "text": "Apple has promised to replace the batteries in what it says are \"a very small number\" of iPhone 6S handsets that have suffered sudden shutdowns.\nOver the weekend, the company confirmed rumours coming out of China that some customers were seeing their phones unceremoniously switch off.\nFurther Reading Apple will fix iPhone 6 Plus “touch disease” at a cost of nearly £150 Unlike the battery problems with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , which saw some handsets unexpectedly go up in flames, Apple has insisted that its iPhone 6S recall doesn't represent \"a safety issue.\"\nThe affected phones, it said, all come from a \"limited\" range of serial numbers, which were manufactured in September and October 2015.\nApple declined to comment when quizzed by Ars about how many iPhone 6S handsets had been affected by the shutdown flaw. It also refused to reveal the range of serial numbers that are subject to the recall.\nCustomers have been told to either visit an Apple store or an authorised third-party service provider—though not those belonging to mobile networks—to get their serial number checked free of charge, to determine whether their iPhone 6S should be recalled.\nAlternatively, Apple said people can contact its customer support service. The replacement won't cost anything, but Apple did say that if a customer's \"iPhone 6S has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair.\"\nIt's understood that the sudden shutdown kicks in once battery charge drops to between 50 and 60 percent—a glitch first identified by the China Consumers Association, which asked Apple to investigate the problem last week.\nFurther Reading Samsung doesn’t want to pay for fire damage from the Galaxy Note 7 Meanwhile, just last week, Apple said it would replace the screens of any iPhone 6 Plus handsets that had been afflicted by the so-called \"touch disease\" for the reduced price of just under £150 . This problem manifested itself in an unresponsive touch screen, or a flickering display, supposedly as a result of \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\"\nIn both cases, users who have already paid to replace their battery or paid full whack for a new screen can apply to Apple for a refund.\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK",

      "title": "myHome Plus review: HomeKit app offers few advantages for iOS 10 users",
      "text": "Learn more on iTunes Store \nmyHome Plus may have beat Apple’s Home app to the punch, but it’s not as intuitive or easy to use as the built-in iOS app. \nWhen Apple launched HomeKit with iOS 8, the home automation database was curiously missing one vital component: Namely a built-in app to control all of the supported accessories from one place. Two years later, that app has arrived and all is finally right with the world. Or is it? Home control \nmyHome Plus (free on the iTunes Store ) launched late last year as a universal third-party solution for setting up and controlling HomeKit-compatible accessories, no matter who manufactured those devices. After debuting as a paid app, the developers eventually offered it for free, with the option to purchase in-app upgrades to extend beyond the reach of HomeKit. \nLike the Home app, myHome Plus offers plenty of ways to configure all of the HomeKit devices in your household. \nIn the dark days before Apple’s Home app, controlling an entire home from a single app instead of hopping between solutions from individual manufacturers would have been hailed as a godsend, especially when myHome Plus supports remote access and Apple Watch control over favorites. \nNow that iOS 10 has arrived, it’s only fair to judge the two apps on equal footing. myHome Plus and Home each provide control over scenes, triggers, rooms, and zones, as well as support for multiple iCloud users. But Apple’s solution ultimately winds up being the more user-friendly of the two. \nWhile Home has the upper hand with the new dedicated Favorite Accessories screen in the iOS 10 Control Panel, myHome Plus compensates by offering a Today widget instead. Although it mostly recaps the current state of each device (users have full control over which data is displayed), where appropriate there are toggle switches and sliders for powering smart plugs on and off or dimming the lights. Beyond HomeKit \nmyHome Plus offers a straightforward enough user interface, but prior experience with HomeKit is a must. There’s nothing in the way of instructions, and even the Help menu points to an Apple support page. Once you’ve added devices, however, the app borders on information overload. This is most apparent when viewing characteristics for a particular device, which is mostly displayed as a string of nonsensical custom values. \nLove HomeKit but also own Nest or WeMo accessories? With myHome Plus, you can control them all from a single app. \nCompounding the problem is how devices are effectively multiplied. Each accessory has more than one listing, first for the main unit and battery level, then others for individual features as needed. The app also favors those living outside of the United States by displaying temperature readings in Euro-centric Celsius only, regardless of your preference settings. \nDespite these quibbles, myHome Plus does offer one compelling advantage over Home: The ability to also control non-HomeKit accessories manufactured by Nest and WeMo. These optional features must first be unlocked via in-app purchase, priced at $6 each or both for $8. \nHowever, the app doesn’t magically integrate a Nest Thermostat or one of the many budget-priced WeMo home automation devices into HomeKit. They’re still very much disparate and incompatible systems, but at least myHome Plus allows all three to coexist in a single place. Bottom line \nFor those with a house full of HomeKit-supported products, I’d recommend sticking with Apple’s built-in iOS 10 software over myHome Plus. The Home app is simply more attractive and easier to use. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed. At a Glance",

      "text": "\nIgor Bonifacic \nNovember 21, 2016 8:32am \nFollowing the arrival of its new, less expensive ‘Touch Disease’ repair program , Apple has just announced another new repair initiative. \nAccording to the company, “a very smaller number” of its iPhone 6s units are shutting down randomly due to faulty batteries. Specifically, the issue relates to iPhone 6s units manufactured between September and October 2015. The company notes that the batteries, while unreliable, do not pose a safety risk. \nIf the iPhone 6s you own was manufactured between those dates, all you need to do is head to your local Apple or Authorized service provider to get your phone’s serial number checked. Apple adds it will refund any customers who already paid for a battery replacement out of pocket.

      "text": "November 18, 2016 Apple silently uploads iPhone call logs to iCloud Drive The feature is available on all devices running on iOS 9.x and 10.x and there is no official way to disable it. \nResearcher at the Russia proactive software firm Elcomsoft found that iPhones silently upload call logs to iCloud. \nApple automatically uploads iPhone call logs to Apple's remote servers where the data may be stored on Apple servers for months with no option for the end user entirely disable the feature on their device, according to a Nov. 17 press release . \nThe feature is available on all devices running on iOS 9.x and 10.x and there is no official way to disable to feature other than to disable the iCloud Drive functionality. Elcomsoft researched that disabling the feature would greatly affect the usability of the device since Apple delivers a number of features via iCloud Drive. \nAn individual's communication history can reveal a lot about a user life including sexual preferences, medical issues, infidelities, illegal activities, business dealings, and more, Tripwire Cybersecurity Researcher Craig Young told SC Media. \n“Unlike the encryption employed on an iPhone's local memory storage, data stored within iCloud is encrypted in such a way that it can be retrieved with the assistance of Apple or through the use of an authentication token such as what might be stored on the device owner's computer,” Young said via emailed comments. “A compromise of Apple's servers could therefore expose the data from a large number of users thereby enabling social engineering attacks as well as extortion schemes.” \nHe went on to say Apple has stated that a third party would need to know a person's username and password to extract this information but this is not entirely correct for a variety of reasons. \n“Apple should have a granular set of options allowing users to have complete control over what data is sent off of their device,” he said. “While it is entirely likely that many consumers may prefer to have this data backed up, it is important that they are able to make an informed decision about how and where their data is stored.” \nYoung said users concerned that their information can be remotely accessed should strongly consider disabling the iCloud Drive feature.

      "text": "Email \nApple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. The Apple logo is displayed on the back of an iPhone on August 3, 2016 in London, England. (Credit: Carl Court/Getty Images) \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n“A very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. It didn’t provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple’s battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease”— when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease. 37.322998 -122.032182 ",

      "text": "55 shares \nJust as Google’s preparing to start shipping its Wi-Fi router , Apple has reportedly reassigned the engineers tasked with developing its AirPort wireless routers to other product teams, reveals Bloomberg . \nIt’s believed that the company has been slowly shutting down the division over the course of the past year to “sharpen [its] focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue.” \nWi-Fi routers — which fit into the “other products” category of Apple’s annual financial results — accounted for around 5 percent ($11.1 billion) of the firm’s total sales in fiscal 2016. \nApple’s hoping to use the extra manpower to develop more innovative next-generation products that make up the majority of its revenue, like the Apple TV , iPad and iPhone . \nIt’s currently unclear whether the Cupertino company is planning to stop manufacturing its AirPort routers, but for the time being, all three models are still available to purchase from both its online and brick-and-mortar stores. \nHowever, seeing as the AirPort range — the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule — hasn’t been refreshed since 2013, we expect it to be phased out pretty soon.",

Some eager iPhone fans arrived to queue at 4am on Thursday morning to be the first to purchase Apple's new products, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with iOS 8 featuring 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. (Photo by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images) Cole Bennetts Next \nApple will offer free battery replacements after reports of iPhone 6 devices unexpectedly shutting down. \nThe company reported a \"very small number\" of the phones might shut down unexpectedly. The company wrote in a news release that the issue is not a safety concern and impacts some devices built between September and October 2015. \nThose with the issue are asked to visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider with the device's serial number in order to get a free battery replacement. \nBefore getting the battery replaced, those with the issue are asked to back up the phone's data. For more details, click here . \nLast week, Apple offered to fix iPhone 6s Plus devices that were impacted by the \"touch disease,\" according to ZDNet.com . The issue impacts phones that have been dropped on hard surfaces and makes the screen unresponsive. \nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

The reassignment of employees signals that the company is making a quiet exit from the home router business — just as competitors like Google increase their focus on providing consumers with speedy, reliable Wi-Fi connectivity that blankets entire homes.\n\nApple’s router products were last updated in 2013 with support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi. But that was long before companies like Eero, Netgear, Google and others began manufacturing router systems that use a mesh network approach for better whole-home coverage.

      "text": "in Hong Kong by Staff Writer Drake lip syncs Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood in Apple Music ad \nApple has posted a new Apple Music commercial that continues its “distractingly good” campaign. This time the ad sees rapper Drake lip syncing Taylor Swift’s popular song Bad Blood in the gym, mimicking her ad from earlier this year. \nThe video opens with Drake in the gym room working out with a trainer, but when his trainer steps out for a moment, the rapper hits play on Swift’s Bad Blood and dances and lip syncs. \nSince he’s too busy belting out the catchy lyrics, the Canadian rapper drops the weight and falls off the bench. Then the spot shows “distractingly good” at the end. \nAn Apple Music commercial earlier this year showed Taylor Swift running on a treadmill and singing along to Drake’s song Jumpman . \nIn a similar vein, when Swift got so caught up in rapping along that she slipped and fell right off the treadmill.

      "text": "Apple May Stop Making Routers  17 PST \nApple has been in the router business for a very long time. The AirPort and Time Capsule products have been loved by millions of people across the globe but if a new report is to be believed, perhaps they should stop looking forward to new iterations of those products. According to the report, Apple is actually going to exit the router business rather quietly. \nBloomberg reports that Apple has disbanded the hardware team responsible for the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and Time Capsule products. The employees have reportedly been reassigned to other projects within the company, projects like the Apple TV. \nIf this is true, it suggests that Apple is quietly making an exit from the router market as competition steadily grows. Companies like Google have launched really robust products in this space like the OnHub . \nThere has already been a lot of speculation about the future of Apple’s router business considering the fact that this product lineup was last updated back in 2013. That was long before companies like Google, Netgear, and Eero shook up the home Wi-Fi scene . \nApple hasn’t officially confirmed anything as yet so nothing can be said for sure about the future of its router business. It’s still selling these products which cost between $99 and $399. It’s unclear right now if and when an official announcement will be made or if Apple will keep us guessing for the foreseeable future. \nFiled in Apple . Read more about airport . Related Articles",

      "text": "TWEET Apple — the eighth largest company in the world — is considering moving production of its flagship device back to the United States, according to a report from Nikkei Asian Review . According to Nikkei's unnamed sources, Apple has asked its two biggest assemblers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to look into moving the production of the 200 million iPhones they churn out each year to the U.S. Pegatron immediately declined, one source told Nikkei , citing costs. Foxconn, who generates half of its sales through Apple contracts, obliged but was still pessimistic about what that would mean for production costs. \"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,\" a source told Nikkei . Yet supporters of President-elect Donald Trump were quick to cite the rumors as an early victory, given his tough talk about bringing jobs back to America. Trump said at a January address before Liberty University students that Apple should \"build their damn computers and things in this country.\" \nThey say that even Apple is talking about bringing iPhone manufacturing back to the US! The Force of Trump is strong! &lt;&lt;lightsaber sound&gt;&gt; \nTrump has done more for America in the space of ten days than Obama did in 8 years! President Trump will #MAGA! https://t.co/b7R0JX4ygN One big problem is that higher costs could cause a big price hike on an already-expensive product. The latest iPhone model retails for $649 , and even CEO Tim Cook has suggested the phones might be too pricey right now for the company to break into certain consumer markets, like India. Higher production costs would not just be because labor is cheaper in China than in the U.S. \"In no other country can you scale up so quickly,\" said John Dulchinos, vice president of electronics supplier Jabil, to the Wall Street Journal . \"You have the ability to move quickly and there's a really strong electronics supply chain in Asia centered around China.\" In other words, moving production back to the U.S. creates costly complications: The memory chips in Apple devices are made in South Korea, the displays are made in Japan, and the devices are assembled in China by companies based in Taiwa n. That's why simply slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports isn't a magic wand that will suddenly make American manufacturing more competitive again. A scary consequence, in fact, could be a trade war — which China has already intimated is a possibility: An editorial from the state-backed Chinese newspaper, the Global Times , lays out the ways in which China might retaliate against tariffs. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback,\" the newspaper wrote. \"US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\" Despite these issues, Trump supporters have taken recent headlines as a sign that Trump is already saving American jobs. \nTRUMP EFFECT: Ford says plant will not move to Mexico, will remain in Kentucky. Apple plans to manufacture more in USA too. #TrumpAlwaysWins Not only is celebration about Apple premature, but the belief that Trump is keeping car manufacturing jobs in the U.S. is also based on misinformation: On Thursday night, Trump bragged about convincing Ford to keep an auto manufacturing plant in Kentucky — but that factory reportedly had no intention of leaving in the first place. Representatives from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET Apple has finally recognized a well-documented issue with the iPhone 6 Plus — sort of. The company acknowledged the presence of \"Multi-Touch issues,\" perhaps better known as \" touch disease ,\" and wants to help iPhone owners fix it — for the price of $149. \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" Apple said on a post on the company's support page. Most consumers are more interested in linking \"touch disease\" to the infamous Bendgate , which plagued both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners shortly after its launch. BGR reported that several independent technicians associated the defects with a controller chip design flaw in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple isn't prepared to acknowledge that, though — there's no mention of any liability on the Apple's behalf, and the company won't even make this deal for standard iPhone 6s. \"The repair program covers affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for five years after the first retail sale of the unit,\" Apple's statement continues. That should grant most 6 Plus owners with three or so years of warranty. Apple added that buyers who already repaired iPhone 6 Plus' suffering from \"touch disease\" symptoms qualify for reimbursement. \"The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price.\" Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "– A + Apple's 2018 iPhone could use TSMC-made 7nm processors - report By Roger Fingas \nMonday, November 21, 2016, 07:06 am PT (10:06 am ET) \nApple chip supplier TSMC could make use of its new 7-nanometer manufacturing technique for the processors in 2018 iPhones, a new Chinese-language report suggests.\n\n\n\n\nAfter trial efforts are completed, TSMC should be ready to begin 7-nanometer manufacturing in earnest sometime between Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 , MyDrivers claimed, citing supply chain sources. That would give Apple enough time to implement the technology into 2018 iPhones, and indeed TSMC will allegedly be Apple's exclusive supplier of 7-nanometer chips.\n\nThe report suggested that Apple could make use of the process for the \"A11\" chip in 2017 iPhones, but that would be unlikely. For years Apple has preferred to ship new iPhones in September —the end of Q3 —and the company would need full-scale manufacturing to meet global demand.\n\nInstead the \"A11\" will likely make use of TSMC's 10-nanometer process, which should enter use in the first quarter of 2017. The A10 chip in the iPhone 7 is a 16-nanometer component.\n\nShrinking die size should allow Apple to cram faster processor technology into a smaller space, while simultaneously making iPhones more power-efficient, or at least keeping consumption under control.",

      "text": "TWEET If design, price and die-hard brand loyalty aren't variables in picking a smartphone, then chances are function is the determining factor. In the battle of iPhone vs. Android operating systems, arguments can be made in favor of both. Consumers who want simplicity and a steady experience will likely value Apple 's iOS , while those who want more customization will likely lean toward Android. The latest operating system for the iPhone is iOS 10, which is compatible on Apple phones and tablets, and the most recent OS version for Android is the Android Nougat. For those considering a device with an Android OS, here are six things an Android operating system can do that iPhone's OS cannot. Multi-window view The new OS for Android features multi-window support, which allows the user to simultaneously run two apps side-by-side. This feature has previously been available on Samsung and LG handsets, but it's now available on all Android devices with the recent update. \"Now you can switch between apps with a double tap, and run two apps side- by-side,\" the Android Nougat website reads. \"So go ahead and watch a movie while texting, or read a recipe with your timer open.\" Apple does offer multi-window support for its tablet users, but the feature is not currently available for iPhone users. VR support Android Nougat offers a virtual reality mode that can be used on devices compatible with Daydream , Google's virtual reality headset. Daydream?ready phones include Google's Pixel and Pixel XL, but are slated to expand to other devices. Android Nougat offers VR support. Source: Eric Risberg/AP Launchers Android's user interface is called Launcher — also called a skin — and it allows the user to customize their experience. The skins vary in themes and gives the phone a unique, custom feel with different icons, tools and enhanced functions. For those who like the sleek and simple feel of the iOS interface, Google's new Pixel Launcher offers the same vibe, though it's only compatible with a Google phone. Personal Assistant Apple has Siri and Android has Google Now . Android users who allow their device to gather data can reap some conveniences from their digital personal assistant like receiving directions to a recently searched destination. The Android 7.0 Nougat update for Pixel Phones features Google Assistant , which is more conversational, can entertain the user and make reservations. Those operating on Android 6.0 Marshmallow also have some perks like the Now on Tap feature, which provides information on what's on your screen, whether it be to get a movie review or details about a song. App storage On iPhones, apps are placed on the home screen of the device and can be organized into folders, while Android users have an \" app drawer \" to store apps and widgets. App shortcuts can be placed on the home screens. Users have the option to have a clean home screen with convenient functionality if that's what they want. Wi-Fi information Android devices show the user what Wi-Fi network they're connected to up front — it is written out in small type just below the Wi-Fi icon. Apple owners have to go into settings to see what network they are using. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET A new study from mobile technology service provider Blancco Technology Group has found something that Apple fans will not be pleased to hear: Android devices are more reliable and have less performance \"failure\" than iPhones. According to the study, in the third quarter of 2016, 47% of Android devices suffered from performance failure while 62% of iPhones had similar issues. Problems with the iPhone increased by 4% from quarter two of 2016, which had a failure rate of 58%. The report reads: According to our data, apps crashed on 65% of the iOS devices tested in Q3 2016. This is nearly triple the rate of crashing apps on Android devices — 25% — in the same period. It's also a considerable increase from the rate of crashing apps on iOS devices in the previous quarter (50%). In contrast, the rate of apps crashing on Android devices didn't increase as significantly as it did on iOS devices. Failure is a strong and subjective word, but it rounds up an array of phone-related issues like crashing apps, overheating devices and difficulties connecting. For iPhones, the largest issue was overheating devices followed by crashing apps (15%) and headphone problems (11%). Some iPhones fared better than others. The biggest offender was the iPhone 6, which featured a failure rate of 13%. The iPhone 5S and iPhone 6S, in comparison, had a failure rate of 9%. BTG cites much of the failures to be \"driven by bugs in the iOS 10 update.\" IOS models with the most failure in Q3 of 2016 Source: Mic Among Android devices, Samsung was the manufacturer with the highest device failure rate at 11% and problems that impacted Android devices worldwide varied, from USB problems (15%) to battery charging (7%) — Pokémon Go was cited as a reason for the latter. Android manufacturers with the most failure in Q3 of 2016 Source: Mic \" Battery chargi ng ranked in the list of the top five performance issues plaguing Android devices in the third quarter,\" Richard Stiennon, chief strategy officer at BTG, told the Independent . \"Since users must keep their device screen and GPS on in order to play the virtual reality game, both of these functions are known to drain the device's battery charge.\" Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET An Apple patent published on Thursday hints at a future nobody asked for: more Siri! The patent illustrates texting conversations in which Siri would slide in when it may be of assistance. It would help with tasks like scheduling a get-together, figuring out everyone's ETA to a destination and making payments. Siri scheduling a meeting Source: United States Patent and Trademark Office \"While current systems enable users to communicate and perform tasks, users are required to manually perform the tasks,\" the patent states . It also includes examples of tasks Siri would do for you, like \"scheduling a meeting, performing a financial transaction, determining an estimated time of arrival, providing directions, providing weather information, alerting a user of relevant information, etc.\" If you think that might require sacrificing your privacy , you would be correct. In order for Siri to accomplish any of the aforementioned tasks, you would need to grant the virtual assistant access to some of your personal data, including your location, your calendar details and your financial apps. Siri checking on arrival time at the destination Source: United States Patent and Trademark Office The feature itself isn't groundbreaking — a slew of bots have been designed to help accomplish tasks like these in a casual messaging format. But this feature would end the need for an iPhone user to use outside bots and instead opt-in to an interjecting Siri. The good news for people who think Siri constantly chiming in sounds obnoxious as hell: A published patent is not a very good indicator of whether a feature or product will come to market. But it does prove Apple is brainstorming ways for Siri to be more involved in your life. It's like Her , only if Joaquin Phoenix hated \"her.\" Like us on Facebook: ",

The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is \"not a safety issue.\" Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple's battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said.",

      "text": "  @09:00AM from the killing-things dept. Apple has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers in a move that further sharpens the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, Bloomberg reports. From the article: Apple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV. Apple hasn't refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn't currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. Routers are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. Apple currently sells three wireless routers, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule. The Time capsule doubles as a backup storage hard drive for Mac computers.",

      "text": "Apple will fix any iPhone 6s smartphone suffering from what the company says is an uncommon battery problem.\nThe tech giant AAPL will replace the battery on any iPhone 6s that shuts down unexpectedly, the company confirmed in a Support post on its website on Sunday. The replacement will be free, but limited to iPhone 6s units purchased between September and October 2015 that fall within a certain, but unidentified, serial number range.\nThe announcement comes just days after iPhone 6s owners in China were complaining that their devices were shutting down when they still had battery life left. Soon after, the Chinese consumer-protection agency, China Consumers Association, came to their defense and called on Apple to immediately address the problem.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the agency said in an open letter on Tuesday.\nSoon after, Apple responded, saying that it had found the problem. Apple said last week that it was only affecting a small number of devices and wouldn’t cause a safety problem for users. Apple’s announcement over the weekend was confirmation that the company would address the problem.\nOn its support page, Apple says it will replace batteries at one of its retail stores or via an Authorized Service Provider. Wireless carriers will not participate in the replacement program. Apple also cautioned users to get their iPhones fixed before they tried to have their batteries replaced.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple says.",

      "text": "Just because you can play Doom on the MacBook Pro Touch Bar doesn’t mean you should Posted Apple’s holiday ad is all about inclusion \nDoes it run Doom has long been the gold standard of getting stuff to play on other stuff that it probably shouldn’t be played on. The answer is almost invariably “yes.” The longer answer is usually more along the lines “yes, but why would you want to?” \nThat certainly applies here. Sure you could play the classic first-person-shooter on that lovely 2560 x 1600/ 2880 x 1800 display, but where’s the fun in that, when there’s another Retina Display going unused? The Touch Bar has a decidedly lopsided 2170 x 60 resolution, making it the perfect candidate for the latest unofficial port. Side note, as ridiculous (ly amazing) as Doom is running on the Touch Bar is… the HUD is equally great pic.twitter.com/RFwq7nJ7ae \n— Adam Bell (@b3ll) November 20, 2016 \nFacebook engineer Adam Bell took up the challenge , and the results are about as distorted as one would expect – but it’s doable, and that’s the important thing that end of the day. Bell also used the Touch Bar for the game’s HUD, which makes for a much more aesthetically (if impractical) use of the skinny strip of real estate between the display and keyboard. \nApple’s likely not in love with such unauthorized uses of its shiny new technology, but I suspect we’re likely to some of the most innovative Touch Bar uses arriving from outside the company’s official vetting process.

      "text": "2018 iPhone Rumored To Use TSMC’s 7nm Processors  48 PST \nThe rumor mill already expects Apple to introduce some major changes with the iPhone next year but that doesn’t mean there won’t be speculation about the iPhone that’s due after that. Word on the street is that it’s possible that the 2018 iPhone will use 7nm processors manufactured by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It’s claimed that TSMC is going to be the exclusive supplier of mobile chips for Apple’s 2018 iPhone. \nThere’s a reason why Apple is expected to go all out with the iPhone next year. That’s because it’s going to be the 10th anniversary of a smartphone that has literally transformed the destiny of this company. Apple is thus expected to pull out all the stops and give us a truly revolutionary smartphone next year. \nYou might find yourself wondering what happens after this supposedly great iPhone is launched next year? Well, the company simply goes back to the drawing board to cook up a new smartphone for 2018. If history is any indication, it may only be an evolutionary update with upgraded internals and some new features. \nAccording to a report, TSMC is going to start manufacturing chips on its 7-nanometer process by Q1 2017 or by Q1 2018. This will leave Apple with ample time to implement the 7nm processor in the 2018 iPhone which may not arrive until the fall that year. \nA 7nm processor will be shorter in size but it’s certainly going to provide improved performance and power efficiency. Nevertheless, it’s too soon to be concerning ourselves with the 2018 iPhone when we clearly have the iPhone 8 to look forward to next year. \n  TSMC . Source: news.mydrivers Related Articles",

( AAPL ) has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe report indicated that Apple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV. \nThe report said that Apple hasn't refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn't currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. \n  CLOSE X Edit Favorites \nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

      "text": "Further Reading Apple brings 802.11ac Wi-Fi to AirPort networking hardware Last month, Apple told reporters that it was formally exiting the standalone display business and ceding it to partners like LG. According to a new report from Bloomberg , it may soon be doing the same thing with its AirPort router business. Apple is still selling the routers for now, but it has apparently broken up its router development team and reassigned the engineers to other projects like the Apple TV\nThough this could spell an official end for Apple's routers, unofficially there hasn't been much of a reason to buy any of them in the last couple of years. The $199 AirPort Extreme was one of the earlier full-featured 1.3Gbps 802.11ac routers, but it (and the $299 hard drive-equipped Time Capsule with the same design) hasn't been updated or seen a price cut since its 2013 release. More tellingly, the $99 AirPort Express trudges on with ancient 300Mbps 802.11n Wi-Fi and 100Mbps wired Ethernet—it hasn't been updated since 2012.\nApple's routers have never been cutting-edge; they've always cost a lot compared to routers from other companies, and they lack advanced configuration options, but like many of Apple's peripherals they were designed to work better with Macs and iDevices than third-party products. They also made it relatively easy to set up wireless repeaters to expand a network to cover larger houses, but in the years since the AirPorts were last updated, companies like Ubiquiti and Eero have rushed to fill that niche.",

      "text": "Batteries 11 mins ago \nIf you’ve noticed that your iPhone 6S shuts down well before the battery runs out, you might be in luck. Apple announced late on Nov. 20 that it would be offering replacement batteries for certain phones. \nThe company said in a release that there’s an issue with “a very small number” of 6S models, which causes some phones to switch off before they’re out of power. Apple noted that the bug is not a safety issue. \nIf you have an iPhone 6S built between September and October 2015, head to an Apple Store or an authorized Apple service store to see if your phone is eligible for a free battery replacement. Even if you already paid to have the battery replaced yourself, you may still be entitled to a refund. \nApple seems to have waited a healthy amount of time after the September release of its latest smartphone, the iPhone 7 , to announce the replacement program. So if you upgraded because your old iPhone’s battery life was causing you grief, this might not be the most welcome news. Read full story",

      "text": "Apple is doing a little bit of winter cleaning.\nThe iPhone and Mac maker has reportedly shut down its wireless router team, which builds its AirPort wireless routers, and shifted them over to work on other products such as the Apple TV , according to Bloomberg .\nSEE ALSO: Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is simply superb\nApple currently sells three AirPort models: AirPort Express ($99), AirPort Extreme ($199) and AirPort Time Capsule ($299 with 2TB of storage, $399 with 3TB).\nWith the division disbanded, it seems unlikely Apple will release another AirPort again. The closure of the wireless router division follows Apple's exit from selling its own external monitors (Apple promoted an LG 5K display on stage during its new MacBook Pro announcement last month instead).\nDependence on Wi-Fi chipmaker advancements is cited as one possible reason why Apple is reportedly getting out of the router business. However, ending development of routers could \"make Apple's product ecosystem less sticky.\"\nApple introduced the AirPort in 1999 as a means to help popularize Wi-Fi and transform the Mac into the center of its media hub strategy.\nToday, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous and most people have it set up with their internet installation (either renting equipment or buying their own cheaper alternatives). Moreover, speedy LTE connections are also readily available.\nMost consumers have no reason to buy an Apple-branded wireless router anymore.\nSimply put: Most consumers have no reason to buy an Apple-branded wireless router anymore. It's no surprise wireless routers are lumped into Apple's \"other\" product category (Apple TV, iPod and Apple Watch, accessories, etc.), which makes up only about 5 percent of the the company's total annual sales.\nDon't have Wi-Fi? That's no a problem anymore, either. Whether it's Starbucks, McDonald's or public parks, there are tons of ways to get online wirelessly now.\nWhat's most interesting, however, is folding some of those engineers to work on the Apple TV. Will we see a beefed-up version with more powerful wireless specs? Or, perhaps, maybe the Siri-powered Amazon Echo \"killer\" that has been rumored for some time? It's certainly a possibility given how much Apple has been positioning the Apple TV as a home hub.\nDon't think of Apple disbanding the AirPort team as a bad thing, but more of a refocusing. In the '80s and into the '90s before Steve Jobs returned, the company produced a long list of its own inkjet and laser printers . After Jobs returned and cleaned house, dumping printers and all the other stuff the company wasn't very good at making, Apple was able to refocus on its core products, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nBONUS: The 3 best things about the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar",

      "text": "Twelve South Debuts 'HiRise Duet' Charging Stand for iPhone and Apple Watch   8:00   Twelve South today introduced a new product in its HiRise line, called the HiRise Duet , which provides charging stations for an iPhone or iPad, as well as an Apple Watch. The stand supports the Apple Watch's Night Stand Mode, which displays an alarm clock and turns the device's Digital Crown into a snooze button. The stand has a 3.75â square footprint and includes an integrated Lightning charger for iPhone and iPad, as well as a Magnetic Charging Disc for the Apple Watch, all of which are powered by a single AC cable. The bottom of the stand is lined with a layer of leather to protect the Apple Watch from scuffs. Unlike plastic stands that get dragged across the nightstand from the weight of the power cord, the all metal HiRise Duet stays put. This mighty one pound, dual charging stand weighs as much as three iPhone 7 's. So when you reach for your iPhone in the middle of the night, or go for the snooze button in the morning, both devices will be right where you put them - atop HiRise Duet. Youâll also notice the curves on HiRise Duet mirror the beautiful design of iPhone and Watch. The HiRise Duet is available from Twelve South for $119.99. The stand supports the iPad mini, 9.7-inch iPad Pro , and any recent Lightning-enabled iPhone generation.",

According to a new report from Bloomberg , the engineers in the wireless router team has been dispersed to other departments including Apple TV. \nWhile, Apple currently sells three wireless routers — the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule at $99 (approx Rs. 6,745), $199 (approx Rs. 13,558) and $299 (approx. Rs. 20,400) respectively, none of the device have seen a refresh since 2013. \nWireless router comes under Apple’s “other category” along with Apple Watch and Apple TV that accounts for about 5 percent of total sales. For its routers, the company focused more integrating control of its devices into its computer operating system and industrial design. \nGoogle recently introduced its first WiFi home router for $129. It is a bit sad that Apple isn’t ready to try something new with its WiFi routers. Back in June Apple officially discontinued Thunderbolt Display that it had been selling since 2011.",

      "text": "by Paul Lilly   Apple Offers Free iPhone 6s Battery Replacements To Tackle Unintended Shutdowns Apple has begun providing free battery replacements to iPhone 6s owners who have been bitten by a battery bug that causes affected handsets to shut down prematurely. According to Apple, only a \"very small number\" of devices are affected by the issue, all of which fall within a limited serial number range and were manufactured between September and October 2015.\"If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge.,\" Apple states on its website.Apple says there is no safety issue associated with the battery quirk, an important disclaimer in light of Samsung's recent woes , in which he issue a total recall of all Galaxy Note 7 devices due to defective handsets overheating and catching on fire. iPhone 6s owners with a potentially affected model do not have to worry about that sort of thing, though obviously it's annoyance to have a smartphone shut down unexpectedly.The battery replacement program comes after complaints made by the China Consumers Association over the issue. Some have reported to the consumer protection group that their iPhone 6s model would shut down when still showing around 50 percent battery life. Others claimed the issue manifested on their iPhone 6 handsets, though Apple's battery replacement program is only for the iPhone 6s.Note that wireless carriers are not participating in this program, only Apple is. Also note that if there is physical damage that impairs the replacement of a battery, such as a cracked display, that will have to be fixed prior to Apple swapping out the battery.",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Andrew Cunningham)\nApple told reporters last month that it was formally exiting the standalone display business and ceding it to partners like LG. According to a new report from Bloomberg , it may soon be doing the same thing with its AirPort router business.\nApple is still selling the routers for now, but it has apparently broken up its router development team and reassigned the engineers to other projects like the Apple TV.\nThough this could spell an official end for Apple's routers, unofficially there hasn't been much of a reason to buy any of them in the last couple of years. The $199 (£159) AirPort Extreme was one of the earlier full-featured 1.3Gbps 802.11ac routers, but it—and the $299 (£239) hard drive-equipped Time Capsule with the same design—hasn't been updated or seen a price cut since its 2013 release.\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "BI Intelligence \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.\nThe iPhone 7 is drawing fewer Android users than the previous iPhone, the 6s, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP).\nOnly 17% of consumers who have bought an iPhone 7 since it launched last September were previously Android users, CIRP said. That’s down from the 26% of consumers who purchased an iPhone 6s who had previously been Android users. The majority of new iPhone purchases are still coming from Apple’s existing customer base. Apple has repeatedly said that convincing Android users to switch is a key part of its growth strategy. Android has a much greater user base than Apple: Android controls close to 80% of the smartphone market.\nHowever, CIRP’s research clearly indicates that the new iPhone 7 isn’t drawing many Android users to switch. This is partially because of the model’s cost. New iPhone models are consistently around $700, and can be more expensive in some markets because of import tariffs.\nThe vast majority of Android phones cost less than a third of that, as Android has become the operating system of choice for cheaper smartphone models that are popular in the world’s developing regions. Manufacturers of these cheaper Android models are competing mostly on cost, driving down their prices. So the price gap between new iPhones and Android phones will continue to widen, making it harder for Apple to attract more Android users in many markets.\nThe iPhone is also set to face tougher competition from Android devices among high-cost smartphones thanks to Google’s new Pixel phone, which has received favorable reviews. This will put increased pressure on Apple to make a splash with the new iPhone models it releases next year. Reports indicate that Apple may release as many as three new iPhone models in 2017 to help attract a broader array of new users, including a new premium all-glass model with an OLED touchscreen.\nThe global smartphone market is expected to slow considerably over the next few years. Despite a record-setting holiday quarter, 2015 was likely the last year of double-digit growth for smartphone shipments.\nMature markets were at the heart of this year’s deceleration. Adoption has reached new highs in key markets in the United States, Europe, and China. The pool of first-time buyers in these countries is shrinking rapidly, and sales are now primarily coming from phone upgrades.\nMeanwhile, emerging markets will continue to see robust shipment growth. India and Indonesia, in particular, will help fuel a large share of the shipments growth within the global smartphone market over the next few years.\nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on smartphones by country that forecasts the market through 2021 to reflect slower, stabilizing growth in the long term.\nHere are some key points from the report: \nThe global smartphone market is still growing at a steady pace due to more widespread adoption in emerging markets. We estimate the global market will hit about 2.1 billion units shipped in 2021. Shipments growth over the past few years has been driven by the falling price of smartphones, which has made handsets more accessible in emerging markets. The average selling price of a smartphone in India nearly halved between 2010 and 2015. With relatively low smartphone penetration, we forecast Indian smartphone shipments to grow rapidly over the next five years. Nevertheless, India has a long way to go before it surpasses China as the world’s leading market for smart handsets. India is estimated to account for roughly 10% of the global smartphone market in 2016, considerably less than China’s 30% share. The global platform wars are over, even as smartphone adoption continues to rise across various markets worldwide. Android and iOS are estimated to account for 97.3% of global platform market share in 2015, compared to 96.3% last year. Apple closed the year with another strong quarter on the back of its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus launches. Still, the vendor saw a slight decline in YoY growth of its share of the market in the face of stiff competition from Samsung and Chinese vendors such as Huawei.

The program is limited to certain devices manufactured from September to October 2015, and phones are subject to an inspection prior to the repair to make sure the serial number is within the correct range. Customers can contact Apple technical support, an Apple retail store or an authorized Apple service provider to find out of their phone is eligible for the repair. Owners of an iPhone 6s who have paid to replace their battery to remedy the shut down problem are also urged to contact Apple about a possible refund. Before customers take their phone in for service, Apple recommends backing up all personal data.",

Swift face-planted while listening to Jumpman by Drake and Future? \nThe Canadian rapper has returned the favor while listening to Bad Blood in his ad for the streaming music service, which debuted during Sunday's American Music Awards . \nWith lip syncing that could win any Battle and dance moves that are totally GIF-worthy, Drake shows “no mercy” during his workout. \nNaturally, the artist with parody Twitter accounts dedicated to his softer side starts belting out the lyrics when we're reminded how “sad” it is “to think about the good times.” \nWhether Swift wanted to get us thinking about if they’re really a couple or not , she shared the ad and her enthusiasm for the promo on Instagram , writing “YES” and using the thumbs up and muscle emojis. \nWhich should make this struggle easier to deal with, right, Drake?

      "text": "Apple is ending its long running line of Wi-Fi routers after disbanding the team responsible for the wireless devices over the past year, according to a new report.\nEngineers who worked on Apple’s line of Airport routers, first introduced by Steve Jobs in 1999, have been reassigned to other units, Bloomberg reported on Monday citing anonymous sources. The company had not released an updated router in three years.\nFortune reached out to Apple aapl for comment and will update this story if a response is received.\nApple appears to be honing it hardware efforts somewhat to focus on its core product--such as the iMac desktop, MacBook laptops, and the iPhone--plus more promising sidelines, such as the Apple TV and Beats headphones. After unveiling new MacBook Pro laptops last month, Apple said it would cease development of its own line of monitors.\nApple’s Airport line, still listed for sale in its online store, runs from $99 for a basic Wi-Fi router to $400 for a router that included a large hard drive for storage. The products run the fastest currently adopted Wi-Fi standard known as 802.11ac.\nBut the industry is on the verge of moving to an even faster standard known as WiGig, or 802.11ad, which would allow for wireless video streaming at 4K ultra-high definition resolution and quicker gaming connections between devices.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nJobs introduced Apple’s first wireless router alongside a new candy-colored line of iBook laptops at a time when Wi-Fi technology was almost brand new and not commonly found in homes. Based on the 802.11b standard, the router worked at a maximum speed of 11 megabits per second.\nA few competitors that make wireless routers have already introduced devices that include early version of the WiGig standard, which can operate at up to seven gigabits per second,. Netgear’s ntgr $500 Nighthawk X10 router, for example, includes both the older 802.11ac standard and the 802.11ad standard.",

      "text": "CUPPERTINO, Calif., Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Apple is offering free battery replacements for the iPhone 6S after determining some phones may unexpectedly shut down.\n\"A very small number\" of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected,\" Apple said in a statement Monday. \nThe company didn't give details on problems with the batteries.\nApple said the battery problem is \"not a safety issue\" -- unlike in the case of its rival, Samsung, that pulled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after reports of the phones bursting into flames.\nUsers with iPhone 6S problems are asked to go to an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. The device's serial number will be checked to confirm eligibility for a free battery replacement. Apple will also offer refunds if users had previously paid to replace the battery.\nIf your iPhone 6s has any damage, including a cracked screen, that issue will need to be resolved before the battery replacement, the company said.\nWireless carrier partners are not participating in this program. The standard Apple warranty is 90 days.\nLast week, a consumer watch group in China reported the problem.\nThe China Consumers Association said \"a considerable number\" of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off even though they had plenty of battery life, and even when plugged into a charger, would not turn back on.\nLast year, a software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left. An operating system update fixed the problem.\nAnd last week, Apple acknowledged that iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from \"touch disease.\" The phone's touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. The cost for the repair is $149.\n  Samsung to acquire Harman, leader in auto technology Student develops smartphone app for early autism detection Light from smartphones may hinder a good night's sleep, study says",

      "text": "on Monday November 21, 2016 @11:00AM from the fixing-errors dept. Apple is offering to replace the batteries of a \"small number\" of iPhone 6S phones with a fault that makes them unexpectedly shut down. The phones with this fault were manufactured between September and October 2015, it said in a statement. From a report on BBC: Affected devices will suddenly stop working even though the handset's battery has plenty of charge. Anyone with an eligible phone who takes up the offer will get a free replacement battery for their handset. In its announcement, Apple urged customers who believe they have a faulty phone to contact an Apple store, an authorised repair shop or the firm's support line to start the process of getting a new battery. A \"limited serial number range\" was affected, it said.",

      "title": "Apple Reportedly Guts Router Division, AirPort Express And AirPort Time Capsule Face Death Row",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Monday, November 21, 2016 Apple Reportedly Guts Router Division, AirPort Extreme And AirPort Time Capsule Face Death Row If you’re an Apple enthusiast that fills your home in gear from the company, including its wireless routers, we have some bad news to bring you. According to a credible report from notorious insider Mark Gurman, Apple has demolished its wireless router division.\nThe deconstruction process has taken place of the past year, with engineers that previously worked on products like the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule being shuttled around to other divisions within the company. While Apple’s wireless routers integrate nicely with iPhone s, iPad s, and Mac s, they don’t have broad appeal in a segment of the tech market that is often faced with tight margins. AirPort Extreme (L) and AirPort Express (R) \nAlso working against Apple is the fact that competitors like D-Link and Netgear are considerably raising the bar with new and innovative products at a rapid pace. Netgear’s new Nighthawk X10 wireless router supports 802.11ad, includes a built-in Plex Media Server and a burly 1.7GHz quad-core processor. Even Google is looking to shake things up in the market with the Google WiFi router , which uses mesh technology to add coverage to every nook and cranny of your house. \nBut there are also two other things that have worked against Apple’s wireless router products — both of which are self-inflicted. First of all, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule (basically an AirPort Extreme with an internal hard drive for Time Machine backups) haven’t been updated in over three years. In addition, pricing (ranging from $99 for the Airport Express to $399 for the Airport Time Capsule 3TB) has put the products well out of contention in competing with the top wireless routers on the market from a performance/value perspective. \n“Exiting the router business could make Apple’s product ecosystem less sticky,” writes Gurman. “Some features of the AirPort routers, including wireless music playback, require an Apple device like an iPhone or Mac computer. If the company no longer sells wireless routers, some may have a reason to use other phones and PCs.” \nFor those that are fans of the AirPort series of products, this is likely sad news. However, rest assured that you’ll likely be able to find a much better router for less money from the competition.",

YouTube \nApple has just released its 2016 Christmas ad, and it features Frankenstein's monster. \nIt's an unusual — but arguably heart-warming — ad. The monster, played by Brad Garrett, decides to leave his solitary life behind. \n\" An unexpected holiday visitor finally receives the warm welcome he’s always yearned for,\" the ad's description on YouTube says. \nAfter making a long journey through snow covered mountains, the monster makes a rather odd attempt to befriend a crowd of onlookers in a remote town: By screwing two light bulbs to his neck and singing along to a backing track played on his iPhone. \nAfter failing to amuse the crowd, one young girl gives him a hand — and everyone eventually joins in. \nvia GIPHY \nThe ad is called \"Frankie's Holiday,\" and has the strapline \"Open Your Heart to Everyone.\" \n\"It's a if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it type of thing. We do look at this time of year as a time to put out a message larger than product.\" Apple's Vice President of Marketing Tor Myhren told Co.

      "text": "It's too early to determine if the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro is a gimmick or truly innovative. But there's one thing we do know: It can run the original friggin' Doom.\nThat's right, developer Adam Bell crammed the 1993 classic in all of its glory to run on the the narrow 2,160 x 60 pixel OLED touchscreen. Is it pretty? Hell no. Is it pointless? Absolutely — just look at how smushed the graphics are! But is it stupid awesome? You bet it is.\nIf the entire game running on the Touch Bar is too ugly for you, Bell's also made it so the Touch Bar acts as the game's HUD , which is, admittedly, a little more useful. But looking at the Touch Bar means you're taking your eyes off the screen. Ugh.\nThe 'Doctor Who' Christmas special looks gloriously ridiculous\nDisney's 'Avatar' theme park robots are as amazing as the film characters\n'Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen' guy teams up with Elmo and Cookie Monster\nCrocodile casually makes off with another dead croc for dinner",

      "text": "Apple Enlists Frankenstein in This Strange, Sweet Appeal for Acceptance This Holiday Not just about friends and family By Tim Nudd November 21, 2016, 11:29 AM EST A lot of Christmas ads suggest that spending time with friends and family should be the ultimate goal of the holidays. But what about those people who don't have much of either? Apple just released its 2016 holiday commercial, and it's devoted to reminding people that friends and family aren't the only people who might need comforting at this time of year—and in this particular year, too. Directed by Park Pictures' Lance Acord (who also directed Apple's Emmy-winning 2013 holiday ad, \"Misunderstood\"), it's a remarkable piece of work and a study in contrasts—dark and light, sad and happy, lonely and full of love. It features Frankenstein (or more accurately, Frankenstein's monster, aka \"Frankie,\" played by Brad Garrett), who appears to have retired to a mountain cabin on the edge of a village—the ultimate outsider. His possessions are meager, though they appear to include an iPhone 7 (even monsters from early 19th century novels are in Apple's target demo) and a music box, which he is trying to sync up to deliver a present to the village. See how the story unfolds here: The neck bolts as sockets for Christmas lights are just one of the strangely magical elements here. In fact, the whole setup is discordant—this isn't even Frankenstein's holiday—but that actually helps to build the sense of \"otherness\" that the spot is trying, at the end, to dispel. It's beautifully shot, and the details are great—like the framed photo of Mary Shelley in Frankie's home. And the end line, \"Open your heart to everyone,\" will be read far and wide as a plea for acceptance in a political climate where the core of that message is in dispute. It's not as explicitly political a message as Amazon's spot from last week, with the priest and imam visiting each other. And the fact that Frankie is literally a monster might complicate the metaphor for some viewers, who may not be ready to accept, even in spirit, certain unnamed people it considers monsters. Still, the ad is obviously not about any one person, and the notion of acceptance of those who are foreign to us is clearly evocative in these days after the election. Also, the otherworldliness of the execution is lovely, and perfectly in keeping with the mysteries of the holiday season—in all, one of the most fascinating holiday spots of the year.

      "text": "| Follow About | \nAppleholic, (noun), æp·əl-hɑl·ɪk: An imaginative person who thinks about what Apple is doing, why and where it is going. Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Apple says Wi-Fi isn’t interesting anymore Is AirPort being rebranded for the new Apple Home product range? Computerworld | Nov 21, 2016 8:27   \nOne day, Apple retail employees won't be able to help you with a new AirPort router \nIf you’ve been waiting for a replacement 802.11ac AirPort Express or hoped for some improvements in Time Machine, then stop hoping on strength of claims Apple has ceased development of its AirPort range of products. What is being claimed? \nBloomberg claims just that former AirPort engineers are now working on other teams “including Apple TV development”. The news comes months after Apple pulled its AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule products from its stores. The removal of the latter product underlines quite how much Apple wants to get you hooked on iCloud for all of your back up needs, as long as you have the fare. End of an era \nAs has been remarked by everyone, AirPort has always been an iconic product for Apple. That’s not because Apple invented Wi-Fi, but because it helped build one of the best standards the company ever managed to evangelize. I can still recall the sense of wonder I felt when I saw Steve Jobs pass a tangerine iBook through a hula-hoop to demonstrate what this amazing wireless Internet technology could do. AirPort became a defining competitive feature for the company. Apple stole a march on rivals with the launch of the AirPort router and while it remains one of the best designed such products on the market, there are many competing products that cost less. Strike three \nThe news follows Apple’s recent decision to quit its monitor business, ceding the Mac focused display industry to LG, which now offers jointly developed 4K and 5K displays for the new MacBook. It also follows the recent special Mac launch event, at which many Mac users complained at the lack of focus on desktop Macs. While hope remains the company will introduce desktop improvements in 2017, the direction of travel is becoming increasingly focused on the appliances vision that has haunted the company for the last decade or so. What’s that echo? \nWhile the report seems to say the company has no plans to extend its AirPort range it stops short of saying we shouldn’t expect other wireless products from the company. Those members of its team involved in AirPort development have instead been shunted to work with different teams (including the Apple TV). This could end up being significant if Apple does indeed introduce some form of Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor . \nIn the event Apple were to introduce such products it seems logical it will want to brand these as companion devices for HomeKit and the Apple TV, in which case the historic association of the AirPort name with routers may confuse the identity of its new range of product(s). We recently learned development of such solutions has reached prototype stage and that Apple engineers have secretly begun testing these early models at home . Will these new products be part of a range of some kind? Apple Home? Siri@Home? Wait and see... \nI can’t help but hope Apple continues to provide some kind of router, even if only as a component of whatever it is it is working on. Failure to do so will leave the space clear for mesh-based solutions like Google WiFi. Meanwhile there are a few minor discounts on Apple’s existing range to be found on Amazon . \nGoogle+? If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not join AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community and join the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple? \nGot a story?

      "text": "– A + Apple's Austin campus now up to 6,000 workers as company touts 2M US jobs since 2007 By Roger Fingas \nMonday, November 21, 2016, 08:44 am PT (11:44 am ET) \nIn a weekend profile of Apple's campus in Austin, Tex., the company claimed that it has created over 2 million jobs in the U.S. since the iPhone first went on sale in 2007.\n\n\n\n\nThat number includes \"explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,\" Apple said in a statement to the New York Times . Its own workforce includes about 80,000 people.\n\nThe company added that it \"made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States,\" and plans to \"continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\"\n\nMuch of the company's tech support staff is based at its Austin campus, which in the last seven years has grown from holding 2,100 workers to about 6,000, aided by a recent major expansion. The facility also handles supplier operations, finances, Maps development, and various iTunes and App Store tasks.\n\nWhile the average pay for an Apple call center worker is just $30,000 per year, people who graduate to permanent status can take home $45,000 plus benefits and annual stock grants. Overall the average salary at the Austin campus —including management staff, but excluding benefits and stocks —is $77,000 per year.\n\nA perk of working at the campus is that workers are encouraged to try out other positions, which can potentially lead to dramatic career shifts. Apple is working on formalizing the program, allowing people to test different jobs in six-month stints.",

(Source: EEIM/Wikicommons) \n(KGO/CNN) - Apple is offering batteries to some iPhone 6 users whose phones abruptly shut down. \nApple said in a statement on Monday that a \"very small number\" of devices made between September and October 2015 are affected. The tech giant's announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \nThe China Consumers Association said in a statement that \"a considerable number of Chinese iPhone 6 and 6s users reported the problem.\" \nApple says the problem is not a safety issue. \nThe battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6 is being issued worldwide. \nCopyright 2016 KGO via CNN.

Still, he notes that the company's growing emphasis on software and services could serve as a defense, although those have less utility and appeal in the large and highly regulated Chinese market.\n\nHis comments come as the iPhone maker has offered fixes to two different longstanding bugs over the past week. \nLast week, Apple launched a repair program for \"touch disease,\" which leaves iPhone 6 Plus devices with f lickering, unresponsive screens after being dropped. Then, another new repair program emerged, this time for battery replacements on iPhone 6S models that unexpectedly shut down . \nBut Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners and technology investor, said that while he agrees with some of Uerkwitz's conclusions, the note was \"clickbait.\" \n\n\"The law of large numbers makes it almost impossible for Apple to outperform the market materially,\" McNamee told CNBC's \" Squawk Alley \" on Monday. \"And it's just reached a scale where hyper-growth is very hard. But accusing them of not having the courage to lead AI is ridiculous.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time an analyst has rung the death knell for Apple. Over a year ago, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi told CNBC the tech company's best days were behind it . Shares have fallen more than 7 percent over the past 12 months. \n\nHowever, McNamee said that Apple is doing many interesting things to maximize their growth, while artificial intelligence is a \"catch all for ever new computer project that doesn't actually have a use case.\" Many of the early efforts of AI aren't a \"must have\" for consumers, McNamee said — and some are even problematic. \n\"At the end of the day, the challenge that we face as technology investors is that we are coming off the mother of all product cycles with smartphones,\" McNamee said. \"And there really is nothing on the horizon one-tenth as large. You look at something like virtual reality — a concept I think will produce a really significant business opportunity — by comparison to smartphones, it's tiny.\"",

      "text": "Here's Apple's New Coffee Table Book With Actual Products Monday November 21, 2016 9:06 AM PST by Joe Rossignol 512 Pixels blogger Stephen Hackett has created a unique video showcasing Apple's new \" Designed by Apple in California \" coffee table book alongside actual Apple products, ranging from the PowerMac G5 to iPod socks. The video helps bring the book to life by providing a nostalgic look back on the past two decades of Apple products, starting with the original iMac in 1998 through to the Apple Pencil in 2015. Hackett said most of what it is in the book is a part of his personal collection of Apple products. MacRumors provided a hands-on look inside Apple's new book last week. \"Designed by Apple in California\" chronicles 20 years of Apple design with 450 photos of its products and the processes used to make them. The high-quality photos were taken by photographer Andrew Zuckerman. Apple says it took eight years to design the linen-bound hardcover book, dedicated to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It features specially milled, custom-dyed paper with \"gilded matte silver edges,\" and low-ghost ink. It is available now in a smaller 10.2Ă12.8 inches size for $199 and a larger 13Ă16.3 inches size for $299. The book is also available at select Apple retail stores, including Apple Regent Street in London, Apple Opera in Paris, and Apple Ginza in Tokyo, among others. In the U.S., it is available in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, San Francisco, and Palo Alto, and at Apple's campus store at its Cupertino headquarters.",

      "text": "Comment Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District of California has ruled that Samsung infringed on an Apple patent for \"autocorrect\" technology. Judge Koh also ruled that Samsung patents for multimedia synchronization were invalid, giving Apple an advantage heading into the electronic giants' March 31 trail. (Photo : REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) \nIt's public knowledge that Samsung and Apple are the biggest rivals in the smartphone industry. Each tech giant wants to outdo the other. Though the said market is suffering a decline in shipments, Samsung still tops Apple based on the preliminary data released by global research firm International Data Corporation for the third quarter of 2016. \nThe two tech companies are set to clash again next year with the release of its new flagship devices the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8. Innovations is the key in winning as far as technology is concerned. Samsung seems to get ahead of Apple with the latest confirmation by Qualcomm. The American multinational semiconductor company just announced that Samsung will build its next-generation Snapdragon 835 processor. According to Engadget , the Korean-based tech giant will be using its 10-nanometer FinFET process. \nYibada further reports that the mass production of Qualcomm's latest SoC has already commenced. This innovative processor is set to hit early next year. Samsung's upcoming flagship device Galaxy S8 is rumored to be powered by Snapdragon 835. The successor of the Galaxy S7 is set to be released early next year. \n\nThis is a significant deal for Samsung as far as competing against Apple's upcoming iPhone 8. The Snapdragon 835 will be the most powerful chip for Qualcomm. This means that the Galaxy S8 will probably be the fastest smartphone. Compared to the previous Snapdragon 821, the SD 835 will offer at least 27 percent increase in performance and up to 40 percent less power consumption. \n\nFurthermore, the two companies will also make it the thinnest mobile processor. Thus, it will let manufacturers increase the battery life of their devices because of the bigger space made available by the SD 835. Likewise, there will also be plenty of room for added hardware features. The new chip will also be integrated with Quick Charge 4. This makes charging 20 percent faster. \nEngadget also reported that in just a five-minute charge, the device will have at most five hours of additional battery life. To put it simply, the Galaxy S8 can achieve a full-charge in around 30 minutes. That should be 15 minutes for half-full battery. Both Qualcomm and Samsung is yet to reveal more details about the new chip. Apparently, people will expect it at the CES 2017 on January. \nAs for Apple's iPhone 8, it is rumored to be powered by an A11 processor, according to Tech Times . This chipset will also use the 10-nanometer method. The speed should increase by 20 percent. It will also reduce power consumption. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) will be the one producing the chipset instead of Samsung. \nIt was previously reported that Samsung is Apple's primary supplier of OLED or organic light-emitting diode display. This is the US-based company's venture in the new display technology since Apple has been using LCD screen on its iPhones. One of the rumors regarding the iPhone 8 is its curved display that can only be achieved with OLED screen technology. It will also allow an edge-to-edge or bezel-less display. It is akin to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Google has also used the said new techonology.",

      "text": "  11:52 AM EST Apple Lacks Courage, Says Oppenheimer; A Decade-Long Malaise? Oppenheimer & Co .’s Andrew Uerkwitz today reiterates a “Perform” rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), writing that the company \"lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),” and as a result, \"Over the next decade we believe the stock will generally underperform the market.\"\"We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise ,” concludes Uerkwitz. We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater. However, we believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last “growth” hurrah from the tenth anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company. Our Perform rating is unchanged for now. (Contrast this report with the bullish note today from Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley .) Apple shares are up $1.66, or 1.5%, at $111.72. By June 29th of next year, writes Uerkwitz, the iPhone will be ten years old, Apple will have sold 1.2 billion units, and sales will probably “peak” at 245 million, he thinks, which he refers to as the first “ crack ” in its empire. Prices may even peak, with the next model, he thinks, as “fewer hardware breakthroughs are available today that can trigger favorable mix shift.\"",

      "text": "Home / News / Internet News / McLaren confirms Apple talks happened – they just weren't ever 'definitive' McLaren confirms Apple talks happened – they just weren't ever 'definitive' \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nIn September, reports surfaced that Apple was in talks with car-maker McLaren concerning a possible takeover of the company by Tim Cook and co. \nIt was also claimed that Apple was considering investing in the British supercar company if a takeover didn't go ahead, with the New York Times, Bloomberg, and The Financial Times all reporting the news. \nNow, a new report from Reuters seems to confirm the talks did indeed happen but that they largely came to nothing. \nRelated: Apple Car \nMcLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt confirmed in an interview that McLaren and Apple were in discussions, but he said the talks never resulted in a 'definitive proposition'. \n\"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" said Flewitt. \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition .\" \nThe CEO's comments follow McLaren saying it was \"not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment\". \nAccording to a recent Bloomberg report, Apple, which has long been rumoured to be working on a self-driving car, has \"drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions.\" \nThe company reportedly cut hundreds of jobs and gave remaining staff a deadline of late next year to \"prove the feasibility of the self-driving system\". \nApparently, the firm decided to refocus its efforts on developing an autonomous driving system, rather than manufacturing an actual vehicle of its own. \nIt could be that this development affected talks between Apple and McLaren, though there's no way to know for sure. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nLet us know what you make of the news in the comments. 0 shares",

For example, TSMC manage to win that exclusivity for the production of A10, the chipset inside the iPhone 7. The Taiwanese company achieved that due to its InFO packaging technique that allows the A10 to remain very thin, while at the same time delivering improved performance and efficiency. However, the chipset is made on TSMC's 16nm FinFET+ process, which is inferior to Samsung's newly announced 10nm FinFET process. The latter will be used in the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor that should make its debut next year. It's clear that TSMC needs to refine its own process in order to win exclusivity over the production of the chipset that will be included in the next iPhones. It's unclear what company will score a contract with Apple next year, but TSMC has already confirmed that it will start a pilot for its 7nm process in 2017. Based on these facts, the Chinese media reports that TSMC might be favorite to produce the chipset inside the 2018 iPhone. Samsung and TSMC could split exclusivity over 2017 iPhone CPU Unfortunately, many things can happen in two years, so if we know what TSMC plans for the next years, it doesn't mean that its rivals won't improved their technologies. Apple has a habit of splitting production of certain component to different companies, as to keep prices on the low side and encourage competition between rival companies. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are an exception since they all come with TSMC's chipset inside. TSMC promised to finish trial efforts of its 10nm processor in Q4 2016 and that it will make it available to customers in late 2016. This means that the 2017 iPhone could come with a 10nm processor made by TSMC, but that we don't rule out from the equation its main rival, Samsung.",

      "title": "Phil Schiller Says 32GB RAM on New MacBook Pro Would Have Required Battery Compromising Design",
      "text": "Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller has allegedly responded to an email from software developer Ben Slaney to further clarify why the new MacBook Pro maxes out at 16GB of RAM, noting that supporting 32GB of RAM would require a different logic board design which might reduce space for batteries.\n\nSchiller: The MacBook Pro uses 16GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHz. To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.\n\nSlaney himself wrote an article explaining how the new MacBook Pro uses a low power, enhanced version of DDR3 RAM called LPDDR3E, which maxes out at 16GB. To achieve up to 32GB RAM would have required using DDR4 RAM, but its low-power variant LPDDR4 is not supported by the Intel processors powering the late 2016 models.\nUsing the iStat Menus tool, Slaney determined that, under normal conditions, the LPDDR3E RAM uses 1.5 watts of power. In comparison, he said the notebooks would use about 3-5 watts if they were using DDR4 memory, although this estimate is rather loosely based on tests of DDR4 RAM on Windows-based notebooks.\n\nSlaney said the 2-5 watts saved translates to 10% of overall power usage being dedicated to RAM versus 20-30% that would be required for DDR4 RAM, which, if accurate, helps justify Apple's power versus performance tradeoff.\n\nSchiller previously addressed these power concerns in an earlier comment:\n\nTo put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn't be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system.\n\nApple's decision is even more justified when considering background power draw, or the energy a notebook uses to go back into sleep mode after regular usage. Slaney said this figure is estimated to be about 50% of overall power draw on an average system when using DDR4 RAM, but only 20% when using LPDDR3 RAM.\n\nMoreover, the new MacBook Pro would get less than 7 days of standby time if it used DDR4 RAM, compared to 30 days with LPDDR3E RAM, he said.\n\nApple have been using LPDDR for several generations of their notebooks, and it’s part of the way that they get very long standby time on them. Switching to DDR4 would drastically decrease it from the 30 days of standby time that they get now to less than one week. With DDR4 they’d have produced a notebook that would have a completely drained battery if it was at 50% charge and you closed the lid and left it for a few days. Not only would that be annoying, but by running the battery flat often it would end up damaging a percentage of their batteries because they’d frequently get 100% discharged, which puts a lot of stress on them, and sometimes even kills them.\n\nThe rest of the article reflects upon poor battery life in several Windows-based notebooks with 32GB RAM, part of which can be blamed on the FAA's 100-watt-hour limit on notebook batteries brought on airplanes.\n\n*Full Article:* \"Why the MacBook Pro is limited to 16GB of RAM\" on MacDaddyRelated Roundup: MacBook Pro\nTag: Phil Schiller\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

The text at the end of the ad, which runs just about two minutes, reads “Open your heart o everyone.” The new ad is entitled “Frankie’s Holiday.” \nYou get to see the iPhone 7 in action for a brief few moments, along with Voice Memos — an admittedly strange pick to showcase in a long holiday ad. \nYou can check out the new ad below.
