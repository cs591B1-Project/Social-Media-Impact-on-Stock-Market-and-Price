They were among about 350 people at a peaceful rally, part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. The campaign seeks higher hourly wages, including for workers at fast-food restaurants and airports. Participants chanted, \"We shall not be moved\" and waved signs that said, \"We won't back down\" and \"Strike for $15 and our future.\" Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation in April that will gradually raise New York's minimum wage to $15. One protester, 55-year-old Flavia Cabral , struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs. \"All these people don't have savings because we're working check to check,\" Cabral said. \"We have to decide what we are going to get: We're going to pay rent or we're going to put food on the table or we're going to send my child to school.\" Cabral, who's originally from the Dominican Republic, said she was especially concerned about her children's education. \"No family has money saved to send their children to school. I'm one of them,\" she said, adding that one of her daughters dropped out and she's concerned about keeping her other daughter in school. InsideGov | Graphiq Fast-food worker Alvin Major , 51, said he supports four children and a wife recovering from cancer. \"Fifteen dollars is just a number,\" he said. \"If we could get one dollar and one dollar could take care of our health care, housing, food and everything, that's what we need.\" The Employment Policies Institute , a conservative economic think tank, issued a statement in response to the protests, saying dramatic minimum-wage increases result in lost jobs, reduced hours and business closures. The minimum wage will rise to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018 and in some prosperous suburbs by the end of 2021. It will rise to $12.50 in the rest of the state by 2020, eventually reaching $15. ___ Associated Press photographer Mark Lennihan contributed to this report. Today's Deals",

The District Attorney’s Office is opening a criminal investigation into the matter.\nIt all started with a photo shared on Facebook showing a law enforcement officer’s soda at a Topeka McDonald’s mixed with mustard has gone viral.\nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!”\nThe incident reportedly happened at the McDonald’s located at 2001 North Topeka Boulevard.\nSupervisor at the McDonald’s, Gary Vaughn, tells KSNT News the issue has been handled internally but would not elaborate on what that meant.\nTom and Marilyn Dobski of McDonald’s Franchisees in Topeka released the following statement.\n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.”\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol tells KSNT News this happened to one of their trooper’s about two weeks ago at the same location.\nThis embed is invalid",

REUTERS/Keith Bedford 5349837 \nThe McDonald’s employee who put mustard in the soda beverages of two police officers was fired, according to the franchise. \nTom Dobski, the franchisee, said that the company is “shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee,” reports WIBW. \n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants,” Dobski declared . “We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.” \nThe incident allegedly happened Friday night, when an officer went through the drive-thru of a Topkea McDonald’s. He asked for a Dr. Pepper, only to discover that mustard had been poured in it. \nAn image of his soda with mustard in it circulated throughout social media. The Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted a picture of it on their group page, writing “This is extremely unacceptable!!” \nThe Topeka Police Department, after discussing it with the district attorney’s office, will be opening a criminal investigation into the matter. \nThe restaurant is cooperating with the investigation, according to the police department. \nThe Kansas Highway Patrol said that one of their troopers also found mustard in his drink not long ago. \nA restaurant in Alexandria, Va. also fired two employees who refused service to a female officer in uniform.Two employees at Noodles & Company apparently refused to give service to the officer and cracked a joke about her. After conducting an internal review, management fired the two employees and issued a statement condemning discrimination of any form.

The fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered.\nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area.\nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favour of butter.\nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.\nThe Associated Press",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) \nNEW YORK (AP) — About 25 people participating in a nationwide minimum-wage protest were arrested Tuesday after they linked arms and sat on a lower Manhattan street. \nThey were among about 350 people at a peaceful rally, part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. The campaign seeks higher hourly wages, including for workers at fast-food restaurants and airports. \nParticipants chanted \"We shall not be moved\" and waved signs that read \"We won't back down\" and \"Strike for $15 and our future.\" \nGov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation last April that gradually raises New York's minimum wage. \nOne protester, Flavia Cabral, 55, struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs. \n\"All these people don't have savings because we're working check to check,\" said Cabral. \"We have to decide what we are going to get: We're going to pay rent or we're going to put food on the table or we're going to send my child to school.\" \nCabral, who's originally from the Dominican Republic, said she was especially concerned about her children's education. \n\"No family has money saved to send their children to school. I'm one of them,\" she said, adding that one of her daughters dropped out and she's concerned about keeping her other daughter in school. \nFast-food worker Alvin Major, 51, of Brooklyn, said he supports four children and a wife recovering from cancer. \n\"Fifteen dollars is just a number,\" he said. \"If we could get one dollar and one dollar could take care of our health care, housing, food and everything, that's what we need.\" \nThe minimum wage will rise to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018 and in some prosperous suburbs by the end of 2021. It will rise to $12.50 in the rest of the state by 2020, eventually reaching $15. \n___ \nAssociated Press photographer Mark Lennihan contributed to this report. Tags",

      "text": "Getty Images McDonald’s is testing fresh beef in Oklahoma. Adding to the growing list of menu tests the fast-food giant is conducting, McDonald’s Corp. is trying out Quarter Pounder burgers in northeastern Oklahoma that are made with fresh beef that’s never been frozen.\nThe test is taking place in 75 restaurants, and includes the Quarter Pounder with cheese, Double Quarter Pounder with cheese, Quarter Pounder Deluxe and Bacon Clubhouse Burger.\nFresh beef was first tested in the Dallas–Fort Worth area, McDonald’s MCD, -0.50% said in a statement released this week. The burgers are “seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper,” McDonald’s chef Chad Schafer is Quote: d as having said.\nAlso: McDonald’s takes on fast-casual with tech upgrades and table service\nMcDonald’s has announced a number of other tests recently , including the Sriracha Big Mac, a larger Grand Mac and a smaller Mac Jr.\nThe company also introduced a Chicken McNugget recipe in August that does away with artificial preservatives, as well as sandwich buns with high-fructose corn syrup removed .\nSee: McDonald’s latest push to attract millennials?

Delivery companies are having to rise to the challenge of getting customers a hot, fresh and held-together burger. Here are their techniques. Photo: Deliveroo\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets believe, they said, that “more core burger news” could ultimately contribute to continued positive trends in same-store sales, alongside an easing of food deflation headwinds and broader adoption of the McPick 2 and beverage value options.\n“Over time, McDonald’s needs to compete more effectively against the expansion of convenience-store food service and fast casual,” analysts wrote in a note published on Tuesday. “Our guess is that new value options and premium core burger news can help trends improve ahead of potential renovation news (for example, fresh beef).”\nSee also: The restaurant recession has arrived\nRBC rates McDonald’s shares outperform with a price target of $140.\nMcDonald’s shares are up 1.7% for the year so far, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.24% is up 8.1%.\nMore from MarketWatch Many U.S. Businesses Struggle to Find Mexican Workers Living in a Castle That’s Also a Draw for Tourists How Election 2016 Changed the Political Parties",

The Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying \"a McDonald's here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order.

(AP) - McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas,” they said in a statement.\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol told KSNT that a similar incident happened to one of their troopers a couple of weeks ago at the same location.",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) \nCHICAGO (AP) — Dozens of people were arrested Monday as they participated in protests nationwide for a $15 per hour minimum wage. \nFast-food restaurant workers and home and child-care workers rallied in cities including Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and New York on Tuesday morning. In many cities the protesters blocked busy intersections. \nIn Chicago, hundreds of protesters at O'Hare International Airport were outside terminals chanting \"What do we want? $15! When do we want it? Now!\" Police gated an area to allow travelers room to walk. As many as 500 workers at the airport planned to strike. \nMore protests were expected nationwide later in the day. Thousands plan to walk off the job at McDonald's restaurants. The efforts are part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. \nAbout 25 of the 350 protesters in New York City were arrested. One protester, Flavia Cabral, 55, struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs. \n\"All these people don't have savings because we're working check to check,\" Cabral said. \"We have to decide what we are going to get: We're going to pay rent or we're going to put food on the table or we're going to send my child to school.\" What's going on in the markets today? \nDetroit police say they arrested about 40 protesters who blocked traffic. And nearly three dozen protesters have been arrested in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In the San Francisco Bay Area, ride-hailing drivers, fast-food employees, airport workers and others shut down an Oakland intersection. \nThe conservative-leaning, nonprofit Employment Policies Institute think tank said it believes minimum wage increases will result in lost jobs, reduced hours and business closures.

      "text": "McDonald's Expands Push to Swap Frozen Patties for Fresh Beef  28 PM Tweet More than 75 locations in northeastern Oklahoma participating, while the chain first began trials in Dallas-Fort Worth area locations. © McDonald's Corp. By Bloomberg \nMcDonald’s Corp. is expanding a program that ditches frozen patties in favor of fresh beef, making another break with decades of fast-food practices in a bid to revitalize the chain. \nFresh beef is now being used in some sandwiches in more than 75 restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, area, McDonald’s said in a statement, extending trials that began in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, where the company is preparing fresh beef in 55 locations. \nThe push more than doubles the number of restaurants serving serving fresh meat, a sign the chain is stepping up competition with fast-casual eateries such as Smashburger and Shake Shack. In Tulsa, the change will apply to Quarter Pounders and Bacon Clubhouse burgers, according to the statement. \n“These burgers are hotter and juicier than our previous quarter-pound patties,” said McDonald’s Chef Chad Schafer. They’re seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper, he said. \nMcDonald’s has made other moves recently to improve its food, including switching to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine. It is also using real butter, not margarine, in breakfast sandwiches, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from buns. Wendy’s Co. advertises that all of its beef is fresh and has never been frozen. \nThe fresh beef test is being conducted in just a tiny fraction of McDonald’s 14,000 U.S. locations. Changing the supply chain, as well as kitchen operations and equipment won’t be easy, or cheap, should the test go nationwide. \n“If you bring in fresh beef, you’ve got to be careful on the storage and the kitchen equipment, so you can’t have cross contamination,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at an investor conference earlier this year. “We’ve got to work out whether we have the chillers or refrigerators with the necessary capacity.” \nThat means it will take more time -- and money -- before fresh beef could spread to the rest of the chain. \n“There’s things like that we’re going to need to work through,” Easterbrook said.",

      "text": "Stumble \nMcDonald’s ( MCD ) worker Terrance Wise said spending Tuesday morning in a New York City jail was a “beautiful thing.” \nAs part of the “Fight for $15” movement, a national union-backed campaign advocating for a $15 an hour minimum wage, Wise had traveled to New York City from his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri, to take part in a round of protests and strikes that the group has organized on its four-year anniversary, which it calls “Disruption Tuesday.” Wise and other protesters were arrested on Tuesday morning after they linked arms and sat in a lower Manhattan street, while low-wage workers held protests and planned to walk off their jobs in dozens of other U.S. cities. \n“I went to jail to make sure my kids have a better future,” he said. “As I sat behind the bars, I thought about why I was there, how I’ll make the American public confront this thing we have going on, wage and racial inequality in this country.” \nThe Fight for $15, which is backed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is marking its anniversary at an unusually volatile time in the country’s economic and political landscape. The movement is credited with helping raise awareness of the plight of low-wage workers and bolstering state and municipal efforts to increase the minimum wage. \nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka, center, marches with service workers asking for $15 minimum-wage pay during a rally at Newark Liberty International Airport, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016, in Newark, New Jersey. Julio Cortez, AP \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has expressed contradictory beliefs about wages, describing them as “too high” while at other times professing support for boosting the baseline wage to $15. \n“Whether you are a Trump supporter or a Hillary supporter, we all get up every day and we work,” Wise said. “Today sent a strong message, not only in New York, that workers are stronger than ever, and we have to increase our efforts, take bolder action. That’s what you’ll see from the Fight for $15.” \nWise, whose mother worked at Hardees, describes himself as a second-generation fast-food worker who now earns $9 an hour and struggles to make ends meet. He and his fiancée, who have three daughters, struggled with homelessness a few years ago, even though both of them were working at the time. Living on low wages “is constantly a hustle, a juggling act,” he said. “It’s the simple things we miss out on,” such as the ballet shoes he wasn’t able to afford for his daughter’s dance class. \n“Fifteen dollars an hour and union rights would make my family a stable family,” he said. “To keep the lights and gas on at the same time.” \nIn many ways, the Fight for $15 has had remarkable success since it began in 2012. At the time, the call for a $15 minimum wage was viewed as a hugely ambitious, if not preposterous, goal, given that it reflected an hourly rate more than twice the federal minimum pay of $7.25 an hour. \nFour years later, the movement is credited with helping raise support for higher minimum wage laws across dozens of states and municipalities. The National Employment Law Project estimates those baseline wage increases have provided $61.5 billion in annual raises. Corporations have also responded, with Walmart ( WMT ), McDonald’s and Target ( TGT ) among the companies raising their baseline pay to $10 an hour amid mounting public pressure to offer workers a living wage. \n“When we first started, the Fight for $15 was for our employers,” Wise said. “We never set out as a minimum wage campaign to get elected leaders to change our wages. To see elected leaders stand up and support a higher minimum wage and support unions. that’s a sweet side impact of the Fight for $15.”",

      "text": "\nTOPEKA, Kan. – A fast-food employee is out of a job after reportedly mixing a police officer’s drink with mustard. \nAccording to KSNT, a Facebook post grabbed the attention of management at a Topeka McDonald’s restaurant. \nThe post claims that an officer was given a Dr. Pepper with mustard in it after ordering food through the drive-thru. \nThe franchise owners say they investigated the claims and the employee responsible was fired. \n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas,” they said in a statement. \nThe Kansas Highway Patrol told KSNT that a similar incident happened to one of their troopers a couple of weeks ago at the same location.

      "text": "Switching over to from frozen patties to fresh beef would be a huge undertaking for McDonald’s mcd , but the fast food chain is working hard to do exactly that.\nCase and point: McDonald’s announced it’s expanding its fresh beef to 75 locations in Northeast Oklahoma, effectively growing the market test by more than a factor of six, Business Insider reports. The test initially began in May at just 14 restaurants in the Dallas area.\nThat said, these tests don’t apply to every menu item at participating McDonald’s locations. For now, franchises testing fresh beef are only using it to make Quarter Pounder burgers.\nFrozen beef patties are still standard for McDonald’s burgers. And with 14,000 outposts in the U.S. alone, the company would have to drastically change its operations if it wants to make a complete switch to fresh beef. But on the bright side, this expansion means the initial test went well, so now McDonald’s will see if it’s something it can sustain on a larger scale.\nIf the test does continue to grow, it could spell bad news for Wendy’s wen considering the rival chain’s big selling point is “Always Fresh, Never Frozen.”\n \nOf course, there are both upsides and downsides to using fresh beef. Some franchisees expressed concern that it could increase the likelihood of food safety issues. Others were optimistic that it would create a tastier product and reduce cook time. There’s also the idea that it would improve the brand’s perception. As one franchisee responded to a Nomura survey , “Perception is everything.”",

      "text": "TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- McDonald&apos;s is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.\nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that&apos;s cooked when ordered.\nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald&apos;s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area.\nMcDonald&apos;s says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter.\nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.\n ",

(AP) – McDonald’s is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.\nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered.\nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area.\nMcDonald’s says it has making “significant enhancements” to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter.\nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.",

His wife is smokin hot, doesn't nag him, and professes undying love, while cooking him hot meals & letting him smoke cigars & drink brown water in the house. His 2 boys, Michael T & Crockett, have been called the most wonderful kids ever (by him), and they're young enough to still think he's cool and are willing to be seen in public with him. Michael Berry has a beard you can hide a French car in and shows no signs of male pattern baldness, his testosterone levels are those of a 17-year-old and his bad cholesterol level is no longer near-fatal (both due to modern medicine), but he has untreated acid reflux that affects his voice on occasion.Named Top 25 talk hosts in America by NewsMax Magazine.

Subscribe Rate Of Female Fund Managers Has Not Improved Since 2008 Financial Crisis McDonald’s restaurant employees rally after walking off the job to demand a $15 per hour wage and union rights during nationwide ‘Fight for $15 Day of Disruption’ protests on November 29, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. (David McNew/Getty Images) \nAs the labor union-backed Fight for $15 begins yet another nationwide strike on November 29, I have a simple message for the protest organizers and the reporters covering them: I told you so. \nIt brings me no joy to write these words. The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing. \nWatch on Forbes: $15 Minimum Wage, What We Can Expect \nLet’s start with automation. In 2013, when the Fight for $15 was still in its growth stage, I and others warned that union demands for a much higher minimum wage would force businesses with small profit margins to replace full-service employees with costly investments in self-service alternatives. At the time, labor groups accused business owners of crying wolf. It turns out the wolf was real. \nEarlier this month, McDonald’s announced the nationwide roll-out of touchscreen self-service kiosks. In a video the company released to showcase the new customer experience, it’s striking to see employees who once would have managed a cash register now reduced to monitoring a customer’s choices at an iPad-style kiosk. \nIt’s not just McDonald’s that has embraced job-replacing technology. Numerous restaurant chains (both quick service and full service) have looked to computer tablets as a solution for rising labor costs that won’t adversely impact the customer’s experience. Eatsa, a fully-automated restaurant concept, now has five locations—all in cities or states that have embraced a $15 minimum wage. And in a scene stolen from The Jetsons , the Starship delivery robot is now navigating the streets of San Francisco with groceries and other consumer goods. The company’s founder pointed to a rising minimum wage as a key factor driving the growth of his automated delivery business. \nOf course, not all businesses have the capital necessary to shift from full-service to self-service. And that brings me to my next correct prediction–that a $15 minimum wage would force many small businesses to lay off staff, seek less-costly locations, or close altogether. \nTragically, these stories—in California in particular–are too numerous to cite in detail here. They include a bookstore in Roseville, a pub in Fresno, restaurants and bakeries in San Francisco, a coffee shop in Berkeley, grocery stores in Oakland, a grill in Santa Clara, and apparel manufacturers through the state. In September of this year, nearly one-quarter of restaurant closures in the Bay Area cited labor costs as one of the reasons for shutting down operations. And just this past week, a California-based communications firm announced it was moving 75 call center jobs from San Diego to El Paso, citing the state’s rising minimum as the “deciding factor.” (Dozens of additional stories can be found at the website FacesOf15.com .) A crowd of about 350 protesters stand on Broadway in front of a McDonald’s restaurant, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) \nOther states are also learning the same basic economic lesson: Customers have a limit to what they will pay for service. Voters in Washington, Colorado, Maine and Arizona voted to raise minimum wages on Election Day, convinced of the policy’s merits after millions of dollars were spent by union advocates. In the immediate aftermath, family-owned restaurants, coffee shops and even childcare providers have struggled to absorb the coming cost increase—with parents paying the cost through steeper childcare bills, and employees paying the cost through reduced shift hours or none at all. \nThe out-of-state labor groups who funded these initiatives aren’t shedding tears over the consequences. Like their Soviet-era predecessors who foolishly thought they could centrally manage prices and business operations to fit an idealistic worldview, economic reality keeps ruining the model of all gain and no pain. This brings me to my last correct prediction, which is that the Fight for $15 was always more a creation of the left-wing Service Employees International Union (SEIU) rather than a legitimate grassroots effort. Reuters reported last year that, based on federal filings, the SEIU had spent anywhere from $24 million to $50 million on the its Fight for $15 campaign, and the number has surely increased since then. \nThis money has bought the union a lot of protesters and media coverage. You can expect more of it on November 29. But the real faces of the Fight for $15 are the young people and small business owners who have had their futures compromised. Those faces are not happy ones. ",

      "text": "McDonald's testing the use of fresh beef in some burgers Posted: Updated: Credit: Fibonacci Blue / CC BY 2.0 \nTULSA, Okla. (AP) - McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Puskar, File) 0 Shares Email McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. The fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. McDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. McDonald’s Adds Fresh Beef to More Locations \nSwitching over to from frozen patties to fresh beef would be a huge undertaking for McDonald’s mcd , but the fast food chain is working hard to do exactly that. \nCase and point: McDonald’s announced it’s expanding its fresh beef to 75 locations in Northeast Oklahoma, effectively growing the market test by more than a factor of six, Business Insider reports. The test initially began in May at just 14 restaurants in the Dallas area. \nThat said, these tests don’t apply to every menu item at participating McDonald’s locations. For now, franchises testing fresh beef are only using it to make Quarter Pounder burgers. \nFrozen beef patties are still standard for McDonald’s burgers. And with 14,000 outposts in the U.S. alone, the company would have to drastically change its operations if it wants to make a complete switch to fresh beef. But on the bright side, this expansion means the initial test went well, so now McDonald’s will see if it’s something it can sustain on a larger scale. \nIf the test does continue to grow, it could spell bad news for Wendy’s wen considering the rival chain’s big selling point is “Always Fresh, Never Frozen.” \n\nOf course, there are both upsides and downsides to using fresh beef. Some franchisees expressed concern that it could increase the likelihood of food safety issues. Others were optimistic that it would create a tastier product and reduce cook time. There’s also the idea that it would improve the brand’s perception. As one franchisee responded to a Nomura survey , “Perception is everything.” ",

He was taken to Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville, where he died. \nPolice said a passenger in the teen's car was there, along with a witness, attempting to give the teen CPR. \nTRENDING STORIES: \nPolice say Smith's passenger is cooperating and told them it might have been a drug deal. \nGwinnett investigators said that was surprising considering where this happened. \n\"The Hamilton Mill area is quite unusual to have a homicide. We've got some really nice homes in that area, we've got a lot shopping centers, we've got a lot of traffic from people doing their holiday purchases, so it is quite unusual to have a homicide in this area,\" said Gwinnett Cpl. Michele Pihera. \nPolice are now searching for a red car seen leaving the restaurant after the reported shooting. \nPolice said they are going over surveillance video in the area. \nThere are no comments yet.

He was taken to Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville, where he died. \nPolice said a passenger in the teen's car was there, along with a witness, attempting to give the teen CPR. \nTRENDING STORIES: \nPolice say Smith's passenger is cooperating and told them it might have been a drug deal. \nGwinnett investigators said that was surprising considering where this happened. \n\"The Hamilton Mill area is quite unusual to have a homicide. We've got some really nice homes in that area, we've got a lot shopping centers, we've got a lot of traffic from people doing their holiday purchases, so it is quite unusual to have a homicide in this area,\" said Gwinnett Cpl. Michele Pihera. \nPolice are now searching for a red car seen leaving the restaurant after the reported shooting. \nPolice said they are going over surveillance video in the area. \nThere are no comments yet.

(AP) — McDonald’s is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.\nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area.

      "text": "Service union targets McDonald's, UPMC with wage rallies Published 5:31 am, Tuesday, November 29, 2016 PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Service Employees International Union is targeting McDonald's restaurants and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with marches demanding a $15 minimum wage and union representation. The union contends UPMC shuttle bus workers have also gone on strike seeking union representation. UPMC, which is western Pennsylvania's dominant hospital network, had previously announced plans to increase the minimum starting wage for entry-level jobs at most facilities to $15 per hour by 2021. But the union contends UPMC needs to move faster and accused the network of trying to silence workers and union organizers. UPMC hasn't immediately commented. Organizers began their \"Day of Disruption\" marches at a McDonald's in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood Tuesday morning. The group plans similar protest near a McDonald's and the federal building downtown during the evening rush hour.

      "text": "Service Union Targets McDonald’s, UPMC With Wage Rallies November 29, 2016 9:26 AM \nPITTSBURGH (KDKA/AP) – The Service Employees International Union is targeting McDonald’s restaurants and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with marches demanding a $15 minimum wage and union representation. \nThe union contends UPMC shuttle bus workers have also gone on strike seeking union representation. \nUPMC, which is western Pennsylvania’s dominant hospital network, had previously announced plans to increase the minimum starting wage for entry-level jobs at most facilities to $15 per hour by 2021. \nBut the union contends UPMC needs to move faster and accused the network of trying to silence workers and union organizers. UPMC hasn’t immediately commented. \nOrganizers began their “Day of Disruption” marches at a McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood Tuesday morning. The group gathered for a similar protest near a McDonald’s and the federal building downtown just before the evening rush hour. (Photo Credit: KDKA) \nThe afternoon march started at the federal building, made its way to Grant Street, then Sixth Avenue and Smithfield Street, heading for the Boulevard of the Allies. \n“Their unfair practices, the fact that many of us have to work two jobs working for the largest employers within Pennsylvania,” said Erica Lee, a UPMC shuttle bus driver. \n“We want a better voice on our job, we’d like better pay, better benefits package,” added Lou Berry, a UPMC housekeeper. “We work for the largest health care institution in the city of Pittsburgh and we’re charged some of the highest health care prices out of anybody.” \nIn a statement to KDKA, UPMC says, “The vast majority of UPMC employees are focused on providing high quality care and they know that wages, comprehensive benefit packages and general working environment throughout UPMC are the best in the region and that further wage structure increases are already coming, all without paying union dues.” \nPittsburgh Public Safety officials say 19 people were arrested after sitting down in the streets during the protest. There were no reports of any injuries. \nBut it did cause a traffic mess in and around downtown. Some bus routes were delayed. \nThe protests in Pittsburgh were part of many taking place across the country with workers calling for better pay and benefits. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

The workers from Nepal say they their passports were confiscated by the agency. \n  CLOSE X Edit Favorites \nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nDinner at McDonald’s was a treat for Sef Gonzalez . \nIt meant it was Thursday night — the night his mother got out of work early from her job as a doctor’s office assistant, and his family could dine out together. \nNot that they could splurge. His grandparents, parents and he and his sister were still packed together in their Westchester home just as they had been when he was a baby in upper Manhattan, where his grandparents settled after fleeing Cuba in the 1950s. \nThursdays, though, when Mom was home early and his father wasn’t delivering Wise potato chips on his Hialeah route, was family time. \n“It was important that we got to spend that time together,” Gonzalez said. “The bonding of a family around a dinner table, I don’t know if it really happens anymore.” \nIt wasn’t always McDonald’s. Sometimes it was Lums or Latin American Cuban restaurant or the Burger King at Flagler and 87th Avenue. Only one thing was certain: Sef was having a burger. \n“The rest of the family would eat things other than burgers,” he said. “Any place I saw a burger on the menu — and it’s still that way today — I have to have the burger.” \nThat’s a long way of answering the question of why Gonzalez, a St. Brendan grad who went on start a popular Miami food blog, eponymously titled The Burger Beast, decided to open a burger museum in Miami — the first of its kind in the United States. \nThe Burger Museum by Burger Beast opens Friday at the Magic City Casino, where Gonzalez hosts regular food truck rallies that bring street-food lovers from all parts of South Florida to this forgotten spot in central Miami. McDonald’s will be serving burgers on site, including their new versions of the Big Mac. \nThe 1,200-square-foot museum houses more than 2,000 items Gonzalez has collected over the past seven years. More than 500 other items still in storage will be used to rotate the collection. \nYou’ll find more than burgers represented here. That much is clear from the moment you step inside to find an oil painting of Alice Cooper sitting on a throne of White Castle hamburgers. The Burger Museum tells the story of the way Miami restaurants, from fast-food chains to beloved family-owned spots, have evolved in parallel with the city. And it’s not tchotchkes and bric-a-brac. \nYou’ll find images and uniforms from Royal Castle, which was founded in South Florida and headquartered in Hialeah. Blueprints of the first Burger King here. Pristine waitress uniforms from Krystal Hamburger, dating back to the 1940s. Styrofoam containers from the original Burger King Whopper and the double-headed container for the forgotten McDonald’s McDLT. (Remember? Hot on one side, cool on the other.) \nRemember, too, the castle-like El Cid restaurant on Le Jeune Road, an iconic building that has long ago been razed? Gonzalez has historical photos and memorabilia of the place. Further down, there’s a classic stained glass lamp and part of a Wendy’s salad bar next to a photo of Dave Thomas eating a salad under the very items, donated by the Ohio-based company. \n“It was great to see so many of the old photos and memorabilia,” said McDonald’s franchisee Peter Menendez Jr., 37, who grew up in the business with this father and got a sneak peek of the museum. “It’s a really unique walk down food memory lane.” \nAnd it all started with a sign from a Burger Chef restaurant a friend gave him years ago. \nHis collection grew, and not by design. Gonzalez has an appetite for history. His blog went from becoming strictly reviews of local burgers and restaurants to a place Gonzalez could tell stories about Miami’s favorite or forgotten historical markers. \nGonzalez wants the Burger Museum to be something that the Miami in the glitzy brochure is not: authentic. When someone comes to South Florida to visit, he doesn’t point them to the trendy areas. \nHe sends them to Finka (started by the granddaughter of the Islas Canarias founders) in West Kendall, Latin House on Sunset Drive and La Fresa Francesa (a French restaurant founded by a Monsignor Pace High graduate) in Hialeah. \n“I don’t delve into Wynwood, and I don’t delve into the Beach. I don’t delve into areas that are overexposed,” he said. “I feel this area is underexposed.” \nThe museum is the kind of place where you could spend 10 minutes or four hours and walk out having learned something you never knew about Miami. \n“We’re happy to hitch our wagon to him,” said Izzy Havenick, whose family owns the casino. “We’re happy to be the bacon to his cheeseburger.” \nGonzalez opened the doors for a few hours last week for friends and family and watched them recall their childhoods. \n“I want something that evokes emotions in people, and that’s what the museum does,” Gonzalez said. “I want them to love this as much as I do.” \nPart historian, part entertainer, Gonzalez has both in his blood. His paternal grandfather (Serafin, for whom he and his father are named) was a lucha libre wrestler married to a flamenco dancer. A horror movie buff who once owned a macabre-looking movie rental store in Westchester called Oh, The Horror, Gonzalez makes his own house look like Halloween for Christmas. (Think creepy baby doll heads hanging from a black Christmas tree.) \nYears ago, he thought he might start a horror movie museum. He even bought a book about how to open one. It sat mostly unread in his bathroom magazine rack for more than a decade until he stumbled upon it earlier this year. \nInstead, Gonzalez invested nearly $100,000 of his own money into the Burger Museum, taking no outside investors other than an online campaign that raised $10,000. \nTo show for it, he’s got his burger museum. It sits by the entrance of a casino in a working class neighborhood, where it is bizarre and incongruous and perfectly Miami. \n“I get asked a lot why would I open a burger museum. And my question to you is why wouldn’t I?” he said. “I have an obsession with burgers. I have an obsession with history. This is the best of both worlds.” \nCarlos Frías: 305-376-4624 , @Carlos_Frias \nIf you go \nWhat: The Burger Museum by Burger Beast, a collection of more than 2,000 burger- and restaurant-related pieces of memorabilia. \nWhere: Magic City Casino, 450 NW 37th Ave., Miami \nWhen: Opens Friday. Hours will be noon to 8 p.m. Thursday through Sunday. \nTickets: Admission is $10 adults and $5 for children \nThe Original Slider by Sef Gonzalez, aka The Burger Beast \n4 2-ounce balls of 80/20 ground chuck \n1 yellow onion, sliced thinly on mandolin \n4 slices American cheese \n4 potato rolls (I use Martin’s) \nKosher salt to taste \nDill pickle slices \nMustard \nGrab the 2-ounce balls of 80/20 chuck and place them onto a flat-top or griddle on medium-high heat. Place thin onion slices on the ball, and smash into griddle until it resembles a beautifully deformed burger patty. Add a pinch of salt. After cooking for about four minutes, flip the burger with the onions against the griddle. As it’s approaching a medium-well temperature, about another three minutes, place a slice of American cheese on it. When the cheese begins to melt, place the bottom bun on the patty followed by the top bun. This technique is used to steam the buns. When the onions reach a brownish color, it’s ready. Set aside top bun. Flip the burger with a spatula with bottom bun on (where the cheese is now on the bottom, the browned onions on top). Add a couple of dill pickle slices and a dollop of yellow mustard. Place top bun onto the slider and serve. \nYield: 2-4 sliders",

Aniah Ferguson was warned by a Brooklyn judge to behave at her program or face up to 15 years in prison. (Barry Williams/for New York Daily News) \n“In two weeks if this continues, I’ll pull you out. I don’t want you or the staff or the other patients to get hurt,\" said Riviezzo during a Nov. 2 court appearance. \nBut Ferguson defied the judge’s orders — and was remanded to Rikers Island. \nAssistant District Attorney Janet Gleeson noted her objections with Ferguson receiving psychiatric help over jail time since Dec. 2015 for beating 16-year-old Ariana Taylor inside a Flatbush Ave. McDonalds in March 2015. Front page of the New York Daily News for March 13, 2015 (New York Daily News) \nThe caught-on-camera incident depicted Ferguson carelessly sporting a purple bra as several other girls stomping and kicking Taylor who coward on the linoleum floor. \nFerguson’s violent history at the time of her arrest for the gang assault included abusing her grandmother as well as an open case with child protective services for stabbing her brother.

      "text": "Read Article \nCHICAGO — McDonald’s said Tuesday it is expanding a test of fresh beef burgers after a trial run in Texas got a positive response. The world’s largest burger chain’s experimentation is part of its effort to change the public’s perception of its food quality and freshness. \nThe fresh beef test, which had been at 55 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now has expanded to include 75 restaurants across northeast Oklahoma. The test of never-frozen beef only includes Quarter Pounder patties, not the smaller patties that come on hamburgers and Big Macs. \nFresh beef represents a huge opportunity for McDonald’s but also a substantial risk. It means a big change to the process of food delivery and preparation. Share",

On January 13, the company will host a stream in which it will reveal an exact launch date, price, and offer previews of launch titles—one of which may or may not be The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.   4:27 PM Only in the UK and no actual toys?

      "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. ( KSNT ) – A Topeka McDonald’s employee who put mustard into a Topeka Police Officer’s drink has been fired after a lengthy investigation by the cooperation. The District Attorney’s Office is opening a criminal investigation into the matter.\nIt all started with a photo shared on Facebook showing a law enforcement officer’s soda at a Topeka McDonald’s mixed with mustard has gone viral.\nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!”\nThe incident reportedly happened at the McDonald’s located at 2001 North Topeka Boulevard.\nSupervisor at the McDonald’s, Gary Vaughn, tells KSNT News the issue has been handled internally but would not elaborate on what that meant.\nTom and Marilyn Dobski of McDonald’s Franchisees in Topeka released the following statement.\n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.”\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol tells KSNT News this happened to one of their trooper’s about two weeks ago at the same location.",

(AP) — McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "Reality Rocks ‘The Voice’ Top 10 Night: God Bless the Child Named Wé McDonald Lyndsey Parker Yahoo Music November 29, 2016 Monday’s Voice top 10 competitive episode was one of the best in recent memory, with Christian Cuevas, Brendan Fletcher, and Sundance Head all delivering phenomenal, even potentially gamechanging performances. But breaking up that Season 11 boys’ club was old girl wonder Wé McDonald, who continued to step up her own game and prove that her memorably awesome Blind Audition was absolutely not a fluke. This 17-year-old has a one-Wé ticket to the finale, for sure.\nLet’s get to the recap!\nBilly Gilman (Team Adam)\nAdam Levine described ex-country child star Billy’s Martina McBride cover this week as a “return to his roots.” (McBride was instrumental in helping Billy land a Sony Nashville record deal when he was just 10 years old.) Billy, who’s been trying to reinvent himself as some sort of vague pop star all season with varying degrees of success, made a point of saying the Martina song was Adam’s idea. Adam then called Billy the most “diverse” contestant this season — which was a backhanded-complimentary way of saying Billy has been all over the place this season. Billy has covered Adele (twice), Rachel Platten, Roy Orbison, and even Queen, and while he’s been vocally stellar every time, his inability to consistently define himself could ultimately be his undoing on The Voice . Will the real Billy Gilman please stand up?\nPerhaps Adam knew McBride’s “Anyway,” grandly backed by an orchestra, was the right song at the right time, in this all-important first double-elimination week of the season. It’s a popular song, a sentimental and inspirational song that mentions God — and it’s a country song, which, frankly, is probably what Billy’s diehard fans have wanted to hear from him all along. As Blake Shelton later told Billy: “I’m happy to see you go back to the well… country music, that’s still what I think of you.”\nBilly admittedly sang the hell out of “Anyway,” but I actually preferred him doing Adele’s “All I Ask” last week, which felt more authentic and connected than this autopilot performance of a song Billy probably knows all too well. However, I am sure America will adore “Anyway,” which Adam called a “remarkable feat.” Miley Cyrus spent most of her critique time babbling about Alicia Keys’s turtleneck, for some reason, but she did eventually call Billy “maybe the winner” of Season 11. And maybe Billy will win. I just don’t know what kind of album he’ll release after that.\nCourtney Harrell (Team Blake)\nI’m not sure why Blake thought Courtney needed a “big ‘80s moment” this week, when her other retro power ballads of the season (Roxette, Aerosmith) have been embarrassing, plodding mistakes. Why hasn’t Courtney, a music biz veteran, ever covered one of the modern R&B/pop hits that she actually co-wrote ? But, no. Instead, this Monday she bafflingly performed “If I Could Turn Back Time” by former Team Blake mentor Cher.\nUgh . Honestly, if Courtney really could turn back time, she should probably go back and choose a different song.\nFirst, the positive — because if these singing shows have taught us anything, it’s that if you can’t say something nice about a contestant’s performance, you can always compliment that contestant’s clothes. So, yes, Courtney looked fierce. She wasn’t wearing a sailor-baiting see-through bodysuit (much to the relief of NBC censors, I am sure), but she was rocking a whole lotta leather that did NOT look like it came from Kohl’s, paired with a sculptural Grace Jones hairdo. The Voice stylists did a good job with her this week.\nBut Courtney’s voice ? That was not so fierce. In the verses, she wavered, with her lines awkwardly trailing off. And whenever she let out a wild rock ‘n’ roll scream, it was off-key and unpleasant. Alicia and Miley seemed too distracted by the onstage pyro to say much about Courtney’s lack of vocal fireworks, but Alicia offered some bland, diplomatic praise. Blake seemed more excited, raving, “A new contestant just stepped into the top 10! Your stage presence and personality just came out like never before.”\nI agreed to some extent: Courtney looked and acted like a star, albeit a star circa 1989. She just didn’t sound like a star — from any decade. She’s going to be in big trouble this week.\nJosh Gallagher (Team Adam)\nI don’t know why I keep hoping, week after week, that Josh will finally take a risk. I guess I thought after his previous predictable Brett Eldredge karaoke performance was one of last week’s lowest iTunes-charters, he might try to rejigger his game plan this week. But instead he again played it super-safe, and did “Real Good Man” by Season 11 advisor Tim McGraw. Sigh .\nRead More I will say, Josh’s “Real Good Man” was pretty good. Real good, even. He performed with more gusto, confidence, personality, and even sex appeal than he ever had before. But I think Josh has shown is all he can do this season. He has no surprises left in him — if he ever had any in him to begin with, that is. This simply wasn’t the performance he needed to catapult him to the finale that is taking place in just two short weeks.\nAlicia and Blake disagreed with me, however. “That was fantastic… I felt like you were really in your element,” said Alicia. “I’m so happy for you… tonight, a country star was on that stage,” said Blake. We will see if America agrees.\nAaron Gibson (Team Miley)\nAlong with Courtney, Aaron is the most at-risk contestant this week, since he’s been in the bottom two twice already. Both times, he was Instant-Saved by America with more than 70 percent of the public Twitter vote — so clearly some viewers out there like the guy. But as Miley noted, Aaron’s “Save Me” songs have been poppier than his mopey Monday-night song choices by the likes of Nine Inch Nails and Father John Misty. So this week she decided to lighten things up, by assigning Aaron Elton John’s “Rocket Man,” a song everyone knows and loves.\nThis was a smart choice, in theory, but Aaron’s jazzy, jammy “Rocket Man” wasn’t exactly explosive. It was so laid-back — maybe even a little bit lazy — that I thought I was watching an episode of SNL ’s “The Mellow Show” or maybe a semifinals Phillip Phillips performance from American Idol .\nThere was nothing bad about this, but I missed Aaron’s darkness, his edge, his sense of menace. Apparently that’s not what most Voice viewers want to see and hear, but I always thought Aaron stood out, in a good way, from this season’s shiny, happy singers.\nAdam, a longtime avowed Aaron fan, may have been equally underwhelmed — or maybe he just sees the writing on the NBC Studios wall at this point — because his critique sounded like one long passive-aggressive goodbye. “Regardless of how you go on from here, I just feel that you’re establishing yourself… I’m a fan of yours, and I’m going to be after the show,” Adam said, congratulating Aaron for even making it into the top 10 at all. Welp .\nChristian Cuevas (Team Alicia)\nChristian may have crooned, “You’re giving me a million reasons to quit the show” — but quitting is the only way he’ll be leaving The Voice in the near future, after this script-flipping tour de force. Now, this was an example of the right contestant singing the right song at exactly the right time. Passionately belting Lady Gaga’s countrified Joanne ballad “Million Reasons,” Christian seemed more connected to his material than he had in weeks — certainly more so than when he confusingly dedicated breakup songs like Coldplay’s “The Scientist” and Toto’s “Rosanna” to his fiancée, Elaine. (Actually, Christian may be trying to tell Elaine something. “Million Reasons” is a breakup song, too!) Finally, Christian, on the brink of tears by the song’s tastefully restrained but earnest ending, seemed to be paying attention to meaning behind his lyrics.\nAnd boy, did Christian have a moment here. Even presumably neutral host Carson Daly had to interject some praise, declaring, “When you get a performance like this on the show, things can change .” Blake added, “We’ve been waiting for that incredible moment, and I think you may have just had it.”\nEven Lady Gaga herself was impressed:\nGo @ccuevasmusic you've got my vote! https://t.co/l4vUXHNghA https://t.co/WwDQPRN6mY\n— xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) November 29, 2016\nAnd proud Alicia, who’d been joyously testifying during Christian’s performance and was probably already mentally clearing some mantel space in her mansion for her first fist-shaped Voice trophy, said, “That’s what an artist does… Tonight, an artist was born.” I expect a very high iTunes position for Christian this week. Heck, he might even help Gaga’s Joanne album inch its way back up the charts. This was that good.\nAustin Allsup (Team Blake)\nAustin has established himself as the lanky country outlaw of Season 11, so it was interesting this week that he did John Waite’s soft-rocker “Missing You” in a dinner-theater blazer and slicked teen-idol hair. To be honest, I was missing Austin’s true grit; this was a little milquetoast compared to his past fiery performances like last week’s intense, Seger-sanctioned “Turn the Page.” And his vocals were a little goaty, though that may have been because he was sick this week.\nBut, overall, this was an ‘80s cover song that I could get behind. The cry-in-your-beer heartbreak lyrics worked well with Austin’s storyteller delivery and within the country genre in general, and Austin seemed sincere. “Congratulations on taking classic song and making it your own, man. That’s hard to do,” marveled Blake.\n“I just got teary-eyed… When I believe somebody and what they’re saying, I put myself in their shoes and in those lyrics… I really believed you, and it was really powerful,” gushed Miley, before getting distracted by Austin’s daughter’s cute pom-pom headband. I personally got distracted by the Adam Lambert sighting that took place shortly thereafter. (Adam was sitting in the studio audience with last season’s winner, his BFF Alisan Porter.) I just hope viewers don’t get distracted by flashier performances this week and forget to vote for Austin. He truly deserves to be in the top eight.\nWé McDonald (Team Alicia)\nGod bless this 17-year-old child. She sang “God Bless the Child,” and she was giving me some baby-J.Hud realness. She was adlibbing. She was sassing and stankfacing. She was calling-and-responding. Damn ! Wé had total command of the stage. This felt like a Grammy-night performance from start to big, big finish.\nWé was, granted, doing a lot — from the attitudinal talky bits to those crazy Mariah-high opera notes. Lesser contestants might not have been able pull off something so bold and ambitious; it would have felt forced, affected, inauthentic, trying-too-hard. But Wé made it all look and sound charming and effortless. I loved every second of this. It might go down in history as one of the best Voice performances of all time, or at least of Season 11.\n“There’s nobody like you, period,” proclaimed an elated Alicia. “It’s just really a beautiful thing to appreciate and to honor the way that you’re bringing so much to it. There’s so many different sides of who you are — the opera side and the jazz side and the soul side and the pop side and the individual side.” Then Alicia added, “ There is no boundary for you ” — with Adam Lambert in the audience! Serious American Idol Season 8 flashbacks, there. (Let’s just hope if Wé wins and she gets her own coronation song, it’s better than “No Boundaries.” Please .)\nBrendan Fletcher (Team Adam)\nCyndi Lauper’s “True Colors” is a song that can make me cry. ( Here’s proof .) So I knew when Adam suggested that Brendan sing an “earthy,” “superorganic” version in the gruff-but-soulful style of his everyman idol, Bruce Springsteen, I’d soon be reduced to a blubbering saline puddle. Brendan’s rendition was so tender, so vulnerable and earnest; he made me feel every lump-in-throat syllable of Lauper’s sweet lyrics.\nWow. I cannot believe I ever wrote this guy off as some filler contestant who’d never make it past the Battles. Now that he’s showing his true colors on this show, I could actually see Brendan making it to the finale.\n“You just sang about a rainbow! I’m so happy… You just made ‘True Colors,’ which I never really thought about — and your version of it, specifically — my new favorite song that I’m going to listen to on repeat… I can’t wait to download that,” raved Miley. “We talk a lot about how The Voice has all this bombast and big giant things and explosions and fireworks, and those are great. We love that. But you’re the first artist this season to take a song and artistically create a version that didn’t exist before,” said Adam. I don’t know if that’s entirely true — Austin and especially Sundance have had some pretty creative moments this season — but I am predicting a big iTunes showing for Brendan this week.\nSundance Head (Team Blake)\nIt’s hard to believe that cross-network reality TV history might be made in two weeks’ time, when a former American Idol contestant just might win The Voice . Sundance competed on Idol 10 years ago and wasn’t quite ready for prime time then, although he did make it to the top 16. This year, I see him easily making The Voice ’s top four. His knee-slapping, hooting-and-hollering, barn-storming rendition of Tom T. Hall’s “Me and Jesus” was an enjoyable bluegrass romp (“We might have a religious moshpit,” Sundance joked), and it was the triumphant performance of an Opry-worthy star.\n“You got my heart, and I think you will take people’s heart wherever you go… bluegrass, the blues, gospel, country, soul, it’s all in that same wheelhouse… I think that’s such a beautiful message the way that music just brings us all together no matter what,” said Alicia. “We’ve never experienced any kind of performance like that ever, in 11 seasons of doing this show,” raved a hyperbolic Blake. Again, I’m not so sure about that statement. But I do believe that Sundance’s time is now .\nAli Caldwell (Team Miley)\nAli faltered last week with an ill-advisedly chosen novelty song, Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5,” that fell entirely outside the iTunes top 200. Luckily, the former frontrunner survived to sing another week — and this week, in the pimp spot doing what she called a “back-to-basics” performance, she earned back some of her early hype.\nBelting the Mariah Carey powerhouse version of Badfinger’s “Without You” in a pink, princessy, Gwyneth-goes-to-the-Oscars gown, while standing in backlit cloud of smoke, Ali was pure drama, pure talent. This was an old-fashioned performance, yes, but not in a hokey way — this felt classic . And classy. And Ali’s vocal was master-class perfect . At this point, it’s unclear if Ali can regain her momentum after some of this season’s boys — Christian, Sundance, Brendan — have made such stridesand upstaged her. But this was the go-for-broke, swing-for-the-fences performances she needed right now.\n“I haven’t seen anything like Ali in my life. I’m so honored to be your coach. Every time I sit here and watch you perform, it takes me back to the Blinds, when you chose me. That was my first time on this show, and I felt like I had won — just by Ali choosing me as her coach,” Miley began. “My goal in my life isn’t just to make you the biggest star in the world, because you already are . I just want to see you shine the way you deserve to. You are so incredible.”\nSo who is in trouble this double-elimination week? That prediction is glaringly obvious. Barring any major shocker upset, it seems Courtney and Aaron have little chance of surviving this week. Rounding out the bottom three will probably be Josh, who didn’t take enough of a risk this Monday, or Austin, who may have taken too much of a risk — but either of those guys will likely win Tuesday’s Instant Save Twitter vote.\nTune in Tuesday to see if I’m right, when the top 10 become the top eight.\nFollow Lyndsey on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google+ , Amazon , Tumblr , Spotify",

      "text": "CHICAGO — McDonald’s said Tuesday it is expanding a test of fresh beef burgers after a trial run in Texas got a positive response. The world’s largest burger chain’s experimentation is part of its effort to change the public’s perception of its food quality and freshness.\nThe fresh beef test, which had been at 55 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now has expanded to include 75 restaurants across northeast Oklahoma. The test of never-frozen beef only includes Quarter Pounder patties, not the smaller patties that come on hamburgers and Big Macs.\nFresh beef represents a huge opportunity for McDonald’s but also a substantial risk. It means a big change to the process of food delivery and preparation. But McDonald’s has shown willingness over the past two years to make big changes to its food to improve still-sluggish foot traffic, and to draw in a younger crowd that prefers “better burger” rivals like Shake Shack, Epic Burger or Five Guys. Wendy’s also has been ramping up marketing efforts recently behind its own fresh beef.\nIt’s not clear how long the fresh beef test will last before the chain will consider offering it at restaurants nationwide, or if that will happen at all.\n",

It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered.\nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area.\nMcDonald’s says it has making “significant enhancements” to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter.\nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.\n\n",

Gottfried , Staff Writer, @sophiafgott 8:43 p.m. EST November 29, 2016 The 17-year-old from Paterson continues dominating THE VOICE -- \"Blind Auditions\" -- Pictured: We' McDonald -- (Photo by: Tyler Golden/NBC) (Photo: NBC, Tyler Golden/NBC) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWé McDonald just clinched her spot in the semifinals of \"The Voice.\" The 17-year-old contender continued to show off her mature and versatile voice on Monday night's performance show, blowing away both the judges and the audience with a cover of Billie Holiday's \"God Bless the Child,\" and was saved midway through Tuesday night's live results show. She is one of eight remaining contestants. \nThe Paterson resident, who's been mentored by coach Alicia Keys all season and has trained in classical singing since childhood, threw her own style into the jazz classic, doing a call-and-response with the audience, adding commentary at the beginning of her song and ending with some operatic notes. Her cover, as of the start of Tuesday night's show, reached number eight on the iTunes chart. \nAfter McDonald's performance Monday night, judge Alicia Keys declared: “There’s nobody like you!” \nMcDonald, who graduated from Passaic County Technical Institute in Wayne last year, told The Record earlier this year that Billie Holiday, among other classic artists, is one of her greatest influences. The William Paterson freshman will continue to compete for the show's top spot and a record deal. \nEliminations are decided by fans, who vote via Twitter, the show’s official app, and by buying music from the show on iTunes to save their favorite artists. \n“The Voice” will continue to air Monday and Tuesday nights at 8.

In many cities the protesters blocked busy intersections. \nIn Chicago, hundreds of protesters at O'Hare International Airport chanted outside terminals: \"What do we want? $15! When do we want it? Now!\" Police gated an area to allow travelers room to walk. As many as 500 workers at the airport participated in an unfair labor practices strike, according to officials from Service Employees International Union Local 1 who have been organizing the workers. \n\"We're not asking for special treatment, we're asking for decent treatment. We're asking for decent wages,\" said Kisha Rivera, an airplane cabin cleaner at O'Hare. \"We're demanding respect.\" \nThousands planned to walk off the job at McDonald's restaurants, organizers said. The efforts are part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. \nIn New Jersey, airport workers marched between two terminals at Newark Liberty International Airport. Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka has called on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour at its facilities and take steps to hire more Newark residents. \nAt a McDonald's in Denver, about 100 people, including about 60 striking fast food workers from around the metro area, picketed. Protesters briefly shut down a downtown St. Louis McDonald's restaurant, blocking the drive-thru for about 30 minutes. In Massachusetts, a state senator was among nearly three dozen people arrested after they sat down on a Cambridge street during a demonstration. \nAbout 25 of the 350 protesters in New York City were arrested. One protester, Flavia Cabral, 55, struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs. \n\"All these people don't have savings because we're working check to check,\" Cabral said. \"We have to decide what we are going to get: We're going to pay rent or we're going to put food on the table or we're going to send my child to school.\" \nDetroit police say they arrested about 40 protesters who blocked traffic. In the San Francisco Bay Area, ride-hailing drivers, fast-food employees, airport workers and others shut down an Oakland intersection. \nRaising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $12 would lift pay for 35 million workers, or 1 in 4 employees nationwide, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \nThe conservative-leaning, nonprofit Employment Policies Institute think tank said it believes minimum wage increases will result in lost jobs, reduced hours and business closures.

      "text": "Pinterest \nProtests took place across the country recently in the “fight for $15” movement with dozens of people arrested, according to ABC News . Thousands of McDonald’s employees planned to stage a walkout according to organizers. The walkout is part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15, but as we have reported here at TFPP, there are some big problems with their plans. \nABC News reported : \nFast-food restaurant workers and home and child-care workers rallied in cities including Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and New York. In many cities the protesters blocked busy intersections. \nIn Chicago, hundreds of protesters at O’Hare International Airport were outside terminals chanting “What do we want? $15! When do we want it? Now!” Police gated an area to allow travelers room to walk. As many as 500 workers at the airport planned to strike. \nAt a McDonald’s in Denver, about 100 people, including about 60 striking fast food workers from around the metro area, picketed. Protesters briefly shut down a downtown St. Louis McDonald’s restaurant, blocking the drive-thru for about 30 minutes. In Massachusetts, a state senator was among nearly three dozen people arrested after they sat down on a Cambridge street during a demonstration. \nWe recently reported here at TFPP : \nMcDonald’s restaurants have announced plans to implement automated kiosks, and some of these cities that have already adopted the kiosks have a noteworthy correlation — the fight for a $15/hr minimum wage. \nAlthough McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook told The New York Times that this wouldn’t mean that jobs would get cut, but rather that employees would be “redeployed,” the correlation between the fight for an increased minimum wage and the automation is important. \nAs we reported, McDonald’s restaurants have begun to look to automation that will eventually replace low-wage workers — despite the company claiming otherwise. \nThere is an issue in this country with a lack of good, decent-paying jobs. There is no doubt about that. It is also frustrating to many that companies who can pay a decent wage for labor — and make no mistake, just because someone is low-skilled, that doesn’t mean their labor shouldn’t be respected — don’t. \nThat said, the answer almost assuredly isn’t government intervention via an artificially inflated minimum wage — especially not on a federal level. \nThese protesters that are fighting for the minimum wage have likely not thought through the consequences and those consequences involve losing their jobs altogether. \nAn artificial increase in the minimum wage without further regulation that would bar companies from moving to automation or passing off the costs onto consumers would almost assuredly be the end of many jobs. In addition, the last thing this country needs is more regulation and for the government to get their grubby hands in the free market like that would be disastrous. \nInstead, these $15/hr protesters should be behind what Trump has proposed: bringing back and keeping good jobs here in America. In conjunction, we need to make sure that Americans are getting the training they need to fill these jobs, instead of bringing people in from overseas to fill them. \nIt would be far more productive to bring back good jobs and make sure that Americans are prepared for these jobs than to artificially inflate wages. \nFor all the bleeding-heart liberals out there — start a business, take the pay cut and spread the profits around without increasing the cost to consumers (or do so and see what happens) and see if you can survive. That would be a better use of your time than trying to inflate a wage across the board that will likely put people out of work. \nOnce again, the left shows that they don’t care about the welfare of the people they claim to “champion”; rather, they care about power and their agenda.",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) \nNEW YORK (AP) — About 25 people participating in a nationwide minimum-wage protest were arrested Tuesday in Manhattan after they linked arms and sat in a street. \nThey were among about 350 people at a peaceful rally, part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. The campaign seeks higher hourly wages, including for workers at fast-food restaurants and airports. \nParticipants chanted, \"We shall not be moved\" and waved signs that said, \"We won't back down\" and \"Strike for $15 and our future.\" \nDemocratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation in April that will gradually raise New York's minimum wage to $15. \nOne protester, 55-year-old Flavia Cabral, struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs. \n\"All these people don't have savings because we're working check to check,\" Cabral said. \"We have to decide what we are going to get: We're going to pay rent or we're going to put food on the table or we're going to send my child to school.\" \nCabral, who's originally from the Dominican Republic, said she was especially concerned about her children's education. \n\"No family has money saved to send their children to school. I'm one of them,\" she said, adding that one of her daughters dropped out and she's concerned about keeping her other daughter in school. \nFast-food worker Alvin Major, 51, said he supports four children and a wife recovering from cancer. \n\"Fifteen dollars is just a number,\" he said. \"If we could get one dollar and one dollar could take care of our health care, housing, food and everything, that's what we need.\" \nThe Employment Policies Institute, a conservative economic think tank, issued a statement in response to the protests, saying dramatic minimum-wage increases result in lost jobs, reduced hours and business closures. \nThe minimum wage will rise to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018 and in some prosperous suburbs by the end of 2021. It will rise to $12.50 in the rest of the state by 2020, eventually reaching $15. \n___ \nAssociated Press photographer Mark Lennihan contributed to this report. Tags",

(AP) — McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "Wé McDonald (Team Alicia) Josh Gallagher (Team Adam) \nPredictably, that left two from Blake Shelton’s squad on the chopping block — rock-country crooner Austin Allsup and veteran songwriter Courtney Harrell — along with Aaron Gibson, who’s amassed a ton of experience fighting his way back from the bottom. \nAll three singers had poor performances last night, thanks to some ill-advised song selections across the board, but tonight each of them turns that trend around and mics up with something flattering. What they accomplish with their numbers of the night, however, is a mixed bag. Austin Allsup (Team Blake) \n“Tennessee Whiskey” by Chris Stapleton \nBlake Shelton is right to say that what Austin Allsup brings to his genre is something that’s not common to it right now. His steely sound isn’t altogether new, of course; Robert Plant and John Fogerty come to mind as possible inspirations for his tone. But what he does, he does well most of the time. As for tonight, it’s a good idea in theory for him to tackle a song that’s right there in his musical wheelhouse, but there are some moments where he falls just as flat as he did last night, which is what landed him in this position in the first place. He almost sounds stuffed-up in some moments; even when he throws in some colorful pulls and tugs at the feel-strings by giving a shout-out to his wife afterwards, it’s otherwise very forgettable, unfortunately. Courtney Harrell (Team Blake) \n“Bless the Broken Road” by Rascal Flatts \nThere are a couple of reasons why this song choice was, in theory, a pitch-perfect way for Courtney Harrell to state her case for the Top 8. It’s a crowd-pleaser, especially for the country wedding song-loving collective who might be tempted to vote for her teammate/competitor, and, frankly, it’s melodically the exact opposite of what was happening last night with her chaotic callback to the ’80s. If only Courtney had chosen to let the song rest in its original, soft form, rather than throwing in so many oohs and ahhs of extra , this might’ve been a convincing showcase. If only. Aaron Gibson (Team Miley) \n“Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright” by Bob Dylan \nHow does he do it? After last night’s decimation of an Elton John favorite (plus the fact he’s been in the bottom-two barrel two weeks in a row before tonight), I was ready to write Aaron Gibson off. But all that time spent in this position must’ve erased any jitters he might’ve had about performing in this moment, because his rendition of this song is filled with the precise notes of “come what may” and easy style add-ins that make his attachment to it completely convincing. Voters might’ve also been convinced by the fact he brought coach Miley Cyrus to actual tears with his light, but still raw performance — and Adam Levine’s decision to step in and insist Aaron Gibson was the one who deserved to go through didn’t hurt. And with that, we’ve all forgotten just how WTF his showing last night was. Well played, indeed. \nThe percentage ticker from the commercial break shows it became a real race between Austin and Aaron with viral voters, but Aaron ultimately prevails with yet another crunch-time number gone right. \nAs for the night’s cast-offs, they seem like they’ll be okay. Austin’s parting words to coach Blake Shelton express his gratitude for being given his single-turn in the blinds and for coaching him this far, while Courtney Harrell’s lapping even more thanks upon Blake for helping her realize she doesn’t just belong in the writer’s room for these songs anymore. \nGulp. Things are gonna get even more intense from here. Will Aaron Gibson’s surprise momentum from tonight take him even further than this? Gah, at this point, you certainly can’t count the kid out. I predict next week he’ll turn to a Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews Band, or Phillip Phillips hit to just go ahead and seal the deal on his audio-doppelgänger awareness factor. \nFINAL STANDINGS: Team Adam — Billy Gilman, Josh Gallagher, Brendan Fletcher Team Alicia — Christian Cuevas, Wé McDonald Team Blake — Sundance Head ",

      "title": "Whistleblower Site Calls McDonald's 'The Fraud Of The Century'",
      "text": "A whistleblower website, under the copyright © Justice-pour-tous.org, has targeted McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD ) CEO Steve Easterbrook , calling the multinational corporation the \"new Volkswagen\" and \"the fraud of the century.\"\nThe website’s URL, steve-easterbrook.com , is aimed at informing McDonald’s investors about illegal business practices and investigations the company is undergoing in Europe.\nThe whistleblower site focuses heavily on the fast-food chain’s questionable marketing practices surrounding its highly popular Monopoly game, particularly in France, McDonald’s second biggest market.\nThe website makes many bold claims against McDonald's, going as far as to say Easterbrook should face trial, stating, “He knew about the fraud, he had the power to make it stop, he didn't.\"\nThe site continued, \"It's also our upmost [ sic ] conviction that Mr. Easterbrook has deliberately misled investors by omitting to warn them about the very serious legal issues the company was facing in Europe.”\nManipulative Psychology At Play? According to the site, France’s Monopoly game was “radically transformed” in 2016. It claims the game violates the European Union Directive on unfair commercial practices through misleading and aggressive marketing by creating psychological effects in the mind of the consumer causes causing them to spend more money.\n“Our brand remains strong in France, successful monopoly promotions, along with the introduction of new premium products are increasing average check,” said Easterbrook in an interview in early 2016.\nCivil Action The website claims that civil action against McDonald’s was filed on November 15, 2016. They are also working on a class-action suit in France and have filed a complaint with the SEC.\n“We strongly believe that once the French authorities truly realize the extent of the frauds McDonald's has committed over the years, they will notify their European counterparts and it will trigger investigations everywhere in Europe. These investigations will unavoidably lead to hefty fines and quite possibly prison sentences for some executives,” the site added.\nWhile this isn’t the first time people have questioned the legitimacy of McDonald’s Monopoly game, it appears unlikely that the case will cause much if any threat to one of the world’s biggest corporations.\nImage Credit: By Katy Warner from Orlando, FL, USA (I'm lovin' it (10-07-08) Uploaded by LongLiveRock) [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n ",

      "text": "\nAfter months of various individuals claiming it was a bad idea, McDonald’s has responded to the fight for a $15 minimum wage with a plan to replace cashiers at every single one of their 14,000 stores with automated touch-screen kiosks. In an attempt to try to get employees more money, all the fight for a $15 minimum wage is going to accomplish is costing a lot of people their job.\nPer The New American , the fight for a $15 minimum wage has backfired as McDonald’s plans on starting with stores in locations where minimum-wage laws mandate the highest rates. This includes New York, Florida, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Washington D.C. In time, however, McDonald’s plans to replace cashiers at all of their stores with automated touch-screen kiosks. After all, it is cheaper to have a robot take orders than to pay cashiers the $15 minimum wage they were fighting for.\nThanks To 'Fight For $15' Minimum Wage, McDonald's Unveils Job-Replacing Self-Service Kiosks Nationwide via @forbes https://t.co/pIQBXQaZUj \n— Joshua Yasmeh (@JoshYaz) November 30, 2016 \n\nIn April of 2016, Ed Rensi – a man who had worked for the company for three decades and served as USA President for the company – warned that the fight for a $15 minimum wage would backfire . Per Forbes , Rensi did not believe the fight for a $15 minimum wage would cause any harm to the company. He did – however – believe it would wipe out thousands of entry level jobs. He believed this would cause a lot of people to lose their jobs without many other options to turn to.\nHow did the fight for a $15 minimum wage backfire? Well, it starts with automation. Ed Rensi, per Forbes , claimed that he and many other experts in the industry warned that demanding a higher minimum wage would force businesses with smaller profit margins to replace some of their full-service employees with some self-service alternatives. At the time, the employees who were heading the fight for the $15 minimum wage claimed the business owners were crying wolf. Turns out they weren’t.\nDespite hundreds of arrests, striking workers remain undaunted in fight for $15 minimum wage https://t.co/iX4vneUFYj #fightfor15 pic.twitter.com/feNZQrEexT \n— Truthdig (@Truthdig) November 29, 2016 \n\nIt was earlier this month that McDonald’s first announced the company would be rolling out touch-screen self-service kiosks in all stores across the nation. It is worth noting that it isn’t just McDonald’s turning towards technology that is replacing the jobs of actual people, several different restaurants – including both fast food and full service – are looking at some form of computerized service system.\nThe question is – has McDonald’s and other companies in the food business made the decision to move forward with automatic and cut jobs out of spite? Are they doing this because they are angry that so many people were trying to fight for a $15 minimum wage?\nPittsburgh workers protest as part of nationwide fight to raise minimum wage https://t.co/zVA9EU03Hb #15 & Union ..read the hateful comments\n— ISO Pittsburgh (@ISOPittsburgh) November 29, 2016 \n\nThe answer? No, they aren’t. McDonalds and companies like McDonald’s are doing what they need to do in response to the fight for a $15 minimum wage to survive. Some of these businesses do not have the profit margin to offer an increased wage to the employees. So, forcing them to is going to force them to look at options that allow them to accommodate the increased price of labor. Automation is a solution to the rising costs of labor. It allows the restaurants to continue to offer the customer a pleasant experience without overspending their profit margin on labor expenses.\nThe fight for the $15 minimum wage backfired on everyone because McDonald’s and other companies like McDonald’s are going to put the customers first. Without the customers, these companies would go out of business.\nIf you identify as a \"second-generation fast-food worker\", PLEASE, break the cycle, don't have kids. ❌????❌ #Fightfor15 https://t.co/UygWIptbUq \n— Duke (@somethingldsay) November 29, 2016 \n\nIt Isn’t Just About McDonald’s \nThe biggest reason why the fight for a $15 minimum wage is destined to backfire is because not all businesses are as fortunate as McDonald’s is. Some businesses do not have the capital they need to shift from having physical people handling customer service to automation. In the long run, it is going to save the companies money on labor. However, the technology is not cheap. This is forcing some companies to lay off some of their employees, move to a less expensive revenue, or just shut down the company completely. Some companies just can’t foot the bill to make the shift.\nCompanies across California were forced to close because they didn’t have the profit margin necessary to stay in business and meet the new minimum wage.\nDemanding a $15 Minimum Wage Backfired \nPeople decided to fight for a $15 minimum wage because they wanted more money. For the people who were lucky enough to hang on to their job after the fight was won – congratulations. The question is – what good did this fight really do when it has cost and will continue to cost so many people their job?\n‘Fight for $15’ Protest Demands Increase of Minimum Wage via @smallbiztrends https://t.co/1WXUAs33kJ \n— Sig Nordal, Jr (@signordal) November 29, 2016 \n\nThe fight for a $15 minimum wage backfired because people assumed these companies are holding out on paying their employees more out of greed. While this might be the case for a small number of companies, a large portion of companies are paying their employees what they can afford to pay.\nDo you think the fight for a $15 minimum wage has backfired on McDonald’s – as well as other minimum wage – employees?

      "text": "Tweet \nIt shouldn’t be any surprise to anyone with a slim understanding of economics that driving up costs for businesses means bad news for customers and employees alike . In terms of driving up wages by force, there were only two results that could follow. Either that business was going to have to lay off employees in order to afford their work force, or find a way to circumvent having employees in the first place. \nIn the case of the major fast food chain McDonald’s, they took the latter path and rolled out a shiny new line of self-service machines that allow you to order your food without the need for employees at a register. This happened after many cities forced the businesses in their cities to raise the minimum wage to $15 as a result of a nationwide protest called “Fight for $15.” \nMany had predicted this coming, including former CEO of McDonald’s USA Ed Rensi. Rensi wrote a guest post at Forbes on Tuesday that essentially had one message. \n“I told you so.” \nIt brings me no joy to write these words. The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing. \nWhile McDonald’s certainly had trouble in cities featuring the raised wage, it was a minor bump in the road that they could afford to spend their way out of. Sadly, not every business has the capital this massive chain does, and businesses and workers will both suffer for it. \nOf course, not all businesses have the capital necessary to shift from full-service to self-service. And that brings me to my next correct prediction–that a $15 minimum wage would force many small businesses to lay off staff, seek less-costly locations, or close altogether. \nTragically, these stories—in California in particular–are too numerous to cite in detail here. They include a bookstore in Roseville, a pub in Fresno, restaurants and bakeries in San Francisco, a coffee shop in Berkeley, grocery stores in Oakland, a grill in Santa Clara, and apparel manufacturers through the state. In September of this year, nearly one-quarter of restaurant closures in the Bay Area cited labor costs as one of the reasons for shutting down operations. And just this past week, a California-based communications firm announced it was moving 75 call center jobs from San Diego to El Paso, citing the state’s rising minimum as the “deciding factor.” (Dozens of additional stories can be found at the website FacesOf15.com .) \nThese machines have been looming on the horizon since 2013 , but now with the success of the protests, we’re beginning to see the fruits of their non-labor. Hopefully, people will abandon their quest through forced higher wages via the government as their community suffers under the financial burden.",

(AP) — Two suspects are at large and one has been detained after a police-involved shooting in front of a McDonald's in Florida. \nFort Lauderdale police tell local news media that officers were attempting to stop a stolen Ford Fusion with three men inside Monday afternoon in a McDonald's drive-thru when two of the men jumped out of the car and fled on foot. \nPolice say the driver then attempted to speed away, hitting an officer as he did so. The officer ended up on the roof of the car. \nFort Lauderdale Detective Keven Dupree says that at that point, officers fired into the car. It's unknown if the driver was struck. \nThe hit officer was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. \nOfficers arrested one of the passengers who tried to flee.

      "text": "CHICAGO -- McDonald's said Tuesday it is expanding a test of fresh beef burgers after a trial run in Texas got a positive response. The world's largest burger chain's experimentation is part of its effort to change the public's perception of its food quality and freshness.\nThe fresh beef test, which had been at 55 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now has expanded to include 75 restaurants across northeast Oklahoma. The test of never-frozen beef only includes Quarter Pounder patties, not the smaller patties that come on hamburgers and Big Macs.\nFresh beef represents a huge opportunity for McDonald's but also a substantial risk. It means a big change to the process of food delivery and preparation. But McDonald's has shown willingness over the last two years to make big changes to its food to improve still-sluggish foot traffic, and to draw in a younger crowd that prefers \"better burger\" rivals like Shake Shack, Epic Burger or Five Guys. Wendy's also has been ramping up marketing efforts recently behind its own fresh beef.\nMcDonald's has made other changes to its food, including removing high fructose corn syrup from its buns, swapping margarine for butter on its Egg McMuffins, moving toward chicken without antibiotics, and stripping out preservatives from its chicken nuggets. It's also changed the way its food is prepared in order to improve the taste, such as toasting buns and searing beef differently.\nIt's not clear how long the fresh beef test will last before the chain will consider offering it at restaurants nationwide, or if that will happen at all.\nMcDonald's always does a trial run when it makes changes to its food or adds new menu items to make sure customers respond before a national rollout. The burger chain, headquartered in suburban Chicago, tends to favor Texas to start tests involving beef because burgers make up a bigger percentage of average sales at restaurants there. It tends to focus on spots like Atlanta for chicken, the Northeast for coffee and California for salads.\n(c)2016 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "5 6 \nGlobally, World AIDS Day is observed on December 1. It is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in their fight against HIV, show support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate those who have died. Wearing a red ribbon is a simple way to identify with this cause. \nGetting to ZERO is the theme set by the United Nations from 2011 to 2015. \n• ZERO new infections. \n• ZERO stigma and discrimination. \n• ZERO AIDS-related deaths. \nAccording to the UNAIDS, the world is on track to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. \nSince the beginning of the pandemic, 78 million people have contracted HIV and 35 million have died of AIDS, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in history. AIDS kills more than 6,000 people every day worldwide. Nineteen of the 36.7 million people currently living with HIV are not aware they have the virus. \nIn 2015, there were roughly 2.1 million new infections, 220,000 of which were among children who have been infected via their HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. \nIn 2013, the Caribbean accounted for more than 250,000 persons living with HIV in the region. Five countries accounted for 96 per cent of all people living with HIV in the region - Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. \nAccess to antiretroviral treatments has improved significantly, with coverage currently at 42 per cent of people 15 years or older living with HIV in the Caribbean - an increase of 31 per cent since 2011. AIDS-related deaths remain highly concentrated, with 98 per cent occurring in the five countries previously mentioned - Haiti alone accounted for 59 per cent of all AIDS-related deaths in the region during 2013. \nTEENS AT GREATER RISK \n\nIn Jamaica, it is estimated that there are currently 28,400 persons living with HIV/AIDS and 30 per cent do not know they have the virus. This amounts to a prevalence of 1.7 per cent. The main mode of transmission is sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. \nAdolescents are a high-risk group for HIV infection, as almost 10 per cent of all reported AIDS cases are among young people under 19 years of age. Young people between the ages of 15 and 35 are in the greatest danger, as they generally have more sexual partners and more regular sex. \nRecent statistics show that younger females are also contracting HIV, with the 10-29 and 15-19 age groups accounting for the majority of the increase. Within our school system, it is estimated that there are 815 boys who are currently living with HIV, along with 685 girls, all between the ages of 10 and 19. \nBut what is the cause of such alarming numbers? In the end, the main culprit is the spread of HIV from person to person through unprotected sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. The problem is, most people do not believe it will happen to them! Ask any HIV-positive person if he or she believed it could have happened to them and they will tell you no. \nA number of economic, behavioral and socio-cultural factors have also been identified to be the drivers behind this pandemic in Jamaica. These include: \n• Multiple sexual partners. ",

      "text": "This was predictable. Click to expand... U , yeah. It was the minimum wage that did it. I ate a burger from McD about 12 years ago. It was awful. Ranked lowest in taste in a blind taste test by Consumers Report compared to other burgers. McD was heading towards automation anyway. They have to cut costs because their business is trending down and their product sucks compared to independent local businesses. Last year, their revenue growth was -11%. I hear they are experimenting with using \"fresh beef\". What have they been using? Yuck. Would you eat that? Three Trends Haunting McDonald's: Localization, Customization, And Cheap Labor Once McDonald's MCD -0.17% occupied the best spot at Syntagma Square, in Athens Greece, attracting both the locals and tourists who were looking for fast, cheap, and convenient food. Today, McDonald’s continues to occupy the same location, but ithas plenty of competition from Greek upstarts that serve fast and convenient food and much more: localization and customization. So, yeah, automate and standardize. Pretty soon you can get the same crappy calorie rich and nutrition poor burger from a kiosk. Somebody, maybe, not me. Fewer people every day are willing to hurt themselves with a McD burger.",

(AP) — McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. The fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. McDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. The company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Latest News Video ",

Police estimate around 130 people attended the early morning rally Tuesday in south Minneapolis. Police spokesman Scott Seroka says the predawn assembly was peaceful, but officers arrested 21 people. No one resisted arrest, and all were immediately released. Fast-food employees, janitors and other low-paid workers attended the rally. Demonstrators chanted, waved signs and sat in the intersection as part of a \"Day of Resistance for $15 and Union Rights .\" The Star Tribune ( http://strib.mn/2fI8vLY ) reports some Metro Transit buses were briefly rerouted. About 100 cleaners marched through an Eden Prairie mall to a Kohl's department store Tuesday morning but were locked out. Another event was planned on the University of Minnesota campus. ___ Information from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com Latest News Video ",

      "text": "Print \nA crowd of about 350 protesters in New York stand on Broadway in front of a McDonald’s. About 25 of the chanting minimum-wage protesters, foreground, were arrested. The event was part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. The campaign seeks higher hourly wages, including for workers at fast-food restaurants and airports. \nASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge \nCHICAGO — Dozens of people were arrested Tuesday in protests nationwide for a $15 per hour minimum wage. \nFast-food restaurant workers and home and child-care workers rallied in cities including Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and New York. In many cities the protesters blocked busy intersections. \nIn Chicago, hundreds of protesters at O’Hare International Airport were outside terminals chanting “What do we want? $15! When do we want it? Now!” Police gated an area to allow travelers room to walk. \nAs many as 500 workers at the airport participated in an unfair labor practices strike, according to officials from Service Employees International Union Local 1 who have been organizing the workers. \nThousands planned to walk off the job at McDonald’s restaurants, organizers said. The efforts are part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. \nIn New Jersey, airport workers marched between two terminals at Newark Liberty International Airport. Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka has called on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour and take steps to hire more Newark residents. \nAt a McDonald’s in Denver, about 100 people, including about 60 striking fast food workers from around the metro area, picketed. Protesters briefly shut down a downtown St. Louis McDonald’s restaurant, blocking the drive-thru for about 30 minutes. In Massachusetts, a state senator was among nearly three dozen people arrested after they sat down on a Cambridge street. \nAbout 25 of the 350 protesters in New York City were arrested. One protester, Flavia Cabral, 55, struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs, saying, “All these people don’t have savings because we’re working check to check.” \nDetroit police said they arrested about 40 protesters who blocked traffic. And nearly three dozen protesters were arrested in Cambridge, Mass. In the San Francisco Bay Area, ride-hailing drivers, fast-food employees, airport workers, and others shut down an Oakland intersection. \nRaising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $12 would lift pay for 35 million workers, or 1 in 4 employees nationwide, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \nBut the conservative-leaning, nonprofit Employment Policies Institute think tank predicts minimum wage increases would result in lost jobs, reduced hours, and business closures.

      "text": "McDonald's, Walmart and Subway Are Among 13 U.S. Companies Wrecking Forests Through Unsustainable Beef Production Beef production is the primary contributor to tropical deforestation worldwide. November 30, 2016 \nSAO PAULO, BRAZIL - June 18, 2008: A group of cattle in confinement Photo Credit: Alf Ribeiro / Shutterstock.com \nThe Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) recently released a report , “Cattle, Cleared Forests, and Climate Change: Scoring America’s Top Brands on Their Deforestation-Free Beef Commitments and Practices.” The publication highlights how beef production is the primary contributor to tropical deforestation worldwide, predominantly occurring in South America. According to the report, consumer goods companies “have the power to help stop this destruction,” yet none of the 13 United States companies studied for sourcing South American beef had strong deforestation-free policies or procedures in place. The report advises that companies should work together with meatpackers, ranchers, and government to develop a comprehensive plan to end deforestation practices within the beef industry. \nAccording to the report, one challenge to overcome is the structure of the beef supply chain. Meatpackers receive cattle through direct supplying ranches, only some of which are monitored for deforestation practices. The larger problem arises when cattle are shifted from ranch to ranch through various stages of production, allowing indirect supplying ranches to go unmonitored for deforestation. Without a system in place to track indirect supplying ranches, or the cattle who may pass through them, the meatpackers and the consumer goods companies cannot guarantee that the beef they receive is deforestation-free through the entire supply chain. Authors Asha R. Sharma and Lael K. Goodman see potential for change if major players in the industry band together, “These companies have a responsibility to work with their South American supplying meatpackers, which have enormous influence over the beef supply chain, to adopt robust deforestation-free policies and practices.” The authors also acknowledge consumer responsibility and power to effect change, noting previous success with zero-deforestation palm oil initiatives. \nIn 2009, the four largest meatpackers in Brazil signed the Minimum Criteria for Industrial Scale Cattle Operations in the Brazilian Amazon Biome agreement (also known as the G4 Agreement or the Cattle Agreement). This pact required the signatories to determine and report that their supplying ranches were not linked to deforestation, marking a “historic step toward corporate actors taking responsibility for their role in driving deforestation.” Acknowledging that this agreement was a step in the right direction toward deforestation-free beef, Sharma and Goodman argue that the agreement falls short in several ways: it is limited to the Amazon and to the signatories, and the meatpackers have so far delayed in implementing monitoring for all supplying ranches. \nBecause efforts to curtail deforestation largely focus on the Amazon, the authors advise that companies should develop deforestation-free policies that are global in scope. The authors also state that companies should, with the cooperation of meatpackers, monitor all supplying ranches and the cattle that pass through them, ensure the protection of human rights along the supply chain, and support ranchers in improved pastureland management. \nThe 13 companies in UCS’s study were evaluated in five areas: ambition of deforestation-free commitment; time-bound implementation plan; compliance; transparency; and traceability, monitoring, and verification. The study found that none of the 13 consumer goods companies scored high enough to receive a strong deforestation-free beef policies and procedures rating, and none could guarantee that the beef obtained was from a deforestation-free source. Mars, McDonald’s and Walmart garnered the most points—though still receiving a limited designation; while Nestle, Hormel, Wendy’s, Jack Links, Subway, Burger King, ConAgra, Kroger and Pizza Hut all received very limited designations (the last four all scoring zero). \nRead the full report here .",

      "text": "By Stu Tarlowe \nA funny thing happened the other day at a McDonald’s in Topeka, Kansas. \nIt seems a Topeka cop ordered a Dr. Pepper™ at the drive-through, but when he started to drink it he discovered that someone, presumably a McDonald’s employee, had put mustard in the soft drink ! \nBut wait! About two weeks ago, a similar “prank” was played on a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper – at the same McDonald’s! \nOne could say these were harmless practical jokes, and that nobody was harmed. The person who did this, and perhaps his or her fellow employees, probably thought it was oh-so-clever and pretty darn funny. But one could also say the acts were indicative of the utter lack of respect for our law enforcement community that is unfortunately so prevalent – even fashionable! -- just now. And (similar to the way psychopaths start out with abusing small creatures before becoming serial killers) when that lack of respect morphs into outright hostility and is taken to the extreme, we have ambush killings of our law enforcement officers. \n(At least this McDonald’s worker didn’t “pull a Jesse Jackson” on the cop. The “civil rights leader” has admitted that, when he worked in a hotel, he would sometimes spit on white people’s food . \nWhen I was a kid in NYC, almost everything cops ate or drank while on duty was “on the arm.” And, in fact, a friend of my Dad’s, an NYPD homicide detective, would take his son and me and another kid to the movies and never pay for anything. Sometimes he’d “flash the tin,” but a lot of times he’d just “flash the steel.” We’d get on the bus and he’d say to the driver, “Nice day, isn’t it?” while opening his jacket and showing his revolver, and the driver would wave us on. It was the same thing with the ticket-taker at the theater, and at the snack bar. Cops in uniform never paid for so much as a cup of coffee, and the restaurateurs were pretty happy with the arrangement. It wasn’t so much graft or bribery as a way of showing appreciation. And it didn’t hurt to have cops coming around; their presence certainly was a deterrent to armed robbers. \nThose days are pretty much gone now, and cops generally pay for their food and drink just like anybody else. In the mid-‘70s, when I helped run a little 24-hr. breakfast and burger joint in Seattle, the cops wouldn’t let me buy ‘em a cup of coffee! But, just like anybody else, they expected to get what they order and what they pay for, without some jerk adulterating their grub with who-knows-what. \nThe owners of that particular McDonald’s franchise in Topeka, Dobski and Associates of Lawrence, Kansas, have now announced that the matter “has been handled internally” and the employee in question has been fired (although additional, legal action may still be brought; the Topeka PD has opened a criminal investigation into the matter). \nPersonally, I think that now former- employee got off way too easy. I think that his or her photo should be circulated so that he or she can never again find work in the food service industry. \nFurthermore, with his or her photo out there for everyone to see, when that person tries to order food or drink at an establishment that does respect law enforcement, he or she can be emphatically told, “ No soup for you !” In fact, I’d like to see that carried out by all manner of businesses the prankster might choose to patronize, so he or she could be told, “No soup for you!”; “No groceries for you!”; “No gasoline for you!” etc., etc. Let ‘em experience that kind of “disrespect,” except that, in their case, they’ll actually deserve it. Let ‘em order an oil change and have the mechanic say, “Gee, I don’t know. I might not be able to stop myself from putting some condiments in your crankcase!” \nBy the way, the announcement of the particular employee being fired came at about the same time that McDonald’s workers (and other fast food workers) were marching to demand a $15 per hour minimum wage for the work they do. \nTo which I say, “$15 an hour so you can put mustard in cops’ drinks?

      "text": "Colonie\nA crowd of about 25 people chanted inside a McDonald's on Central Avenue Tuesday morning, protesting the company's refusal to pay employees $15 an hour nationwide.\n\"We want our dignity, our respect, better hours, everything we don't get on a regular basis as hardworking fast food members,\" Wendy's worker Elizabeth James said, glancing down at her 2-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter. \"I just want to be able to take care of my kids.\"\nThe McDonald's protest was the first of many stops Citizen Action planned for Tuesday to mark a nationwide Day of Action aimed at putting pressure on fast food companies to raise the hourly pay across the country.\nWorking their way down Central Avenue via fast food restaurants and government buildings, the activists and workers called for a national $15 minimum wage and asked the state Legislature to speed up the timeline for an already approved wage hike.\n\"Five years from now is not enough,\" James said. \"We want it now.\"\nThe protesters at the 1814 Central Ave. McDonald's restaurant dispersed after the manager called police about 7 a.m.\nColonie officers told the group they could rally on the sidewalk but not on restaurant property.\nBut since the group had already staged their planned 15-minute sit-in, they decided to move on, James said. \"We got the workers' attention,\" she said.\nThe group planned to deliver pledges to Albany City Hall, the state Capitol and legislative office building before another protest at the McDonald's restaurant in Albany.\nProtesters also planned to stage sit-ins at Dunkin' Donuts, Taco Bell and Burger King locations throughout the day.\nemasters@timesunion.com • 518-454-5467 • @emilysmasters",

      "text": "Remember the hood chicks that got popped last year for jumping that girl at McDonald’s in a video that went viral? Well, 17-yr-old Aniah Ferguson , one of the girls with a hefty record prior to this incident, was sent to a psych ward to try and help her out…but she couldn’t stop thugging and was just sent back to Rikers Island. Turns out, Aniah had already been locked up before this debacle for beating her grandmother and stabbing her brother. Aniah is a known gang member and doesn’t hide the fact. \n",

      "text": "Share This \nIn Topeka, Kansas, a police officer was thirsty on the job and decided to order a soda at a McDonald’s drive-thru. Unfortunately, when he took a sip of his drink, he quickly noticed something was wrong and decided to glance inside his cup. However, he was left sickened when he saw what was hidden inside, and now the disgusting and disrespectful employee was fired. \nThe day after Thanksgiving, a police officer with the Topeka Police Department decided to get a Dr. Pepper at a local McDonald’s drive-thru. The officer, who has remained anonymous, received his drink and immediately took a sip, but instead tasting the soda, he was met with another nasty taste. As anyone would do, the officer then took off the lid of his cup and was disgusted by what the employee put in his drink – mustard. \nIt seems that the employee had an issue with police officers and decided to get a little bit of revenge by squirting mustard inside his drink. The worker likely never imagined that the officer would do anything about the secret surprise, but now that it’s been made public, there’s no doubt that they may regret their actions. According to a post on Kansas Going Blue’s Facebook page , the McDonald’s manager informed the officers that “this happened before with a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper.” The mustard in the officer’s cup (Image Source: Kansas Going Blue ) \nThe McDonald’s franchise owner, Tom Dobski, was “shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee,” according to Blue Lives Matter . However, he informed that the disrespectful employee “no longer works for the organization.” He continued, “All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.” \nIn addition to the former employee’s dismissal, the Topeka Police Department have opened a criminal investigation into the incident. They have already confirmed that the employee had previously placed mustard in a Kansas Highway Patrol officer’s drink, and now this particular individual may be facing further punishment. \nAlthough some people may feel that it was “just mustard” in the officer’s cup, it could have easily been something more harmful. A food service worker should respect their customers and not tamper with their food. It’s a shame that anyone needs to worry about something in their beverage, especially law enforcement professionals, who put their lives on the line to protect people – including the former McDonald’s employee.
