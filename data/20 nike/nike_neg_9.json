Comfortable strap and comes with two exclusive Nike watch faces. The Bad GPS battery life is short. No altimeter for measuring elevation. Workout data can't be exported to other services. Lacks always-on display. The Bottom Line If you're a loyal Nike user, this is the Apple Watch to get, but it's really just an Apple Watch Series 2 with a few minor changes. There are cheaper alternatives for pure fitness and run tracking. Review Sections",

      "text": "Part of Nike’s “12 Soles” Collection, we now have a release date to report for the Nike Air Max Uptempo 2 Urban Haze.\nCovered in a full Urban Haze (olive) upper, this Air Max Uptempo 2 comes constructed out of a combination of suede and mesh for that Fall-inspired look and feel. Providing some contrast is a white midsole/outsole unit.\nNot much else to this Air Max Uptempo 2, just a clean and versatile option for the Fall. Look for the Nike Air Max Uptempo 2 to release on December 20, 2016 for a retail price of $160.\nvia: Nike\nAuthor’s Take I’m not really sure if I like the Air Max Uptempo 2 as a silhouette, but this olive colorway definitely makes it look nice. This shoe has Fall vibes written all over it.\n\nThe post Release Date: Nike Air Max Uptempo 2 Urban Haze appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Nike’s Kobe AD Cool Grey on Sale Today (NKE, UA) By Dan Moskowitz | November 22, 2016 — 11:19 AM EST \nWhen it comes to sneakers, NIKE, Inc. ( NKE ) is best known for its Jordan Brand. As was written in an article yesterday, consumers like to associate with champions, and with six championships—as well as the potential for more if he hadn’t temporarily switched to baseball—Michael Jordan has earned legendary status as a champion. When it comes to sneaker sales, Nike technology plays a role, but let’s be realistic. That same technology without the name “Jordan” on it wouldn’t sell nearly as well. Kobe Bryant and Steph Curry are champions, but for them, it’s not nearly as clear-cut. \nKobe Bryant mirrored his game after Michael Jordan. That fact combined with his natural talent—and with the help of Shaq for part of his run—led him to five championship titles. This helps Nike sell shoes, but not to the extent of Jordan. It’s not as much the five titles versus six for Jordan; it’s more that Kobe just isn’t as well liked. Whether that’s fair or not is debatable, but perception plays a major role. That being the case, while the Kobe AD Cool Grey goes on sale today and offers exceptional technology, that doesn’t mean it will sell to the point of moving the revenue needle for Nike. If you’re interested in purchasing the Kobe AD Cool Grey, below are three technological features: Nike Lunarlon technology, which allows the force of impact to evenly distribute on your foot. Nike Zoom technology for thin, lightweight and durable cushioning. Nike Flywire, which strategically places filaments that function like cables on a suspension bridge to offer support precisely where it's needed. \nNike Kobe AD Cool Grey Price: $160. \nDespite Steph Curry being more popular than Kobe these days, Under Armour, Inc.’s ( UA ) Curry 3.0 are selling for $140-$150. Prices for both the Kobe AD Cool Grey and Curry 3.0 are high, and Under Armour could run into some trouble here after the Foot Locker CEO stated that Curry 3.0 sales were off to a slow start. (See also, Curry 3.0 Could be a Slow Start for Under Armour ) \nHowever, the focus here is on the Kobe AD Cool Grey. If it’s selling at an even higher price point, then it might limit demand . Then again, according to Sneaker News, the Nike Kobe AD Cool Grey has a 9.0 of 10 rating. There are only 48 votes since the shoe is new, but that's a good start. Comparatively, the Curry 3.0 sports a 6.6 rating based on 168 votes. \nNKE has depreciated 22.84% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.28%. \nUA has depreciated 32.83% over the past 12 months. It does not pay a dividend. Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis Thanks for signing up to Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

      "text": "Not Always Nike | Here is Sergio Busquets' Full Boot History Wednesday, November 23, 2016 Wednesday, November 23, 2016 Last weekend, Sergio Busquets made his 400th match for Barcelona. And while he since then has made always all matches wearing Nike boots, he made his FC Barcelona first team debut with boots that are not made by the Swoosh. So let's take a look at Sergio Busquets' soccer cleat history. Sergio Busquets Makes First Team Debut With Puma Boots A product of Barcelona's youth system, Busquets surprisingly made his Barcelona debut wearing silver Puma King Exec football boots (kangaroo leather upper, released in 2007) and not cleats by Nike. However, after his first match as professional, Nike signed the rising defensive midfielder and gave him the Nike Tiempo Legend boot.",

(Mario Tama/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   4:00 AM \nAn 18-year-old Queens man ripped off two people at gunpoint after arranging on Facebook to buy coats and sneakers from them, authorities said Tuesday. \nThe suspect, Germaine Wright, told police he was simply trying to get back what had been stolen from him. \nAccording to court papers, Wright claimed that he was robbed about a year ago and recently decided to message “different people on Facebook who looked like the people who robbed me.” \nAuthorities said both crimes occurred between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. on Friday. \nTop fashion brands eyeing Madison Ave. Crate & Barrel space \nWright allegedly met a 29-year-old man on 90th St. in Jackson Heights and stole $26, plus the $200 Nike Air Jordan sneakers they discussed on Facebook. \nIn the other incident, on 150th St. in Flushing, a 23-year-old man was robbed of two Nike jackets worth $200. \nIn both cases, Wright was with 3 other men who are still at large. \nPolice learned of Wright’s name from the cell phone number he gave his victims, a police source said. Wright allegedly arranged a meeting through Facebook to buy the two victims' Nike sneakers and jackets in Queens and robbed them at gunpoint. (KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images) \nWright was charged with robbery then released without bail after his arraignment. \nHe could not be reached for comment at his home in Rosedale, where a woman told the Daily News not to call anymore. \nSources said detectives believe Wright is also responsible for another robbery on Friday in which he and a cohort stole Moncler and Canada Goose winter jackets, each of which cost last least several hundred dollars, from a 21-year-old man in Fort Greene. \nHe has not yet been charged in that case. \nMale model discovered on Instagram during construction gig \nInspector Thomas Conforti of the Crime Prevention Division said anyone who wants to sell or buy items through social media or websites should arrange to meet the other party at police precincts or other police facilities. \n“It’s a very safe location,” Conforti said. “It gives you (an) added blanket of security that the transaction is going to go down as agreed to and that you won’t become an unsuspecting victim.” Join the Conversation:",

      "text": "Comment \nAs a high school basketball coach, I’m a big fan of NBA players getting involved and doing cool things for high schools. It could be having members of the team head to a game. Or donating money for a new scoreboard or gym renovations. So, when I saw LeBron James and Nike hooked up a high school team with gear I got pretty excited. \nFor those wondering, the school is Benton High School in Missouri. According to a Google search, the girls went 31-0 in 2015-16 and won the Missouri 4A state title, so they earned the reward. But it also is what makes the generous donation so cool. James really has no ties to Benton. As a native of Akron, James honestly had probably never even heard of them. Or at least we thought so. \nInstead the girls were probably getting ready for practice one day when a big box showed up. Upon opening it the girls got to see a letter from the best basketball player in the world and a whole bunch of free Nike swag. That has to be just an incredible feeling. \nHonestly, I am a bit jealous of the entire thing. Going 31-0 is special. Having LeBron James and Nike send your team things is special. Having both of them in the span of a calendar year is pretty incredible. Those girls now have two athletics stories that they can tell for the rest of their lives and be proud of. That isn’t something that most people in the world get. \nSo good on James for making this happen. With just a simple conversation with Nike he has touched the lives of people he had no real reason to. That seems like a really great thing to do. \nBut really we shouldn’t be that surprised. James consistently does way more than is necessary in regards to working with kids. Not only is he one of the best players in the game, he is consistently one of the best people. Related Story: Anthony Randolph finally found his place in basketball \nSo congrats to the girls once again on their undefeated season and new gear. And good luck this season on keeping the winning streak going. That won’t be easy but clearly you have the talent to do this. \nOh, and LeBron and/or anyone at Nike who may be reading this. Feel free to ship some stuff out to the teams at Dunellen High School. My contact info is in my bio if you need it. We would love it too. \nAlso a big hat tip to the guys at the NBA Reddit for the find. Top Stories",

      "text": "Rec John Lopez - Nike Two weeks after landing five-star guard Gary Trent Jr., Duke has plucked another 5-star recruit out of the class of 2017. Wendell Carter Jr., ESPN’s No. 3 overall recruit, picked the chose the Blue Devils over Georgia, Georgia Tech and Harvard on Wednesday. He was the top uncommitted player in his class. He made his announcement with a video: — Wendell Carter Jr (@wendellcarter34) November 23, 2016 At 6’9 and 254 pounds, Carter is ready to make an impact at the college level from day one. He has solid touch around the hoop, is a tenacious rebounder and has a high ceiling as a defender. In 2015, he won gold on Team USA’s U16 team, averaging 14 points on 55 percent shooting, nine rebounds and two blocks in five starts. Read our feature from October on Carter’s fascinating recruitment . Duke has a history of landing high-impact big men on the recruiting trail. Jahlil Okafor was the centerpiece of a national championship team in 2014, while Harry Giles and Marques Bolden are expected to anchor the middle for the Blue Devils this year once they get healthy. Carter is considered a one-and-done caliber player. He is projected as the No. 4 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft by DraftExpress. Carter and Trent have long discussed attending the same college, and Duke made it happen. The Blue Devils are expected to lose a ton of talent after this season, but now have the foundation for their next great team. Mike Krzyzewski continues to recruit as well as anyone in the country.

      "title": "Nike Brings Flyknit to the ACG Line's Zoom Tallac",
      "text": "\nBack in August, Nike Sportswear resurrected the ACG lineup's Zoom Tallac Lite and now the OG 2008 rendition of the silhouette is getting a major makeover with the addition of the Swoosh's Flyknit construction. Aptly dubbed the ACG Zoom Tallac Flyknit, the special NikeLab release vastly overhauls the original to create something new entirely. Not only does the design boast a lightweight Flyknit upper, but it comes with a reworked take on the Tallac's original supportive, lacing-assisted overlay while the sole unit now employs visible Zoom Air cushioning. The result is a shoe that's as durable as a hiking boot and one that performs as well as a lightweight trail runner.\nLook for the ACG Zoom Tallac Flyknit to debut at NikeLab locations and nike.com in a trio of colorways come December 1.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

Combining a Zoom Air unit in the heel, Lunarlon foam in the midsole and a minimal rubber outsole (with micro-tread traction), the shoe provides responsive, flexible cushioning and maximum court feel. A breathable mesh upper with incorporated Dynamic Flywire, ensures lock down for quick changes of direction toward the basket or to cover an opponent.\nHere’s a few of the photos we shared to give you an idea… ( check out the rest here )\nNike\n\nNike\n\nNike\n\nThe shoes were officially put on the market on November 21st with a suggested retail price of $160 and now they have revealed some new colorways that are just TIGHT.\nNike\n\nNike\n\nNike\n\nNike\n\nSo how much do you want a pair of these bad boys?

      "text": "Following the reveal of its official release date, official imagery of the forthcoming Nike Flyknit Racer Triple Black has now released. \nThe ubiquitous stealthy color scheme essentially drapes the entire intricate knitted upper, tongue, laces and phylon sole unit for a truly blacked-out aesthetic. In addition, signature Swooshes are prominent across its side panels and reflective accents on the heel pull tabs rounds out its overall profile.\nRetailing for $150, you can purchase this standout iteration at select Nike retailers starting Wednesday, November 30th.\nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I’m pretty biased towards this silhouette and this colorway was long overdue. It’s just another sleek/stylish/versatile option that should garner a lot of attention.\n\nThe post Official Images: Nike Flyknit Racer Triple Black appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Chanel Adams \nBella Hadid is showing off her athletic skills after her controversial Nike ad hit the streets of New York. The 20-year-old was seen boxing and wearing a Victoria’s Secret sports bra as part of her preparation for the upcoming Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show debut. \nBella Hadid decided to wear just a bra while doing her workout, according to Teen Vogue . This is her first time in the annual fashion show and she wanted to show her support for the lingerie and sportswear brand by rocking a Victoria’s Secret sports bra. Hadid paired her black-and-white sports bra with a black oversized cardigan and black leggings. She also donned dark sunglasses and tied her dark tresses up into a top knot. \nShe’s a knockout! Bella Hadid flashes a smile during playful boxing session ahead of Victoria Secret Fashion show -… https://t.co/9K7s6SCvP1 \n— Boxing report (@Boxingreport) November 21, 2016 \nBella Hadid Wears a Victoria’s Secret Bra to Practice for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show https://t.co/zQTTsLoMBU \n— Nicole Vitorio (@NicoleVitorio) November 22, 2016 \nBella wore the attire as she made her way to her boxing class in New York on Monday, Nov. 21. According to the Daily Mail , Bella was seen doing an intense workout while wearing a pair of boxing gloves. She will make her debut appearance in the 2016 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show later this month. Her sister, Gigi Hadid, is returning as well as favorites Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Elsa Hosk, Jasmine Tookes, and Lily Aldridge. \nThe previous Victoria’s Secret Angels, Karlie Kloss, Josephine Skriver, Martha Hunt, Sara Sampaio, Stella Maxwell, and Taylor Hill will also be joining the ladies. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 16, 2016 at 6:40pm PST \nBella Hadid’s latest sighting comes after she was slammed simply for becoming the latest face of Nike. The dark haired beauty made the announcement on Instagram, seen posing next to a gigantic billboard of herself in the center of New York City. \n“So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon,” she wrote in her Instagram post. \nHadid followed up with a black-and-white behind-the-scenes photo by Renella Madrano, who previously took photos of the model at her birthday party just a month ago, according to InStyle . Hadid quickly became the center of controversy when she received online criticism from those who wondered if she was a good fit for the athletic brand. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 3:40pm PST \nFans of Nike argued that Bella’s “way too skinny to represent a sports brand” and that she “doesn’t even have an athletic body.” \nHer mother, Yolanda Hadid, fired back at her critics. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum defended her daughter via TMZ . She explained that Bella used to compete in equestrian riding from when she was three years until she was diagnosed with Lyme disease at the age of 15. She had to stop riding due to the autoimmune disease that’s crippling and can affect the brain. \n“[Bella] had to give up her lifelong dream of having a professional riding career and a shot at the Olympics due to her severe symptoms and inability to ride,” Yolanda previously wrote on her Bravo blog earlier this year. “[She] struggles with symptoms of chronic Lyme every day.” A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Sep 26, 2016 at 1:00pm PDT \nEven if Bella didn’t have her athletic background, Yolanda still thinks her Nike deal is deserving. \n“You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,” she said in her latest interview with TMZ . \nAfter Bella’s deal was announced, Olympic skater Meryl Davis tweeted her disappointment over a model being used to promote athletic apparel. She shared a photo of Bella wearing Nike, Kylie Jenner in Puma, and Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman wearing Reebok. \nI’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX \n— Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 \nHadid previously told People that she “accidentally” lost weight due to her strenuous workouts. \n“I want my boobs. I want my a** back,” she admitted. “But it’s not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.” A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Oct 30, 2016 at 11:09am PDT \n[Featured image by Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images for Dior Beauty]",

      "text": "Nike Red Limit Pack by lumo723 Wednesday, November 23, 2016 Wednesday, November 23, 2016 Adidas got people talking with its latest collection of football boots. Dubbed the Red Limit pack, the new Adidas set introduces clean red, black and white colorways for the Ace, Copa, X and Messi models that don't have to shy away from comparisons with the iconic Predator. Inspired by this, the people at lumo723 have created three similar paint jobs for Nike's Hypervenom, Mercurial and Tiempo models. Predominantly red, the fictional Nike Red Limit Hypervenom has a black Dynamic Fit collar and features a subtle gradient that is worked into the lateral zig-zag design. The Mercurial cleverly incorporates a black-to-red gradient into the existing design, while the Tiempo is solid red with a few grey details and no gradients. Which of the three boots do you like the most? Drop us a line below.",

Comfortable strap and comes with two exclusive Nike watch faces. The Bad GPS battery life is short. No altimeter for measuring elevation. Workout data can't be exported to other services. Lacks always-on display. The Bottom Line If you're a loyal Nike user, this is the Apple Watch to get, but it's really just an Apple Watch Series 2 with a few minor changes. There are cheaper alternatives for pure fitness and run tracking. Review Sections ",

Comfortable strap and comes with two exclusive Nike watch faces. The Bad GPS battery life is short. No altimeter for measuring elevation. Workout data can't be exported to other services. Lacks always-on display. The Bottom Line If you're a loyal Nike user, this is the Apple Watch to get, but it's really just an Apple Watch Series 2 with a few minor changes. There are cheaper alternatives for pure fitness and run tracking. Review Sections ",

      "text": "Nike just teamed up with Bandier to deliver us the most delicious rose gold sneakers Krista Jensen More Before you cast your Christmas wishes for those sparkly gold layering necklaces you’ve scouted out on Etsy all year long, consider changing your plan. Not from gold to …something else, that’d be insane. But from rose gold metals to a fresh-to-death rose gold sneaker . YES, WE KNOW! How dare Nike and Bandier release these beauties when our holiday desires have already been documented and distributed?! Nonetheless, Nike’s limited-edition rose gold sneakers , exclusively available at Nike.com or in person at Bandier, aka the one-stop shop for everything that’s dope , are making us rethink everything and anything else we asked for. Just one pair of these beauties, please? And then maybe a back up? A pair for just the gym? Come on, we’ve been so good this year. More “Rose Gold is a color that represents a woman’s strength and femininity ,” cited Bandier’s founder and our best friend at the moment, Jenn Bandier. “When you put on sneakers or apparel from Nike’s Rose Gold collection, you feel like Superwoman — it’s empowering!” And speaking of good, we didn’t know Santa himself was behind the counter at Bandier this season. Get this: when (not if, when ) you pick out a pair of rose gold sneaks for yourself somebody at Bandier, “you’ll get a complimentary rose-flavored Balm Dotcom from Glossier and a matching rose-gold Nike notebook.” That’s a free stocking stuffer duo that’s just thrown in for the hell of it because Bandier’s got our back (they’re also in the middle of their first ever online warehouse sale right now , where everything is up to 70% off. …GO!). Just imagine the selfies, the pairing of your warm, pink metallic shoes to your rose gold iPhone, the athleisurely ease of never needing another pair of sneakers again. Remember, it’s all in the name of empowerment! To restate: we were good, but were we this good? Shh. Sure we were.",

      "text": "Tweet 0 shares / likes \nKyrie Irving himself said the Nike Kyrie 3 is releasing in January, but Nike Basketball may just drop the debut pair in time for the Christmas holiday. We’re hearing that this black/white colorway with Oreo-style speckling and a bright green traction point on the sole is releasing on December 24th, so the wait for the Kyrie 3 signature shoe might be much shorter than you think. \nRetail price info for the Kyrie 3 hasn’t been revealed, but don’t expect it to jump much higher than the $120 pricepoint of the Kyrie 2. Stay tuned for continuing updates on the Nike Kyrie 3 and give us your thoughts on the new shoe as more colorways continue to be revealed. Nike Kyrie 3 \nRelease Date: December 24th, 2016 \"Air Jordan 11 Premium Grey Suede\" \"Nike Kyrie 2 Four Wins\" ",

      "text": "\nLeBron James's tenth Soldier signature sneaker with Nike may be the line's most popular yet all thanks to a special defensive play seen around the world. Ever since King James's huge block in last season's NBA Finals, a various amount of colorways of the silhouette have released, whether it be from the Swoosh or in collaboration with others such as John Elliott . This time around the model will host a color combination of \"Team Red,\" metallic gold and white, reminiscent of the Cleveland Cavaliers' colorway. You'll find that its upper and three straps are coated in \"Team Red\" while its midsole and sole dons white. Metallic gold serves as a finishing touch as it's used as an outline for the silhouette's Swoosh branding.\nThis edition of the Nike Zoom LeBron Soldier 10 will officially release on December 17 for a price of $130 at select Nike retailers, in addition to nike.com .\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

Matthew White with his two dogs Nike and Toffee recently received the keys to a new mortgage-free and fully-furnished Centex home in the Cherry Hill Crossing community in Dumfries, Virginia . The new home was donated by PulteGroup's Built to Honor program, which provides the gift of a new home to wounded veterans and their families across the country.\nAn enthusiastic group of more than 100 well-wishers, including the North Stafford HS AFJRROTC Color Guard, Combat Veteran Motorcycle Association riders, Hampton Roads 82nd Airborne Division veterans, friends, family members, PulteGroup employees, and trade partners were on hand to greet Sgt. White as he arrived to the dedication ceremony for his new home.\n\"It has truly been an honor to build this home for Sgt. White who served our country with honor and integrity,\" said Jarod Blaney, Mid-Atlantic division president of PulteGroup, which is the parent company of Centex, Pulte Homes and Del Webb. \"The home is a way for us to say thank you for what Matthew has done for our country and what he has gone through on his path to recovery. We respect his bravery and dedication, fighting spirit and his giving heart, and want to join the Dumfries community in welcoming him with open arms.\"\nDuring Sgt. White's second deployment to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom, he was injured on a dismounted foot patrol by an I.E.D, had countless surgeries and eventually had his right leg amputated from the knee down. In addition to competing in many running and sporting events, Matthew works with the Senate Committee on Veteran's Affairs and Board of Veteran's Appeal in the FOIA office in order to help other veterans and their families.\nMore than 50 national and local contractors, trade partners and PulteGroup employees donated time, money and resources to build the 1,800+ sq. ft. townhome. In particular, the home's furniture was donated by Rachael Ray from her new Rachael Ray Home collection. Sgt. White is expected to share his story of recovery and transition to civilian life on a special Veterans Day segment on the Rachael Ray Show Friday, November 11, 2016.\nIn advance of the event, Sgt. White also encouraged attendees to bring nonperishable food and pet supplies in support of various local community organizations. Guests as well as Pet Valu generously gave more than 100 pounds of donations and money to support Sgt. White's outreach efforts.\n\"I'm very involved with several anti-animal cruelty campaigns and I wanted this event to also be an opportunity to gather donations for the local shelters and rescues in the area,\" said Sgt. White.\nSgt. White applied for the new home through Operation FINALLY HOME, a 501(c)(3) organization that honors wounded, ill and injured veterans and widows of fallen soldiers with new custom-built, mortgage-free homes.\nPulteGroup's Built to Honor™ program was launched in 2013 to recognize and thank returning military personnel who have been injured during their term of service by providing mortgage-free homes to veterans and their families. Built to Honor works in partnership with nonprofit organizations, such as Operation FINALLY HOME, to identify veteran candidates. Follow Built to Honor on Twitter: @BuiltToHonor.",

      "text": "Making its debut last weekend in the black/grey/white colorway, the Nike LunarCharge is now showcased in a new colorway that we all knew was coming.\nSeen above is Nike Sportswear’s latest silhouette taking on the ubiquitous Triple Black color scheme as every portion of the shoe has been done in black, including the upper, laces, tongue, midsole and outsole. The only touch of contrast comes with the subtle pops of volt that have been added on the outsole.\nThe Nike LunarCharge in Triple Black is expected to make its debut overseas on December 9th with a stateside release coming soon after. Keep it locked to Kicks On Fire for updates.\nvia: thesolesupplier \nAuthor’s Take I’ve expressed that I think the LunarCharge has potential, but I don’t think I would actually buy this Triple Black colorway.

By Brandon Richard \nWhile we're still waiting to see what's next for LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, Nike Basketball has another signature sneaker to unveil at some point this season. \nFirst spotted over the summer, Paul George's Nike PG 1 will officially launch soon. Here's an early look at the upcoming release, a low-top performance model equipped with bootie construction and a midfoot cross-strap. This time, we see the shoe in a Pacers colorway that will likely be hitting the court ahead of the drop. \nThe original speculation was that the PG 1 would launch over the summer for $110, but those plans have obviously changed. We'll keep you posted on this story as it develops. Watch Now",

By Brendan Dunne \nNike will bring Flyknit materials to its most rugged of models via the new ACG Zoom Tallac Flyknit , a redux of 2008's Zoom Tallac. This time around the shoe features Flyknit on its upper around the lace system. \nThe NikeLab model won't come cheap, clocking in at $275. The price isn't exactly surprising though when one considers the Flyknit material, Zoom Air cushioning, and other sneaker tech utilized. \nThe NikeLab Air Zoom Tallac Flyknit will debut in the three colorways shown on Dec. 1 via Nike here . \nThis take on the Zoom Tallac was introduced alongside a collection of new NikeLab ACG apparel, which readers can see in full detail here .

In the year 2000, Jezign applied for a patent on a new way to illuminate the soles of athletic footwear through a manual switch. Recently, footwear companies have begun to pop up left and right with watered-down, cheap knockoffs. It is easy to distinguish some of these imitation shoes from genuine Jezign footwear because these knockoffs do not have an air compartment in the sole which house the lights in the way Jezign does. Instead, they glue the lights all the way around the sole, similar to a do-it-yourself experiment. Also, most of the knockoff shoes do not have their lights incorporated on performance footwear such as Running or Basketball. There is also no gimmicky blinking or flashing of the lights on Jezign's footwear but, rather, steady light once the switch is activated. Don't be fooled by these cheap knockoffs and do not be fooled by others who lay claim to this concept. Jezign footwear ha...Originally collected by WSHH ( less ) Embed: URL: Tags:",

      "text": "Striking Nike Hypervenom Phinish 2016-2017 Dark   Nike today unveiled an interesting colorway for its Hypervenom Phinish football boots to close the year and as one of the last releases of the second-gen Hypervenom cleats overall. The black and blue Nike Hypervenom Phinish soccer boots are included in the Nike Dark Lightning pack . The likes of Gonzalo Higuaín, Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney are expected to switch to the predominantly black Nike Hypervenom cleats once they are unveiled, while Nike of course also unveiled a Hypervenom Phantom II variant for those who prefer the heightened Dynamic Fit collar. That version will be worn by players such as Edinson Cavani, Robert Lewandowski and Riyad Mahrez. Nike Hypervenom Phinish - Black / Volt / Paramount Blue   November 2016 Nike Hypervenom Phinish soccer boot colorway from the Nike Dark Lightning collection.   the new Nike Hypervenom Phinish boots boast an intriguing graphic design on both sides, roughly following the inspiration of the second-gen Hypervenom's trademark splatter zig-zag graphic. The visual detailing features Paramount Blue as well as Volt, while all brandings, including two sizable Swooshes at the front and back, are white. The sole plate of the black and Volt Nike Hypervenom 2016-17 boots is solid Volt. Tech-wise, the Nike Hypervenom Phinish Dark Lightning in black, green and blue boasts a tongue-less construction, while its thin NikeSkin upper features a honeycomb-like structure and is designed to ease the break-in period and provide a flexible and responsive feel. The outsole of the last Nike Hypervenom Phinish boots in 2016 comes with conical studs for rotational agility and is in fact identical to the one used for the higher-priced Nike Hypervenom Phantom II cleats. Available   the black Nike Hypervenom Phinish 2016-2017 Dark Lightning cleats retail at $200 (€200, £160). Do you like this new Nike Hypervenom Phinish Dark Lightning colorway for 2016-2017?

      "text": "Only Nike! What Cristiano Ronaldo, Gerrard, Messi and Neymar Wore When They Made Their Professional Debut   Steven Gerrard today announced his retirement from professional football. We take a look at the boots worn by Steven Gerrard and the the three players in today's game who regularly receive signature cleats from their suppliers - Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar - inlcuding some surprises (Gerrard received one signature boot from Adidas for his last match at Anfield). Steven Gerrard - Nike Tiempo Premier 5 Steven Gerrard, who been wearing Adidas Predator boots for almost his entire career, made his professional debut for Liverpool wearing boots not from the Three Stripes but from the Swoosh - the back, white and blue Nike Tiempo Premier soccer cleat, released for the 1998 World Cup. However, Steven Gerrard should score his first goal wearing Adidas Predator boots one month later, and remained true to Adidas until the end of his career (He wore the Predator for more than 15 years before Adidas discontinued the boot silo in 2014; Steven Gerrard switched to the Ace). Steven Gerrard scored his first goal for Liverpool as professional wearing Adidas Predator boots in 1998 Cristiano Ronaldo - Nike Mercurial Vapor After impressive performances at youth level with Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo made his professional debut aged 17 for Sporting wearing the Nike Mercurial Vapor. He never laced up in another silo since then, which is a big exception, to say at least. Lionel Messi - Nike Air Zoom Total 90 III Lionel Messi made his Barcelona debut exactly 12 years ago, wearing Nike's Total 90 cleat. 17-year-old Leo Messi made his first La Liga appearance for Barcelona in 2004 wearing the Chrome, Black and Red Nike Air Zoom Total 90 III boots. Messi's La Liga debut came two years before he agreed a sponsorship deal with Adidas, and 11 years before he received his own signature silo. Messi had signed with Nike at the age of 14 after his move from Newell's Old Boys to Barcelona. After breaking into the first team Messi also made a number of matches in the Tiempo Legend and Mercurial Vapor II before switching to the Adidas +f50.6 TUNIT in March 2006 as he signed a reported £2million five-year deal with Adidas. Neymar - Nike Mercurial Vapor III Neymar has been wearing no other boot than the Nike Mercurial Vapor for Santos. Neymar made his professional debut in 2009 wearing a pair of Nike Mercurial Vapor football boots at the age of 17. And while the Brazilian superstar since then has become the face of the all-new Nike Hypervenom, he still wears a version that is more a Mercurial than a Hypervenom (Read more about Neymar's camouflaged boots ). Do you also still miss the Total 90? Let us also know in the comments below.",

Since then it's been seen on the feet of Marty McFly , released as a mid-top and given a Nike SB spin – which led to 2009's collaboration with Supreme – en route to establishing it as an iconic Nike model. Fast forward to now and the Bruin has received a retro suede update that comes in four subtle colorways with monochrome uppers and a white Swoosh.

      "text": "28 Comments \nIn the late 1980s, Nike produced a series of commercials featuring Michael Jordan and Mars Blackmon, the star of the 1986 film She's Gotta Have It , played by Spike Lee. \nThe iconic spots, which featured a Blackmon obsessed with the shoes Jordan wore were instant successes and helped create the sneaker industrial complex we live with today. \nOhio State has it's own Shoe, and it's pretty damn impressive in its own right, so the Buckeyes cut their own version of the spot featuring offensive lineman Michael Jordan and Brooklyn native Curtis Samuel. \nTo see the video, it's obvious. Ohio State has a player named Michael Jordan and a star from Brooklyn who can rock a hat and play Blackmon perfectly. But it's the execution that makes this Buckeye production. \nHow does Ohio State's version compare to the original? You can judge for yourself:",

      "title": "Nike’s “La Silver” Air Max 97 Returns This December",
      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 2 images from this gallery. \nEarlier this year, Nike treated Italian sneakerheads to a special reissue of the OG Nike Air Max 97 .\nFeaturing tricolore Italiano detailing, the drop was limited to select Italian shops, but we had a feeling that wouldn’t be the last Air Max 97 sighting of the year. Now, Nike confirmed our suspicions by declaring a wider release of the 97 in a “La Silver” colorway, just in time for the silhouette’s 20th anniversary.\nTo complement the announcement, several big names in the Italian fashion community shared their first impressions of the shoe with Nike.\n“I have to admit that I first found them horrendous. But that kind of fascinating horrendous: brutto-bello. Freaks. Their aesthetic was totally outside of our visual vocabulary. At the time sneakers were worn very infrequently in fashion.”\nMichela Gattermayer, Editor-in-Chief, ELLE (1989-2004) “As a graffiti writer it was cool because you could get a photo taken of yourself with a flash in front of a piece in a tunnel and you’d be all covered up but there was a crazy glare coming from your shoes. They made you feel like you were doing some space age stuff when you went out at night.”\nSha Ribeiro, Photographer “I can remember that you had kids turning up wearing AM97s for both the hip-hop and the hardcore nights. As an observer from the decks I thought that the AM97s were much better suited to the hardcore scene where everybody had a very clean look, was very aerodynamic, with their shaved heads and 180 + BPM music and their whole cult of synthetic velocity.”\nRiccardo Balli, DJ The sneaker will see a Western European release on December 14.\n",

      "text": "\nAfter introducing its Lunar Force 1 Workboot with Flyknit earlier this year, Nike is ramping up the colorways for the winterized shoe. The burgundy and black hues on the latest silhouette give a dramatic upgrade to the design, as the leather and Flyknit panels provide construction and breathability along the upper. A nod to Nike's iconic Air Force 1 Mid form can be seen via the straps, tongue and pull tab, complete with debossed branding throughout. Balanced atop a black Lunarlon midsole and rugged outsole, head over to select retailers like KITH to purchase a pair for $200 USD now. \nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "title": "A Pacers Colorway of Paul George’s Upcoming Nike PG 1?",
      "text": "It’s widely believed that Paul George is next in line to get his own signature sneaker from Nike as he’s been patiently waiting his turn for quite some time now. With James Harden’s departure to adidas it makes perfect sense for Nike to make PG13 their latest signature athlete.\nUp above we take an early leaked look at what is believed to be George’s first signature shoe with the Swoosh, the Nike PG 1 . This specific colorway comes covered in an Indiana Pacers color scheme as the shoe features a blue upper with white and yellow accents.\nNo solid information is available yet as far as a release date, but the Nike PG 1 should be coming sooner rather than later. Stay tuned to Kicks On Fire for updates.\nvia: US11 \nAuthor’s Take It’s kind of hard to give my opinion based off of this first early look. Sort of reminds me like a Nike Basektball silhouette that already exists. I’ll wait to we get a better look at the PG 1.\n\nThe post A Pacers Colorway of Paul George’s Upcoming Nike PG 1? appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

Instead of going with the usual leather construction, we now see the model done in a smooth suede build done in several different tonal colorways.\nComing in your choice of Red, Grey, Green or Blue suede, each pair is offset by the White noted on the leather Nike Swoosh and heel, as well as on the entire sole unit. Tonal laces and a White tongue tag round out the look of the shoe. Get a good look at the shoe above and just know that all the pairs are available internationally (for approximately $115 USD), with a stateside releases date being imminent.\nvia: SNKRS \nAuthor’s Take Very dope.

Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports \nThanksgiving time puns usually revolve around turkey, but Ohio State football went in a different direction for its punny Thanksgiving Day promotion of Saturday’s Ohio State-Michigan matchup: Michael Jordan and shoes. \nMichael Jordan is famous for shoes (among other things). Ohio State is famous for Ohio Stadium which is nicknamed “The Shoe” (among other things). Ohio State also has a linebacker named Michael Jordan. \nGot it all? \nNow that we’ve got that out of the way, we can talk about how Ohio State’s Jordan and teammate Curtis Samuel starring in a remake of the famous 1989 Mars Blackmon Nike commercial with Spike Lee and the Bulls’ Michael Jordan. We'll let @CurtisSamuel4__ & @BigMikeJ73 rewind all the way back to 1989 for this one...It's gotta be #TheShoe . — Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) November 24, 2016 \nThis isn’t the first time athletes have spoofed the famous shoe commercial, such as when Blake Griffin, a.k.a. Mars BlakeMan, promoted USC tight end Jordan Cameron prior to the 2011 NFL Draft. \nHere’s the original with Spike Lee and Michael Jordan. You’ve got to hand it to Ohio State here over Griffin and Cameron for the better remake.  ",

      "text": "Pink Next-Gen Nike Hypervenom Phantom III 2017 Boots Leaked   Nike will release a predominantly pink colorway for the next-gen Nike Hypervenom Phantom III soccer boots next year. The pink Nike Hypervenom Phantom 3 cleats are expected to be released in late spring or early summer 2017. In case you missed the news, the low-cut edition of the third-generation Nike Hypervenom won't bear the 'Phinish' name - instead it will be known as the Nike Hypervenom Phantom III. In addition, Nike will launch a version with a heightened collar, named the Nike Hypervenom Phantom 3 DF (short for Dynamic Fit). Nike Hypervenom Phantom III - Pink / Grey / Navy This image shows the Phelon takedown of the pink Nike Hypervenom 3 football boots. Employing the recurring split design of the Hypervenom 3, these new Nike Hypervenom Phantom III 2017 cleats are pink on the out- and grey on the inside. Complementing this quite unusual base composition are dark blue Swooshes that sit on the inside front and outside rear of the pink Nike Hypervenom 3 boots. Like their predecessors, the new Nike Hypervenom III 2017 boots are designed to offer lockdown, improve ball touch and support dynamic motion. They are made for fast wingers and agile attackers. Becoming the first low-cut Nike soccer cleat to feature a Flyknit upper, the Nike Hypervenom Phantom 3 also introduce an engineered texture that's somewhat similar to the original upper of the first-gen Hypervenom in its pattern and shape. The sole plate of the Nike Hypervenom 3 was updated to include chevron studs, mostly on the inside, while the trademark offset lacing was retained and only slightly adjusted. As mentioned before, the pink Nike Hypervenom Phantom III boots are expected to be launched sometime in the first half of 2017. They have a recommended retail price of $250.

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 11 images from this gallery. \nWith so many kicks on the market, finding the best of the best calls for a little bit more than just strolling into the shoe store with some spare change. To help you isolate the best of the bunch, our Sneaker of the Week is a chance for us to highlight some shoes that you need to add to your rotation. Thanks to some help from our partner Finish Line , we’re calling out the best sneakers on shelves today. \nNike’s not afraid to innovate—taking a look at the brand’s technological advancements is nothing short of impressive. In the past four years, the revolutionary Flyknit process has become one of the brand’s most influential uppers, adorning plenty of sneakers bearing the Swoosh. Technological sport advancements aside, Nike’s been able to harness its unique textile to create shoes that are simply more exciting to see as they sprint by on the sidewalk. While several shoes in Nike’s roster have Flyknit embedded within their design, the Zoom Flyknit you see here is one of the standout continuations of a sport-meets-style lineage.\nThe benefits of Flyknit have certainly been expounded upon in the past, and rest assured that the Zoom Flyknit 6 is no different in that regard. Breathable as it is light, the Flyknit upper stabilized by Flywire lacing ensures a practically-weightless shoe (especially compared with other trainers). The knit may feel like a knit sock, but it still packs a significant punch. Speaking of packing a punch, it’s near impossible to miss such a vibrant Flyknit (which, according to Nike, is “micro-engineered”). It’s that technology detail that allows the upper to seamlessly gradate between a variety of colors—from royal blue, to volt green, to a turquoise toebox—while still maintaining the tactile texture that you’d expect from a knit.\nWhile running shoes are almost a dime-a-dozen as of late, it’s refreshing to see such an expressive option from the team behind the swoosh. While lacing these up is certainly a fashion statement, you’ll be better off keeping the rest of your ‘fit a little more low-key. After all, you don’t want a cluttered wardrobe ensemble to distract from sneakers this fresh, right?\nWhether you’re flexing your muscles during a training session, or simply trying to flex on your friends, the Zoom Flyknit Streak is certainly one to add to your rotation. Naturally the Phylon foam midsole and Zoom Air unit ensure that every stride feels responsive, but it also ensures that you’ll be reaching for these kicks wear after wear. With a streamlined bottom that recalls the sculpted sole found on the Nike Racer, the Zoom Flyknit Streak is just as sleek as its Nike Racing counterparts.\nIt’s hard not to fall for Flyknit when you see it on one of Nike’s sneakers. It’s cutting edge design isn’t just aesthetically pleasing, it also helps to literally shape a lighter, more breathable shoe. Sure, the Zoom Flyknit Streak is one that’s designed around running races, but when it comes to the stack of style points with this sneaker, you don’t want to get left in the dust.\n",

      "text": "A while back, Nike dropped a handful of AF1 Lows done in different reflective camo uppers. One of those happened to be the Desert Camo colorway you see above. Today we get a better look at that version of the camo pack.\nThe Nike Air Force 1 Low Reflective Desert Camo is done in an all-camo upper made up of Brown, Khaki and Green shades. Additional Khaki is placed on the Nike Swoosh, lining, tongue, laces and sole. Some nice pop is given to the shoe by way of the 3M reflective hits placed throughout the upper. Priced at $100, pick these up at select retailers today.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take It’s cool, but for the most part I stay away from the AF1 becuase it’s not too comfortable. Put this design on an AF1 with an Ultra sole and I’m on it.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post You Feeling The Nike Air Force 1 Low Reflective Desert Camo? appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

Latest revision as of 12:04, November 25, 2016 Buck : \" Take a gander at them moccasins. What kind of skins is them? \" Stubble : \" What's that writing mean … 'Nee-kay' … what is that, some sort of Injun talk or something? \" — Buford's gang in discussion over Clint's shoes Nike Footwear logo as seen in 2015. Power laces, to make the art of shoelacing as dead as using a rotary phone dial. \nNike is a shoe company that was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, before changing to its current brand – named for the ancient Greek goddess that personified victory or triumph – in 1971 . \nMarty McFly wore white Nike sneakers with a red \"swoosh\" symbol on them in 1985 , and usually wore them until he could change to shoes that were appropriate for the time period. Doc Brown wore a pair of brown Nikes while at Twin Pines Mall on October 26 , 1985 . \nSince Nike shoes did not exist in 1955 , and would not be marketed until 1971, Marty wore a pair of Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star sneakers while in that time period. In 1885 , however, Marty ended up wearing his Nikes after throwing his cowboy boots away in order to distract a bear , causing Buford's gang to notice what they thought was strange writing on them — during which Stubble was heard to pronounce the name as \"Nee-kay\". \nBy 2015 , Nike was manufacturing power-lacing shoes known as the Nike MAG , which were worn by Marty Jr. and Marty Sr. when he had to pose as his future son. Behind the scenes Edit Although Nike shoes figured heavily in product placement in all three films, Converse shoes got equal time in the first film. Although manufacturers' names were removed from much of Marty's clothing ever since the first film, Buford 's gang would have actually seen the word Nike on the tongue of each shoe. The brand name is barely visible at 16:34 on the DVD , as Doc speaks about fresh batteries for the walkie-talkies prior to Marty's departure from 1955. Marty's jeans cover the top of the shoes as he walks down the train tracks. Though an 1885 reader might have mentally pronounced \"Nike\" to rhyme with \"like\", \"Nee-kay\" would be the Spanish pronunciation, as well as a product placement mention for a viewer who didn't recognize the brand of Marty's shoes. In the fourth draft and the novelization , and perhaps in scenes filmed with Eric Stoltz , Marty wore green Nike shoes, which were as out of place in 1955 as his down vest (\" life preserver \") would be on film.

      "text": "We’re Still Hoping For A Nike ‘La Silver’ Air Max 97 Stateside Return Fashion Ashley Monaé @chicmonae   4:30   CREDIT: Nike \nFor those still sick over the fact that Nike gifted Italy-based sneakerheads to an exclusive reissue of the OG Air Max 97 on Dec. 2, don’t fret. As many of us suspected, that won’t be the last sighting of the silhouette this year. \nNike recently announced a wider release of the 97 in a “La Silver” colorway to celebrate the sneaker’s 20th anniversary. And staying true to it’s iconic look, the upper still shines in metallic hues of silver and grey along with a red Swoosh and black tongue and heel tabs. READ: Nike Confirms Release Date And Price For Nike Hyper Adapt 1.0 \nIn collaboration with the big news, a number of big names in the Italian fashion community shared their first impressions of the shoe with Nike. DJ Riccardo Balli spoke on how the silhouette appealed to the masses, saying, “I can remember that you had kids turning up wearing AM97s for both the hip-hop and the hardcore nights.”“As an observer from the decks I thought that the AM97s were much better suited to the hardcore scene where everybody had a very clean look, was very aerodynamic, with their shaved heads and 180 + BPM music and their whole cult of synthetic velocity,” he continued. \n“La Silver” will have its Western Europe release on Dec. 14. While there’s no word on a stateside release, we’ve got our fingers crossed that we too will have the chance to cop these kicks.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nThe Dow enjoyed another week of substantial gains following optimism about Donald Trump’s policy proposals. Meanwhile, economic data released over most of the week was encouraging. Oil prices moved higher following speculation that OPEC’s member countries and Russia were close to reaching an agreement on curtailing crude output. Additionally, prospects of the Fed hiking rates in December continued to improve. \nLast Week’s Performance \nThe Dow decreased 0.2% last Friday after rising rate hike possibilities boosted the dollar to its best settlement in 13 years. Rate hike chances gained momentum following expectations that the Trump Presidency will adopt new policies including expansionary infrastructure spending and tax cuts. \nSooner than expected rate hike chances boosted the dollar. According to Fact Set, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) settled at its best level since April 2003. Rising dollar weighed on export-based large-cap companies and eventually on broader markets. Moreover, oil prices fell after Baker Hughes Incorporated ( BHI - Free Report ) reported that U.S. oil rig counts experienced its biggest increase in 16 months. \nThe index increased 0.1% over last week. Most of last week’s gains came on the back of encouraging domestic economic data and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s testimony. Yellen indicated that a rate hike after next month’s policy meeting was definitely on the table. \nThe Dow This Week \nThe index increased 0.5% on Monday following strong surge in oil prices and sell-off in the dollar. Oil prices jumped following speculations that major OPEC members and Russia were likely to reach a deal to curtail crude production by the end of this month. Moreover, countries like Iraq and Iran, who were previously unwilling to limit crude production, also backed the deal. \nSeparately, the dollar fell yesterday primarily because the greenback became vulnerable to a sell-off after registering a rapid increase over the last ten sessions. Thin trading ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday also weighed on the greenback. \nThe index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following rising expectations from Donald Trump’s policy proposals and encouraging housing data. The Dow moved past the psychological levels of 2,200. Markets moved up following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies, including expansionary infrastructure spending, environmental and financial deregulation and tax cuts. \nMoreover, Trump said that bilateral trade deals will be negotiated in order to “bring jobs and industry back onto American shores. Existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.60 million, to reach the highest annualized rate in more than nine years. \nThe index increased 0.3% on Wednesday after strong durable orders and Donald Trump’s economic agenda boosted the industrial sector. The Dow reached a record high level for the third straight session following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies to improve the economy. Moreover, orders for durable goods in the U.S. registered its best increase in a year. \nFurther, minutes from the Fed’s November meeting showed that following labor market improvements and higher inflation, policy makers were in agreement that interest rates should be raised \"relatively soon\". Markets were closed on Thursday following the Thanksgiving Day holiday. \nComponents Moving the Index \nNIKE, Inc. ( NKE - Free Report ) announced a 13% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 18 cents per share.

      "text": "The Dow enjoyed another week of substantial gains following optimism about Donald Trump’s policy proposals. Meanwhile, economic data released over most of the week was encouraging. Oil prices moved higher following speculation that OPEC’s member countries and Russia were close to reaching an agreement on curtailing crude output. Additionally, prospects of the Fed hiking rates in December continued to improve.\nLast Week’s Performance \nThe Dow decreased 0.2% last Friday after rising rate hike possibilities boosted the dollar to its best settlement in 13 years. Rate hike chances gained momentum following expectations that the Trump Presidency will adopt new policies including expansionary infrastructure spending and tax cuts.\nSooner than expected rate hike chances boosted the dollar. According to Fact Set, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) settled at its best level since April 2003. Rising dollar weighed on export-based large-cap companies and eventually on broader markets. Moreover, oil prices fell after Baker Hughes Incorporated ( BHI - Free Report ) reported that U.S. oil rig counts experienced its biggest increase in 16 months.\nThe index increased 0.1% over last week. Most of last week’s gains came on the back of encouraging domestic economic data and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s testimony. Yellen indicated that a rate hike after next month’s policy meeting was definitely on the table.\nThe Dow   This   Week \nThe index increased 0.5% on Monday following strong surge in oil prices and sell-off in the dollar. Oil prices jumped following speculations that major OPEC members and Russia were likely to reach a deal to curtail crude production by the end of this month. Moreover, countries like Iraq and Iran, who were previously unwilling to limit crude production, also backed the deal.\nSeparately, the dollar fell yesterday primarily because the greenback became vulnerable to a sell-off after registering a rapid increase over the last ten sessions. Thin trading ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday also weighed on the greenback.\nThe index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following rising expectations from Donald Trump’s policy proposals and encouraging housing data. The Dow moved past the psychological levels of 2,200. Markets moved up following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies, including expansionary infrastructure spending, environmental and financial deregulation and tax cuts.\nMoreover, Trump said that bilateral trade deals will be negotiated in order to “bring jobs and industry back onto American shores. Existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.60 million, to reach the highest annualized rate in more than nine years.\nThe index increased 0.3% on Wednesday after strong durable orders and Donald Trump’s economic agenda boosted the industrial sector. The Dow reached a record high level for the third straight session following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies to improve the economy. Moreover, orders for durable goods in the U.S. registered its best increase in a year.\nFurther, minutes from the Fed’s November meeting showed that following labor market improvements and higher inflation, policy makers were in agreement that interest rates should be raised \"relatively soon\". Markets were closed on Thursday following the Thanksgiving Day holiday.\nComponents Moving the Index \nNIKE, Inc. ( NKE - Free Report ) announced a 13% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 18 cents per share. The new dividend, applicable for Nike’s Class A and B shares, will be paid on Jan 3, 2017, to shareholders on record as of Dec 5, 2016. Notably, this represents the company’s fifteenth consecutive year of dividend hike, further underscoring its healthy cash flows and robust potential.\nAdditionally, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Nike repurchased 19 million shares for $1.1 billion in the last reported quarter, under its $12 billion share repurchase program approved in Nov 2015. With this, the company had repurchased about 39 million shares for roughly $2.2 billion under the program.

The cola giant currently owns approximately a third of its bottling in China, with the balance split roughly between Swire and China Foods Ltd., which is part of state-owned COFCO Ltd.\nPost the completion of the deal, COFCO will own and operate 18 bottling plants while Swire will own and manage 17 in Mainland China.

Johnson & Johnson has a Zacks Rank #3.\nThe approval came three months after a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was submitted in August. The FDA had granted breakthrough therapy designation to Darzalex for the combination use in July. Regulatory application for the indication is under review in the EU.

For one, economic data released this week has been extremely encouraging. Additionally, it is increasingly likely that an agreement on crude production cuts will be announced next week.\nThis where the crucial GDP report and data on personal spending and consumer confidence scheduled for release next week assume greater significance. In case these reports are positive in nature stocks could scale even greater heights in the days ahead.\nZacks' Best Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit \nToday you can gain access to long-term trades with double and triple-digit profit potential rarely available to the public.

      "text": "Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Nike Raises Dividend, Boeing-Textron JV Bags Defense Contract November 25, 2016, 02:30:00 PM EDT By Swarup Gupta, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nThe Dow enjoyed another week of substantial gains following optimism about Donald Trump's policy proposals. Meanwhile, economic data released over most of the week was encouraging. Oil prices moved higher following speculation that OPEC's member countries and Russia were close to reaching an agreement on curtailing crude output. Additionally, prospects of the Fed hiking rates in December continued to improve. \nLast Week's Performance \nThe Dow decreased 0.2% last Friday after rising rate hike possibilities boosted the dollar to its best settlement in 13 years. Rate hike chances gained momentum following expectations that the Trump Presidency will adopt new policies including expansionary infrastructure spending and tax cuts. \nSooner than expected rate hike chances boosted the dollar. According to Fact Set, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) settled at its best level since April 2003. Rising dollar weighed on export-based large-cap companies and eventually on broader markets. Moreover, oil prices fell after Baker Hughes Incorporated BHI reported that U.S. oil rig counts experienced its biggest increase in 16 months. \nThe index increased 0.1% over last week. Most of last week's gains came on the back of encouraging domestic economic data and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony. Yellen indicated that a rate hike after next month's policy meeting was definitely on the table. \nThe Dow This Week \nThe index increased 0.5% on Monday following strong surge in oil prices and sell-off in the dollar. Oil prices jumped following speculations that major OPEC members and Russia were likely to reach a deal to curtail crude production by the end of this month. Moreover, countries like Iraq and Iran, who were previously unwilling to limit crude production, also backed the deal. \nSeparately, the dollar fell yesterday primarily because the greenback became vulnerable to a sell-off after registering a rapid increase over the last ten sessions. Thin trading ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday also weighed on the greenback. \nThe index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following rising expectations from Donald Trump's policy proposals and encouraging housing data. The Dow moved past the psychological levels of 2,200. Markets moved up following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies, including expansionary infrastructure spending, environmental and financial deregulation and tax cuts. \nMoreover, Trump said that bilateral trade deals will be negotiated in order to \"bring jobs and industry back onto American shores. Existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.60 million, to reach the highest annualized rate in more than nine years. \nThe index increased 0.3% on Wednesday after strong durable orders and Donald Trump's economic agenda boosted the industrial sector. The Dow reached a record high level for the third straight session following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies to improve the economy. Moreover, orders for durable goods in the U.S. registered its best increase in a year. \nFurther, minutes from the Fed's November meeting showed that following labor market improvements and higher inflation, policy makers were in agreement that interest rates should be raised \"relatively soon\". Markets were closed on Thursday following the Thanksgiving Day holiday. \nComponents Moving the Index \nNIKE, Inc. NKE announced a 13% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 18 cents per share. The new dividend, applicable for Nike's Class A and B shares, will be paid on Jan 3, 2017, to shareholders on record as of Dec 5, 2016. Notably, this represents the company's fifteenth consecutive year of dividend hike, further underscoring its healthy cash flows and robust potential. \nAdditionally, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Nike repurchased 19 million shares for $1.1 billion in the last reported quarter, under its $12 billion share repurchase program approved in Nov 2015.

      "text": "To follow-up on the recent orange box theme, the shoe box-inspired Nike SB Dunk Low series continues with this Pink Box edition. \nEssentially draped in the vibrant pink hue which was utilized for SB boxes back in 2005, the low-top sneaker’s leather composition is complemented with accents of black prominent on the Swooshes, branding on the heel tab and outsole, while pristine white graces the inner lining, laces, tongue tab and midsole unit. \nFinally, shoe box logos debossed on the heels cap off its notable details and respective theme. \nPriced at $120, you can purchase this pair at select Nike retailers worldwide now. \nImages: Titolo \nAuthor’s Take If it was 2006, I would’ve bought this silhouette instantly. My days of collecting Dunks are over, but, this is one of the better iterations this year. The colorway is solid as well. \n\nThe post Now Available: Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",
