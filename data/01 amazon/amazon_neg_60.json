      "text": "Share \nIt has recently come to light via a chain of email correspondences that Amazon has been testing its drone technology in U.K. airspace for much longer than initially believed. \nThe correspondences were written between Amazon and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the organization responsible for regulating safety, economics and consumer protection for commercial aviation in the U.K. The 45-page correspondence was uploaded to the CAA’s website after someone filed a freedom of information request. \nAmazon has been in contact with the CAA since 2014 and has been testing drones in U.K. airspace since summer 2015. Before the release of the documents, most were under the impression that Amazon’s drones had only come to the U.K. in summer of 2016 . \nAmazon’s plans to deliver via drone were first announced in late 2013, but it has hit some barriers to rolling out the technology across the U.S. The FAA published rules in early 2015 that cut back on the use of autonomous drones and drones operated by an onboard camera for commercial use. \nThese rules required commercial drones to be operated in direct line-of-sight of operators, flying no higher than 500 feet and close enough that an operator can see the drone with no visual aids — vastly restricting Amazon’s drone testing and launching capabilities here in the States, despite consumer demand . \nBut in the U.K., the CAA granted Amazon special permissions to test its drone delivery technology in U.K. airspace. \nPerhaps in response, the U.S. changed its tune in late August of this year … sort of. The FAA loosened its restrictions a bit by allowing operators to fly drones without needing to obtain a costly and time-intensive pilot’s license. Instead, operators now need to pass an aeronautics exam before they are allowed to fly. \nAlphabet and Alibaba have also been experimenting with drone delivery technology in recent years.",

      "text": " 40AM from the fixing-things dept. Amazon says it will start capping the number of product reviews any customer can submit in a given week, limiting each person to five/week except for products that have been verified by the company as purchased by the reviewer . From a GeekWire report: Books, music and video are exempt from the limit, but the new cap applies to the rest of Amazon's vast online selection of products. It's the latest move by the e-commerce giant to police its online reviews, a critical resource used by many online shoppers to assess products before buying. The news comes during the peak holiday shopping season, the most important time of year for Amazon, as the company tries to get more people comfortable with doing more of their shopping online. An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed the changes in a message to GeekWire, and they're spelled out in Amazon's updated Community Guidelines.",

      "text": "  12:00 PM EST Console and Amazon Web Services Elevate Technology Partner Status Company's Impressive Growth Earns Console Upgraded Standard Global Partnership Level with AWS Direct Connect Service \nLAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - November 28, 2016) - AWS re:Invent - Console Connect Inc. , the enterprise software and interconnection platform that is changing the way businesses directly connect to their customers, vendors and partners, announced today that the company is now an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Standard Level Technology Partner. The upgrade is a result of Console's expanding success as a partner of the AWS Direct Connect program and highlights its growth as a software interconnection platform. \n\"We're proud to advance our technology to this higher tier as we continue to work with AWS on a more global level,\" said Jef Graham, CEO, Console. \"This enhanced partnership validates the work Console has put into establishing secure, high-performance and consistent access to AWS Direct Connect services across the globe, and we will continue to grow the reach of this connectivity through our partnership.\" \nAWS Partner Network (APN) Technology partners can achieve a higher performance tier based on product status, customer engagements and overall business investment in AWS. In order to advance from a Registered Partner to Standard Technology Partner status, Console grew its AWS practice and provided 110Gb worth of direct connect port capacity, equivalent to 200+ new customers to AWS customers. \nThis upgrade has earned Console additional partner benefits not available at the original Registered tier, which will help increase visibility of its interconnection platform and direct connect solutions to AWS. Along with this achievement, Console's open source technology, CloudRouter , will be listed on the AWS Marketplace portal, where qualified partners can market and sell their software to AWS customers. \nAWS Direct Connect customers connected to the Console platform gain access to a wide variety of destinations across the entire Console Partner ecosystem, in addition to AWS regional connectivity. Console Direct Connect service is currently available across multiple AWS regions, including US West, US East, US Central, EMEA and APAC. \nConsole will also be exhibiting at AWS re:Invent 2016 on November 28 - December 2, 2016 in Las Vegas as a Bronze sponsor at booth #2345. To set up a meeting, please contact Stephen Conners at . \nAbout Console Connect Inc. \nThe Cloud Connection Company \nConsole is a leading provider of global direct connect solutions, enabling its customers to privately access business-critical SaaS applications, cloud providers and other enterprises with the click of a button. \nThe Console platform delivers cloud connectivity through a unique blend of software and network infrastructure.

Black Friday a ‘Dud’ For Wal-Mart, Says MKM As expected, the holiday shopping orgy that began on Thanksgiving in the U.S., continued with Black Friday , and runs through today, with \"Cyber Monday,” is turning out to have been a better affair for online commerce outlets such as Amazon ( AMZN ) than it was for the brick-and-mortar proprietors. You wouldn't know if from the stock action today: Amazon is down $13.65, or 1.7%, at $766.72, while Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT ) shares are also down, off 8 cents at $71.15. The trade group National Retail Federation reports , based on a survey conducted with the help of Prosper Insights & Analytics, that the number of shoppers in the U.S. from Thanksgiving through Sunday was up slightly, at 154 million versus 151 million a year ago, and that “when it comes to where consumers shopped over the weekend, the survey found that 44 percent went online and 40 percent shopped in-store.” Shopping was most “popular” for online shoppers on Black Friday, which is when 74% of them did their shopping. The firm projects that \"122 million Americans plan to shop online on Cyber Monday, up from the 121 million who planned to participate last year.\"",

This is a relatively rare discount on the extremely powerful iPad Pro accessory that gives you more than just a stylus with which to navigate your iPad's interface. The Pencil is sensitive to both pressure and tilt, so it can adjust brush strokes, shading options and more depending how you are using it. In other words, it's a digital artist's dream.\n\nIf you aren't already an Amazon Prime member, you can try the service out for 30 days to take advantage of this discount.\nSee at Amazon \n",

      "text": "Apps & Games News by John Callaham 7 seconds ago \nThe team behind Google’s popular navigation mobile app Waze like to have some fun while guiding users to their destination. Today, the Waze team announced that for a limited time, users can get their directions from the hosts of the new Amazon Prime streaming TV series, The Grand Tour. See also: The best GPS app and navigation app options for Android April 14, 2016 \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will be telling you to turn left, right or if you are getting close to your home. If you are not familiar with the trio, they are the former hosts of the BBC’s worldwide hit car driving show Top Gear. In 2015, the BBC announced it would not be bringing Clarkson back to the show after he attacked a Top Gear producer. Both Hammond and May left as well, and Amazon snatched the trio up to launch a new car-oriented show, The Grand Tour. The first two episodes of the series are live on Amazon Prime now, and new episodes will premiere every Friday. As with Top Gear, the hosts drive some amazing vehicles and get into some over-the top races and events. \nIf you want to hear them making your drive to a new destination more pleasant, you can access their voices on the Waze app by going intoÂ Settings, then Sound and then Voice Language. Finally, you pick “Clarkson, Hammond & May” from the menu selection of voices. It will be available from now until February 5. ",

The saloon is supposed to get its official and proper launch on the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Don't Miss: $149.99 40-inch Sony KDL40R350D 1080p TV Cyber Deal on Amazon \nVW just shared a sketch in which one can easily see this majestic saloon car. The Geneva motor show will be held in March 2017 and the Volkswagen Arteon will be replacing the discontinued CC in this event. \nThis is one the very first all new model to arrive on the stand by the company. There were no new models introduced in the market from the past few months after the diesel emission scandal. \nIt looks like VW has worked hard to make sure that this saloon fulfills all the requirements of a car that will not be held responsible for any kind of scandal. \nAccording to Volkswagen, Arteon is based on the sketchy version of MQB platform. This means that this saloon will be 50mm longer than the discontinued CC four door coupe. \nThe CC was one of the lowest selling models of VW. This was one the main reasons for which it was discontinued among others. Till the year 2015, CC had sold only 4000 units only. \nThe car will have a storage capacity of 1700 liters with its rear seats folded down in order to make room for luggage. The car is premium salon thus will provide more legroom for second row passengers as compared to good old CC. \nThis Volkswagen Arteon is supposed to come along with BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. Thus we are pretty sure that it will be its rival and thus will bear a few similarities with it too. \nThe Arteon is supposed to come in a brand new seven speed DSG gearbox. It will be available in wither front wheel or four wheel drive. It is said that it will have a 3.0 liter V6 engine. \nCyber Monday 2016 is Here. Shop the best Cyber Monday Deals at:",

      "text": "Amazon \nWhen Amazon burst onto the crowded music-streaming market in October with its own competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, the question was how it would set itself apart.\nThe first crucial point it landed was on price.

And Amazon’s approach to recommending songs you’ll like takes the form of the company’s general philosophy: approachability mixed with a ton of data and selection.\nMassive selection When you open up Amazon Music Unlimited, there are thousands of playlists Amazon has created for you sitting there, some generated by algorithms and others by its editorial team.\nAmazon There’s not an infinite selection, but it would be a tall order to find the bottom of the well.\nThe huge selection is by design, Dave Dederer, head of programming and editorial, tells Business Insider. Amazon's position is that having as big a selection as possible benefits the customer. And having more playlists gives Amazon more granular data on what people respond to, which in turn makes the algorithms better over time, Dederer continues.\nWhen you scroll down a practically never-ending list of playlists and choose between “Awesome ‘80s Country Songs,” “Honky Tonk Heroes,” “Alabama and More,” or even “Tear in My Beer: Sad Country,” Amazon knows a bit more about the kind of country you are into.\nEnter the humans But Amazon’s algorithms aren’t the only things contributing to the company’s catalog of thousands of playlists. There’s also a bunch produced by Amazon’s editorial team, which looks to fill in gaps a computer might not be good at.\nAmazon An example is “Daily Digs,” which surfaces hidden gems, both new and old. “Songs not enough people have heard,” according to Amazon's Jeff Reguilon, whose team makes “Daily Digs.”\nWhile “Daily Digs” is hand-curated by Reguilon’s team, it doesn’t have a particular genre or demographic in mind. The idea is to be welcoming and not alienate anyone, Reguilon says. Generally, the Amazon team that puts together the playlists wants to steer away from imposing a particular musical vision onto anyone. The goal isn’t to be a musical authority or tastemaker.\nThat doesn’t mean the team isn’t obsessed with minute detail. Reguilon tells a story of trying to decide which version of “When a Man Loves a Woman” to put on a playlist. He sat there for three hours straight trying to parse the right one from dozens of options.\nThe future In all, Amazon’s approach to music curation fits snugly into the company’s broad approach.

Spotify found it with \"Discover Weekly,\" its hyper-personalized playlist that gives you a new set of tunes each week. As Amazon builds its trove of data, and sees what users respond to, that feature could certainly emerge.

      "text": "print Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy Amazon \nAnd the cloud is really just getting started, AWS CEO Andy Jassy told the Seattle Times' Ángel González . \nWhen González asked Jassy if AWS could ever become the biggest business within Amazon, Jassy cautiously said it could (emphasis ours): It would likely take time. But I do think it’s possible that in the fullness of time AWS could be the largest business in Amazon . Part of that is because, if you look at the market segments AWS addresses — infrastructure software, hardware, data center services, plus some capability to build further up stack as well — that’s trillions of dollars worldwide . It’s a very large opportunity and we’re very optimistic about where AWS will be in the long term. \nAmazon's cloud growth remains on a tear. On Monday, Amazon said that it had won yet another huge customer for its cloud, Matson the international shipping company. Matson has closed all four of its own data centers and moved all of its apps to Amazon's cloud, joining a growing list of companies who have done the same, going \"all-in\" with Amazon, in some cases nabbing those customers right out of cloud competitors' arms.

      "text": "Amazon goes a step further to battle counterfeit goods It's reportedly a major goal for the company in 2017. Share Save \nAmazon is getting even more serious about preventing the sale of counterfeit goods on its site. According to Bloomberg , the online retail giant is organizing teams in the US and Europe that will work with major brands to establish a registry of recognized sellers. It has also made fighting fakes a major goal for 2017, said Bloomberg's source. We've reached out to Amazon for confirmation, and have yet to hear back. \nBloomberg's sources say that the company's new teams will seek out brands, even those that don't sell through Amazon, to register with it. Then, it will require any marketplace merchant offering those items to prove they have the brand's permission to sell them online. The plan is to target thousands of big companies to get them to register, including brands that don't want to sell on Amazon , in part because of the prevalence of knockoffs. \nEarlier this year, the e-commerce giant reportedly start imposing hefty fees on independent sellers who wished to sell products from brands such as Adidas, Hasbro and Samsung. Those who wanted to list their items on Amazon's Marketplace had to provide invoices, no more than 90 days old, showing the purchase of at least 30 items, with at least five different products across the receipts. \nThese measures may seem drastic, but cracking down on counterfeit goods is important for Amazon. The company has seen discussions with the National Football League and Major League Baseball stall due to concerns over the online retailer's lack of control over fakes, Bloomberg's source said. If Amazon doesn't find a way to curb the problem, it could see business losses from unhappy vendors and shoppers.",

      "title": "Kevin Smith and Amazon are being sued over their Buckaroo Banzai TV series",
      "text": "Kevin Smith and Amazon are being sued over their Buckaroo Banzai TV series November 28, 2016 \nIt was a few months ago that an excited Kevin Smith announced he was developing a TV show based on the 1980s cult classic The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension , and it was revealed recently that he was partnering with Amazon Studios on the project . However, it might not go anywhere as far as MGM are concerned. \nMGM filed a suit against Smith and Amazon Studios over the development of Buckaroo Banza , citing that the original writer and director – Earl Mac Rauch and Walter Richter – do not own the rights. The duo claim they do, which is what led to the meetings with Smith and Amazon Studios about the TV show, and that they have had them since 2011. MGM, however, reputed this claim and say they have been working on their own version of the show since 2008. \nRauch and Richter’s agent Mark Lichtman claimed in July they owned the rights to Buckaroo Banzai , which prompted MGM to file a cease and desist. In August, Rauch and Richter’s attorney Kenneth Keller said, “We are not claiming the limited rights which MGM might own with respect to the single motion picture, Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension , although as is discussed below, there are certainly serious questions even as to the chain of title with respect to that picture and MGM’s rights associated with it. What my clients own are the overall rights to the world of Buckaroo Banzai , and all of the characters, themes and ideas associated with that world.” \nThe story goes that Rauch and Richter had pitched a TV show and sequel to MGM in the 1980s, which the studio turned down. “Critically… MGM passed on the opportunity to option or obtain any rights in Mr. Rauch’s larger property, including the other four episodes which he had written to the point or any other rights to the world of BUCKAROO BANZAI ,” continued Keller’s letter. “The Agreement itself specifically defines what MGM was contracting to acquire — a screenplay (based on a single episode of Buckaroo Banzai ) and two revisions — and the rights associated with that screenplay.” \nMGM, of course, see things differently and claim, “all exclusive rights under copyright to the screenplay and motion picture, and the characters, plots, themes, dialogue, mood, settings, pace, sequence of events, and other protected elements therein.” \nWhat this means for Kevin Smith and Amazon Studio’s project remains to be seen. Rauch and Richter claim they own the rights while MGM argue the pair signed them over and have paperwork to prove it.",

      "title": "Amazon preparing to banish fake products during 2017",
      "text": "By James Walker 57 mins ago in Technology Amazon has announced a new initiative to eradicate fake products and counterfeit sellers from its site. The retailer will introduce new policies that will make it harder for traders to sell fake goods on the site. It is also revising its reviews system. Amazon has been aware of the prevalence of fake products for some years, according to a report from Bloomberg today. Until now, it has done little to confront the problem, leaving brands frustrated as Amazon allows third-party sellers to abuse their trademarks. With the problem still growing, Amazon is said to be planning a company-wide effort in 2017 designed to \"aggressively\" remove fakes from its marketplace. Teams in the U.S. and Europe will work with manufacturers to create a \"registry to prevent fakes,\" a person \"familiar\" with the initiative told Bloomberg. Amazon will encourage all brands to list themselves in its registry, even if they do not sell on Amazon. Once a trademark name is registered, any marketplace seller who lists one of the products will be forced to provide proof they have the brand's permission. Manufacturers and brand owners will be given control of the situation. Amazon will come to them when a seller wants to list a product, instead of brands reporting counterfeit goods to Amazon and waiting for a response. In a statement to Bloomberg , Amazon said it is \"aggressively pursuing bad actors\" using its marketplace to sell fake goods. \"Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" the company added. Amazon's sudden commitment to eradicating fake goods comes after being criticised by major brands. According to Bloomberg , Major League Baseball and the National Football League were in discussions with Amazon about selling merchandise on its site. The conversations \"hit a standstill\" earlier this year when Amazon failed to demonstrate it could control fake marketplace products. In October, Apple publicly claimed that 90 percent of Apple-branded accessories on Amazon are fake. It filed a lawsuit against Mobile Star LLC, a company that produces counterfeit smartphone accessories. It expressed frustration at Amazon's acceptance of Mobile Star's products, noting that multiple user reviews suggested some products \"literally caught fire\" shortly after purchase. Faced with these criticisms, Amazon has been left with little choice but to finally take the situation seriously and begin a proactive approach to eradicating fake goods. It has already introduced some new policies, including a $1,500 fee for sellers who want to sell a major brand. The idea is that counterfeiters won't be willing to hand over the cash while established traders will notice a negligible financial impact as a consequence. Amazon has also announced a new limitation on user reviews of products that forms part of its clampdown on fakes. From today, people can only write five reviews a week of items not bought from Amazon. It should help to combat the proliferation of bogus reviews on the platform. The new rules do not apply to books.",

      "text": "It's kind of funny that after all these years, HDTVs and UHD TVs still almost always come with terrible sound quality. Display panels have gotten so much better than they used to be and designs have become slim and sleek. But the speakers TV manufacturers use are almost never any good. Luckily, a ton of companies now make sound bars and other home audio systems that offer killer sound in a compact, affordable package. And if ever there was a perfect time to purchase a new sound bar for yourself or for a friend or loved one as a gift, Cyber Monday 2016 is it.\nAmazon has tons of sound bars and home entertainment speaker systems on sale for Cyber Monday and Cyber Week this year, and we've collected the best deals right here in this post. It's important to note, however, that while some of these deals are valid all week long, other prices will only last until the end of the day today.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nAll of Amazon’s best Cyber Monday 2016 deals Walmart’s Cyber Monday sale kicks off right now – here are Sunday’s best deals Cyber Monday 2016 ",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.’s stock dropped Monday, which should come as no surprise to investors despite reports of a big jump in sales during the busiest online shopping day of the year.\nCyber Monday is a phrase that Shop.org coined in 2005, in an effort to create a Black Friday-like buzz for online retailers on the first Monday after Thanksgiving. Although Cyber Monday is no longer a one-day event for many retailers , it is still on track to retain its position as the top online shopping day , according to Adobe Digital Insights.\nAmazon’s stock AMZN, -1.49% shed 1.4% in midday trade. On the past 11 Cyber Mondays, the stock had declined six times, including the past three years in a row. The biggest one-day percentage decline was 5.2% on Dec. 1, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, while the biggest gain was 6.4% on Nov. 28, 2011. See table of Cyber Monday moves below.\nThe median one-day move has been a 0.2% decline, while the average move a slip of about 0.1%.\nMeanwhile, the selloff in the broader retail sector is almost exactly what history suggests should happen. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -0.69% slumped 1%, after falling on nine of the previous 10 Cyber Mondays since the ETF’s inception in June 2006. The median decline on down days was 1.9%, while the average drop was 2.5%.\nBlack Friday: Malls vs. Online Shopping (4:32) Black Friday and the holiday shopping season are \"make or break\" for many mall owners and brick-and-mortar stores nationwide as more consumers choose to shop online. Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL, which owns 73 malls in the U.S., and which chose to close its doors for Thanksgiving, explains what retailers must do to remain competitive on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero.

      "text": "Cyber Monday kitchen buys we're nabbing from Amazon 1 hour ago Image: Elizabeth Livermore/Getty Images Print These are the deals you want to check out for gifts and your own holiday baking plans Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media \nCyber Monday is here — got your wish list ready? We've pulled out a few kitchen items we like from Amazon. Looks like things are going fast, so check these out before they're gone. \nInstant Pot 7-in-1 for $69 \nFirst of all, have we told you enough times that everyone needs an Instant Pot pressure cooker? Because it's true. Several different models are on sale, but we want to point out the 7-in-1 multifunctional 6-quart version. Regular price is $120, but you can get it now for $51 off. \nMore: 12 reasons why pressure cookers are the new slow cookers \nKitchenAid 6-Quart Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer in Empire Red for $220 \nThis particular color is on super- sale — though other colors like this pink model are also on sale. But if you're flexible on the color, this is a steal. The professional-quality classic is 60 percent off the regular price of $550. \nBlendtec Total Blender, FourSide Jar, Black for $238 \nFor the juicing and smoothie-making person on your list, there's this solid workhorse that does it all, now at a 40 percent discount. \nRubbermaid High-Heat Scraper for $8 \nThis is one of the great, underrated, low-tech kitchen tools — I can't make scrambled eggs without a heatproof rubber scraper . Truth be told, I don't think this is actually on sale by much. You can get them elsewhere for a dollar more. But if you're already ordering a big-ticket item, this is a handy add-on you can later slip into someone stocking. \nMore: The ultimate NFL football team and snack-pairing guide \nMultifunction Food Kitchen Scale with Removable Bowl for $20 \nSerious bakers know scale measurements have an accuracy edge over cup and spoon measurements. And if you like using British or Australian recipes, a digital scale is a must. This one comes with a handy removable bowl and is half off. \nEllo Syndicate BPA-Free Glass Water Bottle for $13 \nThis is another add-on item that's not necessarily a steal in and of itself, but would make a great stocking stuffer. A glass water bottle is a bit of a luxury, a sweet way to treat the athlete on your list. \nAluminum commercial baking sheet for $12 \nHere's something to nab in anticipation of all the baking you'll do this holiday season. These Nordic Ware baking sheets are 40 percent off and will last you forever. Maybe throw in a silicone sheet while you're at it. \nMore: Gifts for the lazy gourmand in your life \n2 silicone ice cube trays for $9 \nOK, no one needs this, and don't give this as a gift. But — especially if you're into cocktails — these silicone ice trays that make extra-large cubes are pretty darn cool. Maybe you have some cracked plastic trays languishing in your freezer? Time for an upgrade; these are at a 71 percent discount. Tagged in",

      "text": "5 Amazon Cyber Monday toy deals to nab ASAP 2 hours ago Check out these Cyber Monday bargains before they're gone Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media \nMaybe you were in too much of a carb coma on Black Friday or the idea of attending a door buster doesn't appeal. Either way, it's not too late to snag a great deal or two before the holiday hysteria really kicks in. Here are a few deals we've found after scouring Amazon's Cyber Monday offerings. But hurry — these will be gone before you know it! Furby Connect Image: Amazon \nThe Furby’s back, and it’s better than ever. It has color LED eyes, for one, and larger ears. Look at it. It’s just cuter. And it’s connected (thus the name) using Bluetooth to receive updates when you’ve paired it to iOS, Android or Amazon Fire devices. The Furby Connect is a hot toy this year, and Amazon’s offering a Cyber Monday deal for the teal or pink versions. (At $50, it’s 50 percent off the MSRP of $100). Play-Doh Mega Pack — 36 Cans Image: Amazon \nDid you even know there were 36 different Play-Doh colors ? We did not. Kids of all ages dig Play-Doh, and at $17 for 36 cans (MSRP $25), why wouldn’t you snag these? Teamson Kids Kitchen Playset Image: Amazon \nFor kids who are serious about their pretend cooking time, this playset delivers. It’s a sturdy wooden structure made with lead-free paint and looks like it's built to help someone train for the Culinary Institute of America. And at $83 (down from MSRP of $229), you can’t find a better deal.",

      "text": "Amazon’s ‘Grand Tour’ Triples ‘Man in the High Castle’ Viewers (Exclusive) More We already knew that “The Grand Tour” debuted as Amazon’s top-watched original series to-date , but now we have a pretty good snapshot of just how badly it beat “The Man in the High Castle.” The former “Top Gear” guys’ new show more than tripled the opening weekend viewership of the revisionist history drama, which previously held Amazon’s record. Per measurement company Symphony Advanced Media, the highly anticipated “The Grand Tour” premiere earned 1.954 million viewers 18-49, the age range coveted by advertisers. Those numbers are inclusive of three days worth of delayed viewing, like all in this post. Comparatively, the first episode of “MITHC” premiered to 637,000 viewers, according to Symphony AM. That total is more than double Amazon’s now third-biggest original series, “Catastrophe” (274,000 debut demo viewers). Keep in mind, the “Top Gear” alums had a built-in audience, so this wasn’t a typical new series launch. Also Read: 'Amanda Knox' Ratings Are No Killer on Netflix, Firm Says Of course, Amazon’s internal viewership numbers would be better to have, but the streaming company’s not coughing those up. Symphony utilizes audio recognition software and a panelist’s cell phone microphone to count up tune-in. The Silicon Valley-based measurement company considers its TV Ratings to be stable after eight days of compiling data, though others in the industry have strongly waved off their accuracy . The series stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May doing what they do best — traveling the world and discussing anything and everything car-related. Clarkson, who is known for being impulsive and outspoken, got into hot water at “Top Gear” after he punched a producer; he later apologized for the incident and settled a lawsuit over the matter. “The Grand Tour” is releasing one episode at a time, unlike many streaming shows. Further episodes will be released weekly over the next 11 weeks for Prime members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, and the show will premiere worldwide for Amazon customers in over 200 countries and territories in December.

Amazon takes a few in its new series \"Good Girls Revolt,\" about a group of women who sue over their treatment at a male-dominated newsweekly in 1969-70. \nGenevieve Angelson plays Patti, a young journalist seen in the pilot marching to work through midtown Manhattan ... past a fairly large anti-Vietnam War protest. In December 1969? We can't find any record of such a protest during that month. However, six months later, in May 1970, New York was shaken by the Hard Hat Riot, when hundreds of construction workers attacked students protesting the shooting deaths at Kent State. \nPatti works at a magazine called News of the Week. Of course, there never was a major weekly by that name. But there was and is a magazine called Newsweek, which is where the real-life women described in the story (based on the book by Lynn Povich) worked. (Newsweek's print edition ended in 2012 but was revived two years later.) \nJim Belushi plays Wick, the cranky newsroom boss, who in the pilot, after a lot of arguing and hand-wringing, orders his staff to cover the violence at the Rolling Stones concert at the Altamont track in California. Small problem: Newsweek didn't cover the Stones' concert at all at the time, according to a 1970 piece in Rolling Stone (and neither did much of the rest of the mainstream media). \nMick Jagger and the Stones performed at Altamont on Dec. 6. That was a Saturday, which means the news of the violence would have broken over the weekend, and not on a busy workday, which is when the staff on \"Good Girls\" breathlessly discusses Altamont as if it's happening in real time. \nBut then chronology just isn't a strong suit for \"Good Girls.\" Wick at one point says that the indictment of Charles Manson happened the day before Altamont. Wrong again. Manson and his fellow cult members were indicted on Dec. 8, two days after Altamont. \nWell, at least we have a solid character in Nora Ephron (Grace Gummer), the late writer-director who, it turns out, really did work at Newsweek. Except, oops, Ephron worked there in the early 1960s, and in the mailroom, not as a writer. She had nothing to do with the gender-equality action the show dramatizes. But \"Good Girls\" does get one detail right: Ephron really did go to Wellesley College. \nEven the small details on \"Good Girls\" require some skepticism. At one point, a character says her boyfriend is going to take her to the \"Mark Rothko Retrospective at the Guggenheim.\" Nice! Except that art show was a cool thing to do ... in 1978, nearly a decade later. Oops, time for a cigarette break. \nEnjoy this gallery?",

      "text": "by Natália Carneiro Ardente, Átilla Colombo Ferreguetti, Donald Gettinger, Pricila Leal, Ana Cristina Mendes-Oliveira, Fernanda Martins-Hatano, Helena Godoy Bergallo\nThe Carajás National Forest contains some of the largest iron ore deposits in the world. The majority of the minerals are found below a plant community known as Savana Metalófila, or “Canga”, which represents only 3% of the landscape within the Carajás National Forest (CNF). The aim of our study was to understand the diversity of community of non-volant small mammals in the two predominant vegetation types: Ombrophilous Forest and Canga, and to examine how mining impacts these communities. Sampling was conducted from January 2010 to August 2011 in 11 sampling sites divided by the total area of Canga and 12 sampling sites in the forest, totalizing 23 sites. Of these, 12 sites (Canga and Forest) were considered impacted areas located close to the mine ( ",

      "text": "Amazon.com has dozens of deals on items this Cyber Monday. You could pick up a Fire tablet for just $33.33 or the Echo Dot for $39.99 Also on sale this Cyber Monday, it seems: Amazon’s shares.\nShares of the online retailer slipped $12, or 1.5%, to $768 on Monday. The stock is now down nearly $80 from its recent high of $847 less than two months ago. The drop in shares of Amazon amzn come as analysts are saying that this Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest ever , hitting a record $3.3 billion in sales, up nearly 10% from a year ago.\nSo what gives?\nWell, while near 10% growth sounds good, and would be great for a giant traditional retailer like Walmart wmt , it would actually be relatively slow for Amazon. Sales at the online retailer are expected to rise 25% in the fourth quarter from a year ago. The expectation of huge sales growth is built into Amazon’s enormous stock market valuation of $365 billion, or 176 times its last 12 months of earnings. So a 10% jump would actually be a big disappointment.\nIn the past year, giant retailers, Walmart in particular, have put more and more emphasis on growing their online sales. Walmart and Target tgt this year offered bigger discounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to combat Amazon. Research firm Market Track, based on holiday circulars, found that Walmart was offering an average discount of 39% this year, up from 35% last year. Target is offering average discounts of 38% during the post-Thanksgiving shopping spree, vs. 36% a year ago.\nThis is forcing Amazon to match as well. It says it is offering deals on 75,000 items on its website this week . And this comes at a time when investors are betting that Amazon will be able to turn its massive sales into profit, as much as $4.8 billion this year, and $6.9 billion next.\nThe good news is that the fastest growing portion of its business, web services, is not as dependent on Cyber Monday traffic, or at least traffic directly to Amazon. Still that only makes up about 10% of Amazon’s total business. And if the company increasingly finds itself in even more of an online price war than its already in, investors may not be getting much of a discount on the company’s shares at all.",

      "text": "Shop Now: Amazon's Best Cyber Monday Deals The divorce rate in U.S. has fallen for the third year in a row, bringing it to its lowest level since 1980. \nDivorces rates in United States have dropped to their lowest levels for 35 years, suggesting that marriages in the country are stronger today than they have been in the long time. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Cyber Monday Deals \nAccording to the data from National Center for Family & Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University, the divorce rate has decreased by 25% since 1980 with just over one million couples got divorced in 2015. This is the third consecutive years when fewer marriages broke up or less number of couples sought divorce. \nMeanwhile, marriage rate has increased a bit from 31.9 in 2014 to 32.3 in 2015 for 1,000 unmarried women age 15 or older, reflecting that marriage rate is finally stabilizing after years of decline. \nThe results are based on the data collected by the research center every year and show that marriage rates are not consistent across United States. They vary from one state to another. \nWashington D.C. had the highest divorce rate in the country with nearly 30 marriages per 1,000 ended in divorce in 2015. The lowest divorce rate in the country was recorded in Hawaii, where only 11.1 percent of married couples got divorced last year. Researchers, however, are unable to pinpoint exact cause of decline in divorces. A number of factors can contribute in this trend like age, wealth and education. According to the research, young, wealthy and well-educated couples tend to stay together much more than those who lack these factors. \n“We’ve seen a decline of divorce among people who are younger and an increase among people who are older.” Wendy Manning, one of the researchers involved in the study told Bloomberg . \nOn the marriage side, Rhode Island has the lowest marriage rate while Utah has the highest.",

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- It's Cyber Monday and the year-end holidays are only a month away so shoppers are searching brick-and-mortar stores and the Internet for the best deals and gifts. Two of the heavyweights battling it out for sales this holiday season are Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Walmart   ( WMT ) .\n\"Amazon is the biggest problem for Walmart, and Walmart will be the biggest problem for Amazon,\" J. Rogers Kniffen Worldwide founder Jan Kniffen said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. J. Rodgers Kniffen Worldwide provides equity research, and financial and management consulting services for companies within the retail sector.\nBecause of the continued growth and push into e-commerce, Kniffen said Amazon will continue to find success but don't count out Walmart's ability to capture market share. \"Maybe Amazon's growth slows down a little bit,\" he suggested.\nFurthermore, Kniffen calls Walmart's Summer 2016 acquisition of Jet.com a \"win\" for the retail giant, and a valuable asset as it competes against Amazon. But, the move shouldn't hinder Amazon's growth.\n\"They get a third of all new growth in retail, and half of all new growth online. That's not going to change for a long time,\" Kniffen said.\n(Amazon.com is held in the Growth Seeker portfolio. See all of the holdings with a  free trial ).",

      "text": "Monday, November 28, 2016 11:54AM TRACY, Calif. (KGO) -- Today is Cyber Monday and experts say it's expected to top the previous four days in sales combined.However, the recent trend continues of shoppers spreading out their clicking and buying over more days. RELATED: Here's your shopping guide to Cyber Monday, Cyber Week deals The Amazon Fulfillment Center in Tracy is humming right along, although executives say the high demand is no longer limited to a day.\"It's really become more of a deal season. It's not just Cyber Monday, although Cyber Monday is still our busiest day of the year. There's also Black Friday, a lot of shopping on Thanksgiving, and really all through the holiday season,\" Amazon spokesperson Lori Richter said.Shoppers don't want to wait until Monday anymore to return to their office computer and its fast internet service. They're more mobile than ever and internet companies like Amazon are responding.\"You don't have to be tied down to your computer. Using the Amazon app, you can actually look at all the upcoming deals for the next 24 hours and mark which ones you want to watch,\" Richter said.They know you expect deliveries quicker too. That's where robots come in.The robots bring the product to an employee for packing.Not all Amazon centers have them - the ones that rely on people take much longer to ship products.\"When a customer presses buy to the time that we're getting item off the shelf, we're still really fast but it's a matter of couple hours. In this building, we've taken that time down to a few minutes,\" VP of Global Communications Craig Berman said. We are at the enormous Amazon facility in Tracy where Cyber Monday is in full effect! Expect >629 orders per second! pic.twitter.com/mWjjFknzRK — Amy Hollyfield (@amyhollyfield) November 28, 2016 This is great on Cyber Monday. Last year on this day, Amazon got more than 54 million orders worldwide.\"That's 629 items per second last year, if you can imagine what this year might be, it's pretty compelling,\" he said.They believe today will be busier than last year. In Northern California, there are more than 3,500 extra employees on hand to help them with this busy season. Related Topics:",

      "text": "Amazon Gets Real About Fakes \nIt looks as though Amazon is finally doing something about counterfeiters . The company is clamping down on fake items by, among other things, putting more tools in place for manufacturers to report knock-offs and fake products. \nNow, the world's biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon's lack of control over fakes, the person said.",
