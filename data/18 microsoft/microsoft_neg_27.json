      "text": "By Cage Appleby Neowin LLC · 5 seconds ago \nRemember those intrusive notifications reported back in August that alerted you Google Chrome is draining your battery faster than Edge? Well, they're back. This time Microsoft is using Edge to grab attention from users who choose alternative browsers, promoting Edge as the 'safer' option. \nIn the past, Windows Tips has been used by Microsoft as a means to promote or educate users throughout the operating system. This feature has led to criticism that the company is skillfully attempting to promote features akin to advertisements, an example is the notification banner in the File Explorer that appeared in build 14901. Microsoft claims Windows Tips is a way for the company to inform users of new features that are available in the operating system, but to consumers, it may feel quite intrusive and disruptive. \nAccording to VentureBeat, Microsoft has started to introduce a new 'tip' this month that will alert users of Chrome and Firefox that Microsoft Edge is the safer option. The pop-up notification appears just above the Edge taskbar icon. The notification also states the browser blocks \"21% more socially engineered malware\". \nThankfully, Microsoft allows users to switch off this feature buried in the settings. To turn off informative notifications head over to Settings > System > Notifications > Disable \"Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows\". \nSource: Image via VentureBeat | WinBeta Tags",

      "title": "Microsoft Bets Big On Wind - Nasdaq",
      "text": "Microsoft Bets Big On Wind November 18, 2016, 08:27:00 AM EDT By Oilprice.com Shutterstock photo \nMicrosoft Corporation ( MSFT ) has always been known for their image of environmental protection but this may be their biggest validation to date. The tech company announced on Monday they are in the process converting their datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming to rely entirely on wind energy. Microsoft will be using three wind farms, two in Kansas owned by Allianz Risk Transfer AG, and the other by Black Hills Corp. in Wyoming. The farms will provide Microsoft with 178 megawatts and 59 megawatts of capacity in wind power respectively. \nMicrosoft uses datacenters to operate their cloud services. These facilities require an ample amount of electricity to function and the usage levels are only growing as the service becomes more conventional. Microsoft’s goal is to attain a level of 44 percent use of renewables by the end of the year. This is simply another dimension of competition for tech companies promoting cloud services. Amazon web services (AWS) hopes to achieve a level of 40 percent reliance on renewables by the end of the year . Google only taps into clean energy for 35 percent for their datacenters. \nBlack Hills Corp. is one of the two companies entering the contract with Microsoft. The publicly traded company disclosed on October 25th they would be offering a dividend for any of their shareholders prior to November 15th. The stock has been showing a downward trend since the announcement but will likely rebound based on the future success with their new partner. The company’s stock climbed 30 cents following Microsoft’s press release. Microsoft has always been considered a safe long-term investment. With an average earnings growth rate forecasted at 8.13 percent over the next five years, the company is generally a safe investment choice. \nUnder Microsoft’s agreement with Black Hills, any surplus power can be stored in backup generators and later distributed to the grid at a discounted rate. In terms of their public image, this will benefit both firms. Corporate promotion of renewable energy is becoming routine for industry leaders. Governments often provide tax cuts to these companies for taking the initiative and aligning their interests with global efforts. Bloomberg forecasts that the top 50 corporations that purchase solar and wind energy will have accounted for 63.4 gigawatts of total production added by 2025. \nThis can be chalked up as another victory for renewables as we slowly shift away from common power sources like coal and oil. Local Wyoming consumers will prefer this alternative, more eco-friendly source of power as opposed to power from the grid likely produced using power plants. On a larger scale, as we observe the nation moving away from fuel sources such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas, we can expect the price of these products to decline. Investors should write long-term futures in any of these sources as they are replaced. To hedge their bets, individuals should buy green ETFs, made up of environmentally friendly corporations.",

      "title": "Red Hat CEO on Microsoft, Google, and Cutting Edge Software - Fortune",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Red Hat CEO on Microsoft, Google, and Cutting Edge Software \nEven among technology companies, Red Hat has to stand out as one of the geekiest firms in the business. \nThe enterprise company offers services and support around the Linux open-source operating system, which non-techies can think of as a free equivalent of Microsoft’s Windows and Apple’s MacOS. Developers and IT operators, however, regard Linux as more than just a free service: It’s the underpinning of some of the most popular apps and software used today. \nFor instance, if you’ve ordered a car ride from Uber or bought digital storage from Amazon , it’s likely Linux OS was in a corporate data center somewhere along the line, making sure the appropriate software was chugging along. \nRed Hat rht has also stood out for creating a successful business around open-source technology, unlike the proprietary software sold by companies like IBM ibm or Microsoft msft . Still small compared to other tech giants, the company is profitable. In its latest quarter, it brought in $600 million in sales, a 19% year-over-year increase. \nCEO Jim Whitehurst was previously the chief operating officer of Delta Air Lines dal , and joined Red Hat in 2008. In this edited version of an interview with Fortune, Whitehurst discusses making a business out of free software, the impact of companies like Google googl and Facebook fb in the technology world, and Microsoft’s changing attitude toward open source software. \nFortune : How was it like transitioning from a non-traditional tech company to now leading a hardcore enterprise infrastructure business? \nWhitehurst : We’re about as techy as you can get, right? We don’t do business functionality directly at all. We are all key infrastructure software, so it’s by nature tech stuff. At Delta I spent a lot of time trying to bring everybody together, and in that case it was [about] “We’re going to save the company so it’s not going to die on our watch.” We were trying to make a positive message out of a tough situation. \nAt Red Hat, I remember talking to a recruiter, and I was asking a little bit about how people at Red Hat act and the culture. The recruiter said, “It’s a little bit like that Blues Brothers movie, when Dan Aykroyd says, ‘We’re on a mission from God.'” They kind of have that feel to them. There is some of both geeky and passion kind of rolled together in terms of the company, which makes it a great place to be a part of and a great place to lead as well. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nWhat are you seeing in regards to how more mainstream companies like Microsoft are approaching open source technology? \nI’ve had a front row seat to watch it all happen, which also makes the job fascinating. \nAn interesting thing happened during the Web 2.0 era, when large web IT users like Google , Facebook, Twitter twtr , LinkedIn lnkd , Yahoo yhoo , etc., started using open source to drive their infrastructure. Because they’re large and because they’re technically sophisticated, they started building their own features. Open source basically has become a place where user-driven innovation happens in software. \nIf you go back and think about the industrial revolution [during the early days of automobiles], the winners weren’t the people who made the machine tools. It was Ford f and GM gm and these mass manufacturers who used the machine tools everyday and ultimately perfected the technique of mass manufacturing. To some extent I think that’s happening a bit in technology. It’s not exclusively web companies, but that’s an easy one to put your head around and see the key drivers like Google and Facebook. \nWith these big web companies, their technology projects might be specifically tailored to their services, so how does what they do trickle down to the average company? \nAgain, as most new innovation that’s happening in open source, [traditional] enterprises almost have to follow. Microsoft was, I would argue, originally successful in the 90’s because of the Microsoft developer network in which developers started developing on the Microsoft platform and then through Microsoft’s infrastructure. \nDevelopers now are heavily using open-source tools and technology and, bluntly, I think that’s why Microsoft had to open source .NET and why they’re embracing more open source in general. \nBecause open source is where innovation is coming from and is what developers are consuming, it forces vendors to participate. Now for traditional businesses, there’s a difficult problem in that there are over a million open source projects. Some of those have companies behind them and some don’t. So all of the sudden, for an enterprise, you have to think really hard about how you want to consume this innovation that was never written for enterprise consumption in mind. \nI think there are a couple dimensions to that. One is there’s a whole set of tooling, which is pretty easy to do. Your developers download certain testing frameworks and other things and you just use them. \nThe big issue is when you want to run something in production. The example I’ll use is Linux. You’re running your SAP application on Linux and that’s great, but now there’s a bug that needs to get fixed, and the open source community fixes that on the brand new version of Linux. If you’re running on a three-year old version of Linux, nobody’s looking at that version for a bug or a security hole, but you don’t want to re-integrate and re-test your SAP system every time there’s a new version. That’s what Red Hat does. \nWe have thousands of engineers, and that’s what they do. They take these old versions of Linux, and if there’s a bug or there’s a security update, they patch it and fix it without ever breaking their compatibility. And we do that across all of our products, so to some extent the functionality is free but all the sustaining support is what we provide across our product set. Software Patents May Be Coming to an End \nAnd that’s your business model, right? Making sure things are getting updated around all that open source software and doing a lot of the leg work it takes to run one of these big projects? \nExactly. A lot of people think that Red Hat only offers support for free software. Well, if you look at our financials, support is 6% of our cost structure. You only have 94% gross margin. So support is a very small overall cost. What drives our cost is under the R&D line, and our R&D is a percentage of revenue that’s higher than other software companies. The reason is because all of that is sustaining engineering, So the innovation, or the original feature development, happens in the open source community. But all of the downstream sustaining engineering, the patching, all of that’s what we do. \nWhat advice do you give to the fast-rising enterprise startups like Docker or Mesosphere that are trying to create business models out of open source technology ? \nTo go back to my old world, the airline industry has created enormous value for society. From making the world closer, which helps avoid wars, to being able to pursue your career and still keep in touch with your family. Yet, since the dawn of aviation, the airline industry has not made money. \nThere’s a big difference between creating value for your users and extracting some of that value for your owners. What I tell open source companies over and over and over again: it’s not the value your open source project brings, because it’s open source and it’s free. It is what unique value are you bringing when it comes to that functionality that you can ultimately extract for your owners. I’ve seen too many open source companies focus on “oh, isn’t this great technology, it can add a lot of value,” and maybe it can. But if you don’t have the unique business model that allows you to add value on top of the free functionality, in the end you’re going to fail. Just like every major airliner has gone going through bankruptcy. \nI do worry a lot. It’s almost like when an original web 1.0 company would say, “But, whew, these websites are going to add a ton of value!” Well, yeah but they couldn’t extract any value. I don’t want to get into it with specific companies, but in general a lot of open source companies have come and gone because they’ve been more focused on the functionality versus how they add value around the functionality. Red Hat Is Now a $2 Billion Open-Source Baby \nGitHub CEO Chris Wanstrath, who runs a popular online software code repository, recently told Fortune that he doesn’t have an allegiance between open source and proprietary software, and that companies need to use both. What is your stance on the two different types of technologies? \nThis is today and this could change over time, but areas that are of interest to large IT users and our common to infrastructure—like storage, development tools, things that are relatively common across different businesses—will be open source. Those IT users can drive road maps better than vendors. \nThings like, storage and all this big data stuff, that’s common across a lot of companies and I think it would be hard for a proprietary company to compete against a byproduct of what Google and Facebook are doing, because when they’re on to something they give it away. \nA rough line would be almost to say most infrastructure is going to be open source and most business functionality above it is going to be proprietary.",

      "text": "Microsoft executive bonuses could soon be tied to diversity goals Satya Nadella is making diversity a priority at Microsoft. Share Save \nWhen we graded Microsoft on its employee diversity last year, its report card wasn't exactly stellar . Despite filling out its leadership team with more women and ethnic minorities than ever in its history, the diversity of the company's general ranks fell year over year . Microsoft's final grade was a solid C. Not awful, but plenty of room for improvement. Satya Nadella seems to agree: the company's CEO plans to make diversity a core business value moving forward -- to the point that executive bonuses may hinge on the company meeting its diversity goals. \nAccording to Gwen Houston, Microsoft's General Manager for Global Diversity and Inclusion, Nadella is working on a plan that will make meeting diversity goals a major factor in deciding if executives receive their full bonus each year. \"Diversity and inclusion is something you've got to ingrain,\" Houston said. \"That's what Satya has been doing.\" Still, Houston says the company has more to do. Layoffs from sale of Nokia assets severely hurt the company's percentage of women and minority workers, and new hires haven't made up the difference yet. \nStill, the company is making efforts -- it's expanding its internship programs and running focus groups in US cities hoping to encourage minority groups to pursue careers in technology. In a update on the company blog , Houston says she believes the company is on the right path, but says it will take \"committed, intentional, focused efforts in the future to stay on that path.\"",

      "text": "Microsoft recently awoke a sleeping giant after remaining stagnant for a decade. Some attribute the awakening to Satya Nadella, who took the reins as Microsoft CEO in February 2014.\n\"Satya turned our inward gaze outward,\" James Whittaker, distinguished technical evangelist at Microsoft, told Search Marketing Daily. The \"our\" refers to the thousands of people at Microsoft working on the future of technology.\n\"When you get that many smart people looking ahead it can get pretty magical,\" he said. \"I get my mind blown on a weekly basis. That hasn't happened for a while. A lot of us are feeling really good about the future.\"\nThat sleeping giant — search — will rely on artificial intelligence and cloud services to forever change the advertising industry. The media will still rely on intent signals to serve ads, but some of the smartest minds in search advertising question how much longer marketers will log on to Google AdWords and Bing Ads or Yahoo Gemini to create and schedule campaigns or whether machines will connect brands with consumers through referrals and other signals using artificial intelligence and cloud services.\nMachines will determine the consumer's intent based on data. But when the world becomes reduced to data, and machines determine someone's intent, not their interest, advertising in the way the industry does it today no longer makes sense, he said.\n\"We will need to re-architect advertising, in general, when people step out of the equation and machines are making decisions for us based on actual data,\" he said.\nWhittaker declined to describe how Bing Ads might work, but he said advertising  will become more about the value of the product based on data collected through Internet-connected devices such as hot tubs, refrigerators, running shoes, online movie ticket purchases, point-of-sale systems in grocery stores, and more. These Internet-connected devices will communicate with each other to determine the best products for specific scenarios based on the individual consumer.\nSome might call this real personalization, and it will force marketers to work more closely with product development.\n\"Rather than injecting an ad, you will need to find out how to inject actual value,\" Whittaker said. \"One advantage advertisers have is data from connected devices, machines, will tell them this is the best chemical for a hot tub in the North West and this is the algorithm used to determine it.\"\nPrice could become one criteria. Adding a conditioner to soften the water might be another. All those data points will become important to personalize products. \nWhittaker said it won't be about placing an ad in front of as many people as a brand can, but rather ways to inject value of products and services to satisfy intent. The AI will inform the machine such as a smartphone when it picks up the intent of the consumer, it will provide a solution. Sometimes that will mean automatically replenishing something the consumer had already purchased. \n\"The knowledge from the data to do all this will be in the cloud,\" Whittaker said. \"One reason this is finally happening is because of the cloud.\"\n\nTechnology goes in 10 years cycles and it's as accurate and reliable as Moore's Law, he said.",

      "text": "As Microsoft works toward completing its $26 billion acquisition of popular business networking site LinkedIn, it looks like the company will inherit something of a problem overseas in the tumultuous Russian region. After recently threatening to block LinkedIn inside its country unless some major changes were made to the way LinkedIn stores personal data belonging to Russian users, the Russian government has now made good on its threat: LinkedIn is officially blocked in Russia. DON’T MISS:  The best leather cases for Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus \nIn a brief statement on the Rokomnadzor website, the Russian body that oversees communications said that it will immediately begin enforcing a ban on LinkedIn within the country. The statement cited a decision by the Moscow District Court back in August to block access to LinkedIn, as well as a more recent ruling earlier this month from the Moscow City Court to carry out the ban.\nLinkedIn has confirmed that access to its website has now been restricted in Russia, and it issued a statement in response to the ban.\n“LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for the entire global workforce. We are starting to hear from members in Russia that they can no longer access LinkedIn,” a LinkedIn spokesperson told TechCrunch . “Roskomnadzor’s action to block LinkedIn denies access to the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses. We remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request.”\nSo, why is LinkedIn being blocked in Russia. A law in the country requires all web services that hold personal data belonging to Russian users to store that data on servers located within Russia. LinkedIn had been ordered to move personal data from Russian users to local servers or access to its website would be blocked, but the company failed to comply with the Russian order. LinkedIn executives tried to hold a meeting with Russian regulators late last week to prevent the ban, but they weren’t able to.\nInternet service providers in Russia must now block user access to LinkedIn, or face steep fines for noncompliance. Of note, only about 5 million of LinkedIn’s 465 million registered users reside in Russia.\nTrending right now: \nMassive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles Microsoft joins the Linux foundation and blows everyone’s mind Samsung might not be done with the Galaxy Note 7 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "This is where it gets interesting, as the OOB read happensapproximately 0x2` bytes after the address at which the bufferis allocated. This presents us with a problem: how to store someinformation that we'd be interested in reading at such a large offsetfrom the original allocation?As one might come to expect from me, I used a heap spray. But it neededto be a special kind of heap spray as I did not want to actually have toallocate 8Gb of RAM. However, about ten years ago (boy, time flies!) Ideveloped a heap spray that uses significantly less RAM than atraditional heap spray does; in practice probably about 33% in mostcases, but theoretically much more in ideal situations. I've beenmeaning to blog about it, but never found the time to do so until today:you can read all about it here:http://blog.skylined.nl/20161118001.htmlThat said, I have not actually looked at whether it is possible toexfiltrate useful information using this bug. However, I did write aProof-of-Concept that attempts to make sure something is allocated inthe area where the OOB read happens. This PoC uses these heap spraytricks to spray the heap while minimizing memory use. TheProof-of-Concept uses about ~5.3Gb to allocate the memory at around 8Gbdistance from the buffer (up to ~10Gb to be sure). When you load the PoCin a 64-bit version of Edge, you may notice that, unlike the originalrepro, it will not crash Edge (even though it does trigger theissues): the heap spray has allocated the memory that the out-of-boundsread accesses, and this prevents an access violation exception.Refreshing the page is likely to screw up the precise allocation processneeded and will probably cause a crash.This proves that it is theoretically possible to allocate information atthe address used by the code. All that is left is prove that theinformation read by the code can be exfiltrated somehow, and you have aworking exploit. This is left as an exercises to the reader.Time-line* June 2016: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.* June 2016: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI and iDefense.* July 2016: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.* September 2016: This vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in MS16-104.* November 2016: Details of this issue are released.Cheers,",

      "text": "Workplace messaging platform Slack has become one of the hottest start-ups around on the basis of its astonishingly rapid user adoption and unicorn valuation. But now it's facing an onslaught of serious competition.\nSince launching in 2013, Slack has grown to an average of 4 million daily active users and 6 million weekly active users and was recently valued at $3.8 billion in a spring funding round. It also reached $100 million in annualized recurring revenue this year.\nSlack's impressive following and scale have generated hype around when it will announce an initial public offering, with some speculators suggesting it could be as early as 2017. However, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield said an IPO isn't likely to occur for at least another few years, largely because the company's rapid growth has made it \"harder to predict\" where the company will be one year from now.\nBut as investors await hints about a Slack IPO in the near future, the market for office communication platforms has become more and more crowded.\nMicrosoft ( MSFT ) earlier this month rolled out Teams, its own Slack-like competitor, while Facebook ( FB ) in October launched Workplace, a business-focused social network and messaging service. Other collaboration platforms, such as Atlassian's ( TEAM ) HipChat and Salesforce's ( CRM ) Chatter, have been around for several years.\nMicrosoft Teams is regarded as Slack's foremost competitor in the workplace communication sphere. Slack itself signaled concerns of competition when it took out a full-page advertisement addressing Microsoft Teams in the New York Times .\n\"We're genuinely excited to have some competition,\" the company wrote in the letter, which was published earlier this month on its website . \"However, all this is harder than it looks. So, as you set out to build 'something just like it,' we want to give you some friendly advice.\"",

      "text": "The Windows 10 Mobile market share at the moment is a fraction of iOS and Android. However this doesn’t mean that Microsoft and their partners are quite ready to give up yet. According to the latest rumors, word on the street has it that HP and Microsoft could be teaming up to launch a Windows 10 Mobile smartphone in 2017. HP has been making some effort in releasing smartphones. For example earlier this year we saw HP launch the Elite X3 Windows 10 Mobile smartphone, so if the rumors are true, it looks like we can expect a follow-up device next year. The rumors are suggesting that an unveiling at MWC 2017 could be possible, and given the mobile-centric nature of the event, we guess it shouldn’t be too surprising.\nUnfortunately specs of this rumored HP and Microsoft smartphone are unknown so it could be anyone’s guess. However if it is going to be the successor to the Elite X3, then we guess it will be an upgrade over the current specs which includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.\nPresumably this means that next year we could see the Snapdragon 835 , maybe 6-8GB of RAM, and hopefully more storage. In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but check back with us in the coming weeks/months where hopefully we’ll have more details to share.\nFiled in",

Everyone from the biggest names in tech, like Apple and Google, to the smallest startups are focusing on making software smarter. The vision is making devices think and behave like humans.\nOpenAI is a nonprofit research organization co-founded by Musk, Y Combinator's Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former Google research scientist Ilya Sutskever. The company said it will use Microsoft's Azure cloud computing technology to run \"most\" of its large-scale experiments.\n\"One of the most important factors for accelerating our progress is accessing more and faster computers; this is particularly true for emerging AI technologies like reinforcement learning and generative models ,\" OpenAI said.\n ",

      "text": "Microsoft plans to tie executive bonuses to its goals regarding diversity after the tech giant reported, for the second consecutive year, a decline in the percentage of women working at the company.\nWomen made up 25.8 percent of Microsoft's global workforce at the end of September, a decline of 1 percent from the previous year, according to a company diversity report released Thursday. In 2014, women accounted for 29 percent of Microsoft's workforce.\nLike most large tech companies, Microsoft continues to grapple with how to increase diversity in its workforce. Studies indicate that more-diverse teams, in terms of gender and race, show greater creativity and experimentation -- and get better results .\nMicrosoft's overall gender diversity puts it behind such tech rivals as Apple , Facebook and Google , all of which reported this year that women made up 30 percent or more of their workforces.\nsee also Tech's gender pay gap wider than many US sectors, study finds Intel CEO says we all have unconscious gender biases When tech firms judge on skills alone, women land more job interviews Microsoft blamed the continued decline on ongoing layoffs it began last year as part of the restructuring of the phone businesses the company acquired from Nokia in 2014. Many of the positions eliminated were manufacturing jobs at factories outside the US -- jobs that were held by a high percentage of women.\n\"While we are disappointed in the overall decline in the representation of women at the company, we know why it happened,\" Gwen Houston, Microsoft's general manager of global diversity and inclusion, wrote in the report. She went on to say that the company was encouraged by modest gains it made in the past year in the number of women it employs in technical and leadership roles.\nMicrosoft also reported progress in its hiring trends, saying women made up 27.7 percent of new hires this year, 2 percent higher than the company's current workforce.\nBlack and Latino employees also saw modest increases in the company's makeup. Blacks now compose 3.7 percent of the company's workforce, while Latino's make up 5.5 percent, increases of 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to detail plans to make achieving diversity goals a factor in whether senior executives receive their full annual bonuses, Houston told Bloomberg News.\n ",

      "text": "4 screenshots An Ubuntu-based Linux operating system aimed at Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X users Zorin OS a free Linux distribution designed for Linux beginners. It provides users with a computing environment that is quite similar to the desktop environments of the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X commercial operating systems. It is based on Ubuntu Linux, which says a lot about it already. Being declared the most popular free Linux operating system in the world, Ubuntu is targeted at the novice and standard desktop users. Distributed as 64-bit Live CD Zorin OS aims to be multi-functional, includes exclusive software, and it is distributed as a Live CD ISO image that supports only the 64-bit architecture. The system can be used directly from the Live media or installed on a local disk drive. The boot menu is not so different from other Linux operating systems and it allows users to start the live environment, start the installer, test the RAM, or boot the operating system that is already installed. Astonishing desktop experience The desktop experience in Zorin OS is quite astonishing. It features only a taskbar, which includes the main menu, the application launcher and the system tray area. The truth is that the desktop environment is actually a highly customized version of the GNOME window manager. So customized that only Linux experts will recognize it. Not to mention that it includes some eye-candy effects, which are not available by default on Windows or Mac OS X. Default applications Google Chrome is the default web browser, Nautilus can be used to manage your files, and Noise can be used to listen to your favorite tracks. In addition to the usual utilities (calculator, text editor, archive manager, etc.), Zorin OS comes with the Mozilla Thunderbird email client, Empathy instant messenger, OpenShot video editor, Cheese webcam app, Brasero CD/DVD burning tool, Totem (Video) video player, and the powerful LibreOffice office suite. Wine is also installed by default in case you want to run some Windows applications. The distribution uses the official Ubuntu software repositories, as well as their own sources. Bottom line Whether you are in the process of migrating from a Windows operating system, or you just want to get started with Linux, we strongly recommend to download and install Zorin OS on your personal computer and laptop. You won’t regret it! New in Zorin OS 11: With Zorin OS 11, we’ve focused on improving the overall desktop user experience, from the smallest details to the bigger picture. In addition to shipping new and improved versions of our standard pre-installed applications, we’ve included new applications to help you get more done in Zorin OS faster, better and more enjoyably. These apps include a built-in Contacts manager, Clocks – which allows you to set alarms, a timer, stopwatch as well as view the time in different parts of the world – and a simple and beautiful new video player. The scrolling behavior has been revamped and modernized to give you more space for your content, while allowing you to navigate applications more easily and and enjoyably. The scrollbar only appears when you need it and auto-expands when your cursor gets close to it, allowing you to have more precise control quickly. In addition, a helpful glowing animation now appears when you’ve reached the bottom of the content. We’ve also made improvements to the theme and artwork to make sure that Zorin OS looks better than ever. New to the Zorin Theme Changer is a Grey variant of the Zorin OS theme, available in Light, Dark and Black variants.",

      "text": "By Usama Jawad Neowin LLC @@UsamaJawad96 · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nSHA-1 is a hashing algorithm that has been used extensively since it was published in 1995, however, it is no longer considered secure. It was deemed vulnerable to attacks from well-funded adversaries back in 2005 and was replaced by SHA-2 and SHA-3 which are considerably more secure hashing functions. Many companies including Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft have already announced that they'll stop accepting SHA-1 TLS certificates by 2017 . \nNow, Microsoft has detailed how numerous websites, users, and third-party applications will be affected once the company deprecates SHA-1 signed certificates starting February 4, 2017. \nMicrosoft states that in an effort to further enhance security features on Edge and Internet Explorer 11, the two browsers will prevent sites using SHA-1 signed certificates from loading and will display an \"invalid certificate\" warning. While it isn't recommended, users will have the option to bypass the warning and access the potentially vulnerable website. The company has clarified that this will only impact websites with SHA-1 signed certificates that link to a Microsoft Trusted Root CA, while manually installed enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates will remain unaffected. \nThe Redmond giant states that developers who have installed the latest 2016 November Windows updates can test if their websites will be affected by the change. The detailed procedure can be viewed in the company's blog post here . \nMicrosoft has clarified that third-party Windows applications utilizing the Windows cryptographic API set or older versions of Internet Explorer will not be affected by the changes. Similarly, the update will not prevent clients from using the SHA-1 certificate in client authentication. \nRegarding cross-signed certificates, Microsoft has explicitly confirmed that Windows will only check the thumbprint of the root certificate is in the Microsoft Trusted Root Certified Program. The company has clarified that certificates \"cross-signed with a Microsoft Trusted Root that chains to an enterprise/self-signed root\" will not be affected by the changes next year.",

      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/18/2016 \nMicrosoft on Friday announced the availability of Update 1610 for its System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) client and server management system. \nThe release is the next \"current branch\" of the product, and is supported by Microsoft for one year. Existing users will see it arriving in SCCM's Updates and Servicing node, when it's available in \"the coming weeks,\" according to Microsoft's announcement . Alternatively, a PowerShell script can deliver it faster for those users. \nThe last current branch release for SCCM was Update 1606 in July . Microsoft updates SCCM \"as a service\" somewhat like Windows 10, except that it just releases current branches of SCCM a few times per year. Organizations must shift to the next current branch release of SCCM within a year's time to continue to receive patches from Microsoft. \nUpdate 1610 has already been tested in production environments, Microsoft's announcement claimed, with \"nearly 1 million devices\" currently being managed with it. \nThis release has some dashboard-type additions. SCCM 1610 works with Windows 10 Upgrade Analytics, a capability of the Microsoft Operations Management Suite introduced in July that assesses application compatibility, drivers and computer readiness for Windows 10 migrations. It also has Office 365 Servicing Dashboard improvements for deploying Office 365 apps, along with Software Updates Compliance Dashboard improvements to show the compliance state of devices, according to Microsoft's announcement. \nOther highlights, per Microsoft's announcement, include the ability to use the Microsoft Azure Cloud Management Gateway service with SCCM 1610, which \"provides a simple way to manage Configuration Manager clients on the Internet,\" according to Microsoft's \"What's new\" document . \nThere's also support with Update 1610 for a Client Peer Cache, a new solution for deploying content to remote clients. IT pros can deploy settings to a client and have it act as a peer for delivering content to \"other clients in the same boundary group.\" \nAlso added are new features for organizations that use SCCM with Intune, Microsoft's mobile management service. For instance, it's now possible to \"add and deploy online-licensed paid apps in addition to the free apps in Window Store for Business.\" \nMany more details are described in Microsoft's \"What's new\" document.

It looks like HP is now working on a consumer Windows phone that could see daylight as soon as early 2017, and judging from the success of the Elite X3, this could be a really exciting project. Details are very scarce right now, but German site Dr. Windows reports that HP is working with Microsoft on a Windows 10 Mobile device that’s specifically aimed at consumers – the Elite X3 is indeed a super-flagship, but it’s specifically aimed at businesses. The upcoming Windows phone could use technology from the Lumia lineup, including ClearBlack screens, and adopt features such as Glance scr...",

      "text": "Home > The VAR Guy > Microsoft To Tie Executive Bonuses to Company Diversity Goals Microsoft To Tie Executive Bonuses to Company Diversity Goals Nov 18, 2016 Bloomberg | The VAR Guy \nIt seems we haven't come as far as we wanted in opening up the tech workforce to more diverse demographics. Microsoft is determined to change that. Related Media New HP Enterprise, PC Boards Praised for Diversity Advertisement \nMicrosoft Corp. will tie executive bonuses to workforce diversity goals after the company saw a second consecutive year of declines in the percentage of women employees, owing to its exit from the phone handset market. \nThe percentage of women working at Microsoft fell to 25.8 percent from 26.8 percent of the company’s workforce as of Sept. 30, largely because the Nokia handset factories that Microsoft divested employed a larger number of women, said Gwen Houston, the company’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. Houston said she’s encouraged by an increase in women in technical and leadership positions, as well as in recent hiring trends. \nThe percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees saw “very modest gains” of 0.2 percent to 3.7 percent of Microsoft’s total workforce and 0.1 percent to 5.5 percent of employees, respectively, Houston said. \n“The modest gains for people of color -- those are so slight I really want to see them improve,” she said. “That’s an area of focus that I am really committed to.” \nWhile the total numbers need improvement, Houston said new hires of women and racial minorities has increased. Women represented 27.7 percent of new hires this year and 21.7 percent of those hired for technical jobs. Of the new employees, 6.6 percent were African American/Black and 7 percent were Hispanic/Latino. \nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, after a bumpy start marked by a gaffe over equal pay at a women in tech conference, has made diversity a key priority for the company. He is expected later Thursday to detail a plan to make diversity goals one of the factors in whether senior executives get their full annual bonuses, Houston said. In addition to training for managers, Nadella talks about the diversity work at each of his monthly question-and-answer sessions with employees, Houston said. \n“Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” she said. “That’s what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.” \nTo boost hiring of women and minorities, the company has added human resources workers with experience in that area, and Nadella funded the tripling of an internship program called Explorer for college freshman and sophomores interested in technology, Houston said. The company is also running focus groups in several U.S. cities with underrepresented groups to ask participants what would motivate them to choose careers in tech. The results will be used to improve advertising and recruiting campaigns.",

      "text": "Top of the Order:\nFrom Russia with No Love: When Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26 billion earlier this year, it probably didn’t foresee the latest addition to its tech empire getting into an international incident with the country that is (almost) everyone’s favorite Bad Guy: Russia.\nBut that’s just what’s happened.\nIf you were in Russia on Friday, and you tried to check out what’s happening on LinkedIn (like the Mercury News profile, for instance), you would have been greeted with a message, in Russian, saying the following:\n“Access to the resource you requested is restricted.”\nWhat’s happened is that, in the eyes of a Russian court, LinkedIn has run afoul of a law related to where that nation’s citizens’ online data is stored. Russia says its citizens’ data must be stored on servers in Russia, and that LinkedIn isn’t in compliance with that law.\nThe move makes LinkedIn the first big-name social network to be blocked in the country. The U.S. says it is very concerned about Russia’s decision about LinkedIn, as it could eventually affect other American-based social-networking companies, such as Twitter and Facebook, or possibly other companies that operate in Russia but have data about Russian citizens stored on servers in other countries.\nLinkedIn has about 6 million registered users with accounts in Russia. The company is said to be trying to work out a solution to the situation with Russian authorities.\nWell, it kind of makes the days of the Cold War, when the Soviets used to jam the radio broadcasts of the Voice of America, look quaint by today’s standards.",

Then I can take the entire model to a client, allowing us to collaboratively explore the model through 2d views, 3d perspectives, etc....all generated on the fly with Surface. My question...does anyone have experience with running Revit on Surface? Does Surface have enough power/processing strength to manipulate a Revit model? Similarly, I'm interested in creating new 3d projections, sections, etc. \"on the fly\" in front of the client. None of this works if Surface is bogged down by Revit and it can't perform. Surprise, Microsoft says it has plenty of power, but any \"on the ground\" experience and input is welcome! Axios Architecture LLC | 2218 Lebaron Drive | Atlanta, Georgia | 30345 | 404/636-0611",

      "title": "Surface Phone rumors: Upcoming Microsoft device not really a phone",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Surface Phone is alleged to replace the Microsoft Lumia 950 (shown). However, according to rumors, the Surface Phone is not really a phone. \nAlthough there are already numerous rumors and speculations attached to the alleged Surface Phone of Microsoft, the latest in the rumor mill is that the suspected device may not be a phone after all. \nMicrosoft has neither denied nor confirmed the existence of the Surface Phone. Despite the absence of any official word from the Redmond-based company, though, there is no denying that rumors and speculations on the specs, features, and release of the Surface Phone are rife. \nHowever, according to the latest reports , the Surface Phone may not be a phone at all. Reportedly, Microsoft no longer draws a bead on entering the mobile market, hence, it is unlikely for it to release another phone with its brand attached to it. Nonetheless, it is said that the company is still releasing a Surface Phone, or whatever it will eventually be called. \nIt is insinuated that what Microsoft will offer when the right time comes is an evolved device, an innovative product. It is said that it will be somewhat a hybrid of the Surface Pro and the Windows 10 mobile. Hence, the mystery of what the device will really be now baffles the tech community. Advertisement \nWhatever the device is, many people believe that it will still be a phone in the end. In fact, it is alleged that Microsoft has already obtained surfacephone.com as a domain name, a clear indication that Microsoft is really releasing one in the near future. The device may not look like the conventional smartphones that flood the market these days, but, at the end of the day, it will still fall under the category of a phone once it is out in the market. \nMeanwhile, while the mystery of the alleged Surface Phone has not fully settled yet, rumors claiming that it will come in three variants based on its RAM are also persistent. Allegedly, the premium model will boast of 8 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal memory. However, as the Surface Phone remains a mystery at this point in time, no one can really say if such rumors hold true or not and can only be confirmed once Microsoft finally unveils it — who knows when.

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) A potential replacement for the Microsoft Lumia 950 (shown), the rumored Microsoft Surface Phone, is said to have the ability to run Android and iOs apps. \nAlthough Microsoft has yet to confirm the existence of the Surface Phone, it is believed that the Redmond-based company will release the device next year and has enabled it to run Android and iOS apps. \nRumors about the Surface Phone have been around for quite a while now. However, even if Microsoft has remained mum on whether it really has the device in the pipeline, it is believed that the Surface Phone is already in development and will be released in the market in 2017. \nMobile and Apps opines that it is likely for Microsoft to release a Surface Phone, considering how popular the brand's Surface line is. After all, it has been reported that Microsoft has obtained a surfacephone.com domain name, a clear indication that the device is really in existence and is just waiting to be unveiled. \nFurthermore, Microsoft's director for engineering, Laura Butler, has said in an earlier tweet that the \"Surface phone is not NOT confirmed.\" As the second \"not\" was written in all caps, it is unlikely for the tweet to be a typographical error but was rather intentional. As double negative means affirmative, hence, there may really be a Surface Phone at all. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, as one of the reasons why the Lumia line that Microsoft acquired from Nokia back in 2014 was a failure in the market because of its Windows OS, it is said that the upcoming Surface Phone will have the ability to run Android and iOS apps even if it will still run the Windows 10 OS because of its \"bridge solution.\" In the event that this turns out to be true, it is expected that more consumers will be lured into purchasing the device once it's already out. \nThere are also rumors claiming that the Surface Phone will come in three variants based on their RAM. Reportedly, the entry-level variant will come with 4 GB RAM, while the premium variant will boast of an 8 GB RAM and will be powered by Intel's Kaby Lake processor. \nHowever, as the Intel Kaby Lake processor is said to arrive later this year, it may take some months more before Microsoft releases its Surface Phone.

Find her on Twitter @Emma4EGM Microsoft just kicked off its Black Friday sale a week early There's still a week to go until Black Friday, but that doesn't mean you can't start collecting big discounts on Xbox Live. By Emma Schaefer | 11/18/2016 12:30 PM PT | Updated 11/18/2016 12:54 PM PT News \nBlack Friday deals are kicking off a little early with Microsoft. \nThe Xbox Live Black Friday sale begins today with some nice discounts on popular Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles. On the Xbox One, all users can grab Battlefield 1 for 30 percent off, FIFA 17 (30 percent off), NBA 2K17 (20 percent off), and Forza Horizon 3 (25 percent off). Featured on the Xbox 360 are Red Dead Redemption (40 percent off), Call of Duty: Black Ops (40 percent off), Skate 3 (40 percent off), and Madden 17 (30 percent off). \nDon’t forget: If you have a Gold membership, you can add an extra 10 percent off to each one of those titles (for example, grabbing Battlefield 1 for 40 percent off). \nThese titles aren’t all that the sale has to offer, however. More deals will open up as the week progresses, and many won’t be revealed until November 25th (the actual day of Black Friday). \nThe sale is live from now until November 28th, Cyber Monday. Keep an eye out for more details as the sale progresses, and head on over to Major Nelson’s official listing for a full rundown of the sales.",

      "text": "By Usama Jawad Neowin LLC @@UsamaJawad96 · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nNear the end of the last year, Microsoft released version 1511 of its System Center Configuration Manager , optimizing it for Windows 10 and transitioning to Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Now, the company has released version 1610 of the System Center Configuration Manager for the Current Branch (CB). \nMicrosoft states that the adoption rate for System Center Configuration Manager in the CB is quite high, with over 25,000 organizations using version 1511 or higher of the model on over 50 million devices. \nNow, based on feedback from the Technical Preview branch of the software, that was tested by \"real customers, in real production environments\", the company has released version 1610 of the Configuration Manager. The update, currently being used in over a million devices, packs a variety of new features and enhancements. \nVersion 1610 improves upon Windows 10, Office 365, and application management. It also enhances the end user experience and client management functionalities. Some of the new features included in the update are as follows: Windows 10 Upgrade Analytics integration allows you to assess and analyze device readiness and compatibility with Windows 10 to allow smoother upgrades. Office 365 Servicing Dashboard and app deployment to clients features help you to deploy Office 365 apps to clients as well as track Office 365 usage and update deployments. Software Updates Compliance Dashboard allows you to view the current compliance status of devices in your organization and quickly analyze the data to see which devices are at risk. Cloud Management Gateway provides a simpler way to manage Configuration Manager clients on the Internet. You can use the ConfigMgr console to deploy the service in Microsoft Azure and configure the supported roles to allow cloud management gateway traffic. Client Peer Cache is a new built-in solution in Configuration Manager that allows clients to share content with other clients directly from their local cache with monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. Enhancements in Software Center including customizable branding in more dialogs, notifications of new software, improvements to the notification experience for high-impact task sequence deployments, and ability for users to request applications and view request history directly in Software Center. New remote control features including performance optimization for remote control sessions and keyboard translation. \nIn addition, Microsoft has also introduced new features for customers utilizing Configuration Manager connected with Microsoft Intune. These include new settings for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows 10 desktop and Mobile, Windows 10 Team, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. Moreover, it includes support for paid apps in the Windows Store for Business and Lookout integration, among other features. \nThe update will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks and will be automatically downloaded. Customers will be able to install it from the “Updates and Servicing” node in the Configuration Manager console. However, those eager to be among the first to try out the new features can do so by running the following PowerShell script . You can check out the full list of the new features of version 1610 of System Center Configuration Manager by heading over to the following blog post .",

      "text": "\nIn a blog post yesterday, the Microsoft Edge Team detailed an upcoming change coming to Edge and Internet Explorer. Both of the company’s browsers will start blocking access to SHA-1 encrypted sites early next year — on Valentine’s Day, to be exact. The company actually announced this change back in November 2015, and it’s finally ready to block sites with SHA-1 certificates. In the blog post, Microsoft quickly briefed SHA-1’s issues:\nThe SHA-1 hash algorithm is no longer secure. Weaknesses in SHA-1 could allow an attacker to spoof content, execute phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks when browsing the web. Microsoft, in collaboration with other members of the industry, is working to phase out SHA-1.\nThe software giant will start displaying an invalid certificate starting February 14, 2017, but it will not prevent a client using an SHA-1 signed certificate from being used in a client authentication. You can know more about the change on Microsoft’s official blog post here. \n",

      "text": "November 19, 2016 0 A new rumor emerging from Germany claims a new HP Windows 10 Mobile smartphone in works. What make this rumor more interesting is another claim that Microsoft is co-developing this smartphone. Another claim is that it will be a real consumer-oriented device rather than Enterprise-focused, as was the case with HP Elite X3 . As per this rumor, Microsoft will be a partner active only in background but will share a very small part of developmental budget. All the Lumia-exclusive features will also come to this device. This is not surprising though. Microsoft has been supporting HP Elite X3 development too. If our sources has to be taken into account and even killed its own SD-820 smartphone RM-1162 in its favor . The source of this rumor still doesn’t have any detail about hows and whats of this device. Though they again share another tip from another source claiming a new Windows 10 Mobile smartphone launch in February 2017. So, both the rumor may point to the same HP device making a debut in February 2017 perhaps at MWC. If you ask us, we will suggest you to take this with a pinch of salt but it is not impossible for HP to launch another Windows 10 Mobile device. We will reach to our sources and will let you know if we hear anything about this rumored device. Related ",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nWhile there have been reports before the Microsoft event on October 26 that the next iteration of the company’s ultimate laptop line, the Surface Book, might be unveiled during the event along with the Surface Pro 5, it did not happen. \nThe only thing that happened during the event was the release of the latest update to Windows 10 and the unveiling of the hybrid Surface Book i7. \nThe hybrid Surface Book i7 is not as powerful as the rumored specifications, features, and capabilities of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 but it is certainly more than adequate to match up against the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro, which the American tech giant officially rolled out on October 27. \nIf any, one positive thing that the hybrid Surface Book i7 did for the highly-anticipating fans of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 was to quench their thirst for the second iteration of the ultimate laptop line from the Redmondian company. \nPossible push back imminent \nHowever, some critics believe that the recent release of the hybrid Surface Book i7 might have pushed the release date of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 on the retail market. \nAccordingly, the Redmondian company would not field two similar products in the market at the same time since the Surface Book 2 would come off as a high-end variant of the hybrid Surface Book i7. \nBut the two laptop lines would surely compete for the same market that also has the presence of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro. \nAs such, there are now talks that the release date of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 might be pushed back as far as 2018 since the demand for the original and the recently released hybrid Surface Book i7 remains high, notes Tech Radar. \nThere are also rumors saying that Microsoft Surface Book 2 would come out early next year along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 since both devices shall be using the latest processor from Intel called Kaby Lake. \nTo come with the most powerful processor from Intel \nAs the next iteration of the 2-in-1 hybrid laptop/tablet, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 showcases some of the latest technologies. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to feature 4K resolution with 4K video and 3D graphics playback capability. Its battery may provide a running time of up to 16 hours, details Game & Guide. \nIt can be recalled that the original device and the hybrid Surface Book i7 featured an Intel Core i7 processor so the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to be faster and more powerful with its new chipset. It can improve graphic performance by 100% due to the 14-nanometer technology, which enhances the chipset by 12% compared to the Intel Skylake or the Intel Core i7 processors. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to have a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a pixel resolution of 3000 x 2000 at 267 ppi. The device may include two full-size USB 3.0 ports, a full-size SD card reader, a mini display port and a headphone jack. \nThe device may also feature a GeForce GTX 965M or GTX 1080 GPU, supported by an extra fan. \nMicrosoft Surface Book 2 is said to arrive with a Surface Pen. There may also be a built-in dock to recharge the accessory. \nThe exterior appearance of the ultimate laptop will most likely remain the same, which means that Microsoft will be focusing on the internal components of the new version. Microsoft may also push the Xbox Play Anywhere program via the Microsoft Surface Book 2. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book 2 has been previously rumored to come out last month along with the Surface Pro 5. But that did not happen. Page 1 of 2 1 2 »",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, news and update: tablet arriving early 2017?",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Microsoft Surface Pro 4 \nMicrosoft is keen on releasing any updates about the launch of its devices, but despite the technology giant's silence on the Surface Pro 5, recent reports suggest that the highly anticipated tablet may come sometime 2017. \nRumor has it that the next Surface Pro will come sometime early 2017 since it wasn't unveiled in October. Though Microsoft held an event last month, the Surface Pro 5 was left out of the announcements which left some consumers disappointed. However, despite there being no news, it seems that the company is still preparing for the launch of the upcoming tablet. \nIt is now believed that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be released after the Redstone 2 - the next Windows 10 update - is launched. The Redstone 2 is believed to arrive spring 2017 so fans can expect the next Surface Pro to potentially be out soon after the Windows 10 update rolls out. \nAs for the tablet's specs, it is expected that it will be powered by the Kaby Lake chipsets from Intel. Microsoft has not yet addressed the rumors but since Apple did not unveil a Kaby Lake MacBook, it would be a great time to see Microsoft with a new device that runs the famous chipset. Advertisement \nIt is further speculated that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will feature a Surface Pen that has a rechargeable battery, which is an amazing upgrade from the previous Pens which were all working through non-rechargeable batteries. \nConsumers have previously complained about the Pro 4's USB 3.0 port and it appears that Microsoft is heeding the advice of fans. It is said that the Surface Pro 5 will feature a USB-C port, which will finally address the charging issues that consumers are having problems with. \nMicrosoft has yet to unveil the Surface Pro 5 but experts believe that the tablet will feature upgrades in its cameras as well as the latest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth developments. \nFor now, fans can only wait for further announcements before taking any speculations seriously.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book versus Apple MacBook Pro - Business Insider",
      "text": "\nScreenshot/YouTube \nThe last few months have been full of surprises, and not just in the political world. \nMicrosoft and Apple, the PC market's two long-running rivals, are going head to head this Fall with a pair of impressive new laptops targeted at power-hungry pro users. \nMicrosoft's Surface Book, which launched last year, got a big power boost this year . Meanwhile, the MacBook Pro got its first major redesign in about four years . \nEach laptop packs new features sure to please its constituents. But after taking a close look at the two machines and putting them through their paces, the non-partisan Business Insider was forced to acknowledge that Microsoft, a newcomer to the hardware game, came out on top. \nHere's why: What is the MacBook Pro? Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nApple's new MacBook Pro has been completely redesigned. It's now about as thin and light as the MacBook Air, but it has a lot more power under the hood. It also has Apple's high-resolution Retina display. \nBut the key feature on the MacBook Pro is the new Touch Bar, which replaces the traditional physical function keys with a row of digital keys that change depending on the app you're using. \nThe MacBook Pro comes in two sizes: 13-inch or 15-inch. There's also a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar, but we're only going to focus on the Touch Bar models for this comparison. What is the Surface Book? Melia Robinson/Business Insider \nThe Surface Book is the result of Microsoft's quest to build what it calls the \"ultimate laptop.\" \nTo that end, the Surface Book sports a lot of processing power, a big, beautiful touchscreen display, and the Surface Pen stylus for notetaking and sketching. \nFor extra computing power, you can kick it up a notch: Certain models of the Surface Book include a dedicated graphics processing unit, or GPU, great for gaming or creative work. And just recently, Microsoft introduced the Surface Book with Performance Base, a premium edition with even more juice under the hood. \nBut the Surface Book's most crowd-pleasing feature is the ability for the screen to actually detach and become a fully-functional tablet in its own right. Price Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nMacBook Pro: The 13-inch model starts at $1,799. The 15-inch model starts at $1,999. But you'll likely spend more than that when you upgrade the RAM, processor, or storage. \nSurface Book: The most basic Surface Book model starts at $1,499, and gets you the detachable screen and the Surface Pen stylus. The Surface Book with dedicated graphics in the base starts at $1,899, and the top-of-the-line Performance Base models start at $2,400. You'll have to shell out extra for more storage or RAM. \nWinner: Surface Book. Although the MacBook Pro is cheaper, you get more features and power, like a dedicated graphics processor, for your money with the Surface Book. (Keep reading for more details.) Screen Melia Robinson/Business Insider \nMacBook Pro: The high-resolution Retina display is just a standard screen. It doesn't have touch controls and won't work with a stylus. \nHowever, the MacBook Pro does have a touchscreen on the keyboard. The new Touch Bar replaces the standard physical function keys and changes depending on the app you're using. It's also fully customizable, so you can choose shortcuts to what you use the most. \nBut the Touch Bar isn't as robust as a full touchscreen. For example, when editing photos using the Touch Bar, the images are so tiny it's tough to see them. The Touch Bar is really just a new way to access function keys. \nSurface Book: The Surface Book sports a bright, vibrant touchscreen. That means you can scroll web pages by swiping down on them, or switch apps by poking their icon on the taskbar, or whatever else you feel comfortable doing by touch. \nPlus, the included Surface Pen stylus makes it easy to sketch and take notes right on your screen, either in the preloaded Microsoft OneNote or a handful of other apps. \nThe one weird caveat with the Surface Book's screen is its 3:2 aspect ratio. That means that Word documents and photos appear on the screen in the same proportions they'd appear on the printed page. As a result, you'll sometimes see black bars on the sides when, for example, watching movies filmed for more standard screen ratios. \nWinner: Surface Book. Both computer have gorgeous, high-resolution screens, but the touchscreen and pen input on the Surface Book allow you to get more accomplished. The MacBook Pro's Touch bar, while innovative, feels limited by comparison. Operating system Melia Robinson/Business Insider \nMacBook Pro: The MacBook Pro runs macOS Sierra, the latest version of Apple's operating system for Macs. If you already use Apple services like iCloud, iMessage, or Siri, then macOS is a great way to seamlessly tie all your Apple devices together. \nSurface Book: The Surface Book is the showcase device for Windows 10, and highlights a lot of its best features, including touch. While it can't boast Apple's tight integration with the iPhone, you can use Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant to send and receive texts from a paired-up Android phone. Plus, Windows PCs are still the best place to play video games. \nWinner: Tie. This one comes down to personal preference. Both macOS Sierra and Windows 10 are great operating systems. The biggest advantage Windows has is gaming. Power Melia Robinson/Business Insider MacBook Pro \nThere are several processor, RAM, and storage options for the MacBook Pro. For simplicity's sake, we're only going to list the starting specs and the max specs. In some cases, there will be in-between options. You can browse all MacBook Pro the specs here . \nProcessor \nThe 13-inch model starts with a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor. You can upgrade that to a 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7. \nThe 15-inch model starts with a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. You can max that out to a 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7. \nMemory \nThe 13-inch model starts with 8GB of RAM. You can upgrade that to 16GB. \nThe 15-inch model only has 16GB of RAM. \nStorage \nThe 13-inch model starts with 256GB of storage. You can upgrade that up to 1TB. \nThe 15-inch model starts with 256GB of storage. You can upgrade that up to 2TB. \nGraphics \nThe 13-inch model has an Intel Iris Graphics 550 card. \nThe 15-inch model has a Radeon Pro 455 card with 2GB of memory. You can upgrade that to a Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of memory. \nBattery life \nApple says the MacBook Pro can get up to 10 hours of battery life, but in our tests it didn't get more than eight hours. Surface Book \nLike the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book comes in a variety of configurations that you can browse here, though they all sport the same 13.5-inch screen. These are the starting specs, and the max specs with the premium Performance Base model. \nProcessor \nThe basic model holds an Intel i5 processor. At the highest end, the Surface Book with Performance Base hosts an Intel Core i7. \nMemory \nAll models of Surface Book let you choose between 8GB and 16GB of RAM. \nStorage \nThe core model of Surface Book starts at 128GB of hard drive space; the Performance Base models start at 256GB. In all cases, you can max it out at 1TB. \nGraphics \nThe basic Surface Book unit has an integrated Intel HD graphics card, not vastly better than most other laptops. The versions with the dedicated graphics unit rock a custom Nvidia GeForce graphics card. Surface Book with Performance Base, the highest-end models, run a more powerful NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB of GDDR5 memory. \nBattery life \nThe Surface Book actually sports two batteries: One in the tablet portion, and one in the keyboard base. \nMicrosoft claims that the base Surface Book gets 12 hours of battery life while playing video, while the heavier-duty battery in the Performance Base model gets 16 hours. In our own tests, it was closer to 7 to 8 hours on the core Surface Book and 8 to 10 with the Performance Base, depending on usage and settings. \nWinner: Surface Book. This one is close, but we'll give the edge to the Surface Book because its extra graphics power, especially on the Perfomance Base, is killer if you're doing heavy-duty gaming or creative work. Ports Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nMacBook Pro: There's only one type of port on the MacBook Pro: Thunderbolt 3. This port is used for everything: charging the computer, connecting accessories, and video output. It's also compatible with the new USB-C standard. \nThat's a big problem if you want to connect older accessories to the MacBook Pro. You'll have to buy adapters, dongles, or new cables for everything. After a lot of customer complaints, Apple decided to temporarily slash prices on USB-C accessories to ease the transition to the new port. \nBut the MacBook Pro still lacks a lot of ports professional users love. There no SD card reader. No HDMI. No Ethernet. No standard USB. However, it does have a standard headphone jack. \nSurface Book: The Surface Book boasts a relative plethora of ports. It has an SD card reader, two USB ports, a mini-HDMI connector, and, of course, a headphone jack. \nAs a nice little bonus, the Surface Book's charger itself has an additional USB port that can be used to charge a device — though since that port is for power only, you can't use it to, say, sync a phone. \nMicrosoft's generosity here may have a long-term drawback, though. As new standards like USB-C, championed by Apple and Google, start to pick up steam, the current models of Surface Book may be left behind. \nWinner: Surface Book. Although few doubt USB-C is the future, the reality is that many professionals still need legacy ports like those found on the Surface Book. Which one should you buy? Melia Robinson/Business Insider \nThat really depends. A lot of pro users who need a lot of power and ports for video editing, coding, and more, have raised a lot of valid complaints about the MacBook Pro. As we wrote in our review, the MacBook Pro is more of a \"prosumer\" device. It's a great computer for most people, but power users may find it lacking. \nThe Surface Book is designed as a powerful little productivity machine. It's about as good as it gets for Windows PCs, but there are definitely cheaper options for Microsoft fans. Still, the Surface Book packs enough oomph into a little package to make it an attractive alternative for Apple fans, and a great computer for just about anybody. \nBottom line: \nPro users and gamers will get more out of the Surface Book. It blows the MacBook away in just about every category. But there's also something to be said for the legendary build quality and sleekness of Apple's MacBooks, and for the refined MacOS Sierra. If you love Apple and don't mind dealing with the new Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, you won't be disappointed with the MacBook Pro. ",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has been making some radical changes to Windows 10 recently. The company has replaced Windows 10’s default command-line tool, Command Prompt , with PowerShell in the Win + X menu. \nStarting from build 14971 for Windows 10 Preview , when you right-click the Win + X menu, you’ll notice that PowerShell is now the default command-line tool. As PowerShell is completely Command Prompt-compatible, which means you can perform the same commands in both tools, the company thinks it’s a better idea to give PowerShell advantage over Command Prompt . \nBut don’t get confused, Command Prompt is still present in Windows 10 , and nothing has changed within the tool. The fastest way to access Command Prompt is to simply type ‘ cmd.exe ‘ in the Search menu. And in case you don’t want PowerShell to be your default command-line tool, you can change this by going to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar , and turning “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X” to “Off”. \nMicrosoft also points out that it’s PowerShell’s 10th anniversary, which could be one of the reasons for this decision. \nThis is not the first change of Windows 10’s Win + X menu, we remind you Microsoft also removed Control Panel from the menu some time ago. You probably shouldn’t worry about Microsoft completely discontinuing Command Prompt from Windows 10 , because it’s one of the cult features of the system, and many users are accustomed to using it. \nWindows 10 build brought a lot of confusion to some Insiders who installed it. While replacing Command Prompt with PowerShell is the announced change, people are far more worried about what will Microsoft do with Paint and Paint 3D in the future. \nWhat do you think about replacing Command Prompt with PowerShell? And which tool do you prefer using? Let us know in the comments below. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

This build was released to Insiders on the Fast ring last week, and now Insiders on the Slow ring can download it as well, along with everyone else who wants to install the build manually. \nThe ISO files are available for download on Microsoft’s site . Available editions, as usual, are: “Windows 10 Insider Preview Enterprise – built to address the needs of large and midsize organizations, and comes with the management tools that IT administrators need. Windows 10 Insider Preview Education – built for students and faculty, and comes with the management tools that IT administrators need. Windows 10 Insider Preview Home Single Language – built for consumers in emerging markets and can only run a single language. Windows 10 Insider Preview Home China – built for consumers in China and is delivered in Simplified Chinese.” \nWindows 10 build 14965 introduces some fresh features, like the virtual touchpad , and updates some of the existing apps, like Sticky Notes or the Registry Editor .

Windows 10 build 14971 brings Paint 3D to all Windows 10 Insiders, along with some other additions. For more information about the issues reported by the Insiders who already installed build 14971, check out our dedicated article . \nHave you already installed build 14965 on your computer?

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft recently released the new build 14971 for Windows 10 Preview . This build introduces more Creators Update features to Windows Insiders, and prepare the system further for the big update. With build 14971 , Microsoft finally introduced one of the most notable features of the Creators Update, Paint 3D . \nInsiders all over the world are now able to make their own 3D creations in the revamped version of Microsoft’s famous graphics tool. Paint 3D is now a part of Windows 10 , so you don’t need to install it from the Store . \nAll Windows Insiders can install Paint 3D, but the app is available in English only, for the time being. So, regardless of your system language, you won’t be able to use Paint 3D in a language other than English. \nWhile this is not such a big deal, because the majority of Windows users actually use the system in English, Insiders noticed some other problems in the app. Namely, many users report on Microsoft’s forums that they’re unable to access the regular Paint app, as its shortcut now opens Paint 3D. This caused massive confusion among Insiders, and some of them even wondered if the original Paint was actually removed. \nHere’s what some of them said: “Running 14971 and wanting to take a screen shot to post to a new thread on Insiders. I normally just load Paint to take the Paste, Save and then load the image in the thread. Now when I try to load Paint, I get an auto load of 3D Paint. I see no way to complete my task. I might also be a bit retarded. Has Paint been removed from service?” “Looks like the have Paint 3D Opening in place of the old paint. That is going to make things much harder to use a MS product to modify Snips to remove things like Email.:( “ \nThe truth is, it works differently for different people. There’s no way to open the regular Paint app in Windows 10 build 14971 , because the default shortcut opens Paint 3D. However, some people managed to find the workaround for this issue. If you want to use the regular Paint, you’ll have to open the one from the Windows.old folder. \nPerhaps the most effective way of accessing Paint is to create a desktop shortcut from the version in Windows.old, and access it from there. Some people were actually able to set the original Paint as a default app for opening images, but this reportedly doesn’t work for everyone. \nMicrosoft still hasn’t said anything about this. We’ll have to wait for the next couple of builds to see what the future of Paint will be. But one thing’s for sure, it wouldn’t be wise for Microsoft to completely discontinue Paint, and replace it with Paint 3D. Paint is used by millions every day, so potential discontinuation will surely start a huge avalanche of complaints. \nAt the end of the day, this is the very first version of Paint 3D, and Microsoft still needs to polish it. So, it’s early to make predictions, as the company still has enough time to make things right. \nWhat are your thoughts on the situation? Do you think Microsoft will completely discontinue Paint in the future, or this is just a temporary flaw? Let us know in the comments below. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nUsing devices such as the Surface Book hybrid laptops from Microsoft with the Windows 10 operating system is highly beneficial to your specific working style, but amidst the perks lies a sneaky inconvenience that is bound to drive people mad. We are talking about the taskbar’s unavailability. \nWhen opening the virtual on-screen keyboard, the taskbar located at the very bottom of the screen is hidden, and becomes unavailable. This could prove to be tremendously hindering in some situations where you really need to use the taskbar and would very much prefer to not have to close the on-screen keyboard. \nThe good news is that there is a solution for this situation, so if you find yourself in this pickle, do not despair. The following steps will guide you towards placing your keyboard above the taskbar, so that both can be used at the same time. \nFirst up, open the Windows Registry by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard and typing regedit.exe in the pop-up box. After hitting Enter, confirm any prompts that might appear and go to the the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\StigRegKey\\Typing\\TaskbarAvoidanceEnabled. \nNext, right click TaskbarAvoidanceEnabled . Select New and then Dword(32-bit) Value . Double click it and give it the value “1”, and also name it Enable. Once you restart your PC, you should find that the taskbar is no longer hidden away when you bring forth the on-screen keyboard feature. \nNow, when you use the taskbar, you won’t need to close the virtual keyboard anymore. This solution can be used on all the devices that run Windows 10, irrespective of the OS version. \nSpeaking of the on-screen keyboard, if it doesn’t work, you can check out our dedicated fix article to solve this issue. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/ Xbox) Promotional photo for Microsoft's Xbox One S \nThere is quite a stir going on among gaming enthusiasts in anticipation of Microsoft's latest gaming console that will follow the Xbox One S, the Xbox Scorpio, also known as Project Scorpio, which is expected to come out sometime in 2017. However, Xbox Division Head Phil Spencer's confirmation that the Xbox Scorpio will cost more than its predecessor is expected to make a lot of consumers pause and think twice about upgrading. \nThe main reason for Xbox Scorpio's high price is said to be mainly because it is especially designed for high-end consumers and considered a premium device. While Microsoft has not announced the official selling price of the console, the company assures consumers that it will be a good investment for those who can afford it. \n\"This will really bring the most powerful console you've ever seen,\" Xbox Executive Aaron Greenberg during the Xbox FanFest in Mexico City. \"It will bring these really true 4K, really incredible visual games that we've never seen before on the console. People who have spent thousands of dollars on a high-end PC are getting that experience. How do we bring that to scale in a console in your living room? That's a big part of what Project Scorpio is about,\" he added. \nThe new console was announced in the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2016 briefing. The upcoming console boasts of a 320 GB per second memory bandwidth and six teraflops of performance. Microsoft also claims that Xbox Scorpio will be considerably more powerful than Sony's PlayStation Pro. It will deliver 4K gaming and support virtual reality at the same time. \nMeanwhile, the Xbox One S is presently priced at $299 for the 500 GB model, while the 2 TB variant can be availed for $399. It is highly likely that the Xbox Scorpio's initial offering will be at $399 and the prices go up depending on the storage size of each variant that will be made available.  ",

      "text": "Russia Criticized for Blocking Microsoft’s LinkedIn over Data Location Law November 19, 2016 8:46 AM Daniel Schearf A sculpture of LinkedIn's logo is seen on a terrace outside the offices of the business-oriented social network, in San Francisco, California, Sept. 22, 2016. Share Print MOSCOW — \nRussian users of the online professional-social network LinkedIn expressed concern after Russian authorities this week began blocking the popular service. LinkedIn has around six million registered users in Russia. As Russia’s economy shrank from low oil prices and sanctions, business networks like LinkedIn have become increasingly important to Russian job-seekers and employers. \nEmployment affected \nRussian companies, including state-owned Sberbank, have expressed concern that blocking LinkedIn will make it harder to recruit the right employees. Russian state-run Sberbank headquarters in downtown Moscow, Russia. \n“LinkedIn quite affected us,” said employment service Vital Partners managing partner Ekaterina Gronskaya as she lamented the restriction. “We have got no Russian equivalent. And we started facing difficulties in looking for top experts. We are stuck now when looking for experienced and successful managers. It was a proper resource of contacts. Some of them might now be lost.” \nRussia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor on Thursday ordered internet providers to cut access to the site for failing to abide by a controversial data storage law that came into force a year ago. \nA Moscow court last week said LinkedIn violated the law’s requirement for internet companies to keep their servers with Russian citizens’ personal data on Russian soil. LinkedIn has requested to meet with Roskomnadzor to discuss the situation. \nInternet companies under pressure \nThis is the first time Russian authorities enforced the law, raising concerns that other popular online services such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter could be next. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow expressed deep concern about the block, urged Russian authorities to restore access to LinkedIn, and said the restrictions harmed competition and the Russian people. \"This decision is the first of its kind and sets a troubling precedent that could be used to justify shutting down any website that contains Russian user data,” said spokesman Maria Olsen in a statement given to various media. While Russian internet companies were quick to comply with the law, foreign ones have resisted because of the additional costs and concerns about privacy. \nPrivacy concerns \nRussian authorities say keeping its citizens’ personal data on servers in Russia would protect it from foreign spying and strengthen national security. But, critics say it just makes it easier for Russia to spy on its own people. \n“It has nothing do to with privacy concerns,” said Andrei Soldatov, co-author of The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia’s Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries. “It’s all about how to make global companies domestic, how to land them effectively in Russia and Russian jurisdiction, and to make their data accessible to the Russian secret services,” he comments via Facebook Messenger. \nIn the case of LinkedIn, privacy may not be the main concern as its service involves exchanging detailed resumes and contact information. \n“Considering the nature of this service I'd assume that personal privacy isn't the most important issue for most of the users when they're looking for job(s),” Daniil Grigoryev, an expert from the Institute of Globalization and Social Movements said in e-mailed comments. Analysts say Russian authorities went after LinkedIn, a relatively small player in Russia, to give notice to bigger internet companies with more important data. “I think it's a game and Roskomnadzor believe they are in strong position given their good relationship with Microsoft and that the company is due to be acquired by Microsoft,” said Soldatov. “However, I'm not so sure that LinkedIn is ready to relocate its servers.” \nNationalizing the internet \nSome have suggested Russia wants to nationalize the internet by pushing out big players like Microsoft. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin wants to replace all foreign computer software in Russian government offices and state-owned enterprises with Russian software. The efforts, already begun in Moscow’s city government, underscore concerns about security. But, analysts pour cold water on the notion that relatively new Russian software could replace well-known foreign brands any time soon. \n“One of the most important reasons here, participating in various ‘patriotic’ campaigns, is an easy way to get sufficient budget funding, no matter how shady the actual implications of those ideas would turn out to be,” said Grigoryev. \nA number of lawsuits are pending involving foreign internet companies. Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) is suing Microsoft after a complaint by Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Labs. Kaspersky said Microsoft used its market-dominating Windows operating systems to create preference for Microsoft’s built-in anti-virus software over others. Google on Friday filed a new lawsuit against the FAS over fines the company was ordered to pay last year for allegedly restricting installation of applications by other developers on its Android operating system. The regulator had ordered Google to allow Android phone makers to offer a Russian search engine. \nHacking attacks \nMicrosoft and LinkedIn have been targeted by Russian hackers, including those linked to the Russian state. FILE - Tthe Microsoft Corp. logo appears outside the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Washington, July 3, 2014. \nMicrosoft earlier this month blamed hackers linked to Russian authorities for exploiting a security flaw in its Windows operating system. Cyber security experts say the hackers have connections to Russian intelligence and are part of the same group responsible for attacks this year on the U.S. Democratic Party. In October, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a Russian citizen in Prague who was indicted for hacking LinkedIn, Dropbox and a chatting service called Formspring. LinkedIn in May revealed that 117 million login names and passwords were stolen in the 2012 attack. China model? \nSoldatov said the efforts, including against LinkedIn, show Russia is trying to move toward China’s model of controlling information online. But, he does not believe determined Russian users will really suffer. “Russia skyrocketed to second position in the number of users of the Tor network in November 2015, after Roskomnadzor blocked Rutracker, so now many users know how to use circumvention tools.” \nAnalysts note unlike China’s early established internet controls, Russia has been struggling to catch up and has much less censorship online. Consequently, official Russian efforts to control online information look awkward and get a lot more negative reaction. \nMaking waves of publicity may be the goal, said Grigoryev. “Despite it's ambitious and sometimes hostile slogans, Russia has no real intentions, let alone a properly functioning government, to make all those claims come true. Like most parts of grand national projects, an image in the media and political speeches are way more important than the real implementation.” Related",

      "text": "HP And Microsoft Rumored To Launch Windows 10 Phone Targeted At Consumers Rather Than Business Users 19 November 2016, 9:41 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times New rumors point to a Microsoft-HP collaboration on a new Windows 10 phone. Reports favor a device that will be consumer-friendly following the weak performance of the latest HP business handset. ( HP ) Advertisement \nAfter shuttering its Nokia division, Microsoft has so far been content in partnering with third-party handset manufacturers to bring Windows-powered phones to the market. If rumors are true, then its next project will involve HP and the output of this collaboration will potentially get a February 2017 release. New Windows 10 Phone \nThere is really nothing much to say about the new Windows 10 phone. However, the partnership has been confirmed by at least two sources. \nIn the partnership , HP will purportedly cover the bulk of the work involved, which includes the manufacture and sale of the handset. Microsoft takes a lesser role by helping foot the bill for the product development, perhaps throwing in some technical input in the process. This should probably eliminate the device as a potential Surface phone . HP Elite X3 Successor? \nHP is not exactly a major handset manufacturer so there is very little insight on the company's smartphone production cycle. But in looking at its handsets in the market, it seems that the new device could very well be the successor to the HP Elite X3, which was announced last February. \nOne can say that the one-year gap indicates that the new phone will indeed debut within the rumored schedule. It is important to note, however, that the Elite X3 was launched nearly two years after the release of its predecessor. Rumored Phone Features And The Lumia Pedigree \nThe dearth of leaks means that the Microsoft-HP collaboration is running a really tight ship. Fortunately for fans, some bits of information seem to have recently escaped. According to GSM Arena, the handset will borrow some features from the Lumia such as Glance Screen and double tap to wake. The Glance feature displays time and notifications, including calls, messages and social media updates when the screen is off. \nBoth of the leaked features are also seen in Android devices. But these, nonetheless, have prompted observers to assume that it is the device that Microsoft recently announced internally. \nSome more remnants of Lumia technology could also make their appearances. For example, Tech Times has recently reported a proprietary fingerprint scanner technology, which Microsoft could implement on a new Surface phone. This information is largely based on a patent called \"Fingerprint Detection with Transparent Cover.\" It was filed by Microsoft last year but was only published in August. Hardware Specs, Pricing \nIf you are hungry for information on hardware specs, you could always turn to the Elite X3's hardware for insights. The device uses the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB of RAM. As a new iteration in the range, the new phone will certainly ship with improved internals, potentially including a Snapdragon 835 and 6 GB of RAM. With these under the hood, the new HP Elite Windows phone could take on any flagship Android device or the iPhone 7 when it comes to performance. \nIn terms of pricing, the expectation is that it will be consumer-friendly. The HP Elite X3 has been tagged as a business phone because of its high price point. A number of Windows users avoided it like the plague, which explained its lackluster sales performance.  ",

      "text": "Become a hero of the ancient Greek mythology with Olympus Rising for Windows 10 \n$26 billion is a lot of money for any one company to pay for the acquisition of another. With such a large paycheck heading to LinkendIn, it’s understandable that Microsoft would have 26 billion reasons to want to assert its control over the professional social networking service. \nHowever, LinkendIn CEO Jeff Weiner spoke to an audience at the EY Strategic Growth Forum about some reassurances he received from the head man in charge at Microsoft about the company’s commitment to treating the deal as independently as possible. Linkedin talking about Microsoft take over \nAccording to Weiner, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella spoke of the two businesses alignment and similar purpose as being the driving force behind the acquisition. \nMicrosoft has been coming at it, historically, through its development and offering of software, and now, increasingly the cloud. And we were coming at it through the development of a professional network, and increasingly this economic graph,” said Weiner. “In combination, that is a really unique position to be in, in terms of creating value and unlocking value for all of these members and customers.” \nTo that end, Weiner has found Nadells’ words and Microsoft’s actions thus far have reflected a company looking to do things very differently in its recent acquisitions. \nHe was talking about doing this in a very different way in terms of how Microsoft had done previous acquisitions,” said Weiner, who called the acquisition a “re-founding” moment for LinkedIn. “LinkedIn could continue to focus on growing LinkedIn. He has been true to his word from that very first meeting. Satya has been nothing but authentic and genuine. And everything he has told me in those discussions has been cascaded more broadly to both of our teams repeatedly.” \nGeekwire further illuminates on how the acquisition is going for the two businesses that have yet to close in a detailed reporting of the conversations between Nadella and Weiner. \nThe summation of the report ends with Weiner seeing the deal “progressing wonderfully,” while he continues to be impressed by Microsoft’s renewed passion and new vision. \nIt will be an interesting couple of years as Microsoft and LinkedIn become more aligned in their products, services and customer goals in the future.

      "text": "Become a hero of the ancient Greek mythology with Olympus Rising for Windows 10 \nEarlier today, we reported that the US Microsoft Store had just set up a dedicated page for the upcoming Black Friday Deals that will be available to consumers starting November 24. Looking at the details, we saw that two offers on the Lumia 950 XL (currently priced at $499) and the HP Elite x3 (currently priced at $799, with a Desk Dock) were quite confusing as the Microsoft Store doesn’t provide as much details as for the other discounted products right now. You could easily think that the Lumia 950XL is offered for just $1. \nWe’ve reached the Microsoft Store to learn more details on these discounts and here is what a Microsoft Store spokesperson answered us: Starting November 24, purchasing the $499 Lumia 950 XL will get you a free unlocked Lumia 950 ($379.05 value) plus a free Microsoft Display Dock ($99 value). On this same day, the Microsoft Store will start selling a $1,148 HP Elite x3 Bundle featuring the handset ( $799 value ), the HP Laptop Dock ( $599 value ), a free silicon case and a free screen protector. \nEarlier in April, the Microsoft Store also offered for a limited time a free Lumia 950 with a Lumia 950XL purchase in the US and Canada , though this previous offer did not include a free Display Dock as well. \nAs for the offer on the HP Elite x3 bundle, the free Laptop Dock really seems to be great value as this expensive accessory does enable the use of Continuum in a true mobile setting, transforming the Windows 10 Mobile handset in a lightweight notebook. Sound off in the comments if you’re looking forward to take advantage of these offers starting November 24. In this story stream:",

      "text": "0 0 \nThe latest Windows 10 build introduces a series of interesting new features, such as Paint 3D , but also removes one useful Edge feature. Microsoft introduced Edge Snooze with build 14926 , but decided to remove it on its latest build based on Insiders’ feedback. \nAs a quick reminder, the Snooze option gave users the possibility to save a certain website in Microsoft Edge as a Cortana reminder . When you didn’t have enough time to visit a website, but didn’t want to forget about visiting it in the future, you could ask Cortana to remind you about it. \nMicrosoft Edge Snooze worked just like any other type of Cortana reminders . When the time you set in Cortana comes, the reminder would show up, and you could access your site directly from that reminder. Microsoft removes the Edge Snooze option \nFirst introduced to Insiders in Build 14926, the experimental “Snooze” action on a tab in Microsoft Edge which provides you with a way to set a Cortana reminder on the website you are viewing is no longer available. Based on data we gathered and feedback we received, we decided to remove it from the product and re-evaluate the feature for a future release. \nIn others words, Microsoft Edge Snooze wasn’t reliable enough, and the Insider Team will continue to work on it in order to further improve it. If the testing phase goes well, we may see the Edge Snooze option make a comeback with the upcoming Windows 10 builds . \nSpeaking of Edge, build 14971 fixes a series of issues affecting the browser, as follows: “We fixed an issue where, as closing multiple tabs with middle click in Microsoft Edge, the width of the tabs might change, resulting in potentially unexpectedly closing the wrong tab. We fixed an issue where the copy link option when right-clicking a hyperlink in Microsoft Edge wasn’t work. We fixed an issue where, if you changed the size of the Microsoft Edge window, and then closed the app by closing the final tab, the next time Microsoft Edge is launched it would once again be the default size, rather than retaining the preferred window size. We fixed an issue where pinned tabs in Microsoft Edge were not being restored.’ \nDo you agree with Microsoft’s decision to remove the Edge Snooze option? \n ",

      "text": "november surface book driver update microsoft ( ) More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nMicrosoft’s Surface line of Windows 10 hardware has been the topic of a great deal of discussion lately. The Surface Pro 4 , Surface Book , and now Surface Studio desktop are examples of the best that the Windows ecosystem has to offer, and Microsoft doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon.\nOne of the knocks against the Surface devices so far, however, has been in the firmware and drivers that Microsoft has made available. Battery problems, display unreliability, and more have been news as well, and Microsoft has been busy issuing updates to fix a variety of issues. On Thursday, Microsoft pushed yet another update with the release of Surface Book driver updates.\nMore: Surface Book with Performance Base announced alongside Surface Studio AIO\nThe last set of new drivers and firmware for the Surface Book came on October 28 with a long list of updates including everything from the UEFI firmware to a new Wi-Fi driver to new software to support the Surface Book with Performance Base. The updates for November are significantly less impressive.\nSpecifically, three drivers were updated for the Surface Book. First up is version 1.2.0.70 of the Intel Precise Touch Device driver, which is aimed at reducing false touch events when the Surface Book lid is closed. Next is a new driver for the dedicated Nvidia GeForce GPU, to version 21.21.13.6961 to improve system stability. Finally, the Surface UEFI drivers were updated to version 90.1380.768.0, also to improve system stability.\nYou can get these driver updates immediately by going to “All Settings” in the Action Center, then “Update & security,” then “Windows Update.” Hit the “Check for updates button to download the latest drivers.” If your system is configured to automatically download updates, you might already have them installed.\nOnce you reboot, if instructed, then you will have the latest and greatest set of drivers and firmware for your Surface Book. Microsoft has done a decent job of late in getting issues resolved, and so hopefully November’s updates will provide you with a more stable Windows 10 2-in-1 device.\nEverything you must know about Windows 10 Creators Update and Surface Studio The newest Surface driver update hopes to fix battery life, touch, pen, and more Unfortunately, Microsoft did not just tease a black Surface Book 2",

Women’s share of Microsoft jobs drops again By Matt Day Seattle Times Twitter \nAt Microsoft, about one of every four employees is female. \nThe latest data on the diversity of the Redmond software giant’s workforce, released this week, showed a second consecutive annual drop in the proportion of women employed by the company. \nMicrosoft’s ranks were 25.8 percent female at the end of September, a decline of one percentage point from a year earlier. Two years ago, Microsoft was 29 percent female. \nMicrosoft attributes the decline to layoffs in units Microsoft bought from Nokia in 2014 and spent much of the past three years dismantling. Nokia’s workforce, and particularly its manufacturing centers, employed a larger proportion of women than Microsoft units. \nThe report is the latest evidence of Microsoft’s struggles to broaden the makeup of its workforce, which doesn’t look much like society. Microsoft and other technology firms tend to be male-dominated and employ small percentages of African Americans and Latinos. \nThose disparities are greater in technology-focused jobs and leadership positions; just three of Microsoft’s 12 senior leaders are female. \nThe debate about inclusion in technology companies has taken on a civil-rights dimension as the industry, an important source of high-paying jobs in a relatively slow-growing U.S. economy, gains clout. \nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson is on a multiyear advocacy campaign, pushing Microsoft and its peers in Silicon Valley to look harder for talented employees and disclose more about the composition of their workforce. \n“This is a field that really gives you the power to change the world and the power to address societal challenges,” said Ed Lazowska, a longtime University of Washington computer-science professor. “These are great jobs, and everybody should have them be available to them. In many ways, this involves overcoming what had been kind of a boys-club environment for many years.” \nComparing workforce statistics across companies can be misleading, given the differences in job categories, regions and other factors, Lazowska said. \nBut Microsoft’s proportion of female employees would seem to put the company at the back of the pack among technology giants. \nThe workforces of Facebook, Google and Apple are all more than 30 percent female, according to the most recent data from each company. \nThe decline in the portion of women at Microsoft was disappointing, said Gwen Houston, the company’s director of diversity and inclusion. Still, she said there was a “glimmer of optimism” beyond the headline statistics, particularly in new hires. \nWomen represented 27.7 percent of employees hired in the last year, a higher percentage than the company’s workforce. \nAmong U.S. employees, the representation of black and Latino employees at Microsoft each ticked higher by tenths of a percentage point, to 3.7 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. \nThose figures were higher for employees hired in the last year, Houston said. \n“It’s about retention,” she said. “We can do all this great hiring, but how do we hold onto that great talent?” \nEmployees of Asian descent made up 30.5 percent of Microsoft’s workforce, from 29.3 percent a year earlier. That figure is lifted by guest workers, primarily from India and China, hired under the H1-B visa program for highly skilled workers. \nHouston said Microsoft’s efforts to broaden its workforce include career-development programs focused on getting women and underrepresented groups into leadership roles, and a new effort that ties a portion of senior leaders’ compensation to diversity gains in their teams. \nRegardless of the company’s own programs, Microsoft is likely to report a gain in female representation next year. \nLinkedIn, the social-networking firm Microsoft is acquiring in a $26.2 billion deal, is 42 percent female. Much of LinkedIn’s workforce focuses on the recruiting industry, sales and marketing, and advertising functions, roles that tend to have a greater portion of women than does software development.

      "title": "“Use Edge” campaign continues, disses Chrome and Firefox",
      "text": "Micrsoft's campaign to get Windows 10 users to give Microsoft Edge a try at least continues, this time stating that Edge is safer than the other two browsers.\nFirst reported by Reddit user illCodeYouABrain, the new campaign tries to pursuade users on Microsoft's newest operating system Windows 10 that using Microsoft Edge is safer than other browsers.\nThis is not the first time that Microsoft is notifying users about the benefits of trying out Microsoft Edge. The company notified Windows 10 users previously that Edge was doing better battery-wise than Google Chrome .\nWindows 10 users receive the message as an overlay popup that hovers over the Edge icon in the Windows 10 taskbar.\n\nIt states: Microsoft Edge is safer than Firefox. It blocks 21% more socially engineered malware. Learn more. A similar message is shown to Chrome users but with a smaller difference.\nThe data is taken from a test conducted by NSS Labs recently which saw Edge block 91.4% of phishing URLs and 99% of social engineered malware. The percentage values for Chrome were 82.4% and 85.8%, and for Firefox 81.4% and 78.3%.\nSide note : NSS Labs has a long standing relationship with Microsoft, as the company ran other tests for Microsoft in the past.\nThe popup notification is part of Microsoft's \"Windows Tips for Windows 10\" campaign which launched in early November.\nAccording to Microsoft -- via Venture Beat -- the tips are created to \"provide people with quick, easy information that can help them enhance their Windows 10 experience\".\nMicrosoft Edge is not doing as well as Microsoft hoped it would. If you check NetMarketShare for instance, you will notice that it has a overall usage share of about 5% and is not gaining any traction. While the data covers all operating systems, it is fair to say that the current performance does not meet Microsoft's expectations for its new browser.\nIt is clear that the way these notifcations are pushed to Windows 10 devices is controversial.\nWindows 10 users who run third-party browsers like Firefox or Chrome have done so deliberately. They have downloaded and installed the browser, and maybe pinned it to the taskbar on top of that.\nIt seems unlikely that Microsoft is going to convince many to switch over to Microsoft Edge with these notifications.\nThe main issue that users may have with the popups is not that they are displayed in first place, but that there is no clear option to block them on the system.\nI suppose that there are users out there who are interested in the data, especially since it highlights areas of interest such as battery life or security.\nDisable the popups \nWindows 10 users who are not interested in the notifications can turn them off in the following way:\nUse the keyboard shortcut Windows-I to open the Settings app. Go to System > Notifications & actions. Locate \"Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows\", and switch the preference to Off.

      "text": "Microsoft Has Plans To Tie Executive Bonuses To Diversity Goals 19 November 2016, 10:31 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Executives at Microsoft stand to lose their annual bonuses if the population of the organization's female workers does not improve. This is part of an aggressive workforce diversity and inclusion initiative being introduced by Satya Nadella. ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft thinks it is failing on workforce diversity year on year. In a bid to change this narrative, the company is now mulling to tie executive bonuses to employee diversity goals. Satya Nadella's Plan \nSatya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, is leading the initiative himself. He was reportedly the one who introduced the plan, which involves the use of diversity goals as factors in determining whether executives would get their full bonuses every year. \n\"Diversity and inclusion is something you've got to ingrain; you've got to keep talking about the business value; you've got to keep talking about the impact,\" Gwen Houston, general manager for Global Diversity and Inclusion at Microsoft, told Bloomberg. \"That's what Satya has been doing.\" Female Decline At Microsoft \nDespite the fact that a significant number of Microsoft's top leadership positions are occupied by women, the overall female population within the organization now constitutes 25 percent, falling one percentage point from the figure posted last year. \nThe decline of the female employee population is largely attributed to the shutdown of Microsoft's Nokia division, which the company is phrasing as a streamlining strategy. But the shutdown entailed the layoff of a huge chunk of female and minority employees. Organizational Diversity Goals \nExisting hiring policies are already guided by overarching diversity goals. These have been credited for a slight shift in the organizational diversity. This is purportedly driven by an increase in female, African-American and Hispanic recruits. However, their collective number did not make any dent on the declining trend. \nNadella seems unhappy about Microsoft's inclusion strategy. Observers are watching the debut of his new policy closely because Microsoft is expected to march to its tune with alacrity. \nNadella has already supported key policies in the past that are aligned with diversity and inclusion. He has been an enthusiastic supporter of an internship program called Explorer, which is part of a hiring strategy spearheaded by experts on women and minority recruitment. Why Diversity \nFor those who are wondering why Microsoft is obsessed with diversity and inclusion, there is a prevailing theory that these variables drive the success of companies that rely on innovation to thrive. Microsoft is not the only tech company aggressively pursuing this strategy. Intel has allocated $300 million last year to improve the diversity of its workforce. \nNadella, in his early days as Microsoft's CEO, drew an immense amount of flak for saying that women should just have faith and wait for rewards when asked whether they should ask for equal pay. After apologizing for the snafu, Nadella made it a point to make diversity his priority. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \n7 Days is a weekly roundup of the Editors' picks of what's been happening in the world of technology - written with a dash of humor, a hint of exasperation, and an endless supply of (Irish) coffee. \nIt’s tough to keep up with everything that’s going on around the tech world, with so many announcements, rumors and updates to keep track of. But don’t worry if you missed anything – 7 Days is here to walk you through what’s been happening lately. \nOur journey this week begins by going back to the future, home of the self-lacing shoe. But that future will arrive on December 1, when Nike finally releases its long awaited HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers for $720 . \nOver in the UK, there was troubling news for internet users, as the government passed its controversial Investigatory Powers Bill . The so-called 'Snooper's Charter' has been severely opposed by privacy advocates and others who claim it amounts to blanket surveillance of all citizens' online activities. \nIn somewhat happier news, Brits can now sign up to Amazon's Music Unlimited service , priced from as little as £3.99 a month. \nAmazon also launched its new Music Unlimited family plans for up to six people, but they're currently available only in the United States. \nApple recently launched its new MacBook Pro featuring a distinctive thin 'Touch Bar' between the keyboard and display, prompting many to wonder if a full touchscreen would have been more sensible. Apple's Phil Schiller shot that idea down, saying that \"to reach over the air to try to touch and do things\" would be \"absurd\" . \nOf course, plenty of people think the Touch Bar is a strange idea too - and given that sales of touchscreen notebooks have been doing well while MacBook sales have been falling, Schiller may just be a little out of touch himself. \nSpeaking of Apple's not-so-magic touch, some of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets have been afflicted by non-responsive touchscreens and flickering displays over the last few months. Apple acknowledged the 'Touch Disease' issue this week, but placed the blame entirely on its customers and how they'd treated their handsets, offering to repair them only if they pay $149 . \nMozilla released Firefox 50 on Tuesday bringing significant improvements in start-up performance, and a range of other new features. \nMeanwhile, Facebook bowed to pressure from privacy watchdogs, as it halted its controversial collection of data from WhatsApp users in Europe . \nWhatsApp also launched its new video calling feature , bringing it to over a billion users on iOS, Android and Windows devices. \nQualcomm announced its new flagship-class system-on-a-chip, the Snapdragon 835 , which will come to high-end devices next year. Built in partnership with Samsung, it brings a 27% boost in performance, with 40% less power consumption. \nQualcomm also revealed details of its new Quick Charge 4.0 technology , which promises \"five minutes of charging for five hours of battery life\". \nRecent reports have claimed that Samsung plans to refurbish and sell its troubled Galaxy Note7 flagship - but as we explained here, that seems extremely unlikely . \nSamsung began rolling out its second Android 7.0 Nougat beta to the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. The company is also working on its Nougat update for the Galaxy Note 5, S6, S6 edge and Tab S2 - but it still hasn't given any indication of when the update will actually be released for any of its devices. \nGiven Samsung's record when it comes to updating its devices, it could be a long wait. \nSecurity seems to be an endless problem for Android devices, with major issues popping up with alarming frequency. This week, researchers discovered that some budget smartphones sold by US brand BLU were transmitting personally identifiable user data - including text messages, call logs and location info - to Chinese servers every 72 hours. \nHTC launched its latest high-end handset, the Bolt , on US carrier Sprint. Bizarrely, the device comes with the outdated Snapdragon 810 processor - two months after HTC released the Desire 10 Lifestyle with the years-old Snapdragon 400 . \nIt looks an awful lot like HTC is relying on the ignorance of its customers to sell them new devices with ageing specs. \nAs you may know, HTC is the manufacturer of Google's Pixel flagships - but this week, Huawei confirmed that it turned down the opportunity to build the Pixels . Huawei has plenty of other devices to keep it busy, though, as you can see in these articles from the last few days:",

Well, bad news, because an engineer worked out a way to break into locked computers, and it costs about as much as a value meal.\nThe Poison Tap is engineered off a Raspberry Pi — a small $5 computer that plugs into a USB and has everything you’d need to hijack a system. When you plug the Poison Tap into the computer, it tells that computer it’s an Ethernet device using USB, like a router, so the computer starts routing web traffic through it. That allows the tap to bypass malware screens and other attack prevention tools and inject malicious code into your computer through its browser cache. From there, it’s just a matter of cracking your computer’s internal router and that’s it: You’ve been breached.\nRelated Links: \nAnd Now, A Bunch Of Terrible Stock Photos Of Computer Hackers iPhones Secretly Send Your Call History To Apple, A Security Firm Says  \n\nThe good news is that if your computer is in sleep mode, not just locked, the Poison Tap won’t work. You can also fairly easily encrypt your computer , which stops the device cold. Still, the fact that this is such a glaring vulnerability, and that it’s so cheap to exploit, is fairly worrying. Maybe Apple had the right idea getting rid of ports after all .\n(via Gizmodo )",

      "text": "\nEarlier this month Microsoft announced a new program for Skype users, allowing them to migrate their Skype accounts to Microsoft accounts and/or link them to existing Microsoft accounts.\nHere’s why you should link your Microsoft and Skype accounts to further secure them. For a while, reports have been coming in indicating that Microsoft’s Skype accounts have been hacked, with users of Skype receiving spam messages from their Skype contacts, indicating a possible breach in Skype’s security.\nWhile Microsoft has updated Skype’s back-end to link it with their more secure Microsoft account database, this isn’t readily apparent to users of either service for some reason, as the firm hasn’t had any public communications via way of notification informing users of this change.\nHere’s how you can do it:\nGo to account.microsoft.com Login to your Skype account by using your Skype specific username and password. Even if you’re already linked your account to Skype previously, you’ll still need to use your Skype details. If you’re logged into your Microsoft account, you should log out and re-sign in using your Skype details and not your Microsoft one. Once that is done, you will be asked to sign in to your Microsoft account. Should you have multiple Microsoft accounts, choose the one that you would be using. For this tutorial, I’m using a dummy Skype and Microsoft account to demonstrate the process. Click Next to Update your Skype account with your pre-existing Microsoft account-linking them. You will be asked to enter your password, once this is done, you will be able to use your Microsoft account password -and only that – to sign into Skype. If you have another Skype account which is already tangentially connected to that Microsoft account, you will be warned that this link will be terminated Upon a successful login, Microsoft will alert you that you now have a single password for both Skype and other Microsoft services. Get started and secure your Microsoft account now!\n",

      "text": "It’s been eight months since Microsoft shipped Quantum Break on the Xbox One and PC, and more than five years since Remedy Entertainment started working on the ambitious time travel game.\nThe title was a groundbreaking title that combined an interactive game with live-action film. The game was about the hero’s journey, and the live-action film captured the villain’s point of view. It was an ambitious effort that took four years of full-scale production. During that time, Remedy grew from 55 people to 130, with another 50 outside developers contributing to the game.\nWe gave Quantum Break a score of 90 out of 100 . But many other critics didn’t like it, and the average score was 77 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic. Thomas Puha of Remedy gave a post-mortem on the title at the Montreal International Game Summit (MIGS 2016) this week, and I caught up with him for an interview afterward. He wasn’t doing a victory dance, but he said there were valuable lessons.\nPuha doesn’t run the show at Remedy. That’s the job at . But as communications director, he did a lot of the speaking about the game. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview.\nAbove: Thomas Puha, communications director at Remedy, at MIGS 2016.\nImage Credit: Dean Takahashi GamesBeat: You guys have had a lot of time to do post-mortems and think about everything. What might be a summary of how the project turned out? \nThomas Puha: There’s no easy answer. One thing, for the last couple of years, that Remedy’s wanted to do is have two teams. We have a lot of reasons for that, a lot of ideas for doing game. In the case of Alan Wake and Quantum Break, they were both very long projects. They turned out fine in the end, but we spent such a long time on them. People burn out. It’s just better to give our developers more opportunities, have a couple of different things in the works.\nEverybody at the company wants to ship faster. It’s not like we set out every time to spend five years on a game. We’d like to get our products out there. Quantum Break—in the end, the way we look at it, we were able to pull it off. Microsoft gave us the opportunity to work with the live action. There are lots of positives there, especially with the opportunity to build our technology base and learn a lot. But having worked on two games that took such a long time–Quantum Break was on a massive scale. Dialing back sounds bad, but we want to make something in a bit of a shorter time. Have the same kind of production values, but not spend four or five years on a single thing.\nGamesBeat: CrossFire 2 seems to fit that. It’s somebody else’s IP. \nPuha: That helps a lot, when you have a universe and the rules set up. That said, we have a lot of freedom there. That’s one of the things that excited our creative team. But still, we know it’s going to be a first-person shooter with a certain theme. That helps quite a lot, not having to figure out those basics. It’s the first FPS we’re making, though, so there are challenges.\nGamesBeat: You have an unannounced title. How do you feel about original IP versus working with brands or things like CrossFire? \nPuha: It comes down to the opportunity. Nothing against sequels. We would have loved to do more Alan Wake. In the case of CrossFire 2, a lot of things aligned. But the hope is that it’s our own IP next, something original. It’s very much built on what Remedy is good at, cinematic action, but taking into account how people play games these days, what kind of games are popular.\nThat’s another thing about spending four or five years on a game. When you get started, the market is very different to what it’ll be like when you ship. If you a ship a bit faster, you’ll hopefully be more current.\nAbove: Here’s the complicated timeline of Quantum Break, a time-travel game.\nImage Credit: Dean Takahashi/Remedy GamesBeat: Quantum Break was criticized a lot for not being what it was originally billed as. Do you think that hurt you in the end? \nPuha: Everyone makes up their own mind when you announce something. When you talk about your game the first couple of times on that high level, because you can’t reveal the details, people build something in their mind—but that happens with lots of games. People imagine that it’s going to be one thing, and it probably won’t be.\nIn the case of Quantum Break, people didn’t know what to expect. We thought we were pretty clear that it was going to be a story-driven action game. That’s what Remedy does. But the live action was definitely confusing. I don’t think everybody got the fact that you get to influence the story. Yes, the ending is always the same, but the way you get there is relatively different. I don’t think everyone understood that.\nGamesBeat: How did you guys decide on the live action? Was it obvious that that would be better or easier than just doing the cinematics yourself? \nPuha: That’s one thing I read when the game came out. “Why didn’t they just make the usual cutscenes?” First of all, if we made a 20-minute cutscene, I think people wouldn’t be as interested in watching that. The other thing, making a 20-minute animated cutscene is very difficult.\nWe shipped the game with very few animators. It’s difficult to find animators in Finland. If you’re in California, you have that history going back to Disney. You have all these schools teaching animation. We don’t have the same kind of access. Lots of things come into play. People might think making cutscenes is easy, and it’s not. If we were to make the same amount of cutscenes, a little over two hours, we would have had to have resources we didn’t have. In some ways live action can be simpler.\nBeyond the issues with production, the reality was that as the game focuses on the heroes, when you look at it from the other side, the game can also be presented in another medium. It was something new. Some people liked it. Some people didn’t.\nWe got to work with an awesome cast. We chose them because they’re great actors, first and foremost, and we can bring their performances alive in the game as well. But of course there’s the benefit that they’re known. They bring believability and hopefully help with marketing as well.\nAbove: Alan Wake Easter egg in Quantum Break\nImage Credit: Microsoft GamesBeat: Why were there so many Alan Wake references if you’re not doing another Alan Wake game? \nPuha: [laughs] Only Sam Lake knows. To me, in the first act, when you’re at Riverport University and there’s that live action trailer, that’s the main Alan Wake reference. As the game came out, I think we were pretty straightforward about not taking that as a promise of things to come. It’s there as a fan-service kind of thing, a knowing wink. But I do get that it might have seemed a bit misleading.\nGamesBeat: There was the chalkboard, the Twilight Zone TV thing… \nPuha: Like I said, it was more a fan-service thing. We knew we wouldn’t get to do another Alan Wake, so we wanted to at least put something in Quantum Break that fans of that game could have some fun with.\nGamesBeat: Where did all those theories of time come from? \nPuha: Sam Lake and the writing team—originally there was this quantum plotline in Alan Wake that got cut out pretty early on. Then Sam thought about that for a long time and decided that would make for a good game. Hence Quantum Break. Time travel was something that intrigued him and the rest of the writing team. Mikael Kasurinen did a lot of heavy lifting on the story, as well as in Alan Wake. It was just something that interested a lot of our people. Greg Louden, the narrative designer, he was also really into time travel movies and so on.\nEarly on, the discussion was around how deep we should go. We consulted a physicist in Finland very early on in the project. If there would be time travel, theoretically, what would that require? How would it work? There’s some science behind the way it works in Quantum Break. But really it’s just the imagination of the writers. You start out distilling the core and essence of the story.\n1 2 View All Continue Reading ... ",

      "text": "News Microsoft Now a Linux Foundation Platinum Member Microsoft has been on the Linux bandwagon for a while, and many of the development tool offerings announced at this week's Connect(); event prove that the company is in it for the long haul. By Kurt Mackie 11/18/2016 \nMicrosoft has joined the Linux Foundation, as a Platinum member. The company announced its membership at the Microsoft Connect(); event this week. Along with Microsoft's membership in the nonprofit organization, Microsoft Azure architect John Gossman has joined the board of directors. \nThe Linux Foundation is an advocacy organization focused on fostering open source development projects as well as Linux education programs. The Linux Foundation's executive director offered a positive statement about Microsoft's new role. \n\"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,\" said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, in a released statement. \"The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" \nMicrosoft has contributed to various Linux Foundation-sponsored projects, including \"Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative,\" per the announcement. \nMicrosoft further demonstrated its close Linux relationship with its Visual Studio development environment solutions , which includes a release candidate of Visual Studio 2017 for Windows, a preview of a mobile app dev suite called Visual Studio Mobile Center for Android, iOS and Windows, and a new Visual Studio for Mac preview that was built from scratch to support the Mac platform. \nMicrosoft also announced other Linux-related work: a preview of SQL Server on Linux ; Azure App Service support for Node.js, PHP and ASP.NET Core containers on Linux . \nMicrosoft's Linux collaborations have been piling up in recent years. The company delivered . NET Core 1.0 as open source code . It enabled the Linux Bash shell to run on natively on Windows 10. It released PowerShell as open source code for Linux and Mac. In addition, Linux distro provider Red Hat even has a team located on Microsoft's Redmond campus headquarters. Microsoft now claims to be \"a leading open source contributor on GitHub,\" an open source code repository. About the Author \nis senior news producer for the 1105 Enterprise Computing Group. <>",

      "text": "up vote 1 down vote favorite \nI have been using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Manager 2.7 for a while now and enjoy using it a lot. What I have noticed is that there doesn't seem to be a way to import the connection settings from a standard RDP file into Remote Desktop Connection Manager. \nDoes anyone know of a way to do this? I have 100s of individual RDP files that I am given every month and I rather not have to individually type all the settings one by one. \nI already know that there is an Import Setting under \"Edit > Import Server\" but this option only allows you to import the server names from a text file, but none of the settings for the server. \nThanks, Pete",

      "text": "\n343 Industries was founded by Microsoft to keep making Halo games after Bungie – the creator of the series – moved on to other things. Josh Holmes has been with 343 since day one, influencing much of what people ended up playing in both Halo 4 and 5. Originally serving as the Creative Director for Halo 4, he later became the Studio Head during the development of Halo 5: Guardians- and now he’s leaving the company.\nAnnounced in the latest Halo Community Update on Halo Waypoint, Holmes will be leaving 343 this month, and he’s going to move on to independent game development. After years of working on AAA titles like Halo, Turok (2008) and Def Jam, this is definitely going to be a huge change of pace, and we wish him the best. Holmes contributed a lot to the direction 343 took with their first entry in the Halo franchise, and worked to make the Halo games much faster than they were before.\nChris Lee will be taking Josh’s place, and he’s also got a great deal of experience with the franchise, having served as the Lead Producer for Halo 4, and the Executive Producer for Halo 5. Lee didn’t have too much to say, but he mentioned that there’s going to be more news about the next update for Halo 5 (and by extension, Halo 5: Forge) very soon. This update’s going to bring in the much requested custom game browser, as well as a bundle of new REQ items.\nA teaser for one of the new REQs was posted on the official Halo Twitter account earlier this week, and you can check it out below.\nJoin us for a little peek into what’s coming next for Halo 5: Guardians. pic.twitter.com/TXipqSbFYT \n— Halo (@Halo) November 16, 2016 \n\nAre you excited for the next Halo 5 update?

      "title": "Xbox Scorpio release date, news: Console comes with higher price tag than Xbox One S",
      "text": "  \n(Facebook/xbox) Microsoft's Project Scorpio is going to be more expensive than the Xbox One S. \nGamers who want to purchase Microsoft's upcoming gaming console, Project Scorpio, had better start saving as early as possible. It has recently been revealed that the console will sport a higher price tag — even higher than that of the Xbox One S. \nXbox division boss Phil Spencer spoke to Levelup.com a few days ago about the company's upcoming Project Scorpio and revealed the news to everyone. \n\"Scorpio will be a premium console,\" Spencer said. \"It will cost more than S, obviously, this is how we are building it up. We have not announced the pricing yet, but want to make sure that the investment we are making in the product of Scorpio goes hand in hand with the requirement of high-end consumer and that means a higher price.\" \nSpencer went on to say that Scorpio is a high-end product that was built to satisfy the demands from consumers who want \"the maximum of a console.\" Advertisement \nIt is important to keep in mind that the Xbox One S retails for $399, so fans should look out for a price tag much higher than that. This is not surprising, though, since Microsoft has previously said that the Scorpio is going to be far superior when compared to the Xbox One S and even the PlayStation Pro, which Sony recently launched for $400. \nAaron Greenberg, Xbox game marketing head, previously teased what fans can expect from the console during Microsoft's time at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). \n\"We're building a beast,\" Greenberg said . \"It's gonna be the most powerful console ever made.\" \nFans definitely have a higher expectation from Scorpio, especially after all this hype. However, it has been said that Scorpio will not act as a replacement for the Xbox One. In fact, the two consoles complement each other and go hand-in-hand. \nMicrosoft's Project Scorpio is set to hit store shelves in holiday 2017. Copyright  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 news: release rumors point to early 2017",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (in photo) has proven to be true to its promised functionality and the next-generation 2-in-1 tablet has been much anticipated. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 5 has been one of the most-anticipated devices this year, but it looks like Microsoft will not launch the new-generation tablet in 2016. Instead, new reports suggest it will be launched in early 2017. \nCNet dug into the history of Microsoft Surface Pro releases and it shows that the most recent generation was announced in October 2015 and was released the same month. October is usually the month where previous Surface devices have been launched, although the first Surface Pro was launched in February and the Surface Pro in June. \nPerhaps, it is the reason why new speculations would point to early next year as the possible date when Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be released. \nMicrosoft Surface brand devices were met with skepticism prior to their first launch in 2012. Fast forward to today, the brand has become one of the most-anticipated innovative brands that the market has known. The latest addition is a desktop PC called the Surface Studio, which continues to make waves. A Microsoft Surface Phone is also being rumored to make an entry soon. Advertisement \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 4 already boasts of the sixth-generation Skylake Intel processor, which is being used in recently introduced devices. Intel is scheduled to launch the newest Kaby Lake processor before the year ends, which is expected to be used in the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The schedule has also fueled speculations of the early 2017 release. \nImprovements to the current model are said to come, and the battery issue is expected to be addressed in the upcoming gadget. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is said to have the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system, 256 GB internal storage, 16 GB RAM, and USB Type-C port. It is further believe to come in two sizes, the 12.3-inch and the 13.3-inch display. \nMicrosoft continues to be mum on the matter, thus it would be best to wait for confirmation or official announcement.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft recently rolled out a new update for the Surface Book , aimed at improving the overall system stability. The update also reduces the number of false touch events when the device is closed. \nThis is a very useful improvement indeed because it prevents useless battery drain . When users quickly close their Surface Book devices, it is possible that the devices accidentally turns on when users put them in a laptop bag. Surface Book update content Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) Precise Touch Device: Intel(R) Precise Touch Device v1.2.0.70 reduces false touch events when the device is closed. NVIDIA driver update for NVIDIA GeForce GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GPU v21.21.13.6961 improves system stability. Microsoft driver update for Surface UEFI: Surface UEFI v90.1380.768.0 improves system stability. \nSurface Book updates are installed automatically through Windows Update .

      "text": "Microsoft’s Color Binoculars App Lets Colorblind People See The Normal Way Microsoft Develops Color Binoculars to Help Colorblind People See the World in its True Colors and Vibrancy.   7:18 pm It is a fact that around 8% of the world’s populace cannot see colors properly, that is, some people cannot distinguish between colors the way others can do. For instanceIf, something has shades of red and green, it won’t be properly and accurately viewed by some. Medical science categorizes people as colorblind and non-colorblind individuals because of their ability and inability to view combinations of colors. \nAlso Read: New App Aims to Cure Blindness For Visually Impaired \nA while ago we reported how a researcher invented color blindness curing glasses . Now, Microsoft is turning no stone unturned for helping out colorblind people to be able to see what they otherwise cannot. Yes, the Windows developer firm has created a new app called Color Binoculars. The app is purely dedicated to making the life for colorblind people a lot brighter and vibrant. \nThe app uses the mobile phone’s camera to adjust colors properly so that the frame could appear clearer to a colorblind person. The app has been created by Tom Overton, an engineer at Microsoft who himself is colorblind. Source: Microsoft \nAccording to Microsoft’s official blog post , this Color Binoculars is: \n“An app that helps colorblind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart. For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.” \nAlthough the idea appears quite an intricate one and you might be thinking that this app must involve complicated programming and elaborate designing. However, it is a fairly simple app and can be easily used by colorblind people. There are three modes in the app to counter three major types of colorblindness namely red/green, blue/yellow and green/red. \nThe app also has an option to disable color correction in order to view the difference and contrast between the pictures. This would give the person an idea about how a non-colorblind and a colorblind will view the picture. \nOverton states that with this app, colorblind people “can see the world more zoomed in, you can use this app to see the world in a different way.” Through the app, your phone’s camera will become a tool for you to translate images. Source: Microsoft \nCurrently, the app is available for iPhone users (download link) only and its Android version hasn’t been released yet.",

      "text": "in Books , Education | December 9th, 2013 1.4k   \nStepping down as Microsoft’s chief executive officer in 2000 had given Bill Gates some extra time, which the autodidact immediately expended by attempting to learn… well, everything. Perhaps Gates threw himself at learning to make up for abandoning college for greater pursuits—he attended Harvard but left after two years’ study to pursue his passion for computers. Whatever his reasons, Gates has begun to assiduously learn all he can about the world, and is recording his education process for posterity on his website, The Gates Notes . As the video above explains, Microsoft’s founder has listened to hundreds of hours of university lectures from The Teaching Company; he got hooked after listening to Robert Whaples’ Modern Economic Issues and breezing through Timothy Taylor’s America and the New Global Economy . His number one pick? Big History which is taught by David Christian and, Gates says, “is still my favorite course of all. The course is so broad that it synthesizes the history of everything including the sciences into one framework.” \nWherever Gates travels, he is also eternally accompanied by his reading bag. Surprised that the herald of the digital age is packing paperbacks? Don’t be. “I’m still pretty much an old-school print guy,” Gates writes, “because I like to jot notes in the margins, but I assume I’ll move over to ebooks when annotation features get better.” \nLast week, Gates showed WIRED the contents of his decidedly 20 th century mobile library. The books, which Gates replenishes at an impressive rate, encompass an admirable breadth of topics. As befitting the overseer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the majority of Gates’ reading consists of non-fiction (only Gary Shteyngart’s recent novel made the fiction cut this round). History, psychology, science, sound business counsel, sociology, economics, and history all make up the dizzying array of Gates’ everyday reading. Here is a selection from WIRED’s partial list , including Gates’ own comments on the importance of each choice: – Feynman’s Tips on Physics by Richard Feynman– A short companion book to Richard Feynman’s classic Lectures on Physics . Always worthwhile to return to the feet of the master. – Super Sad True Love Story: A Novel by Gary Shteyngart– I don’t read a lot of fiction, but I thought this was an interesting study of the moral implications of technology. Will technology contribute to everyone’s well-being or just make people more narcissistic? – The Cartoon Introduction to Statistics by Grady Klein– Bought this to use with one of my kids. Helpful in explaining a complicated subject to a teenager. – The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal by David McCullough – I read this to prepare for a family vacation to Panama. It’s pure McCullough: epic drama, political intrigue, heartbreaking defeats, and eventual triumph. – The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined by Steven Pinker– One of the most important books I’ve read. Steven Pinker demonstrates how the world evolved to be far less violent. Counterintuitive, if you watch the news, but true. \nWe’ve also used the trusty Control + Scroll function to zoom in and name a few additional titles:",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nFollowing two straight years of declines in the number of its female employees, Microsoft will begin rewarding its employees for a commitment to diversity. \nThe company will start tying executive bonuses to specific workforce diversity goals, Bloomberg reported this week, as the company’s percentage of female employees dropped to 25.8 percent from 26.8 percent a year ago, mostly owing to its firing of thousands of employees after closing Nokia’s handset division. \n“The move is a form of pressure to incentivize top leadership to reform the company’s hiring practices in an effort to include more women and minorities,” The Verge noted. \nWhile the company’s leadership team is filled out with more women and ethnic minorities than ever before in Microsoft’s history, a diversity report card Engadget completed last year revealed, “the diversity of the company’s general ranks fell year over year.” \nRelated: A designer’s dream: How Microsoft built the Surface Dial \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella took heat to years ago when speaking about diversity at the Grace Hopper Celebration, an annual women in tech conference in Houston, Texas. After being asked how women should go about closing the pay gap, The Verge reported that Nadella advised the female audience to “have faith and hope for adequate rewards, instead of asking to be paid fairly.” \nNadella later released a statement admitting he had answered the question completely wrong, saying that “if you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.” Since, he has made diversity a major goal for the company, moving funding toward programs that will bolster minority groups among the ranks of Microsoft employees. \nGwen Houston, Microsoft’s General Manager for Global Diversity and Inclusion, told Bloomberg that the company’s CEO is working on a plan to make meeting diversity goals a major factor in deciding whether executives will receive their full bonuses. \n“Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” she told Bloomberg. “That’s what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.” Also watch: Microsoft adds a robot guards, ushers in Sci-Fi apocalypse",

      "text": "linkedin Transcript Apple has always been the king of computers for the creative class but Microsoft is making a serious play for artists, animators, illustrators and more with it's growing Surface line now anchored by the flagship Surface Studio and it's inventive dial controller. The Surface studio combines a bunch of ideas we've seen before but puts them together in a new context. It's a 28 inch, all in one, touch screen Windows PC, with a display that folds all the way down to a very low angle of 20 degrees. The hinge mechanism is very smooth and you end up with something that looks like an artist's drafting table. The [UNKNOWN] screen has an insane 4500 by 3000 pixel resolution and it works with the same Surface Pen that comes with the Surface Book and the Surface Pro. But it's the new optional Surface Dial that really makes the Surface Studio feel different. It's a wireless Bluetooth control wheel made of aluminum On the larger screen of the studio, you can actually mount the dial on the display for additional options, such as visually scrolling through a color wheel, or selecting brush sizes. The combination of Surface Dial and Surface Studio is very cool, but right now it's also limited to a small group of supported apps, such as Sketchable, an art program. It also works with Spotify, which is kinda cool But Photoshop and other [UNKNOWN] programs will have to wait for support. We set some actual artists loose with the Surface Studio and its pen and dial, and while they were impressed, they liked the big bright screen and the stylus pen more than the dial itself, which still feels like a work in progress. I find this thing a little clunky. Just the menu system is really ornate. There are so many options to this that I kind of And unintentionally selecting things that I did not mean to select. Like that, I just selected, went back to the main menu. I'm sure after a couple weeks of working in it, I'd get the hang of it. [MUSIC] This is nice, to have all this space. I guess it feels more like a smaller drafting table in itself, which is cool. [MUSIC] For an artist, it's never good to work flat completely, you always want to have it at an angle. So it's cool that this is able to do that. [MUSIC] One nice bonus for the $3,000 and up Surface Studio, it includes a high end laptop gaming graphics card from Invidea So not only can it handle high res animation and video editing, you can play games on the awesome looking giant screen too.",

      "text": "Jagler: 'Intense curiosity' drives Microsoft innovations Steve Jagler , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 3:03 p.m. CST November 19, 2016 Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith revisited his Wisconsin roots by speaking this week to moderator Mike Gousha and the Journal Sentinel at Marquette University. (Photo: Angela Peterson / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt wasn’t by plan or design, but three of the top executives in the C-suites at Microsoft Corp. have Wisconsin ties. \nThe CEO of the Redmond, Wash.-based technology company is Satya Nadella, who earned his master’s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. \nMicrosoft’s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, went to high school in Appleton. \nThe company’s vice president of human resources, Kathleen Hogan, grew up in Wauwatosa. \n“We all came in through different portals. But we enjoy talking about our Wisconsin roots,” said Smith, who rekindled his home state connections this past week by speaking at Marquette University. \nSmith spoke to law school students and others in attendance at a presentation of “On The Issues” with Mike Gousha about the keys to the success and the vision of Nadella as Microsoft’s third CEO after Steve Ballmer and founder Bill Gates. \nThe three CEOs who have guided Microsoft have one thing in common, Smith said: “The intense pursuit of curiosity.” \nIn fact, the “intense pursuit of curiosity” is the driving force behind Microsoft’s innovations as a company, Smith said. \n“He (Nadella) wants to develop not a company of know-it-alls, but a company of learn-it-alls. The key is being nimble. We’re all going to need to keep learning.” \nA sense of “intense curiosity” can be injected into businesses if it is nurtured and promoted by company leaders, Smith said. \nSmith is walking the walk. He is currently three-fourths of the way through reading a biography of Civil War general and former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant. \nWhy? Because Smith was fascinated by the challenges Grant faced as president after the impeachment of former President Andrew Johnson, who took office with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Smith wanted to learn how Grant governed a country that was so profoundly divided. \nSound familiar? \nAlthough Microsoft is a global company, Smith believes its fate is entwined with the future of the United States. \nMicrosoft invests more than $12 billion a year in research and development, he said, and more than 85% of it is done in the United States. \n“We know we have a lot to learn, but we believe this makes one conclusion abundantly clear: In a time of rapid change, we need to innovate to promote inclusive economic growth that helps everyone move forward. This requires a shared responsibility among those in government, across the private sector, and by individuals themselves,” Smith wrote in a post-election blog . \nWith advancements in technologies such as the internet of things, cloud computing and 3D printing, Smith said this is a time for America to aim higher and rebuild its infrastructure, including high-speed trains. Such investments are fueling economic growth in China, Smith said. \nThe U.S. should leverage its diverse population as an asset, not a liability, Smith said. \n“Over a third of our engineers have come from other countries — 157 countries, in fact. We have employees from every race, ethnic background and religion. If there’s a language spoken on the planet, there’s a good chance that it’s spoken by an employee at Microsoft,” Smith said. “And we’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers. We know that this is the only way we’ll fully succeed as a company. And we believe it’s the only way we’ll fully succeed as a country.” \nSteve Jagler is the business editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

As I was growing up, my father worked for Wisconsin Telephone, and I went through the public schools in Beloit, Wauwatosa, Racine and most especially Appleton, where I went to high school (Appleton West). As I spent four years at Princeton, I always felt that my strong public school education was a match for the best schools anywhere else. I’ve always been grateful for that, and I try to give back with support for the Appleton Education Foundation and similar work in Appleton, in particular.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",
