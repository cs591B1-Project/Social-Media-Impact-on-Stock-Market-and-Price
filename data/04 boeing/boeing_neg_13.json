      "text": "In News by Maggie Serota   @maggieserota \nEvery now and then some contrarian on my Twitter feed will chime in with a brilliant “Hey, here’s an idea, how about we just not pay attention to Trump’s tweets anymore” observation. Well, one compelling reason to pay attention to what the tangerine-hued future leader of the free world decides to broadcast publicly is that it can impact the global marketplace. Take, for example, the fact that Trump tweeted the following on Tuesday morning regarding Air Force One: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nAccording to The Hill , Boeing’s stock plunged one percent when trading opened on Tuesday morning. Market Watch reported that, as of Monday, Boeing’s stock had gained 5.2% this year. Well, that was before Trump decided to open his mouth and publicly threaten the completion of a new Air Force One jet scheduled for delivery in 2024 because of overrun costs. \nWhen greeted by reporters at Trump Tower on Tuesday morning, Trump commented that he wants “Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nPresident-elect Trump on his desire to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One order: “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money” pic.twitter.com/kIdpCy0JuX \n— CNN (@CNN) December 6, 2016 \n“I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” Trump told the press pool. According to CNBC , the Department of Defense budget allotted about $2.8 billion to the Air Force One contract awarded to Boeing until 2021, but they put a total cost forecast upon completion of the project. \nAnother interesting caveat is that Trump’s spokesperson Jason Miller announced that the president-elect conveniently dumped his Boeing stock in June. In a financial disclosure form Trump filed in May, the president-elect owned an estimated $50,000 to $100,000 of Boeing stock. \nIn any case, where are all the free market loving Republicans to chide the president-elect over impeding business?",

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump looks out at Lake Michigan during a visit to the Milwaukee County War Memorial Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin August 16, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo A \nNEW YORK: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday urged the government to cancel an order with Boeing Co to develop a revamped Air Force One: one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency: saying costs were out of control. \nTrump, who takes office on Jan. 20, pledged during his unconventional campaign for the White House that he would put his skills as a businessman to work for taxpayers, and had griped about the cost of President Barack Obama's use of the presidential aircraft. \nIt was not immediately clear what prompted his complaint about Boeing on Tuesday, but a spokesman said that Trump was sending a message that he intends to save taxpayers' money. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter before making a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nIt was not clear what Trump's source of information was for the cost. The budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement programme are US$2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, according to budget documents. \nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, estimated the total cost of the two 747's, which have to be extensively modified so they can function as an airborne White House, was estimated at US$3.2 billion. \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the two proposed Air Force One replacements. It is currently working on engineering and designing the aircraft. \n\"We are currently under contract for US$170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet and were down around 0.5 percent at midday. Shares of several other major defence contractors were also lower. \nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET \nA wealthy real estate developer, Trump used his own Boeing 757 to campaign around the country, pledging to shake up Washington. \nA Trump spokesman said that his comments about the plane reflected the president-elect's desire to keep down costs across the board, and so save taxpayers' money. \nThe U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current planes that transport the U.S. president. \nThe Air Force has two planes in case one breaks down or needs to be taken out of service for maintenance. The two replacements for the current Air Force One planes are scheduled to be in service by the 2024 fiscal year. \nBoeing officials were caught off guard by Trump’s comments since the company is simply meeting requirements mapped out by the Air Force in consultation with the White House, said defence consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. \nThe cost of the planes is high because of the unique security requirements and communications equipment, Thompson said. \n\"Air Force One has unique mission requirements, including possibly having to operate in a nuclear war,” Thompson said. “Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet.” \nU.S. presidents have used Boeing planes since 1943, according to the company's website. \nThe 747-8 planes, 240 feet long (73 meters) long with a wing span of 224 feet (68 meters), can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. \nIn a September 2015 Rolling Stone profile of Trump, early on in his presidential campaign, he was quoted as gushing about the capabilities of his own Boeing plane. \n\"I bought this from Paul Allen and gutted it top to bottom. It's bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way. Rolls-Royce engines; seats 43.

      "text": "0 comments Air Force One, a heavily modified Boeing 747, is seen prior to US President Barack Obama departure from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, December 6, 2016, as he travels to Tampa, Florida, to speak about counterterrorism and visit with troops. AFP/Saul Loeb Advertisement \nPresident-elect Donald Trump called Tuesday for the cancellation of a multi-billion dollar Boeing contract to build the next Air Force One, calling the ballooning costs “ridiculous.” \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4bn. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted. \nConverting a pair of 747-8 jumbo jets to state-of-the-art luxury command centres by 2024 had been estimated to cost $3bn when Boeing was picked for the job in January 2015. \nThe legendary light blue and white liveried jets — “United States of America” emblazoned on the fuselage and an American flag on the tail — are a powerful symbol of US might. \nBut the current double-decker 747-200s, first ordered by Ronald Reagan and put into service in 1990, are getting old. \nEarlier this year, the Air Force issued the first of a series of contracts for the project to build new ones. \nIronically, it was a $25.7m effort to look at ways to cut the costs of fielding the next presidential aircraft. \nInstead, cost projections have apparently ballooned, prompting Trump’s outburst. Advertisement \n“I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” the president-elect told reporters at Trump Tower, his Manhattan headquarters. \nHe said the estimated $4bn cost was “totally out of control” and “ridiculous.” \nIn a statement, Boeing did not directly address Trump’s comments or cost estimate. \n“We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” it said. \n“We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,” Boeing added. \nPrestige items like Air Force One have been targeted before because of spiralling costs. \nIn 2009, President Barack Obama halted a project to replace the Marine One helicopters that ferry the president. \nCosts had soared to nearly $11.5bn after the 28 helicopters were ordered in 2005.

      "text": "Tweet Published: 1:40 AM, December 7, 2016 \nDUBAI - Boeing <BA.N> sees sales of its business jets rebounding over the next two years after a \"tough\" 2016, Boeing Business Jet President David Longridge said at a press conference in Dubai on Tuesday. \nBoeing Business Jets (BBJ), which sells variants of Boeing aircraft for the corporate jet market, blames a more than halving of sales this year on the uncertainty created by Britain's Brexit vote and U.S. Presidential election. \nIn 2016, Boeing has booked sales for three business jets, all narrow body aircraft, compared to 10 in 2015, including four wide-bodies, and 14 jets in 2014, BBJ Vice President Jeff Dunn told Reuters. \n\"Now the elections are over and Brexit is decided we're starting to see things pick up,\" Longridge said. \"I think over the next two years we'll go back to the kind of six to eight airplanes that we saw more regularly in the past four years,\" he said. \nBoeing has campaigns open for three to four business jets though is unlikely to close those deals before Dec. 31, Longridge said. He later told Reuters 2016 was likely to be the low point for BBJ in terms of sales since the 2009 global financial crisis. \nBoeing's business jet division, which competes with Airbus Corporate Jets <AIR.PA>, makes up a fraction of the company's total aircraft sales and deliveries. It delivered four dedicated models of narrow-body BBJ jets plus an unspecified number of wide-body jets for private customers in 2015, out of 762 total jetliner deliveries that year. \nLongridge on Tuesday announced Asia-Pacific-based Orient Global Aviation as the first customer of the recently announced BBJ 737 MAX 7 aircraft.

      "text": "Air Force None. Photo: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images The president-elect woke up Tuesday morning, logged onto Twitter, and canceled an “order” of new Air Force One jets — sending the share price of one of America’s largest companies sliding in the process.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 It’s not clear how Trump arrived at that $4 billion figure. The projected fiscal cost of the Air Force One program from 2015 to 2021 is $2.87 billion, according to budget documents obtained by Reuters . The Air Force has already awarded Boeing an initial contract of roughly $26 million, to conduct cost estimates on the White House’s desired features for the plane, which include a more secure system for communicating in the midst of a nuclear war (an innovation that’s looking more and more timely ). In July, the Defense Department provided the company with a $127.3 million contract to develop “interior, power and electronic specifications” for the plane, according to aviation-industry publication FlightGlobal .\nIt’s also unclear why Trump decided to publicly “cancel” these contracts now, when he is still weeks away from having the authority to do anything of the kind. ( Talking Points Memo notes that Trump’s tweet was sent 20 minutes after the publication of a Chicago Tribune story on Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s antipathy for Trump’s trade policies).\n“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, shortly after sending his tweet. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nBoeing responded to Trump’s remarks in a statement obtained by CNBC :\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” The aviation giant said. “We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nBoeing’s share price fell 1.6 percent following Trump’s tweet, to a low of $149.75 — but, as of this writing, its stock has recovered to $151.33, just 0.55 percent below the pre-tweet price.\nNonetheless, politicians’ tweets have moved markets (particularly in pharmaceuticals) many times over the past few months. And, assuming the president-elect does not delete his account upon inauguration, we’re likely to see quite a bit more Twitter-induced volatility over the next four years.\n\"everyone had a plan until the President Tweeted out that the stock market was in a big fat ugly bubble\"\n— StockCats (@StockCats) December 6, 2016 Tags: donald trump wall street twitter boeing air force one stock market dow jones More S h a r e o n F a c e b o o k T w e e t t h i s S t o r y Top Stories Turns Out Ben Carson Never Lived in Public Housing Donald Trump Shoots Down Boeing’s Stock Price This Company Is Transforming Vacant Land Within Slums Into Soccer Fields Most Viewed Stories Time to Go Home, Michelle Obama Already Wore the Best Holiday Look of the Year James Marsden Is One of the Best Actors of His Generation.

      "text": "NEW YORK (CBS/AP) — The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he’s ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration.\nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are “totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper.\nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build the planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn’t fly on the aircraft, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current version is becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape.\nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nLater, he said the costs are ridiculous: “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. Trump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock, but a spokesman said Tuesday he sold all of his stocks in June.\nBoeing stock tries to climb back after @realDonaldTrump slammed their Air Force One contract on Twitter. $BA pic.twitter.com/ZbUyidgxAW \n— Ben White (@morningmoneyben) December 6, 2016 \nBoeing shares fall after Trump tweets to cancel Air Force One order https://t.co/eyraJLUqMk pic.twitter.com/WxBjj0NVJX \n— Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) December 6, 2016 \n\nThe company said in a statement, “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane.\nLater Tuesday, Trump will be using his 757 to travel to the second stop of his “thank you” tour, in North Carolina, less than a week after his return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be.\nAt that Cincinnati stop, Trump disparaged the media as “dishonest,” inspired loud “Build the wall” chants, took swipes at fellow Republicans and stunned his own aides with his surprise announcement from the stage that he was appointing retired Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense.\nMattis’ selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and he is to appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville.\nLater this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House. And on Saturday, Trump will attend the 117th annual Army-Navy football game, spending half the game on Navy’s side of the stadium and the other half on Army’s side. The game between the two military academies often draws the commander in chief; both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush have attended in recent years.\nBefore leaving for North Carolina Tuesday, Trump was slated to hold a number of meetings in New York, including with Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil; Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who is meeting about a diplomatic post, and radio host Laura Ingraham who is being considered for press secretary.\nThose interviews come a day after Trump chose retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, raising fresh concerns about the lack of experience some of Trump’s Cabinet picks have with agencies they’re now being chosen to lead.\nCarson, who opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, has no background in government or running a large bureaucracy.\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, has no foreign policy experience. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood executive, is Trump’s man to lead the Treasury Department but has never worked in government. And Mattis, a widely praised battlefield commander, spent decades in the Marines but now is tapped to run the nation’s largest government agency, the Defense Department, with 740,000 civilian employees in addition to 1.3 million service personnel.\nCarson would oversee a budget of nearly $50 billion that provides rental assistance for more than 5 million households. Demand for that assistance is high in part because housing costs are rising faster than incomes. HUD also promotes home ownership with the Federal Housing Administration underwriting about 1 in 6 mortgages issued in the U.S. The agency is charged with enforcing federal fair housing laws, too.\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force Once contract worth $170 million.\nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles they want on the new Air Force One.”\nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to give an estimated cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes.\n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official.\nIn an official statement , Boeing that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.”\nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones, which will replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs serving the President.\nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin.\n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement.\nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do.\nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. And airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige and revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build two new Air Force Ones.\nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 can travel an additional 1,000 miles without refueling, fly faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and get better fuel economy than the 747-200 that’s used for the current Air Force Ones.\nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines.\nIt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy.\nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment.",

      "text": "Trump Urges Cancellation Of Costly New Air Force One Plane Posted: AP photo NEW YORK CITY - \nBoeing stock slipped 1.2 percent in early trading trading Tuesday after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that the cost of a new Air Force One jet was too high and that the government should cancel its contract with the aerospace giant. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump’s tweet said. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nLike other defense stocks, Boeing’s had risen since Mr. Trump won the election, up by 7 percent through Monday’s market close. Until the president-elect’s tweet appeared, the company’s pre-market price was unchanged, then promptly slid 1 percent. \nMr. Trump’s assessment of the new flying White House’s cost may be inflated. According to military.com, the U.S. Air Force has budgeted $1.65 billion for a new Boeing 747-8 to replace the 30-year old jumbo jet that has served five presidents. \nThere likely will end up being two new Air Force Ones in service when the replacements are slated to start flying in 2024.",

(AP Photo/Paul Beaty) \nBy Chris Isidore \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Donald Trump wants to cancel a government order for a new Air Force One. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet early Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that's being built to carry \"future presidents\" already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, he responded, \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" \nThe new Air Force One would be a 747-8, rather than the 747-200 which is now in use by President Obama. It has a longer range, can travel faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and it gets better fuel economy. \nBoeing, which is the nation's largest exporter, has built the plane used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n-- CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this story \nTM &© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nTrump thinks Boeing is pulling a number on the government and wants to halt their development of the new presidential aircraft. USA TODAY\ntest (Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, Special for USA TODAY)\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the U.S. government to cancel a deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing for development of a new Air Force One.\nThe Air Force signed deals with Boeing in January and July to design certain aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior, electrical and power system, and maintenance systems.\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March that the entire program would cost about $3.2 billion from the 2010 through 2020 fiscal years, including $2 billion for research and development.\nTrump cited different numbers without providing any evidence. The military has not yet awarded a contract to actually assemble the planes.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted Tuesday morning.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Shortly after his tweet, he told reporters at Trump Tower: \"“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nRELEASE: #Boeing statement on #AirForceOne : https://t.co/U4UcrTv1M8\n— The Boeing Company (@Boeing) December 6, 2016 Boeing said in a statement that its current deal for Air Force One development is worth $170 million.\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" Boeing said.\nAn Air Force spokesman said the military was preparing a statement on Trump's exhortation and why it believes the replacements are necessary.\nBoeing plans to replace the two aging 747-200 aircraft that serve as Air Force One with two new, modified 747-8 planes.\nSkip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nThe Boeing 747 is set to be phased out. Here's a look back at its importance to American history. USA TODAY\nThe Air Force pledged to \"keep costs down\" when it awarded the initial development contract to Boeing in January, but said the replacements are necessary.\n\"Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,” Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, said in a statement at the time.\nRichard Aboulafia, aviation analyst at the Teal Group, said the current Air Force One planes were made in the 1980s and have become obsolete. The planes are equipped with state-of-the-art communications technology and defense mechanisms to survive nuclear war or terrorist attacks, he said.\nAnything in the $3 billion to $4 billion range would be reasonable, and a belief otherwise is \"completely ignorant,\" he said.\n\"This is the wrong place to talk about cost control,\" Aboulafia said. \"People aren’t upset in Washington about a relatively small program being canceled. They’re upset we have a president who doesn't understand what is needed to be president.\"\nThe undersecretary of defense approved the plan to replace Air Force One in September 2015.\nThe goal was to replace the aircraft by the 2024 fiscal year.\nIt was not immediately clear Tuesday whether Trump, who owns a Boeing 757 that he uses as his personal aircraft, would or could intervene to halt the Air Force One deal after he takes office in January.\nRegarding the bizarre possibility that Trump might want to use his own plane instead of Air Force One, Aboulafia was beside himself.\n\"That's up there with talking-to-aliens-on-the-toaster weird,\" he said.\nStill, jittery investors drove Boeing shares down 0.8% to $150.93 at 9:45 a.m.\nAs it happens, Trump himself owned Boeing shares ( BA ) as of the filing of a financial disclosure form during his presidential campaign. He owned Boeing stock worth between $50,001 and $100,000, according to his disclosure, but Miller said the president-elect sold all of his stocks in June.\nTrump has taken a special interest in the aircraft manufacturer's travails in the past. During a crisis surrounding the lithiom batteries in its 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Trump tweeted in 2013 and 2014 that the company should excise the technology from the planes.\nEarlier, though, he was ebullient about Boeing's prospects.\n\"@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing,\" he tweeted in January 2013. \"Great company!\"\nContributing: Eliza Collins\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Air Force One Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Trump objects to Boeing's cost for Air Force One  48 PM Nate Guidry/Post-Gazette President-elect Donald Trump says the cost of Air Force One, pictured here pulling into the 171st Air Refueling Wing at Pittsburgh International Airport in October, is \"ridiculous\" and the contract order should be canceled. By Christian Davenport / The Washington Post \nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted this morning that Boeing’s contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nBoeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn’t much of a competition. Boeing’s 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being “consistent with the national public interest,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. \nShe insisted that the Pentagon “will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.” \nTalking to reporters this morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe Air Force and Boeing didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. \nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump’s tweet was “completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it’s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.” \nLoren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that “Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances — like nuclear war.” The price tag, he said, “is driven by the demands of the mission.” \nBoeing is under contract to build two planes to serve as Air Force One, said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think once [Trump] sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,” Harrison said. \nAir Force one is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad. But it is also a “flying command post,” as Harrison said. “In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,” he said. \nTrump’s tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, “I don’t think that there’s any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.” \nPresident Barack Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was “an example of the procurement process gone amok,” leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process. By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems. \nBut Air Force One is different, Harrison said, because “it’s still very, very early. It hasn’t had a chance to have any cost overruns yet.” He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule. \nBut this isn’t the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events: “Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,” he tweeted. “A total disgrace!” \nHe brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. “Now Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,” Trump said. “It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it’s a lot of money.” \nTrump reported owning between $50,001 and $100,000 in Boeing stock in his most recent financial disclosure, which was filed in May 2016 and disclosed his 2015 holdings. It is not known whether he has bought or sold the shares since then. Boeing’s stock was down 0.64 percent in morning trading. \nJenna Johnson contributed to this report.",

It's gonna be over 4 billion dollars ... and, I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,\" Trump said. \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nWhen asked about Trump's tweet, a spokesman for Boeing told the AP , \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\" \nLater, Boeing issued a statement regarding the Air Force One program, putting the amount of their current contract at just $170 million with more phases to come. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" the statement read. \nIt's not clear what prompted Trump to threaten the aircraft manufacturer with the cancellation of its government contract. Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade, according to CNBC . \nBefore the tweet, stocks were trading at $152.16. Shares fell to a low of $149.75 immediately after the tweet, approximately a $1.48 billion hit to Boeing's market cap — not a large impact relative to Boeing's overall market cap, but a dip nonetheless. Shares came back some since Trump tweeted, and opened at $150.85. \nTrump formerly owned stock in Boeing, spokesman Jason Miller said on a transition call Tuesday, but sold it in June 2016 along with all other stocks he held.

      "text": "President-elect Trump on his desire to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One order: “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money” pic.twitter.com/kIdpCy0JuX \n— CNN (@CNN) December 6, 2016 \nDonald Trump announced on Tuesday he would like to cancel a government contract to build a new Air Force One. Specifically, the president-elect argued the price tag for the two new planes had allegedly ballooned to the astronomical price of $4 billion, which was simply too much to pay. Unsurprisingly Trump’s proclamation did not come from an officially released statement or a press conference, but his overly active Twitter account:\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nPlans have been in motion to build a new set of Air Force One planes since January, as Reuters reports Boeing was awarded an initial contract of approximately $26 million designed to help lower costs. Yet CNN Money notes the order for the new planes has yet to be placed, and that they won’t be ready to fly until 2022 . Trump later elaborated on the tweet with reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, who said he was all for companies (i.e. Boeing) being successful, but not too successful :\n“Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump did not explain where the $4 billion price tag came from, as the Air Force has earmarked $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new planes’ construction. Trump may be thinking about the federal government budget years out, as the current timeline reveals plans for the new Air Force Ones taking upwards of two years — along with an additional two years for modifications. Boeing has yet to comment on Trump’s statement.\n(Via CNN Money and Reuters )\n",

      "text": "I’ve been looking at a variety of articles on Trump’s latest Tweetstrom about cancelling Boeing’s contract to build two new planes for the Air Force One program, and I can’t find any corroboration for his claim that the contract has ballooned to the four billion dollar range.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nHis tweet makes it sound like Boeing is building a single plane, but they’re actually looking to replace both of the Air Force One planes. They won the contract back in January, which surprised no one because the only other bidder was Airbus. Does Donald Trump want to make America great again by having the French build our president’s planes?\nOne requirement is that the planes have four engines for added safety, but even Boeing is phasing out four-engine planes due to lack of sales. They’re basically only used for cargo flights these days because the two-engine models are more fuel-efficient.\nOnce Boeing won the bid, they received an initial contract for $25.8 million to investigate ways to increase safety and reduce costs. Then in July , Boeing was awarded a second contract for $127.3 million to “reduce the risk of delays and cost overruns before the USAF commits to full-scale development and procurement.” Prior to that, the Air Force announced an overall budget of $1.65 billion for the two planes. Bloomberg took an initial look at Trump’s claim and came up empty : “Trump didn’t specify where the $4 billion figure came from. The Air Force has budgeted about $1.6 billion through 2019.”\nMaybe Trump has information that is unavailable to our best news sources, but the planes are supposed to cost about $800 million each, not $2 billion each, as Trump’s tweet suggests. It’s hard to see how there could have been cost overruns this significant in so short a time, especially since the deliverable date isn’t until 2024 and the contracts that have been awarded so far add up to barely more than $150 million.\nJUST IN: Boeing issues statement on Air Force One. https://t.co/TGMGUaWBm7 pic.twitter.com/havQhrxOeY \n— CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) December 6, 2016 \n\nOf course, the contract could well be cancelled now that the president-elect has recommended it. Boeing’s stock began to plummet immediately. But, again, the only alternative to Boeing is Airbus, and Airbus is already looking to poach Boeing business from China if Trump follows through with belligerant anti-Chinese polices (as he has already begun to do).\nThey could scrap the plan to replace the planes altogether. But there are reasons that they are being replaced.\n“Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,” Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, in a statement at the time.\nThe current planes will be almost 35 years old by 2024. Trump’s fleet of planes are also reaching old age:\nThe New York Times reported last April that four of Trump’s five aircraft are more than 20 years old, which is rare for someone of the president-elect’s wealth. According to the Times, Trump’s largest, and favorite, aircraft from the fleet is his 1991 Boeing 757, which has brushed 24-karat gold fixtures and leather toilet seats.\nI suspect that Stephen Bannon is behind Trump’s attack on Boeing, but, per usual, it doesn’t seem to be reality-based.\nIt looks like pablum for the hoi polloi. In Trumpworld, corporate stocks are playthings that are easily sacrificed for the opportunity to play at faux-populism.",

      "text": "Trump says Boeing’s Air Force One order should be canned Tuesday December 6, 2016 Print Article \nUS President-elect Donald Trump said the latest Air Force One order should be cancelled over high costs. — Reuters pic NEW YORK, Dec 6 — President-elect Donald Trump said the latest Air Force One order should be cancelled, citing the high costs of converting the Boeing Co jumbo jet for presidential use. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion (RM17.8 billion),” Trump said today on Twitter. “Cancel order!” \nThe Pentagon is looking to replace its aging fleet of Boeing 747-200 aircraft, which will reach the planned 30-year service life in 2017. Officials have said the next Air Force One 747-8 jets are estimated to begin operations in fiscal 2023. The Air Force expects the planes to have the range to fly between continents and comparable interiors to the current 747, whose features include work and sleeping quarters for the president and first family. \n“The plane is totally out of control,” Trump said in a brief appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower today. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump didn’t specify where the US$4 billion figure came from. The Air Force has budgeted about US$1.6 billion through 2019. \nBoeing fell 0.9 per cent to US$150.85 at 9.53am in New York. A representative of the Chicago-based planemaker wasn’t immediately available for comment. \nCorporate targets \nBoeing is the latest major US company to be called out by Trump after the president-elect negotiated a deal with United Technologies Corp. to keep more than 1,000 jobs in the US Trump, who turned US employment and corporate tax reform into defining issues during the campaign, has drawn both praise and criticism for directly intervening in companies’ affairs. \nToday’s tweet wasn’t the first time Trump has mentioned Boeing. At a February rally in South Carolina, then-candidate Trump said the company “is building massive plants in China,” which he said would be problematic if the Asian nation cut the value of its currency. \nOn Sunday, discussing the deal to keep jobs in the US, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on ABC’s This Week that Trump would decide whether to intervene with specific companies “on a day-by-day basis.” \nIn a speech December 2, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on Trump and Congress to ensure that US companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy. \nFor Boeing, the largest US exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defence sales and re-opening the US Export-Import Bank for business, Muilenburg said in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. — Bloomberg",

      "text": "A \nNEW YORK/WASHINGTON: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co to develop a revamped Air Force One: one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency: saying costs were out of control. \nHis bombshell was the latest example of how Trump is using his podium, often via brief Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion (£3.1 billion). Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. \nTrump, who stressed during his election campaign that he would use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nBoeing has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by the 2024 fiscal year, and it was not clear what Trump's source of information was for the cost. \nThe budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are US$2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, according to budget documents. \nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, estimated the total cost of the two 747's, which have to be extensively modified so they can function as an airborne White House, was estimated at US$3.2 billion. \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements, and is currently working on engineering and designing the aircraft. \n\"We are currently under contract for US$170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nSome of the statistics cited by Trump about the plane did not appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing and the Department of Defense, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Speaking to reporters, he added that Americans would expect that future presidents should benefit from upgrades to Air Force One. \nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet and were down around 0.4 percent in the early afternoon. Shares of several other major defence contractors were also lower. \nTrump, who sold his Boeing shares in June according to a spokesman, named former long-time Boeing CEO Jim McNerney to a high-profile business advisory council last week. McNerney could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday. \nLATEST BROADSIDE \nA New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harm ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. Since winning the Nov. 8 election he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. \nLast week, after discussions with Trump, United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes Carrier, agreed to keep 800 of 2,100 jobs at Indiana operations of the company’s Carrier unit, instead of moving all the jobs to Mexico as originally planned. The company agreed to keep another 300 jobs at a headquarters operation in the state. \nFord, meanwhile, in November allowed Trump to claim credit for a decision not to move production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico that the automaker had already made. \nBoth Ford and United Technologies said they support Trump's efforts to cut corporate tax rates and overhaul regulations, which could save the companies billions in the long run. \nBut in the short term, his comments on Boeing put defence contractors on notice. \n\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. \n\"To think that in 140 characters (the length of a Twitter message) the president can cancel a programme is ridiculous. There would be a detailed review by legal professionals on the merits of the termination.\" \nA Trump spokesman said that his comments about the plane reflected the president-elect's desire to keep down costs across the board, and so save taxpayers' money. \nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET \nThe U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current planes that transport the U.S. president. \nBoeing officials were caught off guard by Trump’s comments since the company is simply meeting requirements mapped out by the Air Force in consultation with the White House, said defence consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. \nThe cost of the planes is high because of the unique security requirements and communications equipment, Thompson said. \n\"Air Force One has unique mission requirements, including possibly having to operate in a nuclear war,” Thompson said. “Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet.” \nU.S. presidents have used Boeing planes since 1943, according to the company's website. \nThe 747-8 planes, 240 feet long (73 meters) long with a wing span of 224 feet (68 meters), can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. \nIn a September 2015 Rolling Stone profile of Trump, early on in his presidential campaign, he was quoted as enthusing about the capabilities of his own Boeing 757 plane. \n\"It's bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way. Rolls-Royce engines; seats 43. Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said. \n(Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson, Mike Stone, Susan Heavey, Andrea Shalal and Doina Chiacu in Washington and Steve Holland, Alana Wise, Jeffrey Dastin, and Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Alexander Cornwell in Dubai; Writing by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Frances Kerry) - Reuters",

      "text": "<iframe width=\"476\" height=\"267\" src=\"http://abc7ny.com/video/embed/?pid=1642279\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nABC's Janai Norman has an update on the Trump transition. (AP Photo/John Minchillo/Ben McKeown) AP   12:56PM NEW YORK -- The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he's ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration.Costs for the two Boeing 747s are \"totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper.The government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape.The contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"Later, he said the costs are ridiculous: \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.The price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically.Asked for comment about Trump's statements, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said, \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\"Trump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, but as president he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment.Later Tuesday, Trump is making the second stop of this \"thank you\" tour in North Carolina, less than a week after his bombastic return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be.At that Cincinnati stop, Trump disparaged the media as \"dishonest,\" inspired loud \"Build the wall\" chants, took swipes at fellow Republicans and stunned his own aides with his surprise announcement from the stage that he was appointing retired Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense.Mattis' selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and Mattis will appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"Later this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered the victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House.

      "text": "Citing high cost, Trump says Boeing's contract to build Air Force One should be canceled Filed under Politics at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nNEW YORK (AP) -- The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he's ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration. \nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are \"totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build the planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn't fly on the aircraft, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current version is becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nLater, he said the costs are ridiculous: \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. Trump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock, but a spokesman said Tuesday he sold all of his stocks in June. \nAsked for comment about Trump's statements, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said, \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\" \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane. \nLater Tuesday, Trump will be using his 757 to travel to the second stop of his \"thank you\" tour, in North Carolina, less than a week after his return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be. \nJonathan Lemire, The Associated Press \nPosted by Jamie Lovegrove, Washington correspondent View Comments",

      "text": "By Barrie Barber Dayton Daily News \nPresident-elect Donald Trump slammed the cost of a new Air Force One and used Twitter to call for canceling the new aircraft fleet Tuesday, raising questions about the future of the program managed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. \n>> Read more trending stories \nIn a tweet sent at 8:52 a.m., the president-elect wrote: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nBoeing spokesman Todd Blecher declined comment and referred all questions to the Air Force, which did not immediately release a response. \nThe Air Force is planning to replace two aging Boeing 747-200s that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard with two newer and highly modified Boeing 747-8 airliners. The jets were expected to join the fleet by 2024, replacing a current fleet that will be more than three decades old at the time. \nA program official at Wright-Patterson has said the White House has urgently asked for the jets because of reliability concerns as the planes age, among other concerns. \nRichard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said in an email the tweet was \"complete nonsense. But making program management and military requirements decisions via tweet is just very wrong.\" \nIn an interview, he said the president-elect's position on the Air Force One replacement was \"very concerning.\" \n\"This is not from the standpoint of the contract, but just from deeper lack of understanding for what the president does,\" he said. \"It's very important for the president to travel, visit other places in the country, and other countries and be able to manage national emergencies while he travels. You can't do that without Air Force One. \n\"Now the alternative is he thinks a 50-year-old Air Force One will do the job,\" Aboulafia said. \"Hopefully, nobody can be that completely misinformed.\" \nA message seeking comment was sent to Trump spokespersons this morning. \nTodd Harrison, director of the aerospace project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said it's a tradition for an outgoing president to request a new Air Force One \"so that it would not be seen as being for personal benefit.\" President George H.W. Bush's administration OK'd the purchase of the current fleet, he noted. \n\"If Trump cancels the program now, it could be another eight years before a new replacement program is started, so that aircraft would be pushing 40 years old by then,\" Harrison wrote. \nThe production of the iconic Boeing 747 jumbo jet could come to an end \"so it's not clear that the Air Force would be able to buy a commercial derivative plane like the 747 from a U.S. company in the future.\" \nNeither Boeing nor the Air Force has released the latest figures on the program. \nAboulafia said the more than $4 billion Trump cited was \"about right over 10 years.\" \n\"It's incredibly expensive to be able to manage a country and fight a war from the air, and build two planes that can do that,\" he said. But he rejected the claim the costs were \"out of control.\" \nLoren B. Thompson, a senior defense analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant, said in an email the president-elect \"probably overstates\" the cost of the two new jets. \n\"Boeing thinks the program will cost less, but it is hard to say precisely how much because the Air Force hasn't finalized the requirements for the program. \n\"This is a plane that might need to remain airborne for days during a nuclear war,\" Thompson wrote. \"It must be able to carry out functions no other plane in the world would need to accomplish.\" \nThe jet's cost is driven by its mission with self-protection measures such as shielding against electromagnetic pulse in a nuclear explosion and specialized communication gear to command a nuclear strike \"which is why it is so much more expensive than the planes Trump is used to buying,\" Harrison wrote. \nThe National Museum of the U.S. Air Force hopes to land one of the current Air Force Ones when the plane was expected to be retired in the next decade to add to its collection of 10 presidential aircraft.",

(Robert Reed) \n\"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said. \nMaybe Trump's Air Force One salvo is a down-and-dirty response to Muilenburg's suggestion that the new presidential team, and Congress, cool the anti-trade rhetoric. \nOr Trump simply could be fretting about spiraling defense department costs, including Air Force One, and decided to let fly this morning. \nBoeing has produced Air Force One for decades. But it is possible that European aircraft-maker Airbus, which was a contender for the most recent Air Force One contract, could build it too. \nEven more inexplicable is that Trump appears to be a satisfied Boeing customer and investor. His personal jet is a Boeing 757 and he has held shares in the company, even excitingly tweeting about its rising share price. \nWell, Trump still has the plane. But he's divested those Boeing shares, according to his transition team. \nThe power of Trump's personality and social media is combining to rattle Boeing's stock price, which dipped shortly after the president-elect's tweet zipped through cyberspace. \nWhatever his intent, Trump is telling Boeing that he's watching, so it better watch out. \nTwitter @reedtribbiz ",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 Amanda Shea Politics Air Force One (left), President-elect Donald Trump (right) \nJust as Donald Trump enters into the White House, the contract for Air Force One was up and it was time to replace the airplane that will transport our president around. The aerospace giant took this as an opportunity to sneak in a shocking surprise for Trump who definitely didn’t appreciate it when he saw what they did — so he did something to them. \nUnlike our current president who has occupied the Oval Office for far too long, Trump doesn’t have a problem with being brutally honest. He proves this with his words which he has been criticized for, but more importantly in his actions which he’s unapologetic about since it’s it for the benefit of our country. This was certainly the case with what he just did to Boeing who tried to pull a fast one on Trump and lost out big time for it. \nWhat Trump lacks in political experience, he more than makes up for in business knowledge, which is just what our nation needs right now to get the economy ticking again. So, when Boeing decided to charge $4 billion for the aircraft when the original contract was set at $25.8 million, he said he’s canceling the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted, The Hill reported. While Obama wouldn’t have bat an eye, Trump isn’t allowing overspending and is already taking measures into his own hands before being sworn into office. Leave it to liberals to think he went too far with his statement on the matter, rather than Boeing actually going way too far with the budget. \nWhen asked about his “cancellation” comment in the Tweet, Trump told reporters, “Well the plane is totally out of control,” he said, adding the costs are “ridiculous.” He then went on to say that he believes Boeing “is doing a little bit of a number,” and that he does want them to profit from this contract, but that much money is unnecessary. One of the main reasons for the increased cost is to replace the aircraft with a faster one which also produces less greenhouse gasses. \nAs is the case with every company that has crossed Trump lately, Boeing’s stock dropped after our president-elect made the announcement about the astronomical total they were trying to charge. Eventually, businesses will learn that they either get on board with this change in our country and embrace the profits it will bring, or accept the loss the loss for going against Trump.

      "text": "Boeing becomes latest target of Trump tweets over Air Force One costs Travis Pittman, KING 1:36 PM.   Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII.",

      "text": "It didn't take too long for President-elect Donald Trump to send a strong message to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.\nAs reported in today's column , the Chicago-based aerospace and defense giant is waiting to see how the incoming Trump administration will affect its business. Such concern especially applies to Trump's foreign policy and its approach to international trade issues with China — a huge client of Boeing's commercial jet business and a frequent Trump target.\nThis morning, Trump shook up Boeing another way by suggesting the U.S. government abandon a deal with Boeing for development of a new Air Force One.\nTrump's singling out a major U.S. company in such an adversarial manner may be unprecedented. While other incoming and sitting presidents have criticized industries, unions and business groups, it's unusual for one to focus on a single company, especially when you consider Boeing is also a contractor tied to the nation's defense industry.\nTrump says cancel Air Force One deal; Boeing says it'll deliver 'best value' Christian Davenport President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel...\n(Christian Davenport) \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump tweeted this morning.\nTrump did not provide specifics backing up his claim of cost overruns. A U.S. Government Accountability Office report said the project would run $3.2 billion between 2010 and 2020.\nBoeing plans to replace the two aging 747-200 aircraft that serve as Air Force One with two new, modified 747-8 planes. In a statement issued after the tweet, Boeing said it looked forward to working with the Air Force on the project and delivering the \"best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nThis may not be the last brouhaha between Trump and Boeing.\nIn a speech to Illinois manufacturers last week, Boeing's CEO advocated for a measured and drama-free approach to crafting and improving new and current trade agreements.\nWithout naming Trump, Muilenburg noted that concern about trade deals was a 2016 election campaign theme.\nBoeing CEO waits for Trump's trade play Robert Reed The brain trust at Boeing, among the city's largest companies and a global aerospace and defense powerhouse, must cringe every time President-elect Donald Trump riffs on foreign policy, especially when it comes to dealing with China.\nAdmittedly, that's my supposition because Dennis Muilenburg,...\nThe brain trust at Boeing, among the city's largest companies and a global aerospace and defense powerhouse, must cringe every time President-elect Donald Trump riffs on foreign policy, especially when it comes to dealing with China.\nAdmittedly, that's my supposition because Dennis Muilenburg,...\n(Robert Reed) \"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said.\nMaybe Trump's Air Force One salvo is a down-and-dirty response to Muilenburg's suggestion that the new presidential team, and Congress, cool the anti-trade rhetoric.\nOr Trump simply could be fretting about spiraling defense department costs, including Air Force One, and decided to let fly this morning.\nBoeing has produced Air Force One for decades. But it is possible that European aircraft-maker Airbus, which was a contender for the most recent Air Force One contract, could build it too.\nEven more inexplicable is that Trump appears to be a satisfied Boeing customer and investor. His personal jet is a Boeing 757 and he has held shares in the company, even excitingly tweeting about its rising share price.\nWell, Trump still has the plane. But he's divested those Boeing shares, according to his transition team.\nThe power of Trump's personality and social media is combining to rattle Boeing's stock price, which dipped shortly after the president-elect's tweet zipped through cyberspace.\nWhatever his intent, Trump is telling Boeing that he's watching, so it better watch out.\nroreed@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @reedtribbiz \n  Donald Trump",

We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

By Philip Bump December 6 at 1:50 PM Follow @pbump \nShares of stock in aircraft manufacturer Boeing fell nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday. \nThe reason? A tweet from the president-elect. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nWere Boeing to lose a $4 billion contract, that would certainly cause people to be skeptical of future earnings. But this, as seems always to be the case with Donald Trump tweets, is not the full story. \nAs our Christian Davenport reports , the contract with Boeing is currently $170 million. The government's plan to replace Air Force One actually involves two different planes which would serve future presidents for years to come. Boeing won the contract in 2015; the new planes are expected to be operational in about a decade. The $170 million isn't for manufacturing, after all. It's for Boeing's work \"determin[ing] the capabilities\" of the planes they will eventually produce. \nIt was natural to wonder, given the apparently unprompted nature of Trump's tweet, if part of his comment was meant to suggest he would prefer to use his existing aircraft for the job of the presidency. His campaign spent $6.7 million on his personal aircraft after he announced his candidacy, and he has called Air Force One \"a step down\" from his personal aircraft \"in every way.\" (Not size , mind you.) Once Trump received a Secret Service detail, the agency paid $1.6 million for its agents to travel with him -- money that went to TAG Air, a company owned by Trump. \nTrump's current plane is also a Boeing. \nThe Air Force wouldn't let Trump keep using his plane as president, though, unless it were significantly upgraded. As CNN reported earlier this month, Trump's personal plane would need to be upgraded with critical functionality to serve as his official aircraft. That includes missile detection and avoidance systems, electromagnetic shielding, mid-air refueling mechanisms and confidential communications systems. The cost of those upgrades would be up to Trump. \nAs it turns out, though, the Trump tweet may not have been unprompted. CNN's Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that shortly before the tweet (which was posted at 8:52 a.m. Eastern) the Chicago Tribune posted an interview with the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenberg. \n\"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" Muilenberg told the Tribune's Robert Reed. Fair trade has helped Boeing, which prides itself on being America's largest manufacturing exporter . \n\"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world,\" Muilenberg continued, noting that a third of the planes were sent to China. \"This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985.\" \nThose are pointed comments. It was Trump, of course, who robustly criticized free trade during the general election. And it is Trump who, this week, seemed to threaten a trade war with China. \nThat story has a dateline of 7:30 Central time -- 8:30 Eastern. Trump's tweet came out a few minutes later. \nWe don't know that Trump was responding to the Tribune story. We do know that the last time he tweeted an out-of-the-blue opinion, about flag-burning, it was immediately after a Fox News segment showing students burning flags. \nWe also know that Trump's tweet tanked Boeing's stock price, albeit only briefly. In 2013, Trump tweeted about having just bought stock in Boeing (\"great company!\"), but his spokesman said on Tuesday that the president-elect no longer holds stock in Boeing, or anything else, having sold it all in June. \nThe fluctuations in Boeing's stock price that may have stemmed from Trump's annoyance at a news article criticizing his policies in the lightest of terms, then, only affected other people. politics ",

Members Sign In Boeing stock drops after Trump calls for cancellation of new Air Force One President-elect Donald Trump exits elevators to talk with the media at Trump Tower Tuesday. By Associated Press and staff reports December 06, 2016 \nNEW YORK (AP) — Boeing stock opened down morning after President-elect Donald Trump called on the federal government to cancel its order for a new Air Force One. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn’t fly on the new planes unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. Advertisement \nTrump tweeted early Tuesday, ‘‘Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!’’ Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nLater in the lobby of Trump Tower, Trump called the order for a new plane “ridiculous.” Get Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.

It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,” he said, according to a pool report. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nBoeing responded in a statement issued late Tuesday morning that said that the current contract was worth $170 million, not $4 billion as Trump claimed. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” the company said. “We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nA Boeing spokesman told the Globe that the Air Force has not issued a contract to purchase new aircraft. \nBoeing stock opened down about a point Tuesday morning but recovered by midday. \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane. Christina Prignano of the Globe staff contributed to this report. \nCorrection: An earlier verison of this story mistakenly described Donald Trump’s plane. He flies on a Boeing 757.

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nDonald Trump has decided that the contract to build Air Force One should be canceled immediately because the price tag is just too high. In contrast, making New York City spend $1 million a day to protect his family that won’t move into the White House is fine. But I digress. \nTrump tweeted on Tuesday morning that he wants to trash the contract with Boeing because they want too much money to build the plane. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nOn Tuesday morning, Trump further explained his tweet when speaking to reporters at Trump Tower. \nThe plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. \nTrump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters in a phone call that this is just the beginning. He said that Trump plans to look at the Pentagon’s budget and find other places to make cuts as well. \n“I think this really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,” he said. “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.” \nLoren Thompson, a defense consultant, explained that “Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances — like nuclear war.” The high cost, he said, “is driven by the demands of the mission.” \nTodd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the cost is expected to reach $4 billion, but there is a reason for the price tag, he pointed out. \n“I think once [Trump] sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,” Harrison said. He added that Air Force One isn’t just a symbol of presidential power, but also serves as a “flying command post.” \n“In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,” Harrison noted. \nWatch Trump explain his tweet to reporters, here: \nFeatured image via Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Related Written by April Hamlin April has studied political science, psychology, and philosophy.

Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint.\nTrump, who stressed during his election campaign that he would use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments.\n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters.\nBoeing has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by the 2024 fiscal year, and it was not clear what Trump's source of information was for the cost.\nThe budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, according to budget documents.\nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, estimated the total cost of the two 747's, which have to be extensively modified so they can function as an airborne White House, was estimated at $3.2 billion.\nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements, and is currently working on engineering and designing the aircraft.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement.\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nSome of the statistics cited by Trump about the plane did not appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing and the Department of Defense, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Speaking to reporters, he added that Americans would expect that future presidents should benefit from upgrades to Air Force One.\nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet and were down around 0.4 percent in the early afternoon. Shares of several other major defense contractors were also lower.\nTrump, who sold his Boeing shares in June according to a spokesman, named former long-time Boeing CEO Jim McNerney to a high-profile business advisory council last week. McNerney could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.\n© REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo REUTERS PICTURES OF THE YEAR 2016 LATEST BROADSIDE\nA New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harm ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. Since winning the Nov. 8 election he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans.\nLast week, after discussions with Trump, United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes Carrier, agreed to keep 800 of 2,100 jobs at Indiana operations of the company's Carrier unit, instead of moving all the jobs to Mexico as originally planned. The company agreed to keep another 300 jobs at a headquarters operation in the state.\nFord, meanwhile, in November allowed Trump to claim credit for a decision not to move production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico that the automaker had already made.\nBoth Ford and United Technologies said they support Trump's efforts to cut corporate tax rates and overhaul regulations, which could save the companies billions in the long run.\nBut in the short term, his comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice.\n\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English.\n\"To think that in 140 characters (the length of a Twitter message) the president can cancel a program is ridiculous. There would be a detailed review by legal professionals on the merits of the termination.\"\nA Trump spokesman said that his comments about the plane reflected the president-elect's desire to keep down costs across the board, and so save taxpayers' money.\nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET\nThe U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current planes that transport the U.S. president.\nBoeing officials were caught off guard by Trump's comments since the company is simply meeting requirements mapped out by the Air Force in consultation with the White House, said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies.\nThe cost of the planes is high because of the unique security requirements and communications equipment, Thompson said.\n\"Air Force One has unique mission requirements, including possibly having to operate in a nuclear war,\" Thompson said. \"Of course it's not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet.\"\nU.S. presidents have used Boeing planes since 1943, according to the company's website.\nThe 747-8 planes, 240 feet long (73 meters) long with a wing span of 224 feet (68 meters), can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One.\nIn a September 2015 Rolling Stone profile of Trump, early on in his presidential campaign, he was Quote: d as enthusing about the capabilities of his own Boeing 757 plane.\n\"It's bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way. Rolls-Royce engines; seats 43. Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "View Comments U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government to cancel purchase of Boeing's new Air Force One plane on Tuesday, saying it was \"ridiculous\" and too expensive. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" said Trump in a Twitter message. Speaking shortly afterward to reporters in New York, Trump said, \"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.\" \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" added Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. Boeing did not immediately return a request for comment. The Air Force first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current Air Force planes used to transport the U.S. president. Air Force One is one of the most visible symbols of the United States. Details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets. The U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co an initial contract worth $25.8 million in January. U.S. presidents have used Boeing plane's since 1943, according to the company's website. The 747-8 planes, 240 feet long (73 meters) long with a wing span of 224 feet (68 meters), can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. - Reuters ",

      "title": "Boeing responds after Trump knocks contract for Air Force One jets [Video]",
      "text": "Donald Trump declared Tuesday morning that the Air Force should cancel its contract with Boeing to build two new presidential airplanes, asserting that the agreement had a $4 billion price tag. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” the president-elect tweeted.\nIt’s not clear how Trump, who frequently tweets exaggerated or baseless claims, arrived at that number. Reuters, citing budget documents, reported that the “budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021.”\nThe aircraft manufacturing company issued a statement clarifying that it is currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of the new aircraft.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nThis preliminary process is expected to determine the ultimate cost that the forthcoming Air Force One aircraft will cost taxpayers.\n“Well, the plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in Trump Tower. “It’s going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program. And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nAn Air Force One aircraft at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, D.C. (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) More Jason Miller, Trump’s communications director, further told reporters that Trump’s tweet “really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending.”\nHe continued: “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.”\nThe full details of the new contract have not yet been released, but some of the costs can be attributed to the high-end security and communications demands of a roaming commander in chief.\nA president needs the ability to travel anywhere on the planet quickly and with little notice. The aircraft has unlimited range because it is capable of refueling while airborne. The jet can function as a mobile command center if the U.S. is under attack. It contains sophisticated, secure communications equipment and onboard electronics that can protect against electromagnetic pulses.\nThe term “Air Force One” can be used to describe any aircraft carrying the president, but since the mid-20th century, it became associated with jets specifically equipped for the president. Now the term refers to one of two modified Boeing 747-200B series aircraft.\nA profile on the White House’s website says Air Force One is operated by the Presidential Airlift Group, founded during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. The group is part of the White House Military Office.\n\n\n“Air Force One is one of the most recognizable symbols of the presidency, spawning countless references not just in American culture but across the world,” the website reads. “Emblazoned with the words ‘United States of America,’ the American flag, and the Seal of the President of the United States, it is an undeniable presence wherever it flies.”\nKevin W. Buckley, an executive officer at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson in Ohio, told the Dayton Daily News that it’s become harder to keep Air Force One airborne now that the aircraft are reaching to end of their 30-year life expectancies.\n“The real challenge, and the challenge that is forcing us to buy newer aircraft for the president, is to overcome the fact that there are heroics going on every day to keep the current aircraft flying and it’s becoming way too expensive and way too difficult to do that,” he said to the paper.\nRead More According to the Associated Press, the new Air Force One planes would go into use around 2024, so Trump would not use them to travel around the world unless he won a second term.\nDonald Trump arrives in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York to speak to members of the media, Dec. 6, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) More Trump does have plenty of familiarity with Boeing’s products. While campaigning, he crisscrossed the country in a private Boeing 757 with his last name emblazoned on the sides. As with all things bearing his name, Trump has praised his private jet as being the best of its kind. \nThe Trump Organization released a video gushing about the plane’s Rolls Royce engine, 24-carat gold-plated seat belts and luxury amenities.\nBack in January 2013, Trump tweeted that he was buying stock in Boeing after it had gone “way down.” At the time, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s lithium batteries were a widely reported problem.\n“@Boeing stock went way down because of 787 — so I just bought stock in @Boeing — great company!” he wrote.\nHis comments Tuesday seemed to have knocked that stock price down some, but his net worth apparently won’t be affected. “The president-elect sold all of his stock back in June,” Miller, Trump’s spokesman, told Yahoo News on a conference call with reporters.\nAdditional reporting by Hunter Walker.",

      "text": "By Tomi Kilgore, MarketWatch\nPresident-elect Trump says Boeing is 'doing a little bit of a number' on the government as cost of next-generation Air Force One spirals upward\nA 137-character tweet from President-elect Donald Trump could be costing Boeing Co. shareholders more than $550 million, as Wall Street got a firsthand look at how easily an incoming commander in chief can move markets.\nBoeing's stock(BA)was down 86 cents, or 0.6%, in midday trade, paring an earlier loss of as much as 1.4%. Based on 647.9 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to the aerospace giant's third-quarter report, that implies about $557.2 million was lopped off Boeing's market capitalization.\nTrump tweeted that an order for Boeing to build a new Air Force One should be canceled because costs had risen to over $4 billion, which would be well more than double earlier budget estimates.\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072)\nTrump didn't just tweet about the order. He told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, where he works and lives, that the building of the plane was \"totally out of control,\" as costs were spiraling, according to ABC News.\n\"I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,\" Trump said. \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\n(https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/806150101060055040)\nBoeing's take on the order was a little different from Trump's.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nBoeing had secured the contract in January to start work on the 747-8 jumbo jets that would replace the planes used as Air Force One beginning early next decade. Although the Pentagon didn't disclose the expected cost of the two new planes, earlier budget estimates put the cost at more than $1.6 billion (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-gets-contract-for-development-work-on-new-air-force-one-planes-2016-01-29).\nBefore Trump's tweet, which was sent just before 9 a.m. Eastern, ahead of the stock market's open, the stock had traded unchanged at $152.16.\nThe stock slid to a premarket low of $149.75, down 1.6% from Monday's close, before recovering slightly. Since the opening bell, the stock has traded within a range of $150.02 to $151.50.\nBoeing's largest shareholder is Capital Research & Management Co., with 50.4 million shares, or 8.2% of the shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to FactSet. The stock's selloff could be costing the fund about $43.4 million.\nDon't miss:Opinion: The 'market,' it turns out, doesn't love Donald Trump's policies (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-market-it-turns-out-doesnt-love-donald-trumps-policies-2016-12-06).\nSee also:What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-president-elect-trump-means-for-companies-by-sector-2016-11-10).\nThe next biggest loser would be Evercore Trust Co., as its 40.2 million shares could be worth $34.6 million less, followed by the Vanguard Group, which could be down nearly $32.3 million on its 37.5 million shares.\nBoeing's stock has gained 4.6% so far in 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Averagehas climbed 10%.\nRob Schroeder contributed to this report.\n-Tomi Kilgore;\n 1254ET\n ",

      "title": "Trump's tweet cost Boeing shareholders more than $550 million",
      "text": "By Tomi Kilgore, MarketWatch\nPresident-elect Trump says Boeing is 'doing a little bit of a number' on the government as cost of next-generation Air Force One spirals upward\nA 137-character tweet from President-elect Donald Trump could be costing Boeing Co. shareholders more than $550 million, as Wall Street got a firsthand look at how easily an incoming commander in chief can move markets.\nBoeing's stock(BA)was down 86 cents, or 0.6%, in midday trade, paring an earlier loss of as much as 1.4%. Based on 647.9 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to the aerospace giant's third-quarter report, that implies about $557.2 million was lopped off Boeing's market capitalization.\nTrump tweeted that an order for Boeing to build a new Air Force One should be canceled because costs had risen to over $4 billion, which would be well more than double earlier budget estimates.\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072)\nTrump didn't just tweet about the order. He told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, where he works and lives, that the building of the plane was \"totally out of control,\" as costs were spiraling, according to ABC News..\n\"I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,\" Trump said. \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\n(https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/806150101060055040)\nBoeing's take on the order was a little different from Trump's.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nBoeing had secured the contract in January to start work on the 747-8 jumbo jets that would replace the planes used as Air Force One beginning early next decade. Although the Pentagon didn't disclose the expected cost of the two new planes, earlier budget estimates put the cost at more than $1.6 billion (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-gets-contract-for-development-work-on-new-air-force-one-planes-2016-01-29).\nBefore Trump's tweet, which was sent just before 9 a.m. Eastern, ahead of the stock market's open, the stock had traded unchanged at $152.16.\nThe stock slid to a premarket low of $149.75, down 1.6% from Monday's close, before recovering slightly. Since the opening bell, the stock has traded within a range of $150.02 to $151.50.\nBoeing's largest shareholder is Capital Research & Management Co., with 50.4 million shares, or 8.2% of the shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to FactSet. The stock's selloff could be costing the fund about $43.4 million.\nDon't miss:Opinion: The 'market,' it turns out, doesn't love Donald Trump's policies (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-market-it-turns-out-doesnt-love-donald-trumps-policies-2016-12-06).\nSee also:What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-president-elect-trump-means-for-companies-by-sector-2016-11-10).\nThe next biggest loser would be Evercore Trust Co., as its 40.2 million shares could be worth $34.6 million less, followed by the Vanguard Group, which could be down nearly $32.3 million on its 37.5 million shares.\nBoeing's stock has gained 4.6% so far in 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Averagehas climbed 10%.\nRob Schroeder contributed to this report.\n-Tomi Kilgore;\n 1216ET\n ",

      "text": "Sanjeev Verma | Hindustan Times | Getty Images Dennis Muilenburg, Chief Executive Officer of The Boeing Company \nDonald Trump 's Tuesday morning criticism of Boeing closely followed the publishing of a story in which the aerospace giant's CEO expressed concerns about the trade agenda Trump has backed. \nThe Chicago Tribune published a column Tuesday morning which included Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's recent comments arguing that free trade is a crucial part of the U.S. economy. Boeing has a lucrative jet business in China. \nMuilenburg expressed concerns about resistance to trade, which is partly driven by Trump repeatedly slamming the Trans-Pacific Partnership and North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump appealed to many blue-collar voters by saying those deals cost Americans jobs and depressed their wages. \nOnly 22 minutes after the article published, Trump threatened on Twitter to \"cancel\" Boeing's contract for new Air Force One jets, arguing that an unconfirmed $4 billion cost was too high for the project. \nThere is no clear indication that the Tribune story, or another Washington Post article about Pentagon waste, specifically prompted Trump's attack. Still, he has used his favorite social media platform repeatedly in the past to respond to coverage he views as unfavorable. \nFor instance, Trump has used Twitter to criticize coverage from The New York Times and CNN, among other outlets. \nTrump's tweet moved markets, as Boeing shares fell as much as 1 percent Tuesday before recovering.

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe secretary of the Air Force has a message for Donald Trump, who says he wants to cancel Boeing's \"out of control\" contract to build a new presidential aircraft: \"It is a bit more complicated.\" \nDeborah Lee James, responding to the president-elect's tweet early Tuesday calling for scrapping the multibillion-dollar plan for a pair of new 747s, told POLITICO the new Air Force One will be so expensive because it requires so many added features demanded by White House security personnel. Story Continued Below \nThe features, including protecting the aircraft from missile attacks and the ability to communicate with nuclear forces, are not only intended to protect the commander-in-chief but also to allow him or her to run the government for extended periods of time during a national emergency. \n\"Air Force One, although it is a 747 platform, is way, way more than what you would think of as a commercial airliner,\" James said in an interview. \"It really is, in many ways, a flying White House, in terms of the security. There's [electronic] countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner. So it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye.\" \nShe also contended that while the Air Force oversees the program, the aircraft standards are set by the White House. \n\"There are professional security people who are in the White House who develop requirements for Air Force One,\" she explained. \"They are not political appointees; they are professional security people. Those requirements then come to the Air Force and our job is to build the acquisition strategy around it to deliver those requirements. In other words, we didn't make up all these security factors and communications standards.” By Louis Nelson \nCould the price tag be pared down? \"Yes, if you change the requirements,\" James said. \"If you have lesser communications requirements, if you have lesser countermeasures, if you have lesser any of these factors.\" \n“Any program can be advanced, it can be modified, it can be canceled,\" said James, the civilian leader of the Air Force who is expected to step down on Jan. 20 after more than three years in the job. \"These are all within the realm of the possible. But we did the best that we could to create an acquisition strategy around the requirements that were developed by the professionals in the White House who are charged with that.\" \nShe also pointed out that the new fleet, which is now in the research and development phase, is not scheduled to be ready for another decade, after Trump is already out of office. \n\"It will be the president after the next president who actually flies on this Air Force One,\" she said. \nThe special needs of the president may not be the only obstacle to canceling the project. The likely political pushback from Boeing boosters on Capitol Hill was also on display Tuesday \n\"The workers of my state and the workers of Boeing across this country do an incredible job and build and incredible airplane,\" Sen. Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, where the fleet in being built, told POLITICO. \"I hope the president-elect takes the time to talk to the Pentagon and the Air Force and Boeing about how defense contracts work before he tweets.\" \nHer fellow Washington Democrat, Rep. Suzan DelBene, took to T witter herself, accusing Trump of \"using unsubstantiated facts to publicly attack American aerospace workers, despite saying he’ll protect U.S. jobs.\" \nBoeing, for its part, struck a measured tone. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nBut are there other options for a new Air Force One? \nSure, responded James. \"You could compete\" the program and pick another main contractor. \"Perhaps Airbus could win.\" \nAustin Wright contributed to this report.

      "text": "  His latest bugbear? The mega-contract with Boeing for a new Air Force One presidential aircraft: \"Costs are out of control,\" he railed on Tuesday. \"Cancel order!\" \nWASHINGTON: Four weeks after his White House victory, Donald Trump hasn’t changed a bit. He’s still wedded to Twitter and still breaking all the political rules — in essence, the president-elect is still as unpredictable as ever. \nFrom his gilded Manhattan penthouse in Trump Tower, the Republican billionaire-turned-world leader has tweeted more than 115 times since his shock November 8 win, with the New York Times, China and companies shifting jobs abroad among the targets of his now-legendary tweetstorms. \nHis latest bugbear? The mega-contract with Boeing for a new Air Force One presidential aircraft: “Costs are out of control,” he railed on Tuesday. “Cancel order!” \nIn the first days after defeating the Democrat Hillary Clinton, who was vying to become America’s first female president, Team Trump appeared clunky and unprepared for the mammoth task of building a government around a leader who has never held elective office. \nBut in between tweets the 70-year-old Trump soon found his rhythm, pulling ahead of his predecessors in terms of naming his inner circle of cabinet members and advisors. \nAgainst all odds, Trump — long seen with scorn by the Republican rank-and-file — also has reunited the party which, with control over the White House and both houses of Congress, is once again enjoying the taste of power. \nThe populist candidate however has not forgotten that he owes his victory to the voters, and not the establishment. He has launched an unorthodox “thank you” tour — essentially a victory lap in the swing states that swept him to office. \nThe tour, which began last week in Ohio, moves on Tuesday to a 10,000-seat sports arena in Fayetteville, North Carolina — the site of several raucous Trump campaign rallies. \nUnconventional \nTrump deserves “good marks for appointing a larger than usual number of cabinet members — he’s actually ahead of the average” at this stage in the transition, political analyst Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia told AFP. \nSabato noted that after a few early controversial appointments, like that of Breitbart chief Steve Bannon as chief strategist, Trump has shown willingness to look beyond the party’s far-right wing. \nDay after day, a stream of people with diverse backgrounds have paraded in and out of Trump Tower: conservative and moderate Republicans, former critics, billionaire businessmen and even some Democrats like former vice president Al Gore. \nBut even though Trump has vowed to “drain the swamp” after taking office on January 20, he has looked to Wall Street — repeatedly slammed on the campaign trail — and the ranks of top lobbyists for advice. \n“That’s the only people you have down there,” he told CBS News when asked about the number of lobbyists on his transition team. \nThe president-elect has repeatedly ignored the protestations of the White House press corps, who have howled about his failure to hold a single press conference since his election, and his continued refusal to have journalists travel with him. \nAnd he waves off any questions about his possible inclusion of son-in-law Jared Kushner as a top advisor, or the possible conflicts of interest between his real estate empire and having the highest office in the land. \nOn December 15, Trump will reveal how he plans to reorganize his family business to remove any hint of impropriety. \nPragmatic or winging it? \nTrump has so far remained true to his winning formula: make shocking statements, create ambiguity and drama to earn attention, and hold your cards close to the chest on all negotiations. \nA prime example: ask lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, about what Trump plans to do on Cuba — it’s hard to say right now if he will pursue Barack Obama’s thaw in ties with Havana, or upend it. \n“I’m not clear on what he might want to do, but then neither is he,” veteran Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told AFP. \nWill he repeal Obama’s signature health care reform, or just modify it? \n“Mr. Trump uses these phrases which don’t give you much help,” said Democratic Senator Ben Cardin. “It’s hard to judge until you see the specifics.” \nThe same goes for the nuclear deal that world powers struck with Iran, the Paris climate change agreement and ties with China: Trump deliberately makes provocative statements or gestures, as he did by speaking with Taiwan’s leader in a spectacular break with decades of US diplomatic protocol. \nBut no one can quite tell if he means to follow through. \nIn any event, his supporters are thrilled with what they have seen so far. \nCollin Miller, a 19-year-old restaurant worker in Dayton, Ohio who travelled to Cincinnati for Trump’s rally last week, said he was “elated”— though he was disappointed about Trump’s “backing off of Hillary Clinton.” \n“It honestly doesn’t look good at the end of the day for America to put someone that you ran against in jail, even though she should be in jail,” he told AFP.",

      "text": "Air Force One (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\nNEW YORK — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets.\nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”\nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million.\nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.”\nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes.\n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official.\n“The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest.\nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.”\nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They’ll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President.\nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin.\n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement.\nTrump’s comment emphasizes that he’s looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller.\n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said.\nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded.\n“This Air Force One that we’re currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,” Earnest said. “It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.”\nOf the two Air Force One jets that are currently in use, one has been flying since Ronald Reagan was president, and the other was delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain.\nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do.\nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One.\nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones.\nBoeing’s first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy.\nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines.\nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy.\nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment.\nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month.\nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a “great company!”\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "  Trump Takes Calculated Shot at Boeing Trump Takes Calculated Shot at Boeing   Let's now head to the Donald Trump Air Force One tweet. As with most everything that you see in the Drive-By Media, there's much, much more to this than meets the eye. There's much, much more to this than it might appear. \nLet's start with the Trumpster himself in New York City in the lobby of Trump Tower. He came out of the of the elevator and sought out the media for this. He was not being peppered with questions. He came out of there -- I watched it -- he came out of that elevator and walked up to where the bank of cameras or microphones or maybe some journalist was there, he walked up and purposely made the point here that the Air Force One replacement order is just out of control and we need to cancel it. \nTRUMP: The plane is totally out of control. It's gonna be over $4 billion, it's for Air Force One program. And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nRUSH: All right. Now, I was reading my tech blogs on this today. (laughing) I just love this because they're typical young whippersnappers. They think they know everything and that Trump is this raging idiot. And so they recruit all the stats of what a Boeing 747 costs without factoring in the modifications necessary to make it an Air Force One. They don't know that there are two of them that are being bought. I mean, it's just funny. \nSo here's the deal as it's currently understood. We're talking about the Boeing 747-8. That is the largest version of the Boeing 747. They are not selling well. Boeing has had to reduce production because orders for this plane are not what they had hoped. As with all Air Force Ones, there are two, and both travel on every presidential trip. One is either a decoy or a backup and the other is the primary. But they both fly, because if one of them has a mechanical, you can't put the president on anything other than this airplane. \nTrump cannot fly his own plane as president. He may try, but it doesn't have anywhere near the security, the avoidance technology for attacks, missile attacks and so forth, shielding for various kinds of other attacks to disrupt communications. Air Force One has a legitimate, fully outfitted operating room on board. \nIf the president is shot, rather than take him to a hospital, if it's close by they'll take him back to Air Force One. And they could even do some surgery, they wouldn't want to, in flight. But if they had to get out of there real quick and go someplace they could. I mean, Trump's plane simply doesn't have what the law requires for the president to be kept safe and secure, plus it's not big enough. \nNow, some of the naysayers here say, \"Well, Trump's just mad because he's not gonna get to fly on it because these two 747-8's are not gonna be ready for service 'til 2024.\" So the tech blogs think Trump is just mad because they're not gonna get 'em built soon enough for him to use. That's not what's going on here. \nNow, the actual money involved, Trump says that the contract is $4 billion and that's just out of control, that's just irresponsible. We're wasting money here. Well, the actual contract details as best I've been able to come up with are these. There are three contracts to get this whole production going, and the first three, which are the down payment, totals $169 million. \nThe two brand-new Air Force Ones, according to Pentagon estimates that have been made public -- now, there could be hidden costs, other things that haven't been made public, but the public cost of the brand-new two Air Force Ones is $165 billion. That's two-and-a-half billion short of Trump's four billion that he says Boeing is going to be paid. \nThe Air Force announced this plan two years ago. They promised to use the most proven and advanced technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep costs under control. Remember, now, this is for two airplanes, not just one, and $165 billion is the published cost. However, there's much, much more going on here, ladies and gentlemen, than meets the eye. \nThe first item of interest is that the Pentagon, Bob Woodward at the Washington Post has an exclusive that the Pentagon has buried evidence of $125 billion in bureaucratic waste. This is not the $600 toilet seats. This is $125 billion being given to people and payments to support the existence of a bureaucracy that really has nothing to do with the defense of the country. It's just a bureaucracy supposedly out of control. \nNow, we've gotta take this under advisement, too, because it's the Washington Post, it's Bob Woodward, and the left automatically hates the Department of Defense. They despise 'em 'cause that's where we go to war. That's where the weapons of war are. And you know leftists and weapons of war, from guns on up to nuclear missiles, they just hate it all. They don't like it and they've been trying to cut the Pentagon budget for years. It's interesting that this story comes out as Obama is on the way out even though it's been researched for a year. \nIsn't it interesting the Washington Post never published a story about bureaucratic waste at all for eight years under Obama and here we are on the verge of Trump being inaugurated and here comes this massive story of Pentagon waste. But we'll throw it in the mix because Trump is making the same case, $4 billion for two airplanes, it's ridiculous, we can't pay Boeing that much. \nThere's also, ladies and gentlemen, additional information. In addition to the Pentagon and this $125 billion, are you aware that Boeing donated one million -- whoa. Boeing were huge underwriters of the Clinton Foundation. Boeing paid Bill Clinton a number of millions of dollars to go out there and do speeches. It could well be that Boeing is engaging in business overseas that Trump doesn't approve of, that he doesn't like. \nHe thinks Boeing ought to bring some of that business, some of those jobs back. It could also be that Trump is simply negotiating. This is what he does. If you've read The Art of the Deal, you know that he will publicly negotiate. He will call out the people he's negotiating against, and it could well be that by calling Boeing out and claiming they're charging $4 billion, he's negotiating with them in public. \nThere's a whole lot here and the Drive-Bys are just treating this as the tweet and the tweet alone. \"Look at Trump. He's out there ripping Boeing, $4 billion, Air Force One.\" These are the kinds of things that experts are brought on TV to say, \"This isn't done. This is not what happens in transitions. This is not presidential at all. This is embarrassing, got a president that doesn't even know what he's doing. These kind of discussions of contracts should be kept behind closed doors in private matters and so forth, not airing in public like this.\" \nI don't think you can rule out the fact that Boeing was dancing big and riding hard with the Clintons. The amount of money that Boeing donated to the Clintons -- I had it right here in my Stack, and I must have thrown it away thinking it was a dupe of something that wasn't. I'll find it during the break here, but Boeing and the Clintons have been inseparable. A humongous amount of money that Boeing donated and expected Hillary to win. That's part and parcel. Boeing underwrote the Hillary presidential campaign by virtue of this campaign donation. Well, I don't know, charitable donation, whatever, to the Clinton Crime Family Foundation and hiring Bill to do speeches all over the world for 200 grand a pop. So it's much more going on here than anybody knows. Other people are accusing Trump in his ignorance of attacking Boeing's stock price and it's just unseemly, it's not right, it's not fair. \nOne thing people are gonna have to understand about Trump: He's not stupid; he's not a bull in a china shop. You may end up disagreeing with him profoundly. You may not end up not liking him at all before this is over. I don't know. But he's not dumb, and he's not ignorant, and it's not that he doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing and is doing it for a reason. He's doing this on purpose. There is an objective to this. The left just can't help themselves, though. They have to cast this guy... \nThey have to portray him as somebody that's a walking mental midget, that literally has no idea what he's done here by winning the presidency, that has no idea how to talk, has no idea how to behave. They continue to make the mistake of plugging him into their model. They're plugging him into what they think an accomplished politician is, and he's not that, he's never been that, and he's not going to be that. He doesn't want to a politician, successful or not. He is president and he's going to lead this country in the ways that he's being very open and honest about. \nAnyway, let me take a brief time-out here. I'll find these exact Clinton numbers and get back to you we'll get started on the phones here fairly quickly as well. Sit tight. \nBREAK TRANSCRIPT \nRUSH: Here are the numbers, the Boeing numbers with the Clintons. By the way, also keep in mind, Boeing is in the middle of selling planes to Iran. Let me remind you about this. Remember the Corker Bill, folks. Senator Corker, Tennessee, came up with a bill during the time Obama was negotiating the nuclear deal with the Iranians, and the Corker Bill was presented to us as the way the Republicans in the Senate were going to be keep Obama honest and make sure that he didn't do anything nefarious. \nIt was a way of getting around the Senate having to vote on this as a treaty. It actually green-lighted Obama to do whatever kind of deal he wanted without the Senate being involved. That's what ticked everybody off. The Republicans told us that the Senate was not going to invoke the treaty clause and therefore require 60-some-odd votes in the Senate for passage of the Obama's deal. Instead, they did the Corker deal, and the Corker Bill was going to be a substitute way of the Republicans making sure Obama dotted all the T's and crossed all the I's. \nIt was a... It was a... (sigh) Well, I'm trying to think of another word for \"lie.\" We were misled. The Corker Bill and the deal was actually a green light for Obama, and we later came to find out why. We know that the Republican Party has become a pro-amnesty party because of donors. The Republican Party, as we discussed for the past number of years and really intensely during last year's campaign -- the Republican Party -- became more devoted to its donors, i.e., money than to its voters and their desires and ideas. And we couldn't figure out, \"Why are the Republicans of all people facilitating nuclear deal with Iran? \n\"Why would the Republicans want their fingerprints on a deal that allows the world's state sponsor of terrorism to nuke up?\" Well, it turns out it was Boeing. Not totally, but one of the reasons. Remember this, Mr. Snerdley? The Iranian national airline is essentially falling apart, and because of sanctions and freezing of their money in our banks, they haven't been able to modernize enough their infrastructure, including purchase new aircraft. So the Corker Bill was about getting the sanctions lifted and approving Obama's deal because Boeing wanted to go sell the Iranians new commercial airliners. \nAnd they couldn't do that with sanctions in place. They couldn't make a deal. And so the Republicans were instrumental here in making it possible for Boeing, and Boeing had donated to Republicans to make this possible. You can't throw this here... You know how Trump is talking about the Iranian deal. He hates it! And don't think he doesn't know about all this. You know, Trump going out tweeting about $4 billion and Boeing and a new Air Force One? There's so much more behind this than what it's being portrayed. \nSo there's a possibility here that Trump is really irritated at Boeing for helping facilitate the Iranian nuclear deal -- or not. I mean, I'm throwing out possibilities here. But I'm telling you, something is going on. Here's the story of Boeing and the Clintons. Ready for this? In 2010, two months after Hillary went to Moscow to broker a $3.7 billion trade deal with Russia, \"Boeing donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation... Then in July 2012, just months after the State Department helped it secure major deals in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, Boeing said it wanted to sponsor a speech by Bill Clinton... \n\"Bill Clinton was paid $250,000,\" and Boeing also gave Hillary $166,735 in 2016 for her campaign. So Hillary Clinton as secretary of state had helped Boeing broker two deals, one in Russia (a $3.7 billion deal) which got them a $900,000 contribution to the Clinton Foundation, and in 2012 Boeing hired Bill to do a speech for a quarter mill -- chump change compared to what they've been sending Hilary. Plus, they sent about $170,000 in campaign donations. Trump knows all this. He's very much aware of the cronyism that's been going on. \nNow he's out saying... (telephone ringing) Hang on, folks. Somebody's calling me here. It's a wrong number. I heard something and said, \"What the heck is that?\" It sounded like a tech malfunction. I looked over and saw it was my phone. Did that sound like a phone ringing to you? (interruption) Okay. I did not lose my place. You thought it was some tech snafu, too, and were wondering what the hell was going on. I'm sure you thought what are you doing wrong in there that I'm gonna get mad at. \nSo Trump is very much aware of all this and goes out and publicly says, \"We're throwing $4 billion away on this Air Force One plane.\" He said, \"Tear it up. Cancel the order.\" Well, it's a little late to cancel the order, but I'm telling you, folks, there is much, much more going on here than one little Trump tweet would indicate. I think you should use this as, eh, a little bit of a teachable moment. Trump is not the dummy. He's not ignorant. \nHe's not the inexperienced bull in a china shop that they want you to believe he is. And as we've just demonstrated here with this one little 140-character tweet about canceling the order for the new Air Force Ones because Boeing is charging too much, look at what all the backstory is. Boeing in Iran. Boeing in Russia. Boeing with the Clintons. This may not sit well with Trump. So the point is, there's always stuff going on behind a Trump tweet or a Trump story that you don't know. Trump is not a surface individual. There's more depth to him than anybody wants to acknowledge here. \nBREAK TRANSCRIPT \nRUSH: You could buy sixty-five EIB One aircraft -- sixty-five of 'em -- for $4 billion. Ah, they're about 60, 65, depending on... Well, actually that would be a G650, but you could buy between 61 and 65 of 'em, depending on how you chose to outfit them and paint them and so on. A lot of money. \nEND TRANSCRIPT Related Links",

      "text": "32 minutes ago • Views: 726 \nShortly after a story appeared this morning in the Chicago Tribune about the CEO of Boeing expressing misgivings about Donald Trump’s trade policy, Donald Trump fired up his Android phone while atop his solid gold toilet throne in his gold- and marble-encrusted penthouse and called to cancel Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One planes: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! Reply Reply w/ Quote \nSince this is Donald Trump we’re talking about, the president-elect of the United States, Boeing’s stock price immediately plunged , costing the company as much as $1 billion. \nAnd of course, no Donald Trump tweet is complete without a blatant, in-your-face lie, and it turns out that the projected cost of the new Air Force One planes (there are two of them) is not “more than $4 billion.” \nThe Air Force said previously that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two new presidential aircraft, which will be four-engine Boeing 747-8s. \nThat’s actually about $825 million per aircraft. And remember, these aren’t ordinary planes — they’re intended to protect the president on his trips, and continue functioning even in the case of nuclear war. \nBut we can’t expect Donald Trump to think about things like that when his ego is wounded.",

HOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government’s auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years.

Boeing has that contract. It would also build the replacement Air Force One. \n--- \nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT? \nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20. Related content",

      "text": "President-elect criticized cost of Air Force One upgrade Republican has said he isn’t ‘big investor’ in stock market Share on Facebook \nPresident-elect Donald Trump sold all of his stocks in June, a spokesman said, divesting himself of holdings including Boeing Co., the target of a Trump tweet on Tuesday over the cost of a new presidential aircraft. \nTrump had between $50,000 to $100,000 of Boeing stock when he filed his personal financial disclosure on May 15. Trump said Tuesday that a contract with Boeing to replace Air Force One should be canceled because of “ridiculous” costs, taking aim at plans to replace jets that are among the most visible symbols of the American presidency. \nAsked whether he had a stake in the company, Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on a conference call Tuesday morning that Trump sold his stock in June. Miller later clarified in a text message to Bloomberg News that that meant all of his holdings. \nTrump’s disclosure showed he held as much as $38 million in stocks of companies including Citigroup Inc., Apple Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Ford Motor Co., in addition to Boeing. \nTrump had said in an Aug. 2 interview with Fox Business that he didn’t own stocks. He “got out, and it was actually very good timing,” Trump said, without specifying the dates of any sales. \n“But I’ve never been a big investor in the stock market,” he added. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has returned 3 percent since the interview. \nPrevious presidents have sold stock holdings and placed the proceeds into blind trusts managed by independent overseers so they can’t be accused of having conflicts of interest. Trump has said he’ll announce on December 15 plans to leave his business, the Trump Organization, “in total.” \nMiller didn’t immediately clarify if Trump had also sold corporate bonds that he owned as of the May disclosure. \nDuring his campaign, Trump decried the state of the economy, the national debt and the Federal Reserve’s policies keeping interest rates low, saying stock prices were artificially inflated. \n“The only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that’s going to come crashing down,” he said during his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton in September. “We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force 1",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nTrump later told reporters the cost was \"ridiculous\" and that he wanted the aircraft maker to \"make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency.\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nWhile that is true, the current aircraft that the president uses for the bulk of his foreign and domestic travel are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. Two variants of a Boeing 747 are in rotation. The planes were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One took President Barack Obama on a trip to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nAir Force One, the distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal, is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that take advantage of the most-up-to-date advances in technology.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who travel with him aboard Air Force One enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite that can function as an operating room, in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE IN THE PROJECT?\nSo far, the Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added a commercial aircraft the president would use. Boeing has that contract. It would also build the replacement Air Force One.\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.",

Cancel order!” \nTrump’s own plane, with his name splashed across the side, was formerly owned by Microsoft’s Paul Allen. Trump’s jet is worth an estimated $100 million . It has a lot of features. It includes bedroom, dining room and private guest room. Also there is a bath with 24 – karat gold fixtures! It is important to mention that this Boeing 757 has entertainment system inside – installed video room with cinema system. So, all of the passengers can enjoy a comfortable flight. \nI know we cannot compare the two planes, one is for luxury and the other is for the security and protection of the POTUS and staff as well as luxury. Of course, the costs will be far different, the point is, Trump understands when a company is attempting to gouge the tax payers and charge insane prices. \nIn a surprise appearance in front of reporters at Trump Tower after sending the social media message, Trump expanded on his latest target for negotiation. \n“Well, the plane is totally out of control. It’s gonna be over 4 billion dollars … and, I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” Trump said. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nThe planes are not scheduled to even be ready until 2024, so Trump would not even be able to fly on them unless he wins a second election. \nBoeing issued a statement regarding the Air Force One program. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nAir Force One is so much more expensive than commercial planes because of the communications package and air defense measures. Boeing was the only choice for the build because it’s an American company and they have the only four-engine aircraft, a necessity because of the weight. \nKeeping the old Air Force One is an option, but not an ideal one. The plane has a lifespan of about 30 years, and the current ones are in their late 20s. As the planes age, safety becomes a concern while maintenance and other costs increase. \nExactly how Trump will take on the price of the plane, Miller said, “We can get into that more after the president-elect is sworn in on January 20.” \nAFF’s Huny Badger is a Veteran who served our country as an Army Combat Medic.

      "text": "Boeing to Acquire Liquid Robotics to Enhance Autonomous Seabed-to-Space Information Services Developer of Wave Glider® ocean robot boosts ocean data collection capabilities Photos (1) Tuesday, December 6, 2016 (11:37am) \nBoeing and Liquid Robotics have collaborated on extensive integration on the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft (SHARC®), a version of the Wave Glider®, since 2014. The SHARC, integrated with Boeing’s advanced sensors, connects intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities ranging from satellites to manned and unmanned aircraft to sub-surface crafts. (Photo: Liquid Robotics) CLOSE \nST. LOUIS, Dec. 6, 2016 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] has entered into an agreement to acquire Liquid Robotics, a market leader in autonomous maritime systems and developer of the Wave Glider ocean surface robot, to grow its seabed-to-space autonomous capabilities. \n“With Liquid Robotics’ innovative technology and Boeing’s leading intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions, we are helping our customers address maritime challenges in ways that make existing platforms smarter, missions safer and operations more efficient,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security. \nIn September 2014, Boeing and Liquid Robotics entered into a teaming agreement resulting in extensive integration on the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft (SHARC®), a version of the Wave Glider. The SHARC, integrated with Boeing’s advanced sensors, connects intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities ranging from satellites to manned and unmanned aircraft to sub-surface crafts. \nLiquid Robotics has designed and manufactured the Wave Glider, the first wave and solar-powered autonomous ocean robot, since its founding in 2007. With more than 1 million nautical miles traveled, the Wave Glider’s capabilities address the challenges facing defense, commercial and science customers by making ocean data collection and communications easier, safer and immediate. \n“I am proud of our team, culture, and relentless commitment to designing the best ocean surface robot in the maritime industry,” said Gary Gysin, president and CEO of Liquid Robotics. “This acquisition allows us to leverage the strengths of one of the world’s leading global companies while continuing to push our innovation to new levels.” \nLiquid Robotics has approximately 100 employees in California and Hawaii. The company will become a subsidiary of Boeing operating under its current business model and reporting to Kory Mathews, vice president of Autonomous Systems for Defense, Space & Security. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Completion of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \nFor more information on Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com/ .

      "text": "Though Boeing's (BA) shares slipped a bit today after President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to criticize the price for a new Air Force One , it won't damage Trump's pocketbook. That's because Trump sold his Boeing stock by June, his spokesman Jason Miller said today. Trump on Twitter said \"costs are out of control\" on the planned Air Force One replacement, a Boeing 747-800, saying the costs are \"more than $4 billion\" and that the government should \"cancel\" the order. Shares of Boeing fell about 1% after the tweet. The critique raised eyebrows among observers, who noted that Trump himself was once a Boeing shareholder. When asked about the president...",

      "text": "Trump calls for canceling Boeing's Air Force One contract in morning tweet \nby: Barrie Barber, Dayton Daily News Updated: Dec 6, 2016 - 1:01 PM President-elect Donald Trump slammed the cost of a new Air Force One and used Twitter to call for canceling the new aircraft fleet Tuesday, raising questions about the future of the program managed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. >> Read more trending stories In a tweet sent at 8:52 a.m., the president-elect wrote: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher declined comment and referred all questions to the Air Force, which did not immediately release a response. The Air Force is planning to replace two aging Boeing 747-200s that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard with two newer and highly modified Boeing 747-8 airliners. The jets were expected to join the fleet by 2024, replacing a current fleet that will be more than three decades old at the time. A program official at Wright-Patterson has said the White House has urgently asked for the jets because of reliability concerns as the planes age, among other concerns. Richard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said in an email the tweet was \"complete nonsense. But making program management and military requirements decisions via tweet is just very wrong.\" In an interview, he said the president-elect's position on the Air Force One replacement was \"very concerning.\" \"This is not from the standpoint of the contract, but just from deeper lack of understanding for what the president does,\" he said. \"It's very important for the president to travel, visit other places in the country, and other countries and be able to manage national emergencies while he travels. You can't do that without Air Force One. \"Now the alternative is he thinks a 50-year-old Air Force One will do the job,\" Aboulafia said. \"Hopefully, nobody can be that completely misinformed.\" A message seeking comment was sent to Trump spokespersons this morning. Todd Harrison, director of the aerospace project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said it's a tradition for an outgoing president to request a new Air Force One \"so that it would not be seen as being for personal benefit.\" President George H.W. Bush's administration OK'd the purchase of the current fleet, he noted. \"If Trump cancels the program now, it could be another eight years before a new replacement program is started, so that aircraft would be pushing 40 years old by then,\" Harrison wrote. The production of the iconic Boeing 747 jumbo jet could come to an end \"so it's not clear that the Air Force would be able to buy a commercial derivative plane like the 747 from a U.S. company in the future.\" Neither Boeing nor the Air Force has released the latest figures on the program. Aboulafia said the more than $4 billion Trump cited was \"about right over 10 years.\" \"It's incredibly expensive to be able to manage a country and fight a war from the air, and build two planes that can do that,\" he said. But he rejected the claim the costs were \"out of control.\" Loren B. Thompson, a senior defense analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant, said in an email the president-elect \"probably overstates\" the cost of the two new jets. \"Boeing thinks the program will cost less, but it is hard to say precisely how much because the Air Force hasn't finalized the requirements for the program. \"This is a plane that might need to remain airborne for days during a nuclear war,\" Thompson wrote. \"It must be able to carry out functions no other plane in the world would need to accomplish.\" The jet's cost is driven by its mission with self-protection measures such as shielding against electromagnetic pulse in a nuclear explosion and specialized communication gear to command a nuclear strike \"which is why it is so much more expensive than the planes Trump is used to buying,\" Harrison wrote. The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force hopes to land one of the current Air Force Ones when the plane was expected to be retired in the next decade to add to its collection of 10 presidential aircraft.

      "text": "Boeing becomes latest target of Trump tweets over Air Force One costs Travis Pittman, KING 2:41 PM. EST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nTrump thinks Boeing is pulling a number on the government and wants to halt their development of the new presidential aircraft. USA TODAY\nAir Force One at Kansas City International Airport in 2014. (Photo: Colin E. Braley, AP)\nIn a tweet posted Tuesday morning, President-Elect Donald Trump said he wanted to cancel the order placed in January 2015 with Boeing for a pair of 747-8s that are destined to be the new presidential plane, Air Force One.\nIn a sole source contract, the U.S. Air Force named Boeing as the manufacturer to replace the current fleet of two presidential aircraft. The new planes will be built on Boeing’s 747-8 platform and replace the current Air Force One fleet that operates specially configured 747-200Bs.\nHere’s Trump’s tweet:\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 The price for the two planes was not specified at the time, but the list price for one 747-8 is $378.5 million, which works out to $757 million for two. But that is only a portion of the $4 billion cost Trump cited.\nThe president-elect later told reporters in the lobby of the Trump Tower Tuesday morning, “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.”\nHere is a comment made by Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James when the contract award was announced nearly two years ago:\nThe Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that), when fully missionized, meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission, while reflecting the office of the president of the United States of America consistent with the national public interest.\nThe unspecified “fully missionized” is where the money goes. Boeing is probably selling the actual airplanes to the government at well below the list price.\nAerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia told the Washington Post this morning that Trump’s tweet “was completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing.” Defense analyst Loren Thompson told the Post :\nAir Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances — like nuclear war. The price tag is driven by the demands of the mission.\nThe Trumpian tweet sent Boeing’s stock down about 0.9% Tuesday morning to trade at $150.90, in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $153.755.\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

      "text": "WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nTrump later told reporters the cost was \"ridiculous\" and that he wanted the aircraft maker to \"make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nWhile that is true, the current aircraft that the president uses for the bulk of his foreign and domestic travel are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. Two variants of a Boeing 747 are in rotation. The planes were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One took President Barack Obama on a trip to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nAir Force One, the distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal, is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that take advantage of the most-up-to-date advances in technology.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter to Boeing: 'Cancel Order' for New 747 RICHARD CLOUGH, TONY CAPACCIO Bloomberg News \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said the latest Air Force One order should be canceled, citing the high costs of converting the Boeing jumbo jet for presidential use. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,\" Trump said Tuesday on Twitter. \"Cancel order!\" \nThe Pentagon is looking to replace its aging fleet of Boeing 747-200 aircraft, which will reach the planned 30-year service life in 2017. Officials have said the next Air Force One 747-8 jets are estimated to begin operations in fiscal 2023. The Air Force expects the planes to have the range to fly between continents and comparable interiors to the current 747, whose features include work and sleeping quarters for the president and first family. \n\"The plane is totally out of control,\" Trump said in a brief appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nTrump didn't specify where the $4 billion figure came from. The Air Force has budgeted about $1.6 billion through 2019. \nA representative of the Chicago-based planemaker wasn't immediately available for comment. \nBoeing is the latest major U.S. company to be called out by Trump after the president-elect negotiated a deal with United Technologies Corp. to keep more than 1,000 jobs in the U.S. Trump, who turned U.S. employment and corporate tax reform into defining issues during the campaign, has drawn both praise and criticism for directly intervening in companies' affairs.",

      "text": "  \nWASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing’s contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited “out of control” costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with “Cancel order!” \nTrump later told reporters the cost was “ridiculous” and that he wanted the aircraft maker to “make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nHere’s a look at Trump’s claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency. \n___ \nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST? \nThe Government Accountability Office, the government’s auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n___ \nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN’T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE? \nWhile that is true, the current aircraft that the president uses for the bulk of his foreign and domestic travel are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. Two variants of a Boeing 747 are in rotation. The planes were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One took President Barack Obama on a trip to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday. \nAir Force One, the distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal, is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that take advantage of the most-up-to-date advances in technology. \nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House. \nThe president and most of those who travel with him aboard Air Force One enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite that can function as an operating room, in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests. \n___ \nWHAT IS BOEING’S ROLE IN THE PROJECT? \nSo far, the Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added a commercial aircraft the president would use. Boeing has that contract. It would also build the replacement Air Force One. \n___ \nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT? \nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "Donald Trump Slapped Down By Boeing And White House For Wildly Inaccurate Figure Well this is getting very repetitive. 06/12/2016 20:21 Jack Sommers Assistant News Editor, Huffington Post UK Donald Trump has been slapped down for factually incorrect comments saying the government should cancel contracts to build new Air Force One planes, which hurt Boeing’s stock. Trump said costs for the Boeing 747s were “totally out of control”, though the $4 billion figure he cited appeared to be way off. The US Defense Department budgeted $1.65 billion for the two planes, Reuters reported in January when Boeing won the contract. Trump told journalists in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York: “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” Trump tweeted earlier on Tuesday: “Cancel order!” Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Trump’s comments “do not appear to reflect arrangements” with Boeing. After Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, the value of Boeing’s shares fell by 1.6%, according to financial data company FactSet. Boeing issued a statement that brushed off Trump’s remarks without even mentioning them. Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump addressed the press in the lobby of Trump Tower to elaborate on his tweet Chris Radburn/PA Wire The current Air Force One It said: “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters: “We’re going to look for ways to save money... We’ll have specifics after the president is sworn in.” Trump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock calling it a “great company”. . @Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing - great company! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2013 But Miller said on Tuesday he sold all of his stocks in June. In May, Trump’s financial disclosure said he owned stocks in the company worth up to $100,000. It has been suggested Trump’s seemingly random tweets on subjexts are attempts to distract from press attention. Talking Points Memo noted his Boeing tweet was sent 20 minutes after The Chicago Tribune reported the manufacturer was uneasy about Trump’s approach to foreign policy. The government has contracted with Boeing to build the planes, which would go into service around 2024, meaning Trump would only fly on them if he won a second term in 2020. Trump has his own plane, a Boeing 757, which is outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president he would be expected to fly on an Air Force jet which has special equipment for his safety and communications. More:",

      "text": "Topics: Air Force One , Boeing , Donald Trump , Trump tweets , Video , Video News , Media News , News , Politics News (Credit: Getty/Joe Raedle/AP/Jose Luis Magana) \nOne of Donald Trump’s tweets has held the morning news cycle hostage, caused the stocks of a major multi-national corporation to drop and forced the United States Air Force to issue a statement defending Air Force One. \nSeemingly out of the blue Tuesday morning, the president-elect tweeted a call to cancel Boeing’s contract for a new Air Force One plane: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nTrump, who made a campaign promise to target “waste, fraud and abuse” in government spending, said “the plane is totally out of control.” Trump told reporters outside of Trump Tower “It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” Trump on Boeing/Air Force One tweet: “The plane is totally out of control…we want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money” pic.twitter.com/OnEuw8hfUM \n— CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) December 6, 2016 \nBoeing stocks slipped in premarket trading after Trump’s tweet and continued to dip in early trading, falling 0.9 percent to $150.90. Trump used to own stock in Boeing, but reportedly sold all of his stock in June. \" @PzFeed : The glitziest jet in the sky. Donald spent $100 million on his Boeing 757. VIDEO: http://t.co/phiV9cFI2U pic.twitter.com/HLn6tNyhY9 \" \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2015 \nBoeing, which has supplied airplanes to the Air Force One fleet for nearly 50 years, was quick to release a statement pushing back on Trump’s claim that the two new planes that will make up the Air Force One fleet cost billions. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” the statement said. “We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nThe New York Times reported last October that the Air Force expected the development of two new Air Force One planes to require at least $102 million in the coming fiscal year and $3 billion over the next five years. \nAside from the troubling prospect that the president-elect is explicitly selecting individual companies to either win (Carrier) or lose (Boeing) under a Trump administration, his decision to go after Boeing Monday is rather curious. \nTrump spokesman Jason Miller explained in a call to reporters that Trump plans to closely examine the Pentagon’s budget and look for areas where he can find savings. \nBut instead of tweeting about the Washington Post’s blockbuster report revealing that the Pentagon buried a report that found $125 billion in waste, Trump appeared trigged by a Chicago Tribune article citing Boeing’s CEO’s concerns with Trump’s anti-China bluster. \n“The last thing Boeing, with $96 billion in annual revenues, wants is an international trade war that could raise tariffs or greatly disrupt long-standing, albeit imperfect, global agreements,” the Tribune’s Robert Reed wrote , citing Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s speech to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association on Friday. \n“Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Washington, to customers around the world. One in every three of those 737s were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries — including wide bodies such as the 787 Dreamliner, 777 and 747 — were bound for Chinese customers. This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985,” Muilenburg boasted. \nFollowing Trump’s controversial call with the Taiwanese leader and a series of tweets over the weekend, the Tribune’s Reed was prompted to note: \nThe brain trust at Boeing, among the city’s largest companies and a global aerospace and defense powerhouse, must cringe every time President-elect Donald Trump riffs on foreign policy, especially when it comes to dealing with China. Of course, the punchline here is that Donald Trump will have nothing to do with the future of Air Force One. The secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee James, pointed out to Politico that the new fleet is now only in the research and development phase and is not scheduled to be ready for another decade, after Trump is already out of office. “It will be the president after the next president who actually flies on this Air Force One,” she said.

      "title": "Trump blasts Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!'",
      "text": "Tue, 06 Dec 2016 20:21 UTC © Kevin Lamarque / Reuters U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control. It was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via brief Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. Trump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. Boeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. Boeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. Not a 'Vanilla' Jumbo Jet The U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. The planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. President Barack Obama, who was flying on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. His spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements are \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts. \"The planning work that we have done on behalf of future presidents is something that the next administration will have to decide whether or not to carry forward,\" Earnest said. The budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. The current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system. \"Of course it's not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. A March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft. But the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion. Boeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but were flat by mid-afternoon. Shares of several other major defense contractors were also lower. Latest Broadside Trump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride. A New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harm ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. Since winning the Nov. 8 election he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. Both Ford and United Technologies said they support Trump's efforts to cut corporate tax rates and overhaul regulations, which could save the companies billions in the long run. Behind the scenes, business lobbyists emphasize the importance of trade to the U.S. economy to Trump's advisers. Trump's attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group's CEO Dave Melcher urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion a year sector offers. Industry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice. \"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. Boeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year. The company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenberg last week called for Democrats and Republicans to work together to make sure the United States continues to play a leading role in shaping the global economy through trade agreements. Trump, who sold his shares in Boeing and other companies in June according to a spokesman, named former long-time Boeing CEO Jim McNerney to a high-profile business advisory council last week. McNerney could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday. Trump is known for his love of his own Boeing 757 jet. In a 2015 Rolling Stone profile early in his campaign, he said his plane was \"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way.\" \"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said.",

      "text": "‘It is a Bit More Complicated’: Air Force Secretary Responds to Trump’s ‘Cancel Order’ Boeing Tweet by Justin Baragona | 3:40   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump once again set the news cycle on fire with a single tweet today. In this instance, he called out Boeing for apparently overcharging the United States for the new Air Force One planes that are being planned. He ended the tweet by saying “Cancel order!” \nThe tweet actually impacted Boeing’s stock price at the beginning of trading today. Trump would later inform reporters that he thought Boeing was “doing a number” on the country and that while he wanted them to make money, he didn’t want them to make that much money. \nIn response to Trump’s claims about the Boeing deal, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James stated that “it is a bit more complicated.” \nAccording to Politico , James explained that there is a lot more that needs to be done with Air Force One than just building a commercial jet. \n“Air Force One, although it is a 747 platform, is way, way more than what you would think of as a commercial airliner,” James said in an interview. “It really is, in many ways, a flying White House, in terms of the security. There’s [electronic] countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner. So it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye.” \nJames also pointed out that the White House is actually the one that develops the requirements for Air Force One and then provides those standards to the Air Force. Therefore, the way to make the pricetag for the project lower is to “change the requirements,” getting rid of some of the communications and countermeasures currently set. \nAdditionally, James noted that the current project is still in the research and development phase, and the planes wouldn’t be ready for about a decade. \nThis is likely why Boeing was caught by surprise over Trump’s tweet and the accusation it is costing $4 billion. The company responded today that it is currently under contract for $170 million “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States.” \nAlso, the amount that has been budgeted by the government so far for the project through 2021 is less than $2.9 billion. \n[image via screengrab]",

      "text": "Donald Trump threatened on Twitter to cancel a $4 billion Boeing contract. Boeing's stock immediately dropped. 10:10 a.m. ET \nA single tweet from President-elect Donald Trump had immediate real-world implications Tuesday morning, when shortly before the markets opened, Trump criticized Boeing for how expensive its new 747 Air Force One plane is: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nHe expanded upon that tweet in New York on Tuesday morning, saying \"the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program,\" he said, per CNBC . \"I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nAt the mere threat of Trump canceling his order on the latest model of the presidential jet, Boeing's stock plummeted. At Tuesday's opening bell, Boeing stocks were down 0.86 percent and had slid more than 1 percent in early trading. Though that may not sound all that steep, with a market cap at $93 billion , even a 1 percent decline is significant for Boeing. \nMoreover, Politico reported, Trump's tweet seems to have misquoted the actual projected cost of the Boeing 747. Air Force One estimated it would cost $1.65 billion to build two new jets — about $825 million per aircraft. \nWhen asked for comment by The Associated Press , Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher indicated the company still wasn't quite sure how to respond to the president-elect's tweet. \"We are going to get back to you after we figure out what's going on,\" Blecher said.

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force 1",
      "text": "  WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\" Trump later told reporters the cost was \"ridiculous\" and that he wanted the aircraft maker to \"make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" Here's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency. ___ HOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST? The Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity. ___ WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE? While that is true, the current aircraft that the president uses for the bulk of his foreign and domestic travel are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. Two variants of a Boeing 747 are in rotation. The planes were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One took President Barack Obama on a trip to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday. Air Force One, the distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal, is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that take advantage of the most-up-to-date advances in technology. Air Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House. The president and most of those who travel with him aboard Air Force One enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite that can function as an operating room, in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests. ___ WHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE IN THE PROJECT? So far, the Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added a commercial aircraft the president would use. Boeing has that contract. It would also build the replacement Air Force One. ___ CAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT? Yes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Twitter / Facebook / RSS \nBoeing stocks tumbled Tuesday after president-elect Donald Trump tweeted about canceling a $4bn Air Force One order. But it was a typical Trumpism: the number is plucked out of nowhere , and Boeing was forced to publicize the fact it's only got the U.S. Government on the hook for $170m, and that the two planes, if ordered, would be $850m each. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,\" he said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe president-elect's most recent financial disclosure form, filed in May and detailing his 2015 holdings, showed that the Manhattan billionaire owned between $50,001 and $100,000 worth of stock in Boeing, a purchase he announced on Twitter in 2013. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said Tuesday morning that Trump sold all of his stocks last June. \nMiller added that the exact details of Trump's desire to cancel the Boeing order would be dealt with after he is inaugurated next month. \nBoeing's stocks rebounded later in the morning as it became apparent Trump was saying untrue things. \n(Maybe he doesn't want to fly on it. Same as not wanting to live in the White House.) ",
