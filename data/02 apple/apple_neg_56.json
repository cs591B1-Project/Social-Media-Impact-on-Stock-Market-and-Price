Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 1:30   \nSAN FRANCISCO - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. Related News Apple Watch Series 2 review: Not yet a 'must-have', but getting close September 16 \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. REUTERS",

      "text": "Tweet Share An advertisement of Apple Watch Series 2 is displayed at Softbank Corp.'s flagship store at Omotesando shopping district in Tokyo, Japan September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Issei Kato/Files More By Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. Responding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high.

Apple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. Strong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. Apple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches. \"While I’m not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said. IDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Reblog",

Sarah Tew/CNET \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for more specific sales figures. \nTim Cook is pretty pleased by sales of Apple Watch this holiday shopping season. \nThe Apple CEO told Reuters the gadget set a sales record during the first week of holiday shopping and is on track for its best quarter yet. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote Monday in response to an email from the news agency. Cook went on to say that the Apple Watch reached a new high on sell-through, which measures the number of units actually sold to consumers compared with the quantity distributed to retailers. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nApple unveiled the second generation of its Apple Watch in September. The device, which starts at $369, looks identical to the first model but comes with one notable improvement: It's waterproof enough for swimmers. \nApple doesn't report sales data for its Apple Watch, the first new product released under the leadership of Cook, who needs to show that the company can still create lust-worthy, must-have products in new categories. \nCook's comments come as technology research firm IDC reported that Apple shipped 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch in the three-month period ended in September, a decline of 71 percent from the same quarter a year ago. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for more specific sales figures.

      "text": "Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Apple's Cook Reuters Photo: \nBy Julia Love \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc <AAPL.O> Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \nStrong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. \nApple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches. \n\"While I’m not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said. \nIDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Related Links",

      "text": "Apple Makes it Even More Difficult to Jailbreak iOS 10.2 Posted by Andy on Dec 06, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nWe seem to be waiting forever for the iOS 10 jailbreak , but given that hackers have been able to jailbreak it, we have been quite hopeful that it will be released sooner or later. \nHowever, looks like that it will be even more difficult if you install iOS 10.2, which is currently in beta according to well-known hacker Luca Todesco . He has warned users who are interested in jailbreaking iPhones or iPads to avoid upgrading to iOS 10.2 in a series of tweets. Apple seems to have patched several vulnerabilities that could be used to jailbreak iOS 10, which will make jailbreaking iOS 10.2 even more difficult. note that 10.2 kills many bugs, staying on 10.1.1 is a wise choice \n— qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) December 3, 2016 \nSo if you want to jailbreak your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch then you may want to avoid upgrading to iOS 10.2. The only problem is that you won’t be able to enjoy the new features in iOS 10.2 , and will be exposed to the security risks that have been fixed in iOS 10.2. iOS 10 Jailbreak Status \nPangu team members had showed off a working jailbreak for iOS 10 with a screen-cast of Cydia running on the device when it was in beta at the Mobile Security Conference happening in Shangai in July, but they have remained relatively silent after Apple released iOS 10 to the public. \nTodesco had also released several teaser videos and information to show that he had successfully jailbroken iOS 10, however, it is highly unlikely that he will release a jailbreak to the public. \nSo it is difficult to say if the release of iOS 10 jailbreak is imminent. iOS 10.2 Release Date \nEarlier today Apple released the sixth beta version of iOS 10.2 to developers. So the earliest we expect Apple to release iOS 10.2 to the public is next week. To Upgrade or Not to Upgrade \nBased on the information provided by Todesco, you may want to decide if you want to have the chance to having a jailbreak or you want the new features and security fixes. One of the golden rules of jailbreaking is to stay where you’re and avoid updating your device to the latest iOS software update to improve your chances of jailbreaking your iOS device, assuming that security is not a concern. \nWe’ll let you know as soon as we’ve any further updates. Don’t forget to join our Facebook Fan page , follow us on Twitter , add us to your circles on Google+ , subscribe to our RSS feed or our Daily Newsletter . \nWhat do you plan to do? Stay on iOS 10.1.1 or upgrade to iOS 10.2 when it is released? Let us know in the comments. Like this post? Share it!",

      "text": "Apple Watch holiday sales are hot, says Tim Cook Apple CEO tells Reuters the gadget is on track for its best quarter ever. Sarah Tew/CNET Up Next Memes that need to die along with 2016 \nTim Cook is pretty pleased by sales of Apple Watch this holiday shopping season. \nThe Apple CEO told Reuters the gadget set a sales record during the first week of holiday shopping and is on track for its best quarter yet. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote Monday in response to an email from the news agency. Cook went on to say that the Apple Watch reached a new high on sell-through, which measures the number of units actually sold to consumers compared with the quantity distributed to retailers. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for more specific sales figures. \nCook's comments come as technology research firm IDC reported that Apple shipped 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch in the three-month period ended in September, a decline of 71 percent from the same quarter a year ago. \nApple unveiled the second generation of its Apple Watch in September. The device, which starts at $369, looks identical to the first model but comes with one notable improvement: It's waterproof enough for swimmers. \nApple doesn't report sales data for its Apple Watch, the first new product released under the leadership of Cook, who needs to show that the company can still create lust-worthy, must-have products in new categories.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple’s MacBook Pro With TouchBar Could Have Battery Troubles \nThe new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar might be suffering from battery problems that doesn’t allow it to stay on nearly as long as Apple has promised. \nOwners of the laptop have taken to forums across the Internet to complain that the computer is lasting between three and six hours on a single charge before its battery needs to be recharged. Those who are playing video games on the MacBook Pro or using other resource-intensive apps are saying the battery life falls towards the bottom of the range. \nThe affected users, who are posting their stories on Apple’s Support forum as well as Reddit , say the problem is affecting both the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nApple announced the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar at a press event in October. The computer comes in 13- and 15-inch variants and comes with a glass touchscreen above the keyboard, called a Touch Bar, that lets users interact with on-screen software. It’s also the first Mac to deliver Touch ID, a fingerprint sensor that unlocks the software and allows users to make secure payments via Apple Pay. \nApple AAPL has touted the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar as its latest and greatest innovation and it’s generally received positive reviews . But because it’s a notebook computer, battery life matters. \nThe battery life users are complaining about is notably anemic compared to Apple’s own estimates. Apple says both the 13- and 15-inch models can offer up to ten hours of battery life on wireless Internet surfing. The company’s listing promises up to ten hours of iTunes movie playback. \nForum reports would suggest that Apple’s computer is, in certain cases, actually performing at less than 50% compared to Apple’s promises. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nHowever, other posters have had quite a different experience. Some Reddit users, for instance, say their batteries are lasting much longer than ten hours when they’re working on non-resource-intensive tasks like working in productivity software or surfing the Internet. It appears the trouble crops up for some users when they’re watching videos or performing other sophisticated duties. \nFor its part, Apple hasn’t responded to the MacBook Pro’s owners reported troubles, and it’s unclear whether it’s widespread or limited to certain people engaging in certain activities. \nThe news comes just days after Apple announced that it would fix defective iPhone 6s batteries at no charge . The company has said, however, that few iPhone 6s owners will have battery troubles. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar’s battery woes. ",

      "text": "Home | Gadgets | Apple Watch Sales To Consumers Set Record In Holiday Week, Says Tim Cook Mr Cook's comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. Thomson Reuters | Last Updated: December 06, 2016 11:48 (IST) Thomson Reuters EMAIL COMMENTS Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook said the Watch's sell-through reached a new high. San Francisco : Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc chief executive Tim Cook told Reuters.Responding to an email from Reuters, Mr Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high.Mr Cook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 per cent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote.\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said.Mr Cook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget.Apple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Mr Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV.Strong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, Mr O'Donnell noted.Apple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off.

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   2:27 PM   \nSAN FRANCISCO (Dec 6): Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters . \nResponding to an email from Reuters , Cook said the gadget's sell-through — a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves — reached a new high. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71% from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \nStrong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. \nApple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches. \n\"While I'm not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said. \nIDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | December 6, 2016 : 2:26 PM MYT SAN FRANCISCO (Dec 6): Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters .\nResponding to an email from Reuters , Cook said the gadget's sell-through — a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves — reached a new high.\nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71% from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest.\n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote.\n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said.\nCook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget.\nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV.\nStrong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted.\nApple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches.\n\"While I'm not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said.\nIDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nhttp://www.theedgemarkets.com/my/article/apple-watch-sales-consumers-set-record-holiday-week-says-apples-cook\n Good Articles to Share >>\nMavcom to introduce framework linking aeronautical revenues to customer satisfaction - Dec 06, 2016 Competition to intensify for telcos in 2017, says U Mobile - Dec 06, 2016 China-led Asia trade talks should wrap up with speed, ADB says - Dec 06, 2016 Amazon opens line-free grocery store in challenge to supermarkets - Dec 06, 2016 Four trends that will affect global banks in 2017 - Dec 06, 2016 MIDF Research downgrades glove sector to 'neutral' - Dec 06, 2016",

      "text": "Apple Watch Q3 sales down 71% to 1.1 million units chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2016-12-06 14:02 Versions of the Apple Watch Series 2 are displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, Sept 7, 2016. [Photo/Agencies] \nApple Watch is still the best-selling smartwatch, but not the best-selling smart wearable, Sina Tech reported citing a new report from research firm International Data Corporation . \nApple Watch barely entered the top five smart wearables, as less expensive fitness bands dominate the market, and this trend has started since the beginning of this year. \nApple shipped 1.1 million Apple Watches in the third quarter, down 71 percent from a year earlier, IDC estimated, and it was also the only vendor to see a decline in sales, compared to Fitbit, China's Xiaomi, Garmin and Samsung. \n\"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device,\" IDC research analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in a statement. \nIn terms of wearable device overall, Apple took up a market share of 4.9 percent, while the market leader Fitbit occupied 23 percent. \nChinese electronics company Xiaomi, which took up a market share of 16.5 percent, shipped 3.8 million wearable fitness bands in the third quarter, up 4 percent from a year earlier. \nBut when it comes to the smartwatch alone, Apple Watch was still the No 1, with a market share of 40 percent, followed by Garmin and Samsung. \nIn September, Apple launched a new version of Apple watch, Apple Watch Series 2, and improved on the original watch with a faster processor, waterproofing, GPS and a brighter display.

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nEnlarge Image The proud auteur.\nPhoto by Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Becoming a star means everything to your children.\nHow else are they going to make any money when robots do almost everything else?\nMoreover, being a star allows you to say anything you want to anyone you want. Just ask Kanye.\nApple believes it has now developed the perfect way for you to begin your child's ascent to movie stardom. It's called the iPhone 7 Plus.\nI know this because Cupertino has just released an ad that suggests this phone's video camera is just as good as anything they use in Hollywood.\nWe think, indeed, we're watching a movie. For some reason, the director has cast children to play Romeo and Juliet. Yes, little children, rather than the usual teeny starlets. This is art? This is the man who directed \" Bugsy Malone \"?\nIt turns out that the director is a mere parent. One of those frightfully annoying parents that hold their phones up all through the school play. For that's all this is.\nBut then the message from Apple: \"Your movies look like movies.\"\nMore Technically Incorrect Microsoft begs for unity in a divided world Police 'mug' suspect to get into iPhone while he's using it Donald Trump uses Twitter to attack China It depends which movies you're talking about, perhaps. \" Blair Witch Project \"? Certainly. \" The Grand Budapest Hotel \"? Perhaps not.\nApple's rather into overclaiming of late. Why, it's just tried to convince you that the new MacBook Pro is at the very pinnacle of world ingenuity . Some might find this a SuperTrumpian exaggeration.\nMy colleague Stephen Shankland tested the iPhone 7 Plus against the Google Pixel XL and declared it inferior in terms of stills photography, but superior when it came to video .\nBut does it make Scorsese want to grab one and make an opus with it? I think you'd have to offer him a lot of money. And complete creative control, of course.\n ",

      "text": "Tim Cook has delivered an update on Apple Watch sales through the unusual medium of email to Reuters reporter . “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook said. \"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\"\nThe timing of Cook’s essentially public comments is notable, coming the day after research firm IDC published a report estimating that Apple Watch sales last quarter were down 71 percent year on year. The figures weren’t surprising considering that Apple released the new Series 2 line right at the end of the July-September period, with supply constraints lasting well into the current quarter — basically, this summer was a bad time to buy an Apple Watch.\nHowever, Cook still isn’t providing specific sales data for the Apple Watch; it’s considered part of Apple’s “other products” category along with more minor lines like iPods and the Apple TV. Without that information, it’s difficult to ascertain the overall success of the product.",

This time, Microsoft’s ad is supposed to show how students at the University of Washington are using the Surface Book to build a Formula 1 style race car from scratch using only the laptop created by the Redmond software giant. Only that at one point, one of the students suddenly starts talking about Apple’s Macs, explaining that what they are doing right now on the Surface Book wouldn’t be possible on devices powered by macOS. “We really can’t use Macs from an issue of compatibility. They’re really not the right device for the job that we’re doing,” the student states. Is this relevant in any way to the Microsoft Surface Book ad? No. Can this convince more potential buyers to purchase the Surface Book and not a MacBook? We highly doubt it. The Apple ...",

      "title": "Apple Watch Sales To Consumers Set Record In Holiday Week, Says Apple's Cook",
      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters SAN FRANCISCO : Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. Responding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. Cook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. Cook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. Apple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. Strong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. Apple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches. \"While I’m not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said. IDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. -Reuters",

There have been quite a few attempts to extrapolate what this means in numbers , but the truth is that any of those attempts could be a few million units wrong either way.\nBut reports say the smartwatch market is shrinking fast\nCook's comments come after reports that the smartwatch market is shrinking fast. On Monday, analytics company IDC released a report which claims that Apple Watch's market share has plummeted, from 17.5 percent in the third quarter of 2015 to 4.9 percent in the third quarter of this year.\nHowever, that report does not account for Watch sales in the holiday season, nor the sales of the updated, Series 2 Watch version, so it's quite possible that Watch has experienced a big sales bump in Q4.\nApple is not known for shyness when it comes to boasting about sales data for its most successful product categories; perhaps now that the Watch is breaking records, Apple will finally tell us how many Watches it has sold.\nBONUS: This futuristic snowmobile will have you feeling the winter vibes",

      "text": "Apple Watch Set Sales Record in Holiday Week, Says CEO Tim Cook Reddit \nSales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. The CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget.\nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Latest Video Highlights What Apple’s MacBook Can’t Do GO Redmond publishes new video to promote the Surface Dec 6, 2016 07:35 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has once again compared its own successful Surface Book with Apple’s products in a brand-new ad, as the company has made it a hobby to highlight the things that the MacBook can’t do in its videos. This time, Microsoft’s ad is supposed to show how students at the University of Washington are using the Surface Book to build a Formula 1 style race car from scratch using only the laptop created by the Redmond software giant. Only that at one point, one of the students suddenly starts talking about Apple’s Macs, explaining that what they are doing right now on the Surface Book wouldn’t be possible on devices powered by macOS. “We really can’t use Macs from an issue of compatibility. They’re really not the right device for the job that we’re doing,” the student states. Is this relevant in any way to the Microsoft Surface Book ad? No. Can this convince more potential buyers to purchase the Surface Book and not a MacBook? We highly doubt it. The Apple obsession As we’ve said before, even though Microsoft has become more of a gentleman-ish company and it no longer launches campaigns aimed at its rivals (just think of Scroogled), the firm should still focus more on what it products can do and not necessarily on what its competitors can’t. The latest Surface ads have been mostly about comparing Microsoft and Apple devices and as you can see, every little video contains a reference to the MacBook, which in some cases, such as today, makes absolutely no sense. The Surface Book indeed comes with features that aren’t available on the MacBook, such as the touchscreen and the detachable keyboard, but Microsoft wants to make this very clear with every single ad. On the other hand, Apple has already said that it’s not interested in building a MacBook with a touchscreen or a detachable keyboard, as it wants to stick with a more traditional approach.",

      "title": "Legal showdown of 2016: FBI v. Apple",
      "text": "In the past year, one Apple ( AAPL ) news story proved more memorable than the latest version of the iPhone . In February, the tech giant took a public stand against the FBI’s request that it unlock a gunman’s iPhone, and a weeks-long standoff ensued. While the FBI eventually figured out how to access the phone without Apple’s help , it’s worth revisiting its fight against Apple. Other privacy disputes between the FBI and tech giants that guard your personal data and devices may very well play out in 2017 and beyond. \nMoreover, on Jan. 20, the US will inaugurate a new president who called for a boycott of Apple products after it refused to help the FBI unlock the phone. Donald Trump, and his attorney general pick, Jeff Sessions, may end up valuing national security concerns over privacy, Cornell Law School professor Michael Dorf  told Yahoo Finance. \n”Even if all I cared about was security, it’s not obvious to me here that privacy is the enemy of security,” said Dorf, who teaches Constitutional law, among other subjects. “But I fear that the Trump/Sessions administration will simply view this through a conventional ‘law and order’ lens and regard assertions of privacy as simply impeding security.” \nOf course, Apple also accused the FBI under the Obama administration of threatening the security of its customers ’ data. \nThe dispute became public in February with a judge’s order mandating that Apple help the FBI unlock a phone used by a perpetrator of a mass shooting last year. Apple refused. \n‘An unprecedented step’ View photos \nIn December 2015, 14 people were killed in a shooting at a state-run facility in San Bernardino, Calif., which injured 22 others. Treating the massacre as a terrorist attack, the FBI asked Apple for help unlocking an iPhone used by one of the two perpetrators. \nWhen Apple balked at the FBI’s request, the US government filed a 40-page court document seeking to force the tech giant to unlock the phone used by Syed Farook, one of the two attackers along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik. Both died the day of their attack. \nHowever, before they died, Malik expressed her allegiance to the Islamic State. US investigators believed Farook’s iPhone might hold clues about the attack on the Inland Regional Center, a facility for people with developmental disabilities. But the FBI couldn’t unlock Farook’s phone without his passcode. What’s more, agents couldn’t even try to guess the password. That’s because Apple gives users the option to have all their iPhone data erased after 10 failed passcode attempts . \n“Apple has the exclusive technical means which would assist the government in completing its search,” the US government argued in its request to the court. \nAfter a federal magistrate judge in California granted that request , Apple pushed back more. “ The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an open letter to its customers on Feb. 16. “We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.” \nThe US government, Cook argued, wanted Apple to open up a “backdoor to the iPhone” by creating a new version of its operating system that circumvented security features. Apple could not take the risk that this “backdoor” might be used again to violate consumers’ privacy. \n“[W]hile the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case,” Armstrong wrote, “there is no way to guarantee such control.” \nThe public weighs in on FBI v. Apple View photos \nSource: Bloomberg UK More Apple’s stand against the FBI’s demands drummed up tech-industry support but stoked some criticism, as well. University of Chicago professor law profe ssor Omri Ben-Shahar, for one, suggested in the Huffington Post that Apple’s privacy crusade was a marketing ploy and stood at odds with the company’s practice of harvesting data for targeted advertising. \n“This is awfully rich,” he wrote. “The industry that makes a highly profitable living off of people’s data, now parading as the crusader of privacy.” \nRegardless of their motives, companies in that industry came out publicly to support Apple — including Facebook ( FB ), Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Amazon ( AMZN) . Those companies were among the dozens of companies and organizations that filed “friend of the court” briefs opposing the government’s efforts to enlist Apple to unlock the phone. \n“The government’s position, if it prevails, will undermine the security of Americans’ most sensitive data,” stated one brief signed by the above-mentioned tech companies and several others including Yahoo Finance parent company, Yahoo ( YHOO ). Later, that brief added, “The government’s bid to have technology companies undermine their own security measures is all the more puzzling because the Executive has been encouraging companies to increase cybersecurity in consumer products.” \nOther friends of Apple’s cause included 32 law professors, the ACLU , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , Airbnb, and a number of other groups and companies concerned with cybersecurity. \nWhile one might assume consumers would also support increased cybersecurity, that wasn’t necessarily the case amid the FBI v. Apple showdown. In February, 51% of adults surveyed by the Pew Research Center believed Apple should unlock the iPhone to help the FBI. Just 38% of the 1,002 people surveyed thought the tech giant shouldn’t back down (the rest didn’t have an opinion). \nIt’s possible that many of the consumers in favor of the FBI thought it worthwhile to trade a little privacy to aid the government in investigating a terrorist attack. Still, as Michael Dorf , the Cornell law prof essor, told Yahoo Finance recently, sometimes “privacy is a form of security.” \n“Making devices more vulnerable to law enforcement scrutiny could easily have the unintended consequence of making those same devices easier for foreign governments and criminals to hack,” added Dorf, who posts frequently on his blog Dorf on Law . \nIndeed, hackers could theoretically access Apple’s theoretical “backdoor” software off of its own servers, The New York Times editorial board argued in an piece called “ Why Apple was right to challenge an order to help the FBI .” In the end, Apple never had to create that software. \nThe government drops its case View photos \nApple CEO Tim Cook Credit: Andrew Burton/Getty More In late March, the Justice Department revealed that a third party helped it unlock the iPhone — putting an anticlimactic end to a prolonged and public debate. Of course, the dispute over whether tech companies have to help investigators crack into their systems is far from over, especially since the California court never had an opportunity to weigh in on the Apple case. (Though a different judge, in New York, sided with Apple in a similar case in February.) \nThe case brought by the US government relied on a 227-year-old law called the All Writs Act , which says that courts can hand down “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” \nThis essentially means that courts can order parties — like Apple — to comply with court orders. In a digital age, where orders like the one Apple received can have broad ramifications, the use of the All Writs Act can pose new problems and let the government wield seemingly infinite power. “If it can tell Apple, which has been accused of no wrongdoing, to sit down and write a custom operating system for it, what else could it do?” Amy Davidson noted in The New Yorker . \nIf the case had proceeded, Dorf told me, there’s a possibility Apple would have won given a Supreme Court ruling from 2014 finding cellphones can’t be searched without a warrant. “The Supreme Court rightly realized we’re in a new era,” he said. \nEven if Trump is able to appoint multiple Supreme Court justices, there could still be more precedent aimed at protecting digital privacy. “For the most part, at least among legal elites, these issues do not have a clear left-right balance. Some of the conservatives are quite concerned about privacy,” Dorf said. Regardless of which way the Supreme Court goes, the issue of digital privacy will certainly reach the justices again. Even if Trump doesn’t like it, a justice (or justices) he appoints may end up curbing the kind of assistance the government can demand of tech companies like Apple. \nErin Fuchs is deputy managing editor of Yahoo Finance.",

      "text": "Flyby Media's tech has applications for everything from indoor mapping to driverless cars. \nBusiness Insider actually published a slideshow looking at what its technology can do. \nIts tech is all about tracking the 3D motion of an object. Emotient: artificially intellient facial recognition \nWhat it does: Uses artificial intelligence to scan a person's face and read their emotions \nPrice: Undisclosed \nFounded: 2012 \nHQ: San Diego \nEmotient can recognise a person's emotions at any given moment, in real-time, just by analysing their facial patterns. Marian Bartlett, a founder of Emotient and the company's lead scientist, explains how it works: \n\"It takes an image as input, and it scans that image for faces,\" she says. \"And as soon as it finds those faces, it then does pattern recognition techniques in order to measure and detect the facial expressions in those faces.\" \nOne of Emotient's first wearable applications was a Google Glass add-on that the company hoped salespeople could use to judge whether a person really loves a product or not, according to TechCrunch . \nOne of the keys to Emotient's technology is being able to scan a person's face for emotions, but not store any personally identifiable information about them in the process. The use of face-scanning technology has been a privacy concern for many startups, although it's unclear what Apple intends to do with the company now that it can scan anonymously. LearnSprout: education-tech startup Vimeo / Mitchell Resnick \nWhat it does: Builds software for teachers and school administrators to analyze data on students' performance \nPrice: Undisclosed \nFounded: 2012 \nHQ: San Francisco \nWhen Bloomberg first reported the acquisition, it said more than 2,500 school districts in 42 US states use LearnSprout’s software, according to its website. \nThe ed-tech company had raised $4.7 million in venture capital funding before it was acquired from firms such as Andreesen Horowitz, Formation 8, and Samsung Ventures, according to Crunchbase . \nIn recent years, Apple's traditional stronghold in the U.S. educational market has been eroded by low-cost laptops running Google's Chrome operating system. \nIn December, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Google's Chromebook laptops are mere \"test machines.\" According to data from Futuresource Consulting, a research firm that studies the educational market, over half of all devices sold to schools are now Chromebooks. LegbaCore: A two-person security firm LegbaCore founder Xeno Kovah now describes himself as the \"Low Level Security Dude\" at Apple on his LinkedIn page. LinkedIn \nWhat it does: B est known for developing a proof-of-concept virus-worm hybrid called Thunderstrike 2 that targeted Mac computers. \nPrice: Undisclosed \nAcquired: November 2015, but the acquisition was only properly discovered in February 2016 \nFounded: 2015 \nHQ: Washington D.C. \nThe worm that LegbaCore founder Xeno Kovah developed was able to spread from MacBook to MacBook, even if the computers were not connected to the internet. \nKovah revealed on Twitter in November that he and his partner, Corey Kellenberg, had been hired by Apple to do \"low level security.\" The move went unnoticed until another security researcher revealed it during a presentation at a security conference in December . \nKovah's worm virus was the first to attack Macs at the firmware level, according to Wired, which means it targeted the software that boots up before the computer's primary operating system, OS X. It's a valuable kind of attack because it usually can't be detected by antivirus and other security software. \nInstead of exploiting their findings or selling it to the highest bidder, Kovah and team notified Apple of the vulnerabilities, which have since been fully patched. Although Apple does not pay \"bug bounties\" to researchers for finding security problems, the high road seems to have worked out for the founders of LegbaCore. Carpool Karaoke: TV series spinoff with James Corden Britney Spears and James Corden in an episode of \"Carpool Karaoke.\" YouTube/The Late Late Show With James Corden \nWhat it does: A viral segment on CBS's The Late Late Show featuring James Corden driving around with celebrities and singing \nPrice: Undisclosed \nAcquired: July 2016 \nThe \"Carpool Karaoke\" spinoff will be available on Apple Music worldwide and fans were not pleased when the news broke out. \nThe music giant has licensed 16 episodes at a half-hour each, current episodes are more like 10 or 15 minutes. Corden is not expected to be behind the wheel however, a different host will be cast at a later stage. \nThe episodes will stream weekly on Apple Music, which many of the show's followers may not be subscribed to. Turi: machine learning platform for developers and data scientists Turi.com \nWhat it does: Provides tools and frameworks for other developers to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence into their apps. \nPrice: $200 million (£158 million) \nFounded: 2013 \nHQ: Seattle \nTuri was founded by a University of Washington professor and t he company's website is still live , unlike all the other startups on this list. \nThis open source project was initially intended for applying large-scale machine learning to graph analysis, according to Crunchbase . \nAn example of its use is that it allows developers to build more advanced fraud detection into their applications. Gliimpse: personal health data tracking Apple \nWhat it does: Gliimpse's product collates medical information into an easy-to-read profile for the patient \nPrice: Undisclosed \nFounded: 2015 \nHQ: Silicon Valley \nGliimpse fits into Apple's larger ambitions to explore health technology. While the Apple Watch didn't bring about the new computing platform some were hoping for, Apple has learned people enjoy using it to track their health and fitness. \nHere's how the company's website describes it before it was taken down: \n\"We've built a magical machine. It takes incomprehensible electronic medical records and turns them into understandable, standardized, coded elements (LOINC, RxNorm, CPT, ICD and SNOMED), and terminology that both humans and machines can easily understand and use. The Rosetta Stone meets machine learning.\" Tuplejump: machine learning Rohit Rai, co-founder of Tuplejump, now works at Apple. LinkedIn \nWhat it does: A machine learning technology company \nPrice: Undisclosed \nFounded: 2013 \nHQ: Hyderabad, India \nTuplejump is a machine learning technology company which aims to simplify data management technologies and make them extremely simple to use, according to a Wayback Machine capture of its about page. It has operations in both India and the United States. \nThe reason Apple had its eyes on Tuplejump was for its \"FiloDB\" project, according to a TechCrunch report which explains: \" FiloDB was an open source project that Tuplejump was building to efficiently apply machine learning concepts and analytics to massive amounts of complex data right as it streamed in.\" \nThe lead engineer on FiloDB Evan Chan has been working at Apple since May 2016, as have two of the company's co-founders Rohit Rai and Satyaprakash Buddhavarapu , according to their LinkedIn profiles. Co-founder Deepak Alur , who was also Chairman at Tuplejump, now works at Anaplan as its head of engineering. Indoor.io: indoor mapping platform Co-founder of Indoor.io, Antti Saarinen. LinkedIn \nWhat it does: Maps indoor spaces \nPrice: Undisclosed \nAcquired: Unknown — 2015 according to its founder's LinkedIn profile, but only reported in December 2016 \nFounded: 2007 \nHQ: Finland \nApple reportedly made the hidden acquisition to improve its mapping service and ensure that it stays up to speed with Google. \nApple purchased another startup focusing on indoor navigation called WiFi Slam. \nThe Bloomberg report of the acquisition states that Apple wants to use drones to capture and update map data, according to a Bloomberg source cited in the same report. Drones would potentially allow Apple to capture information quicker than its existing fleet of camera-equipped mini vans.",

By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published: December 6, 2016 12:03 PM Responding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget’s sell-through – a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers’ shelves – reached a new high. (Source: Reuters) \nSales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget’s sell-through – a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers’ shelves – reached a new high. \n“Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Cook wrote. \n“Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” he said. \nWatch what else is making news: \nCook’s comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget’s performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple’s strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an “other products” category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV.  ",

      "text": "  \n(Reuters/Lucas Jackson) A recently publicized Apple letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ignites rumors that the company plans to venture into the automobile industry. \nA recent letter from Cupertino-based technology firm Apple to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration once again sparked speculations that the company is planning to venture into the self-driving cars industry. \nThe 5-page letter was signed by Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner. The main objective of the letter was \"to provide the following comments on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy.\" \nApple's letter revealed that the company is still highly excited about the development of automated systems \"including transportation\" in many areas. It contradicts earlier reports that Apple is changing its plans about creating self-driving cars. According to a New York Times report last September, sources from inside Apple revealed that the company laid off a number of employees and \"shuttered parts\" of their automated cars' plan. \nOn the first page of the letter, Apple says, \"In order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHTSA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking.\" Advertisement \nBeing one of the top electronics company in the world, Apple commented on the regulators' policy on data sharing and reiterated that it \"should not come at the cost of privacy.\" \nApple explained: \"Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses. Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time- series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects.\" \nThe company added that it supports the current privacy principles of the NHTSA. However, Apple reiterates that industry players should \"address privacy challenges\" that come with the data collection on automated vehicles. \nIn another part of the letter, Apple – a company rumored to be venturing into the self-driving cars industry soon – interestingly suggested that NHTSA must treat established companies and \"new entrants\" of the industry equally. \nApple said, \"Instead of applying for exemptions, all companies should be given an opportunity to implement internal safety processes summarized in a Safety Assessment.\" \nEnding the letter, Kenner wrote that Apple \"looks forward\" to working with NHTSA for the wider realization of self-driving cars' benefits to people.

      "text": "  \n(Apple) Apple's iPhone 8 is rumored to sport a major overhaul in design and features. \nAnother week, another leak. Apple's iPhone 8, scheduled to be released next year in time for the lineup's 10th anniversary, has been plagued by rumors as of late. According to reports, the upcoming device will apparently support wireless charging and an all-glass chassis. \nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posits that the upcoming iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging, which will be supported by the smartphone's glass casing, reports reveal. The upcoming handheld will also come with OLED panels instead of LCD screens, which have been the norm for quite some time now. \nHowever, there is also a rumor going around that Apple is having trouble with finding a supplier for its OLED screens. Samsung remains one of Apple's largest competitors, and, according to Forbes , one of its biggest suppliers. This is because the South Korean tech giant has the ability to produce OLED screens in large quantities. Apple is apparently in the market for a new supplier, but it doesn't seem to be going very well. \nThe Cupertino-based tech company has been looking to LG Display, Japan Display, and Sharp for its screens. However, LG Display cannot match Samsung's output rate and Sharp is apparently focusing on other areas of technology. Japan Display, on the other hand, may be in a troubling situation of its own as the publication notes that the company is looking for a financial bailout. Advertisement \nThere is also some talk of Apple producing a foldable iPhone. This rumor was sparked by a patent that the company had filed — and won — which involves foldable screen technology. Before Apple made a splash with its first iPhone, flip phones were all the rage. \nNo release date has been set for the iPhone 8, although it is expected that it will land sometime in late 2017, with an announcement in September. \nSince nothing has been officially confirmed yet, readers should take this news with a grain of salt.

      "title": "What Tim Cook really said about Apple Watch",
      "text": "By Jeremy C. Owens, MarketWatch\nApple CEO emails statement on smartwatch sales, but not actually sales\nApple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook -- presumably reacting to a negative report about Apple Watch sales -- fired up his email Monday to say the company is stocking shelves better than ever.\nBut that was the only significant data point provided to Reuters in his statement, dedicated to driving home the message that \"Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week.\" (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-watch-idUSKBN13V0BT) The record was not for unit sales or revenue, though, it was for \"sell-through.\"\n\"During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history,\" the CEO said.\nSell-through measures sales against how much product was shipped, a favorite of operating execs like former COO Cook. Record sell-through means Apple (AAPL) sold the highest percentage of smartwatches that were sent to stores.\nIn the rest of his statement, Cook failed to give any other confirmable figures on the product's sales performance: \"Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts\" and \"sales growth is off the charts,\" he wrote.\nCook does sign off by predicting another Apple Watch record, of some sort.\n\"As we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" Cook said.\nCatch the vagueness of that \"forecast\"? \"Best quarter ever\" could be accomplished through many different metrics -- unit sales, revenue, profitability, or maybe even sell-through.\nThis type of crowing about sales while providing little to no actual sales data is typical of the tech industry. For instance, see Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) announcement of \"a record-breaking Cyber Monday with Amazon device sales,\" a release (http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2226312) that -- like Amazon's earnings reports -- does not disclose actual sales of Amazon devices.\nApple's inventory-management skills deserve praise, especially in this holiday season of production issues from GoPro Inc (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gopros-bad-karma-drone-recall-adds-to-camera-makers-holiday-woes-2016-11-08).(GPRO) and Fitbit Inc (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/flex2-manufacturing-issues-will-hurt-fitbits-holiday-season-2016-11-02).(FIT) But Cook's verbal gymnastics continue a pattern of concealing data about the only major product category to debut under his leadership (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-hurts-itself-by-hiding-apple-watch-sales-2015-07-21).\nBecause Apple withholds its sales figures, investors must rely on third-party analysis firms like IDC, which happened to release data on the same day as Cook's email. The IDC research showed Apple Watch shipments declining 71% year-over-year (http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS41996116).\nApple began selling the Watch in spring of 2015, with hopes for revenue to complement the mighty iPhone. By IDC's figures, Apple shipped 3.9 million smartwatches in the third quarter of 2015, leading into its holiday-shopping debut. Shipments were 1.1 million in the third quarter of this year, with the Series 2 watch starting to sell toward the end of that period.\nThat drastic decline in shipments would have led to a lot fewer Watches in Apple Stores. But it could help deliver a much better sell-through rate.\nApple's stock fell 0.7% to $109.11 Monday, after the IDC report was released but before Cook's statement was revealed Monday evening.\nThe company's shares are up 3.7% on the year, less than the 10.3% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which includes Apple as a component, and 7.9% advance for the S&P 500.\n-Jeremy C.

      "title": "What Tim Cook really said about Apple Watch",
      "text": "By Jeremy C. Owens, MarketWatch\nApple CEO emails statement on smartwatch sales, but not actually sales\nApple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook -- soon after a negative report about Apple Watch sales -- fired up his email Monday to say the company is stocking shelves better than ever.\nBut that was the only significant data point provided to Reuters in his statement, dedicated to driving home the message that \"Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week.\" (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-watch-idUSKBN13V0BT) The record was not for unit sales or revenue, though, it was for \"sell-through.\"\n\"During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history,\" the CEO said.\nSell-through measures sales against how much product was shipped, a favorite of operating execs like former COO Cook. Record sell-through means Apple (AAPL) sold the highest percentage of smartwatches that were sent to stores.\nIn the rest of his statement, Cook failed to give any other confirmable figures on the product's sales performance: \"Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts\" and \"sales growth is off the charts,\" he wrote.\nCook does sign off by predicting another Apple Watch record, of some sort.\n\"As we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" Cook said.\nCatch the vagueness of that \"forecast\"? \"Best quarter ever\" could be accomplished through many different metrics -- unit sales, revenue, profitability, or maybe even sell-through.\nThis type of crowing about sales while providing little to no actual sales data is typical of the tech industry. For instance, see Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) announcement of \"a record-breaking Cyber Monday with Amazon device sales,\" a release (http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2226312) that -- like Amazon's earnings reports -- does not disclose actual sales of Amazon devices.\nApple's inventory-management skills deserve praise, especially in this holiday season of production issues from GoPro Inc (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gopros-bad-karma-drone-recall-adds-to-camera-makers-holiday-woes-2016-11-08).(GPRO) and Fitbit Inc (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/flex2-manufacturing-issues-will-hurt-fitbits-holiday-season-2016-11-02).(FIT) But Cook's verbal gymnastics continue a pattern of concealing data about the only major product category to debut under his leadership (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-hurts-itself-by-hiding-apple-watch-sales-2015-07-21).\nBecause Apple withholds its sales figures, investors must rely on third-party analysis firms like IDC, which happened to release data on the same day as Cook's email. The IDC research showed Apple Watch shipments declining 71% year-over-year (http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS41996116).\nApple began selling the Watch in spring of 2015, with hopes for revenue to complement the mighty iPhone. By IDC's figures, Apple shipped 3.9 million smartwatches in the third quarter of 2015, leading into its holiday-shopping debut. Shipments were 1.1 million in the third quarter of this year, with the Series 2 watch starting to sell toward the end of that period.\nThat drastic decline in shipments would have led to a lot fewer Watches in Apple Stores. But it could help deliver a much better sell-through rate.\nApple's stock fell 0.7% to $109.11 Monday, after the IDC report was released but before Cook's statement was revealed Monday evening.\nThe company's shares are up 3.7% on the year, less than the 10.3% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which includes Apple as a component, and 7.9% advance for the S&P 500.\n-Jeremy C.

      "text": "Tim Cook: Apple Watch Sets New Sales Record in First Week of Holiday Shopping Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Dec 06, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has revealed that the Apple Watch sold in record numbers during the first week of the holiday shopping season. The smartwatch sales are also on track to be its best ever. \nCook made this statement after research firm IDC released a report stating that Apple sold only 1.1 million units of its smartwatch in Q3 2017, down by a staggering 71 percent on a yearly basis. The report further went on to add that fitness trackers have been dominating the wearables market. \n“Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” he said. \nWhile the CEO did not reveal any sales numbers, he did add in his statement that the Apple Watch “is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.” \nIDC report of a 71 percent decline in Apple Watch sales in Q3 2016 is understandable since the Apple Watch was more than a year old by then. And with the Apple Watch 2 being on the verge of announcement many prospective buyers likely decided to defer their buying decision. \nThe second generation Apple Watch looks the same as its predecessor, but comes with a brighter display, faster processor, and a dedicated GPS chip. It is also ‘swimming-proof’, unlike the original Apple Watch which is only waterproof in up to 1-2m depth of water.",

      "text": "While the overall wearables market grew 3.1 percent year-over-year in the third quarter of 2016, Apple Watch share took a downturn owing to an ageing lineup and an unintuitive user interface, market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) has said. Apple’s decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in the third quarter and the company stood fourth with 4.9 percent share. According to IDC’s ‘Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker’ report, total wearables shipments reached 23 million in the third quarter. “Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme.

      "title": "iPhone 8: Apple’s Next Smartphone Has The Internet Going Crazy",
      "text": "\nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may have not caused the celebration Apple was hoping for, but it seems that Apple is saving all its coolness for the iPhone 8, which will come out on the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. CNET believes that the next iPhone could have wireless charging.\n“Samsung does it, and Apple is starting to, too. The wireless AirPods headphones may have been just the beginning. Next year’s iPhone could do away with the last physical wire: the Lightning cable needed for charging.”\nThe article adds that many different reports claim Apple is finally going to take the wireless plunge. But that’s not the only new feature the iPhone 8 could have.\n“It’s also being said that the iPhone will become curved. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities has predicted that Apple will introduce a new curved AMOLED display in 2017. That’d be a big change from the LCD screens in today’s iPhones — AMOLED is thinner, lighter, more flexible, and more power efficient.”\nFor the past three years, Apple hasn’t increased the screen resolution on the 4.7-inch or 5.5-inch versions, which lag behind other screens. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG 5, and other Android phones have 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution screens. It is rumored that the new iPhone 8 will upgrade to the same resolution as these Android phones.\nUproxx says that besides the curved screen, the new iPhone 8 series could have face recognition.\n“A leak from a Chinese manufacturer shows that Apple is considering bolstering its current biometric pass system, Touch ID, with iris-scanning and face-recognition technology. Yes, soon, selfies might be the key to getting your phone to open, because that won’t be obnoxious!” claims columnist Dan Seitz.\nThere is a lot of excitement for the iPhone 8 on Twitter.\nIf any of these iPhone 8 rumors/leaks are true, i'm excited\n— Austin Drieling (@Austin_Drieling) December 3, 2016 \n\nExcited for the iPhone 8. 10th year anniversary special. Its gonna be a long 10 month wait 🙁 New design after 3 years.\n— Charmaine Redoble (@misschaar) December 2, 2016 \n\nBGR reports that the iPhone 8 can’t come soon enough since sales for the iPhone 7 are starting to collapse.\niPhone 7 sales haven’t been as good as expected for Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Still, despite the fact that sales have been consistently falling throughout 2016, the iPhone 7 was Apple’s chance to stabilize. Based on recent reports, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the iPhone 7 wasn’t enough to revitalize the market.”\nThe article adds that sources from Taiwan’s headset supply say that Apple is reducing orders for the iPhone 7 in the wake of decreasing demand for the new flagship. Those sources also claim that the initial rise in demand was thanks in large part to excitement over the Jet Black model and the battery explosions that forced Samsung to recall the Galaxy Note 7. Many BGR commenters after the article seem to think Apple has lost its touch.\n“Marketing can’t fulfill the lack of innovation. Apple has to understand that,” says The Focus.\n“The iFluffers keep iPologizing and deflecting to prop up those declining sales of the boring iPhone,” jokes Chug.\nApple still has its loyal fans, but has run into trouble with many of their products this year. The Cupertino company had a chance to revive itself with the release of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, but there has been a very mixed reception. Digital Trends , who always rated Pros with four stars or more, only gave the 13-inch Touch Bar version three stars.\n“We’re disappointed with Apple’s vision of cutting-edge computing. With the new MacBook Pro, Apple has ignored the best features offered by its competitors, while also introducing a Touch Bar of questionable use. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is a great Mac – but it’s no longer a great laptop.”\nBesides stating that this is the first MacBook Pro that they can’t recommend, Digital Trends also criticized the lack of USB-A ports, the Touch Bar (which they think is somewhat of a gimmick), the unsatisfactory keyboard, and the fact that the battery life takes a step back.\nIn 2017, Apple will also release the updated iPad Pro, a device that hasn’t sold very well in 2016. Perhaps the iPhone 8 can put Apple back on top.\n[Image by Sascha Steinbach/Getty Images]\niPhone 8: Apple’s Next Smartphone Has The Internet Going Crazy is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Apple Watch sales to consumers hit record levels in the first week of holiday shopping, Apple ( AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook told Reuters.\nCook said the smartwatch's sell-through rate, which measures how many units are actually sold to consumers vs. on sent to retailers, rose to a record level.\nResponding to a Reuters email, Cook said the gadget's sell-through — a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves — reached a new high.\n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history,\" Cook told Reuters .\nCook's response followed an IDC report that Apple Watch shipments fell 71% in Q3 vs. a year earlier, even as wearables overall rose 3.1%. Fitness tracker Fitbit ( FIT ) expanded its lead as No. 1 in wearables, while No. 5 Samsung showed the strongest growth. China's Xiaomi and Garmin ( GRMN ) are No. 2 and No. 3 in wearables.\nApple sales likely plunged in part as consumers awaited the Apple Watch 2. Cook's claimed holiday sales spike supports that argument. That doesn't necessarily ease concerns about the long-term future for the Apple Watch or smartwatches generally.\nShares of Apple were down 0.7% to 109.10 on the stock market today .\nFitbit, which recently reported weak quarterly results and a grim holiday forecast, lost 1.4% to 8.03.\nGarmin stock rose 1.2% ti 52.13. Shares have a potential buy point at 56.29, after the stock touched a 19-month high of 56.19 on Aug. 1.",

      "text": "Loading the player... Apple 's ( AAPL ) iPhone 7 momentum has begun to slow, says Pacific Crest Securities, which lowered its price target on Apple but maintained buy ratings on Apple chip suppliers Analog Devices ( ADI ), Broadcom ( AVGO ) and InvenSense ( INVN ).\nApple has reduced its iPhone 7 handset orders as the initial sales momentum has begun to fade, Taiwan tech news site DigiTimes reported last week.\n\"Despite limited near-term catalysts, we continue to recommend owning Analog Devices, Broadcom and InvenSense,\" said Pacific Crest analysts in a research report late Sunday. \"While we believe Apple has slightly reduced its forecast to suppliers, the change is not drastic and is mostly a return to forecasts in place prior to an increase in October.\"\nPacific Crest, though, lowered its price target on Apple stock to 127 from 129.\nIBD's TAKE: Apple stock has been below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, since Nov. 1. More attractive stocks for investors to consider can be found on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.\n\"We continue to believe Apple is too cheap, but expect the stock to be range-bound in the near term,\" said the Pacific Crest report. \"We see greater potential for upside through 2017 as details about the next iPhone cycle may help address gross margin risks, or new products could emerge.\"\nApple stock fell 0.7% in the stock market today to 109.10, still below its 50-day line and far far from a possible buy point of 118.79, out of a flat base .\nAnalog Devices shares rose 0.7%, Broadcom 1.1% and InvenSense 2.9%.\nThe iPhone 7 series phones launched on Sept. 16 and benefited from rival Samsung's recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Wireless firms AT&T ( T ), Verizon Communications ( VZ ), T-Mobile US ( TMUS ) and Sprint ( S ) used \"Black Friday\" promotions after Thanksgiving to work down iPhone 7 inventory, says Pacific Crest.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's trade policies and the U.S. relationship with China could also be a factor in Apple stock.\n\"We see more opportunity for upside once investors gain more clarity around trade policy, which hopefully remains accommodating, and Apple's lineup and bill-of-materials in the next iPhone cycle,\" added the Pacific Crest report. \"We believe addressing gross margin risks will be necessary to drive Apple meaningfully higher, which could require a better look at the iPhone 8 lineup.\"",

      "text": "Despite a 71% plunge in shipments of Apple 's ( AAPL ) Apple Watch devices, overall shipments of wearables rose 3.1% in the third quarter vs. the year-earlier quarter, market tracker IDC said Monday.\nFitbit ( FIT ) widened its lead, according to IDC's numbers, but among the top five vendors Samsung had the biggest rise.\n\"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in the company's release. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme.\n\"Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five (all but Apple) offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\"\nIBD'S TAKE: Wearables aren't a hot sector, but there always are some fields doing well. And to find them, IBD's Industry Snapshot is one place to regularly check.\nIDC said fitness bands and basic wearables accounted for 85% of the market and jumped by double digits.\nTotal shipments rose to 23 million from 22.3 million in Q3 2015, the firm said. The wearables rise outpaced smartphones, which saw just a 1% rise in Q3 shipments, IDC said in October.\nFor Q3, Apple Watch shipments skidded to 1.1 million, IDC said, hurt by the late-quarter release (mid-September) of its second-generation watches. IDC also criticized what it called the Apple Watch's \"unintuitive user interface.\" It says that problem's been addressed with the new Watch, but said \"Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.\"\nFitbit saw an 11% rise in Q3 shipments, to 5.3 million, with its market share rising to 23% from 21.4%. China's Xiaomi is No. 2, but despite a 4% Q3 rise, its overall share barely rose to 16.5% from 16.4%.\nNo. 3 Garmin ( GRMN ) had a 12.2% Q3 increase, with its market share up to 5.7% from 5.3%.\nNext comes Apple, though its market share tumbled to just 4.9%, from 17.5% in Q3 2015.\nNo. 5 Samsung saw its shipments nearly double to 1 million, and its share rose to 4.5% from 2.5%. The other vendors combined recorded a 26.1% rise in Q3 shipments, as the market fragmented.\n\"Smart wearables have been down in recent quarters, but clearly not out,\" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said in the release. \"As user tastes change, so will their needs. That's the opportunity for smart wearables with multi-functionality and third-party applications, both for consumers and business users.\"\nGarmin stock ended trading up more than 1% on the stock market today , to close at 52.13. Shares have a possible buy point at 56.29, after the stock touched a 19-month high of 56.19 on Aug. 1. Shares of Apple were down 0.7% to 109.10 while Fitbit lost 1.4% to 8.03.\nLoading the player...",

      "title": "Legal showdown of 2016: FBI v. Apple",
      "text": "In the past year, one Apple ( AAPL ) news story proved more memorable than the latest version of the iPhone . In February, the tech giant took a public stand against the FBI’s request that it unlock a gunman’s iPhone, and a weeks-long standoff ensued. While the FBI eventually figured out how to access the phone without Apple’s help , it’s worth revisiting its fight against Apple. Other privacy disputes between the FBI and tech giants that guard your personal data and devices may very well play out in 2017 and beyond.\nMoreover, on Jan. 20, the US will inaugurate a new president who called for a boycott of Apple products after it refused to help the FBI unlock the phone. Donald Trump, and his attorney general pick, Jeff Sessions, may end up valuing national security concerns over privacy, Cornell Law School professor Michael Dorf told Yahoo Finance.\n”Even if all I cared about was security, it’s not obvious to me here that privacy is the enemy of security,” said Dorf, who teaches Constitutional law, among other subjects. “But I fear that the Trump/Sessions administration will simply view this through a conventional ‘law and order’ lens and regard assertions of privacy as simply impeding security.”\nOf course, Apple also accused the FBI under the Obama administration of threatening the security of its customers ’ data.\nThe dispute became public in February with a judge’s order mandating that Apple help the FBI unlock a phone used by a perpetrator of a mass shooting last year. Apple refused.\n‘An unprecedented step’ In December 2015, 14 people were killed in a shooting at a state-run facility in San Bernardino, Calif., which injured 22 others. Treating the massacre as a terrorist attack, the FBI asked Apple for help unlocking an iPhone used by one of the two perpetrators.\nWhen Apple balked at the FBI’s request, the US government filed a 40-page court document seeking to force the tech giant to unlock the phone used by Syed Farook, one of the two attackers along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik. Both died the day of their attack.\nHowever, before they died, Malik expressed her allegiance to the Islamic State. US investigators believed Farook’s iPhone might hold clues about the attack on the Inland Regional Center, a facility for people with developmental disabilities. But the FBI couldn’t unlock Farook’s phone without his passcode. What’s more, agents couldn’t even try to guess the password. That’s because Apple gives users the option to have all their iPhone data erased after 10 failed passcode attempts .\n“Apple has the exclusive technical means which would assist the government in completing its search,” the US government argued in its request to the court.\nAfter a federal magistrate judge in California granted that request , Apple pushed back more. “ The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an open letter to its customers on Feb. 16. “We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.”\nThe US government, Cook argued, wanted Apple to open up a “backdoor to the iPhone” by creating a new version of its operating system that circumvented security features. Apple could not take the risk that this “backdoor” might be used again to violate consumers’ privacy.\n“[W]hile the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case,” Armstrong wrote, “there is no way to guarantee such control.”\nThe public weighs in on FBI v. Apple Source: Bloomberg UK More Read More Apple’s stand against the FBI’s demands drummed up tech-industry support but stoked some criticism, as well. University of Chicago professor law profe ssor Omri Ben-Shahar, for one, suggested in the Huffington Post that Apple’s privacy crusade was a marketing ploy and stood at odds with the company’s practice of harvesting data for targeted advertising.\n“This is awfully rich,” he wrote. “The industry that makes a highly profitable living off of people’s data, now parading as the crusader of privacy.”\nRegardless of their motives, companies in that industry came out publicly to support Apple — including Facebook ( FB ), Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Amazon ( AMZN) . Those companies were among the dozens of companies and organizations that filed “friend of the court” briefs opposing the government’s efforts to enlist Apple to unlock the phone.\n“The government’s position, if it prevails, will undermine the security of Americans’ most sensitive data,” stated one brief signed by the above-mentioned tech companies and several others including Yahoo Finance parent company, Yahoo ( YHOO ). Later, that brief added, “The government’s bid to have technology companies undermine their own security measures is all the more puzzling because the Executive has been encouraging companies to increase cybersecurity in consumer products.”\nOther friends of Apple’s cause included 32 law professors, the ACLU , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , Airbnb, and a number of other groups and companies concerned with cybersecurity.\nWhile one might assume consumers would also support increased cybersecurity, that wasn’t necessarily the case amid the FBI v. Apple showdown. In February, 51% of adults surveyed by the Pew Research Center believed Apple should unlock the iPhone to help the FBI. Just 38% of the 1,002 people surveyed thought the tech giant shouldn’t back down (the rest didn’t have an opinion).\nIt’s possible that many of the consumers in favor of the FBI thought it worthwhile to trade a little privacy to aid the government in investigating a terrorist attack. Still, as Michael Dorf , the Cornell law prof essor, told Yahoo Finance recently, sometimes “privacy is a form of security.”\n“Making devices more vulnerable to law enforcement scrutiny could easily have the unintended consequence of making those same devices easier for foreign governments and criminals to hack,” added Dorf, who posts frequently on his blog Dorf on Law .\nIndeed, hackers could theoretically access Apple’s theoretical “backdoor” software off of its own servers, The New York Times editorial board argued in an piece called “ Why Apple was right to challenge an order to help the FBI .” In the end, Apple never had to create that software.\nThe government drops its case Apple CEO Tim Cook Credit: Andrew Burton/Getty More In late March, the Justice Department revealed that a third party helped it unlock the iPhone — putting an anticlimactic end to a prolonged and public debate. Of course, the dispute over whether tech companies have to help investigators crack into their systems is far from over, especially since the California court never had an opportunity to weigh in on the Apple case. (Though a different judge, in New York, sided with Apple in a similar case in February.)\nThe case brought by the US government relied on a 227-year-old law called the All Writs Act , which says that courts can hand down “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.”\nThis essentially means that courts can order parties — like Apple — to comply with court orders. In a digital age, where orders like the one Apple received can have broad ramifications, the use of the All Writs Act can pose new problems and let the government wield seemingly infinite power. “If it can tell Apple, which has been accused of no wrongdoing, to sit down and write a custom operating system for it, what else could it do?” Amy Davidson noted in The New Yorker .\nIf the case had proceeded, Dorf told me, there’s a possibility Apple would have won given a Supreme Court ruling from 2014 finding cellphones can’t be searched without a warrant. “The Supreme Court rightly realized we’re in a new era,” he said.\nEven if Trump is able to appoint multiple Supreme Court justices, there could still be more precedent aimed at protecting digital privacy. “For the most part, at least among legal elites, these issues do not have a clear left-right balance. Some of the conservatives are quite concerned about privacy,” Dorf said. Regardless of which way the Supreme Court goes, the issue of digital privacy will certainly reach the justices again. Even if Trump doesn’t like it, a justice (or justices) he appoints may end up curbing the kind of assistance the government can demand of tech companies like Apple.\nErin Fuchs is deputy managing editor of Yahoo Finance.",

      "text": "Tim Cook: Apple Watch Sets Record In Sale During Holiday Week  08 PST \nAccording to an email sent to Reuters from Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, it seems that Cook has revealed that the Apple Watch has done well for itself over the holiday week and has apparently set a record. The device’s sell-through is said to have reached a new high, which for those unfamiliar basically means units that are actually sold to customers, not to retailers. \nCook’s email read, “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” \nHis email unfortunately did not provide any numbers, but that’s not surprising as Apple has yet to provide the official figures regarding the sale of the Apple Watch. This is actually surprising to learn, especially when you consider the fact that the Apple Watch has been declining in the number of units shipped and its market share . \nRecent figures from the IDC revealed that in Q3 2016, 1.1 million units were shipped versus Q3 2015 in which Apple shipped 3.9 million units. The market share for Apple’s wearables has also dipped down to a measly 4.9%, where in the previous year the company was sitting at a very comfortable 17.5%. \nFiled in Apple > Gadgets .

      "text": "Tim Cook claims resurgent Apple Watch sales over holiday period thus far By John Glenday - 06 December 2016 08:38am Tim Cook claims resurgent Apple Watch sales over holiday period thus far \nApple CEO Tim Cook has scotched reports of dismal Apple Watch sales in the third quarter by claiming that the faltering wrist gadget actually racked up its strongest ever performance in the first week of holiday shopping – heralding what could be its strongest quarter to date. \nThe comments came in the wake of a report published by independent market research firm IDC which found that Apple Watch sales had suffered a mammoth 71% fall in year-over-year sales in the third quarter, twisting the knife further by blaming the poor performance on an ‘aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface’. \nMoved to respond Cook talked up the line’s performance in an email to Reuters, although he remains characteristically coy about precise sales figures, saying: “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\"",

      "text": "show chapters Partnering with banks to drive European expansion: Alipay      4 Hours Ago | 02:59 Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliate which runs the Alipay payments service, announced partnerships with European banks on Tuesday as it continues to expand in the region. \nThe deals with BNP Paribas, Barclays , UniCredit , and SIX Payment Services will allow an additional 930,000 merchants to start accepting Alipay if they wish to do so, the company claimed. \nAnt Financial runs China's biggest payments service, Alipay, which has a total of 450 million active users and processes 170 million transactions per day. The expansion into Europe is aimed at Chinese users traveling abroad. Alipay is deeply ingrained in the lives of Chinese consumers and is used to pay for items in-store and online, for goods and services ranging from taxis to restaurants and clothing. \nThe partnership with BNP Paribas will allow Alipay payments to be facilitated via the bank's merchant network in France and later in Europe. With Barclays, Alipay will be able to tap the U.K. market. SIX is a payment service provider that will help Alipay expand onto e-commerce platforms and in-store across Europe. And UniCredit will aid Alipay in launching the payment service in Italy next year. \nAlipay first expanded into Europe in October 2015 in Germany and has since been working on getting merchants using its platform . The payments service is now available to use in locations such as famous London department store Harrods and Munich airport. Users can also process tax refunds via the app in 23 European countries. \nAnt Financial said that at the end of the third quarter of 2016, excluding mainland China, it had a network of close to 100,000 retailers in 70 countries and regions. \n\nApple Pay rival? Capturing Chinese travelers abroad is key to locking users into the Alibaba ecosystem, particularly when there are many payment rivals outside of China such as Apple Pay. Chinese tourists spent $215 billion abroad last year, a 53 percent rise from 2014, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Alipay is hoping that much of this spending will be through its app. \nWhile Alipay doesn't directly compete with the likes of Apple Pay or Google's Android Pay in Europe, because it's aimed at Chinese users, Douglas Feagin, head of international operations at Ant Financial, hinted that the company could offer the service to international users in the future. \n\nAnthony Kwan | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee scans a quick response (QR) code displayed on the Ant Financial Services Group's Alipay app, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding. \"In terms of focus on Europe, we like to initially expand Alipay to be much more of a global product with global users. And we're going to do that step by step. Right now we are focused a lot on Asia with a partnership with PayTm in India … we'll look to expand that across Asia, then we'll look to Europe and the United States for future growth,\" Feagin told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday. \nLast year, Alibaba and Ant Financial invested $680 million in PayTm, an Indian payments start-up. \n\nIPO ahead? Alipay raised $4.5 billion earlier this year to fuel its expansion in a round that valued the company at around $60 billion, people familiar with the matter told CNBC at the time. This makes it the second most valuable private technology company in the world, behind Uber which is worth over $62 billion. \nAnt Financial is slated to go public next year. A source close to the situation told CNBC in October that while the firm is \"closer to an initial public offering (IPO)\", there is no timeline set. \n\"We don't have any current plans in terms of timeline or venue for the IPO. We certainly see the benefits of being a public company and I think the transparency of being able to communicate more regularly with investors more broadly we see is a benefit, as well as having the currency to do things more strategically could be an advantage to us,\" Feagin said.",

      "title": "Apple Watch sales on track for best quarter ever, says Tim Cook",
      "text": "Apple Watch sales on track for best quarter ever, says Tim Cook View more By Ric Cowley , News Editor \nApple CEO Tim Cook has claimed that the Apple Watch had a record sales during the first week of holiday shopping and is set to have its best quarter ever. \nSpeaking to Reuters , Cook said that the actual sell-through of the Watch had reached a new high. He declined to provide actual sales data for the device, however. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" he said. \n\"In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" \nDouble the product \nApple launched a new Watch earlier this year while relaunching its original Watch at a smaller price. The Watches are now known as Series 1 and Series 2 to differentiate them. \nApple has also never broken out individual Watch sales in its financials. It is instead considered part of its \"other products\", revenues of which were down 9% year-on-year in its last financial release . Tags:",

      "text": "Follow @phalgunn Share this Apple is known for its quality products - be it smartphone, laptop, PC, or tablet. But, the company’s accessories do not come with a friendly price tag, thus making it difficult for many people to purchase original accessories for their Apple devices. As a result, many consumers go for fake accessories. A charger is one such commonly available fake accessory for Apple devices. In fact, many e-commerce websites like Amazon are flooded with fake Apple chargers. And now, a recent study shows that in among 400 fake Apple chargers that were purchased online, only 3 have been able to pass basic safety tests, according to a recent report published in BBC. According to the same report, investigators have recently warned users to be careful while purchasing a fake charger as they face fatal risks. This came to light when nearly 93 per cent of fake Apple chargers were not having enough insulation to protect against electric shocks. The chief executive of Chartered Trading Standards Institute, Leon Livermore, has also urged buyers to purchase electrical goods only from trusted suppliers. In addition to this report, Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, has also given a couple of note worthy points to take care of when purchasing an Apple charger or any other electrical good. According to him, \"Counterfeit electrical goods are likely to be poor quality and in the worst cases unsafe.” He has also added - \"Look out for tell-tale signs of counterfeiting such as mistakes in brand names or logos, and check plugs for safety marks - all genuine electrical items made in the EU should have a CE mark on them.\"",

      "text": "via IDC \nAccording to IDC's new Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker statistics , this phenomenon caused Apple to record a significant drop in its share of the wearables market, from 17.5% in 2015, to just 4.9%, equating to a -71% YoY (year-over-year) growth. Expounding on this, the report says that this is due to the late launch of the second-generation Apple Watch. However, IDC sees a shift towards simpler wearables, which might have contributed towards the decline of the Watch, claiming that: \n\"The primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.\" \nIndeed, as IDC's data shows, 85% of the wearables shipped currently consist of fitness devices. Fitbit is leading the charge, with 5.3 million units sold in the current quarter, followed by Xiaomi. \n\"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, Senior Research Analyst at IDC. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device.\" \nIDC evaluates that app-running smartwatches like the Apple Watch will continue to struggle, against cheaper fitness trackers. \nIn response, Apple CEO Tim Cook refute d IDC's data, and said: \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" \nHowever, Cook himself did not produce any sales figures for the Apple Watch. \nEven with the alleged decline, Apple still reigns supreme over the smartwatches category with a commanding 41.3%, besting Garmin, Samsung, Lenovo, and Pebble, among other brands.",

      "text": "Apple Watch Sees Drop in Market Share Despite Wearables Market Growth: IDC Reddit \nWhile the overall wearables market grew 3.1 percent year-over-year in the third quarter of 2016, Apple Watch share took a downturn owing to an ageing lineup and an unintuitive user interface, market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) has said. \nApple's decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September , towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in the third quarter and the company stood fourth with 4.9 percent share. \n( Also see: Apple CEO Tim Cook Says Apple Watch Set Sales Record in Holiday Week ) \nAccording to IDC's 'Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker' report , total wearables shipments reached 23 million in the third quarter. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, Senior Research Analyst, IDC Mobile Device Trackers.\nBasic wearables, primarily comprised of fitness bands, accounted for 85 percent of the market and experienced double-digit growth. \nFitbit , with a 23 percent share, was once again the market leader in the third quarter as the vendor released a long-awaited refresh for the \"Charge HR\" wireless activity wristband with \"Charge 2\". \n( Also see: Fitbit to Acquire Pebble for Roughly $40 Million: Reports ) \nXiaomi stood second with 16.5 percent market share. \"The company across all business lines continues to struggle to gain any significant traction outside China,\" the report added. \nWith a market share of 5.7 percent, Garmin stood third as the company with one of the widest portfolios among all the vendors. \n\"The company managed to expand its channel presence over the past year, focusing on numerous sports equipment chains and independent retailers,\" the report noted. \nSamsung , with 4.5 percent market share, stood fifth and the company was able to sustain shipments of its Gear S2 , particularly the cellular-enabled versions, through various wireless service providers, the findings showed. \nIDC expects the momentum for basic wearables to continue for the remainder of 2016. However, smart wearables capable of running third-party apps will likely continue to struggle in the near term.",

      "text": "Reddit \nRebutting an IDC analyst report that intimated Apple Watch sales were down more than 70% year-over-year, Tim Cook has announced that the Apple Watch is in fact seeing “off the chart” sales growth ( via Reuters ). \nAlthough Apple refuses to announce exact numbers for units sold, Cook said that during the first week of holiday shopping, Apple Watch sell-through was higher than any other week in the product’s history. Apple expects the product to be one of the top holiday gifts this year, boosted by the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 2 . \nApple does not disclose exact numbers for Apple Watch performance as it does for other products like iPhone, iPad and Mac. This means there are no official numbers about sales performance available; analysts such as IDC attempt to estimate sales from supply chain indicators. \nAhead of the holiday shopping period, Apple revamped the watch hardware lineup and the software offering to answer customer complaints about the first generation Apple Watch units. \nThe company introduced the Apple Watch Series 2, with waterproofing, GPS, brighter display and faster internals, as well as a spec-bumped Apple Watch Series 1 available at cheaper prices. watchOS 3 reworked the functionality of the side button and streamlined the UI to focus on the watch face and apps. \nIt seems, in this case, the IDC report was way off. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that during the first week of holiday buying season, Apple Watch sell-through was the highest it has ever been. Sell-through is the rate at which inventory shipped to retail stores are bought by end consumers. \nThe email note from Cook continues to say that the wearable is on track for its best quarter ever. This will no doubt be taken as good news in the eyes of investors who are looking for ways for Apple to continue company-wide growth as sales of smartphones slow and tablet interest declines. \n“Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Cook wrote. \n“Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” he said. \nHowever, it’s difficult for analysts to get visibility into the Watch successes and failures as Apple does not break out sales data for it in its earnings report, instead including it in an ‘Other Products’ business that comprises Watch, Beats, iPod and other items. \nThe holiday quarter is expected to be a blockbuster period for the company with Apple dominating Christmas wish lists : iPhone is the most sought-after gift, MacBook coming in at #2. After a few quarters of revenue decline, Apple has also told investors that it expects to return to revenue growth in the holiday period driven by demand for iPhone 7. Guides",

      "text": "Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions By Tuesday, December 06, 2016 Pic: Reuters \nApple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self- driving cars. \nThe company is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Apple said in a November 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering Apple's opinion about draft regulations for the sector. \n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realised safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,\" the company's director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote. \nApple issued the letter because it is \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" Rumours about Apple's ambitions in the sector have circulated for years. \nThe company has a separate organisation called \"Project Titan\" that is developing automotive projects. \nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook's comments have fueled speculation. \nAfter a US$1 billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of \"some strategic things that the companies can do together over time.\" However, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project's \"reboot.\" Instead of designing and producing a complete self- driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles. \nIn its letter, Apple urges the NHTSA not to penalize new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions. \n\"To maximise the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" it says. \nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to \"build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone.\" Most major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020.

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has said that the random shutdowns plaguing some iPhone 6s models may be more widespread than it first believed. \nApple initially said that it found that battery components in a particular batch of iPhones were exposed to the air for too long before assembly, causing the batteries to cut out. It has now updated its statement to say that some customers with phones from outside this batch have also experienced shutdowns, and that it will be issuing an iOS update to help track down the cause … \nIn a support document seemingly not yet posted in English, Apple said that it needed additional diagnostic data to determine the cause of the problem. However, it believes that a software fix may be possible for units outside the original batch. Outside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns may be normal, because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates. \nApple launched a free repair program for iPhone 6s units within certain serial number ranges , but it now appears that these may not be the only ones affected. \nThe repair program followed shortly after another one for iPhone 6 Plus models suffering from ‘ Touch Disease .’ In that case, Apple said the issue was caused by impact damage, and that customers would be required to pay a flat fee for repairs.",

      "text": "Tim Cook says Apple Watch sales are doing just fine Posted The NFL Players Association is launching an accelerator to trade licensing rights for equity \nIt’s hard to know if the Apple Watch is a hit or a miss. The company doesn’t disclose sales numbers directly, but Tim Cook wanted to react to IDC’s report on wearables, saying that sales are doing just fine. \nAccording to the report, Apple is only the fourth wearable company now behind Fitbit, Xiaomi and Garmin. It represents a stark 71 percent decline in shipments compared to last year. \nBut Tim Cook wanted to set the record straight and gave some information to Reuters . Sales set a record during the first week of holiday shopping. That’s a very specific data point, but I guess it means that Apple had a good week. \nApple also says that the current quarter should be the best ever for the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch seems like a good holiday present, so it seems normal that Apple Watch sales are much higher during the holiday quarter compared to the rest of the year. \nNow, people are wondering whether customers are going to renew their existing Apple Watches over the coming years or if they think it’s not useful enough and they don’t need an Apple Watch in their life. The Apple Watch excitement phase is over. But maybe it’s going to be a slow and boring growth over the coming years. 0",

      "text": "12/06/16 AT 6:26 AM Close \nApple claimed on its Chinese website Friday its iPhones would shut down rather than explode, to protect hardware from damage due to low voltages. On Tuesday, a Chinese consumer watchdog refuted the claim, saying it had received complaints of iPhones exploding and catching fire. \nShanghai Consumer Council called on Apple to address the complaints: “Apple should be responsible for consumers. A lot of consumer complaints are not solved effectively.” \nThe state-run consumer protection forum alleged it received eight reports of iPhones simultaneously combusting while being used or charged, in a report posted Friday on its website. The report quotes one woman saying her iPhone 6s exploded in August, shattering the display and blackening the back and battery of the phone. The council added it had seen a six-fold rise in the number of complaints in the past two months, including those related to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. Related Stories Apple is Gearing Up For It's Biggest iPhone Sale Ever Next Year \nThis is not the first time that news of iPhones exploding has surfaced. On Oct. 1, an iPhone exploded in a student's back pocket in New Jersey and on Oct. 20, an iPhone exploded in an Australian man's car, burning down the vehicle. \nApple China addressed the issue of the accidental shutdown of a few iPhone 6s handsets Dec. 2 and said the complaints concerned only those handsets manufactured between September and October. \nThe consumer watchdog's report comes on the heels of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 scandal, where the recall of the exploding devices caused the South Korean company an estimated $5 billion. Apple has also seen a plunge in its profits and such incidents could hit the company further.

      "title": "Reading tea leaves of insider sell at Apple, buy at Acushnet",
      "text": "Reading tea leaves of insider sell at Apple, buy at Acushnet | Monday , Dec. 5, 2016, 11:00 p.m.   \n  7 hours ago Eduardo Cue, known as Eddy, is a big man at Apple Inc. (AAPL). He is in charge of the iTunes store, the iBooks store, and Apple Music, among other things. As senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, he reports directly to CEO Tim Cook. So, what are we to make of the fact that Cue has sold more than $42 million of Apple stock this year? One can argue that sales of this kind are not a bearish sign. Cue's livelihood is dependent on Apple; why should his stock portfolio be too? Also, Cue's supply of Apple stock may be replenished by the exercise of stock options – either ones he already has or ones he fully expects to get. Those aren't bad arguments but I'll say this: There is no way a big insider sale is a bullish sign. Apple's Slowdown I've recommended Apple stock in this column at times in the past, but I don't like it as much now. To be sure, the company still has many strengths: able executives, a big cash hoard, and wonderful products. But Apple doesn't look like the juggernaut it recently was. Operating earnings grew an average of 40 percent a year in the past ten years. In the past year, they fell 11 percent. The company was debt free through fiscal 2012. Today debt is 68 percent of stockholders' equity, which is just middle-of-the-pack. Acushnet R. Walter Uihlein, the CEO of Acushnet Holdings Corp. (GOLF), spend $1.19 million on Nov. 2 to add to his store of Acushnet stock. Altogether he owns 702,196 shares, worth $14.4 million at the Nov. 30 price of $19.96 a share. Based in Fairhaven, Mass., Acushnet makes golf balls, clubs and other gear under the Titleist brand, and golf clothing under the FootJoy brand. On the same day as Uihlein made his jumbo purchase, five other Acushnet insiders bought smaller amounts. Such cluster buying is a good sign more often than not. And I like the Uihlein purchase because buys by CEOs tend to have more predictive value than buys by lesser corporate officers. Acushnet is a brand-new public company. It made its initial public offering in late October. But Titleist is a brand familiar to all golfers, many of whom are fond of it. And while there's no earnings history as a public company, the stock sells for only 0.28 times revenue, a ratio I like. Skechers I also recommend Skechers USA Inc. (SKX), which makes casual shoes, boots, sneakers and sandals. Based in Manhattan Beach, Calif., the company is run by the father-son team of Robert and Michael Greenberg. The Greenberg's made their name with LA Gear, which soared, then fizzled. Like LA Gear, Skechers has used aggressive business strategies and sexy advertising. But Skechers has lasted better. The company has shown a profit in 13 of the past 15 years. Lately, growth has accelerated. In the past four quarters, its revenue increased nearly 17 percent, and operating earnings rose almost 20 percent. Data on consumer spending have been looking good, so I think there's a good chance Skechers continues to streak. The stock is moderately valued at 13 times earnings. Insider Series I've written 40 columns on the subject of insider buys and sells over the years. I've tabulated the results for 30 of them – all those written from February 1999 to December 2015. I have recommended 57 stocks on the basis of insider buying and they have beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 by an average of 6.5 percentage points. For 18 stocks, I commented on insider buying but said to avoid the stock. Those have trailed the S&P 500 by 25 percentage points. For nine stocks, I noted insider buying but didn't make a clear recommendation. Those have beaten the index by 15.9 points. For 21 stocks, I wrote about insider selling. Those have trailed the index but only by 0.05 percentage point. Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don't reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn't be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn't predict future results. Correction: In last week's column, I mistakenly said that Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. runs two fish chains and three steak chains. Actually, it sold off its other subsidiaries some time back to concentrate on its flagship Ruths Chris Steak House. Disclosure: I have no holdings in the stocks discussed in this week's column, and no plans to establish holdings in the next three days.

      "text": "Apple's new MacBook Pro has crappy battery life Apple can't catch a break with its new MacBook Pros, with users claiming crappy battery life Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: A A \nApple's new MacBook Pros hit the headlines with their cool new Touch Bar, but then there were claims that there was visual corruption over the AMD Radeon graphics cards - something that was debunked as 'fake news' if I can use that in a news story I will - it turned out to be third-party software, and not AMD hardware causing the visual artifacts . \nNow there are MBP owners taking to Reddit to talk about the poor battery life on their new, expensive laptops. One of the posts reads: \" The battery on mine (MBP 15″, 2.9, 1 TB, 460) seemed poor when I first got it, but after a week or so it seemed to get better. I assume it's because I was syncing Dropbox and installing all of my software. Now, I'm easily getting 8+ hours out of it when doing the \"loungey\" stuff like Messages, Safari, Mail, Calendar, and working on the odd spreadsheet in Excel \". \nAnother post said: \" I've had the 13′ w/ TB model for a little over a week and a half now. And I'm not liking the battery life at all so far. So initially using chrome w/ the rest of my apps I was getting about 4-5 hrs. So I switched to safari and noticed a slight bump, 5-6hrs. Which is not what was advertised. I used Safari, Mail, NetBeans/xcode and spotify. While in sleep mode, with all apps off, I lose about 6% every 8hrs which is also very bad... \". \nAnd finally, there's this one: \" Damn. I opened laptop when I just got home and had 75%. Has been less then 2 hours and got down to 5%. Chrome was open, and was editing photos in lightroom. Not a fan of the battery life \". \nAs I said in an article a few weeks ago: Apple can't launch a high-end MacBook Pro anymore, and that's quite sad.",

Subscribe \nIf you're in the camp that believes the Apple Watch is further evidence of the decline of the Cupertino empire, then you will see the news out of IDC as evidence to bolster to your case. The latest report on wearable technology shows everyone growing nicely -- except Apple, whose Watch sales \"plummeted\" 71% in the most recent quarter. Doing it: The Nike-branded Apple Watch is one of the new models this year, with features targeting runners and some unique band designs. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \nWhat most of the reporting on this \"news\" out of IDC is that it isn't news at all. The firm reported the very same Apple Watch data back in October , albeit in a different report focused just on smartwatches. Yet somehow the media latched onto this report and Reuters asked Apple CEO Tim Cook about the IDC report. \nCook, of course, didn't offer specifics -- Apple doesn't break out Watch sales and hasn't since launch, nor does it tell media outlets selective data in the middle of fiscal quarters -- but he did respond to Reuters. \"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" \nWhat does that mean numbers wise? Again, we can't know precisely though IDC itself thinks Apple sold 4.1 million Apple Watches last year in the fourth quarter. While some of those sales benefited from aggressive retailer promotions that knocked the starting price down from $349 to $249, it's worth noting that this year the base price has fallen to nearly that level ($269). \nThe Watch is also a better product this year, with a faster processor; a better, more streamlined operating system; superior battery life and improved features. While the last of the items on the list requires selecting the pricier Series 2 models, even those are priced no higher than last year's models and now are available with new options, including bands and software from Nike. Series 2 also includes integrated GPS and are also better for swimmers, with more complete waterproofing. \n(It's worth mentioning many swam for more than a year with the original Apple Watch, sometimes now called \"Series 0\" and had no problems doing so. Still, having 50m water resistance as an option is valuable to some.) \nThat Apple is forging ahead is perhaps noteworthy in itself. In recent days, Lenovo announced that its Moto division won't be releasing a new smartwatch to run on Android Wear 2.0, joining Huawei and LG in skipping a 2016 model release. While Moto didn't rule out a future return to wrist-based wearable technology, it also offered no suggestion as to when that might come. ",

      "text": "The British-made Blacklamp Carbon watch is full of glowing goodness Posted Tim Cook says Apple Watch sales are doing just fine \nBack when Britannia ruled the waves her beautiful lighthouses were wonders to behold. Many a sailor found solace in the pale light cast out over the ocean and now the Schofield Watch Company is celebrating these by releasing a watch that glows like a radioactive trash fire and is made almost entirely of carbon fiber. \nThe Blacklamp Carbon is a mechanical watch with a few interesting facets. First, it uses a massive Unitas movement, the same once found in pocket watches. Further, the company has handcrafted something they’re calling Morta . The material is made of dense carbon fiber fused and shaped by hand for the case. Finally, the company added a massive ring of lume material called strontium aluminate GLTD which glows once charged in sunlight. The light is enough to keep the watch glowing overnight ensuring you can see the hands in the dark. \nEach watch is marked with the coordinates of a British lighthouse and its flash pattern just in case you’re stuck at sea and need to find your way back to the Bonnie Young Lass or Lad who waits for thee on the quay. \nIn all this is a unique little watch with a lot of unique little features. That is made by hand in the UK is a bonus and that it looks like the lovechild of a Formula One race car and a hockey puck is another. Watches with odd touches and mechanical movements truly tickle my fancy and this guy looks very cool. The company is based in West Sussex and the founder, Gilles Ellis, makes all of his watches by hand. This particular model is almost sold out and each one takes six weeks to build by hand so get cracking. The bad news, as usual, is the price: $12,000 or so at current exchange rates which means it might be cheaper just to buy 0 ",

The company doesn’t disclose sales numbers directly, but Tim Cook wanted to react to IDC’s report on wearables, saying that sales are doing just fine. According to the report, Apple is only the fourth wearable company now behind Fitbit, Xiaomi and Garmin. It represents a stark 71 percent decline in shipments compared… Read More",

It seems the biggest loser is Apple, which has seen its YoY growth fall by a massive 71 percent, though one person who disagrees with the figures is CEO Tim Cook. \nThe report shows that “basic wearables,” which is mainly comprised of fitness bands, were the best-selling wearable devices for the last quarter, accounting for 85 percent of the market. IDC says this can be attributed to the launch of newer models and an expanding user base. \nThe number one wearables vendor is Fitbit, which saw YoY growth of 11 percent. It shipped 5.3 million units in Q3 2016, representing a 23 percent share of the market. The company looks set to acquire Pebble and eventually offer a true smartwatch of its own, cementing its position at the top of the pile. \nChinese giant Xiaomi sits in second place with a 16.5 percent market share and 3.8 million units shipped in Q3, while fitness brand Garmin is in third position with a 5.7 percent market share and device shipment volumes of 1.3 million.

      "text": "Despite its best efforts, Apple is still boring .\nAccording to data released from analytics firm IDC Dec. 5, Apple’s share of the wearable market in the third quarter shrunk significantly. Apple shipped roughly 4 million smartwatches in the quarter last year, according to IDC, but could only manage to ship roughly 1 million this year—a 70% drop in shipments.\nEvery other manufacturer has gained market share this quarter. Samsung is now selling about as many smart devices as Apple, up 90% from the same quarter last year. Fitbit, although up slightly from the year earlier, recently forecast that it’s likely to have a much weaker holiday quarter than Wall Street had been expecting. Its stock plummeted 30% to about $8.50 on the news.\nApple launched its newest watches , the Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Nike+ , partway through the third quarter, in early September, meaning that some people may have held off on buying an Apple Watch earlier in the quarter if they’d been reading the rumors that a new one was on the way. But there doesn’t seem to have been in a massive uptick in watch sales after the release, so perhaps people weren’t waiting for the new models. Regardless, Apple will be hoping people are out right now buying Watches as stocking stuffers for the approaching holiday. iPhone and Mac sales have been weak in recent quarters, and Apple posted its first yearly loss in over a decade in October.\nWhatever Apple’s solution to return to growth might be, Apple Watch probably won’t be part of it.",

In an email to Reuters, Cook said Apple Watch sales to consumer set record in holiday week, and that it was doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts, and that sales growth was off the charts. However, Cook did not provide actual sales data . His email followed a report by IDC that third-quarter Apple Watch shipments plunged 71% from a year ago.

      "text": "After years of secrecy, Apple has finally publicly acknowledged that it has joined the self-driving car race. In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on November 22, the Cupertino company said it was making huge investments in developing a self-driving car. If the rumor mill is to be believed, the so-called Apple car is being developed under the Project Titan for almost two years.\nImage Credit: Automobile Italia/Flickr Apple making huge investments in Apple car In his five-page letter , Apple’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner urged the US regulators not to impose heavy restrictions on autonomous driving as Apple begins testing the technology. Kenner said Apple was “excited” about the potential of automated systems “in many areas, including transportation.” The tech giant was making huge investments in the “study of machine learning and automation.”\nApple CEO Tim Cook has indicated on several occasions that the company was eager to move beyond the integration of iPhones in car infotainment systems. The tech giant has registered several automobile-related domain names such as Apple.auto and Apple.car. After the five-page letter went public, an Apple spokesman told Reuters that the company wanted to work with the NHTSA to “help define the best practices for the industry.\nApple emphasizes the need to share data Kenner pointed out that there were huge societal benefits of automated vehicles to be realized. Automated vehicles could prevent millions of car accidents and thousands of fatalities. However, some analysts believe that self-driving cars would also lead to millions of job losses. Kenner demanded that established players like GM and Ford and new entrants like Apple should be treated equally.\nApple emphasized the need to share “crashes and near-misses” data without compromising user privacy to improve the self-driving technology. Sharing such data will allow the industry to build a more comprehensive picture than “any one company could create alone.” It will help all players in the industry to design better systems “to detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.”\nApple developing underlying tech for a self-driving car Though Apple has been quiet on the Apple car, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called it an “open secret.” Musk believes that Apple is late to the self-driving party. Google already has autonomous cars on roads. Tesla announced in October that all of its cars built from October onward would have the necessary hardware installed to drive without requiring hands on the wheel.\nAfter several key departures, Apple reportedly shifted focus from building a full-fledged car to developing the underlying technology. It leaves open the possibility of designing a car later or partnering with an existing manufacturer to build the Apple car. Earlier, there were rumors that Apple was in talks to acquire or invest in the British carmaker McLaren.\nThe post Apple Publicly Acknowledges Work On Self-Driving Apple Car appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "title": "Apple Inc. Stock Rides On iPhone 7 Demand, But Reports Are Mixed",
      "text": "This year it seems that Apple stock is being impacted more by expectations for the iPhone 8 than by what’s happening with the iPhone 7. One big reason for that is because next year will be the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, and thus, something huge is expected. However, it’s probably a good thing that iPhone 8 hopes are driving Apple stock right now because analysts seem more befuddled than usual when it comes to trying to figure out how iPhone 7 sales are going.\nPhoto by Szilveszter Farkas iPhone 7 Plus supply still constrained One point that most analysts do agree on is that demand for the iPhone 7 Plus still appears to be constrained even though it’s been about two months since the new phones were released. Wait times for the Plus-sized iPhone still stands at three to four weeks. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Dec. 4 research note that the constraints on demand for the iPhone 7 Plus are making it difficult to tell just how well this year’s lineup is doing in terms of end demand.\nThey add that after meeting with manufacturers and component suppliers, they feel that iPhone 7 sales are going about as expected, noting that this is better news than the recent concerns from Apple’s supply chain suggesting that there Apple had cut iPhone orders at TSMC. As a result, they believe that either the reports were company-specific due to inventory levels or yields or not entirely accurate.\niPhone 7 demand appears soft Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal described demand for the smaller iPhone 7 as “sedate” in his report dated Dec. 1. He noted that it took about a month for supply and demand on the iPhone 7 to reach equilibrium, which was about the same as for the iPhone 6. He believes that demand for the iPhone 7 Plus is “siphoning” from demand for its smaller sibling and that as a result, demand for the 7 is softer.\nKvaal added that his checks in the U.S. suggest that fourth quarter upgrade rates will be similar to that they were for the iPhone 6s last year and that Apple’s purchase commitments suggest the same story. He also believes that the iPhone’s gains versus Android phones are still positive, even if they’re smaller because of the constraints on the iPhone 7 Plus. He explains that even if the growth rate is smaller, it implies that the iPhone 8 will launch into a subscriber base that’s almost 50% higher than the base the iPhone 6 launched into two years ago.\nIs Apple doing well in China or not? UBS analyst Steven Milunovich used sell-through data from Gartner to gauge iPhone 7 sales for his Dec. 5 report. He said even though iPhone shipments fell 8% year over year in fiscal 2016 compared to the premium smartphone market’s 4% decline, Apple still outperformed competitors in most markets. He explained that sales in the West are still solid, with all regions except China showing improved sales trajectories in the second half of fiscal 2016.\nWhat’s worse is that the declines in China got worse in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, with Hong Kong leading the fall on the back of the strong dollar. Milunovich believes that Apple’s brand is still strong but that consumers in China want a greater differentiation than what the company provided between the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7.\nInterestingly, Kvaal termed demand for the iPhone 7 Plus as “strong” in China and the U.S. This would seem to support Milunovich’s view that Chinese consumers want more differentiation because the 7 Plus has dual-lens camera on it, which does set it apart from its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus . If it doesn’t support his view of the need for differentiation, then it just adds confusion to what is already a muddled story.\nShares of Apple stock declined by as much as 0.78% to $109.04 during regular trading hours on Monday.\nThe post Apple Inc.

      "text": "Apple Admits More iPhone 6s Units Could Have a Faulty Battery GO Firm announces software update to help track down the issue Dec 6, 2016 12:57   ​   program after it discovered that “a small number” of iPhone 6s units might come with a faulty battery, and now it says that it’s possible that another “small number” of iPhone 6s models might have the same faulty battery. In other words, there might be many more iPhones out there that were shipped with a bad battery, and although Apple seems to be doing damage control right now and limit its recall to just “a small number” of devices, it appears that the issue might be more widespread than initially believed. iOS update coming In an updated statement posted on its Chinese website , Apple says that it believes that another batch of iPhone 6s units could be impacted by the unexpected shutdown problem. Originally, the firm said that only devices manufactured   2015 were affected. “Outside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns may be normal, because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components,” the firm says. In order to determine whether more units are affected or not, Apple is now planning to release an iOS update that would help the company isolate the issue. The patch should go live next week, Apple says, but it’s not yet clear if only the iPhone 6s would get it or all models. We’ve also seen reports that other iPhones could suffer from similar unexpected shutdowns, but Apple might be targeting just the 6s. “To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates,” the company says. According to Apple itself, the batteries in these iPhones were exposed to the air for too long during the manufacturing process, so they degrade faster over time and lead to unexpected shutdowns even though devices still show around 50 percent of battery left.",

      "text": "AP \nOver the past few weeks, a number of iPhone owners have made note of an issue that causes their phones to shut down with around 30% battery left.\nApple first addressed the problem in late November, saying that a \"very small number of iPhone 6s devices\" were affected. It opened up a free battery exchange program for those phones it deemed vulnerable.\nMore and more complaints have come to light since then, though, with many claiming to suffer from the same issue on iPhones beyond the 6s. Apple Store employees have reportedly been inundated with grievances over the issue, and a Chinese consumer watchdog has claimed that the battery flaw is more widespread than Apple has let on.\nAll this of led  Apple to issue a statement  last week, when it reiterated that the problem should only apply to a select number of iPhone 6s devices manufactured between September and October 2015, and chalked the issue up to excess \"ambient air\" being let into a battery component within those devices during manufacturing.\nAP \nThe complaints have kept rolling in, though, so Apple on Tuesday put out another statement on its Chinese language website . As spotted by 9to5Mac , the new note acknowledges that \"a small number of customers outside the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown.\"\nThough the company isn't opening up its battery replacement program to more iPhones, it says it will include \"additional diagnostic capability\" in a forthcoming iOS update, which should help it see if there's anything it can do on a software level to counter the unexpected shutdown problem.\n\"This will allow us to gather information over the coming weeks which may potentially help us improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown,\" the statement says. \"If such improvements can be made, they will be delivered in future software updates.\"\nApple says the additional diagnostic tools will roll out next week.\nAP It's worth noting that unexpected shutdowns are not uncommon for lithium-ion batteries nearing their death — iPhone users have been reporting similar issues for years .\nKyle Wiens, head of popular device repair site iFixit , told Business Insider that iPhone batteries are generally designed to last for 400 charging cycles. That amounts to roughly two years of \"regular\" use. If someone isn't careful with how liberally they charge their phone, though, they may run into this sort of battery \"failure mode\" sooner.\nAll of this is to say that not every iPhone user complaining about random shutdowns is suffering from the battery flaw Apple has addressed here. Sometimes, a battery is just nearing its end.\nThat said, it's clear that some newer batteries are failing sooner than usual — it's just hard to tell which of those are due to explicit manufacturing or software flaws on Apple's part.\nFor now, though, you can either check Apple's webpage to see if you're eligible for a battery replacement, or hope that there's some sort of software fix after all.\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Apple Watch sales set record first holiday weekend, says Tim Cook Following an IDC report that threw shade on Apple Watch sales, CEO Tim Cook said in an email to Reuters the current quarter is set to be the best for the wearable. | Topic: Mobility (Image: File photo) \nApple CEO Tim Cook on Monday said Apple Watch sales set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is set to be the best for the smartwatch so far. Read more Read More \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" wrote Cook in an email response to Reuters. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" the executive continued. \nCook's comments were likely promoted due to a research report from IDC on Monday. It said Apple sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. Apple hasn't disclosed specific sales numbers for the wearable. \nIDC said Apple Watch's sale decline is in part to an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Meanwhile, basic wearables like the Fitbit have gained popularity. \n\"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" said IDC Senior Research Analyst Jitesh Ubrani. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\"",

If someone isn't careful with how liberally they charge their phone, though, they may run into this sort of battery \"failure mode\" sooner. \nAll of this is to say that not every iPhone user complaining about random shutdowns is probably suffering from the battery flaw Apple has addressed here. Sometimes, a battery is just nearing its end. \nThat said, it's clear that some newer batteries are failing sooner than usual — it's just hard to tell which of those are due to explicit manufacturing or software flaws on Apple's part. \nFor now, though, you can either check Apple's webpage to see if you're eligible for a battery replacement, or hope that there's some sort of software fix after all.

      "text": "There are so many clues and sources providing detailed leaks sharing that Apple might be developing self-driving car technology. The latter has emerged in a letter sent by the tech giant to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nAdvertisement The letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal , was sent by Apple's head of product integrity Steve Kenner and included feedback on proposed guidelines for self-driving cars. The full design and details of specifications of the car are also included.\nSpecifically, there was a paragraph stating that Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nThere have been rumors and leaks online of fact that Apple is developing self-driving car technology for years and until recently it was thought that Apple would use the technology for its own car.\nThe thinking and concept changed in October when reports emerged and was out in the public claiming Apple had abandoned plans to launch its own car and would instead focus on self-driving technology. The reports were backed up by the downsizing of staff working on Apple's car project, code-named Project Titan.\nOn the other side, the government is in the process of establishing laws , policies and rules for the safe testing and deployment of autonomous or self-driving vehicles or cars. In September, it presented initial guidelines that included a 15-point design and development checklist , targeted primarily at automakers.\nIn its letter to NHTSA, Apple called on the government to accelerate the establishment of rules for self-driving cars and to work with groups outside the United States to harmonize the \"approach to automated vehicles.\" Apple also asked the government to be more flexible regarding the rules, in order to foster innovation in a technology the tech giant sees as \"life-saving.\"\nAdvertisement\n Top 17 Gift Ideas Perfect For The Yuletide Season Apple Urges Government To Patronize And Encourage Self-Driving Cars EU To Draft Laws Against Online Hate Speeches Adidas Reveals Biodegradable Sneakers As Latest Innovation In Footwear Nestle Announces Cut Down On Candies' Sugar Content Advertisement",

      "title": "Review: A Made-for-iPhone 7 battery case w/ headphone jack, Lightning port, Qi-wireless charging & a built-in stand",
      "text": "Reddit This iPhone case launching on Indiegogo today is one of the first Apple certified, made-for-iPhone cases that adds a 3.5mm headphone jack back to your iPhone 7. It’s a battery case that connects to your device with a built-in Lightning connector, and it also has a female Lightning port to charge the battery using your iPhone’s charging cable. On top of being one of the first cases to offer audio over Apple’s Lightning connector to facilitate the 3.5mm headphone jack, the model I reviewed also included Qi-wireless charging. A competitor announced a crowdfunding campaign for a similar product a few months back, but this is the first actual production sample we’ve been able to go hands-on with. And the iStand case packs in a few other tricks including a built-in stand and, as mentioned above, one model that offers Qi-wireless charging via a dock the company also sent over for review. Design | One of the most notable aspects of the case is the fact that it manages to be quite slim and well-designed as far as battery cases go while still cramming in as much functionality as it does. The case measures 0.5 inches (12.9mm) at its thickest, compared to 14.5mm for Apple’s Smart Battery case or 15.5mm for Mophie’s case. There aren’t many compromises here, although the Qi-wireless charging compatible model only offers a capacity of 2000mAh, good for close to a full charge of your iPhone, versus the 3000mAh capacity of the one without Qi-charging. That’s simply because the company needed extra space for those components in the wireless charging version, and it didn’t want to sacrifice the sleek design of the case, which I appreciate. 3.5mm headphone jack | Once you’ve docked the case with the built-in Lightning connector, you can then use the headphone jack on the case without any further configuration. Since it also has a female Lightning port, it doesn’t come with a charging cable, but you can use any Lightning cable you already have (like the one that came with your iPhone) to charge the battery case itself. That’s ideal because it means you might be able to cut down on the number of cables you’ll need to carry around. Qi-wireless charging | The company is selling models with and without Qi-wireless charging technology, and a third that doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack for those that don’t need it. I also received the wireless charging dock with my review unit that the company will also be offering alongside the compatible iStand 7 case. But since it works with the Qi standard for wireless charging, it should work with any compatible dock product that offers that functionality. The stand comes with a micro-USB cable to plug it in, then you can just place your iPhone with the iStand 7 case on to begin charging. The decision whether or not to go with the wireless charging model or not will come down to battery life– if you need more than around one charge, you’re better off going with the larger 3000 mAh version that doesn’t include Qi wireless charging tech. If you’re mostly around a desk and not on the move for long periods of time, the wireless charging is a nice addition that doesn’t add any bulk. Built-in stand | The case also includes a built-in stand that is somewhat unique. Rather than just being a kickstand, the entire bezel of the case snaps free from the main unit and folds down behind to create a stand. Here’s a look: The stand works well enough and comes in handy to prop up a device in either landscape or portrait orientation while on the move. But the female Lightning port for charging and the 3.5mm headphone jack are obstructed so it’s not really possible to use this as a charging dock or with headphones while in stand mode. It also made getting the iPhone in and out of the case extremely easy, as the device slides in easier than the average case when in stand mode. Should you buy it? \nThis is one of the slimmest and overall well-built battery cases I’ve tested and that’s before considering it’s one of the first to pack in a 3.5mm headphone jack AND a female Lightning port. The product is launching on Indiegogo today ahead of shipping in March/April. The version without wireless charging starts at $54, while the Pro model with Qi charging tech goes for $79. Get the model without a 3.5mm jack for $39.",

      "text": "Tim Cook is pretty pleased by sales of Apple Watch this holiday shopping season.\nThe Apple CEO told Reuters the gadget set a sales record during the first week of holiday shopping and is on track for its best quarter yet.\n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote Monday in response to an email from the news agency. Cook went on to say that the Apple Watch reached a new high on sell-through, which measures the number of units actually sold to consumers compared with the quantity distributed to retailers.\n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said.\nApple unveiled the second generation of its Apple Watch in September. The device, which starts at $369 (£369, AU$529), looks identical to the first model but comes with one notable improvement: It's waterproof enough for swimmers.\nApple doesn't report sales data for its Apple Watch, the first new product released under the leadership of Cook, who needs to show that the company can still create lust-worthy, must-have products in new categories.\nCook's comments come as technology research firm IDC reported that Apple shipped 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch in the three-month period ended in September, a decline of 71 percent from the same quarter a year ago.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for more specific sales figures.\n ",

      "text": "Depending on whom you ask, smartwatches are struggling or red hot. Apple falls in the latter camp, as CEO Tim Cook says that the company just broke a record.\nCredit: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide \n\"Sales growth is off the charts,\" Cook told Reuters in an interview. \"In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\"\nThis rosy picture seems to fly in the face of a report just issued from research firm IDC , which says that Apple Watch shipments declined by 70 percent in the third quarter.\nMORE: Best Smartwatches - Top Picks for Android and iOS \nThe firm claims that it's seeing a big shift in the overall wearables market, with more simple, single-purpose fitness trackers from Fitbit and others now making up a whopping 85 percent of the market. \nCan both companies be right? Sort of. The latest Apple Watch Series 2 and updated Series 1 didn't go on sale until September, which doesn't count towards IDC's figures. The results won't show up until the fourth quarter numbers are available.\nIs the Apple Watch right for you? It depends on what you're looking for from a wearable device. Although it does a lot more than a simple fitness tracker, the Apple Watch Series 2 is actually a smartwatch that's best for those who are looking to get fit. It offers built-in GPS to track your runs and comes in a new swim-proof design you can easily take in the pool.\nApple made some other notable improvements, including adding a faster processor, bright display and beefier battery, but there simply isn't yet a killer app for the Apple Watch or any smart watch yet. Notifications are helpful, and so is being able to pay with stuff with Apple Pay via your wrists, but most of the time you'll still want to use your smartphone for other tasks.\nMORE: 7 Ways Samsung's Gear S3 Beats the Apple Watch \nRamon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team, cited several challenges for smartwatches in the company's report and wrote that \"we need to see more intuitive user interfaces, seamless user experiences, standalone connectivity, and applications that go beyond health and fitness and into personal and professional productivity.\" \nThe new Gear S3 from Samsung goes further than the Apple Watch buy offering optional 4G and a more stylish design, but as our own Mike Prospero wrote in his review, there's simply not enough apps to choose from yet.\nSo, yes, the Apple Watch is hot for now, but that doesn't mean it's right for you.\nSee Also : The Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) \nThe Best Fitness Gifts: Guide 21 Apple Watch Tips and Tricks Best Fibit: Choose the Right Tracker Your Needs About the author Mark Spoonauer @mspoonauer Mark Spoonauer is the editor in chief of Tom's Guide and has been covering technology for more than 15 years.

      "title": "HyperDrive Dongle: Answer To Apple’s New MacBook Pro Biggest Problem",
      "text": "Hardware & Machines , Technology HyperDrive USB Type-C 5-in-1 Hub enhances your new MacBook’s capabilities \nThe MacBook Pro 2016 with an innovative new keyboard and a monstrous touch-pad is perhaps the most beautiful laptop ever created but not everyone thinks the same. The company’s decision to include only four USB-C ports has not got well with the users compelling them to depend upon expensive and bulky dongles to access an SD card, or to connect an external hard drive, or even charge their iPhone. \nFortunately, the HyperDrive USB Type-C 5-in-1 Hub is here to make it easier for such users making it the only dongle you will ever need. The HyperDrive is tiny and neat, with dimensions of 115 x 28.5 x 8.5mm and it weighs 34 grams. \n“We designed HyperDrive to feel like a natural extension of the 2016 MacBook Pro with similar product lines, thickness, right angled edges and rounded corners. HyperDrive is made of CNC precision milled aluminium available in both Space Gray and Silver to match the color and appearance of the MacBook Pro. We also wanted an adapter hub that users can leave on their MacBook Pro as they move around. As such we did away with connector cables and have HyperDrive connect right next and flushed to the MacBook Pro”, says Sanho Corporation. \nThe HyperDrive has been launched on Kickstarter and it is specifically made for the MacBook Pro 2016. It is a compact and portable hub that has a HDMI port, Thunderbolt 3, USB-C port, a pair of USB 3.0 ports, along with SD and microSD card slots. The dongle uses 45Gbps bandwidth to drive its selection of 7 ports and enable them all to be used simultaneously if needed. \nWhile the hub will cost $99 at retail in the future, the cheapest super early bird price starts at $49 if you pledge through the ongoing Kickstarter campaign . The first models (only for super early bird buyers) are expected to ship in February 2017, with volume shipping for other purchasers to start in April. \nCheck out the video below to see this all-in-one dongle in action.",
