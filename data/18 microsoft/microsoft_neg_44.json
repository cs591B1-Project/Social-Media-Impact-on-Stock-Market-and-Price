      "text": "NASA, which is now using HoloLens at its 'Destination: Mars' exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center , and has even put the headset to use aboard the International Space Station . A virtual jet engine, appearing onstage at Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference \nAt its Worldwide Partner Conference this summer, Microsoft also highlighted its partnership with Japan Airlines, which has been using HoloLens to improve training for the engineers who maintain its fleet of aircraft . The airline said that the headset offers \"advantages and potential\" for its operations, including quicker maintenance procedures, and improvements to safety - the top priority for the aviation industry. \nMicrosoft's Alex Kipman said today that the company is on a mission \"to bring mixed reality to every person and organization on the planet\", adding: \n\"Since January 2015 we have been hard at work to bring the vision of mixed reality to life. It has been inspiring to see what has been created by our partners, and the team remains in awe of the way developers are using HoloLens. We can’t wait to see what everyone in Japan creates when they get their hands on HoloLens.\" \nYou can also find out more about what it's like to use HoloLens in our hands-on feature from earlier this year.

      "text": "  \n(REUTERS/Carlos Barria) Three new game titles have been released in the Xbox One Backwards Compatibility list. \nMicrosoft has recently added three more titles to the growing list of Backwards Compatible games for Xbox One. \nAfter unveiling \"Military Madness\" and \"Omega Five\" in the past week, the new games that will be available in the Games App library are \"Rayman Legends,\" \"Burnout Paradise\" and \"Pure.\" \nAs per Mobile & Apps , each game has its own pros and cons. \n\"Rayman Legends\" is the fifth game in the popular \"Rayman\" series released by Ubisoft. It was first made available for several platforms, but not until 2014 was it introduced to Playstation 4 and Xbox One. \"Rayman Legends\" reportedly drew good reviews but was not as popular as Ubisoft expected. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, \"Burnout Paradise\" is considered the first of the \"Burnout\" series to introduce open world gameplay. It was first made available for PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2008. \"Burnout Paradise\" is a well-loved racing game for players and critics alike. It has earned several awards for its innovative features and gameplay. It is also part of the Games with Gold December 2016 lineup. \nThe third game is \"Pure,\" another award-winning game that features an action-packed off-road quad-bike racing experience. \n\"Pure\" was first unveiled in 2008 by Black Rock Studio (now defunct) and published by Disney Interactive Studios. It bagged several accolades, including one from the Game Critics Awards, the Editors' Choice Award from Official Xbox Magazine and others. \nMeanwhile, many fans are still waiting for games from the \"Call of Duty\" franchise to be included in the list. \"Call of Duty: Black Ops II\" by Treyarch still remains the number one on the most requested list. Other top \"Call of Duty\" games requested include \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,\" \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,\" \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\" and \"Call of Duty: World at War.\" \nGamers can check out the full list of the Xbox One Backwards Compatibility titles available via GameSpot .

      "text": "Print Message It is good to see in this month's issue of Architecture Magazine the new architecture school at Kent State University. The Photos of the studio class show every desk out fitted with a drawing board, covered in our typical green protective vinyl, and each board has a parallel edge attached. That tells me some one is still teaching hand drawing!!! I saw one desk with a computer. I am 67 and I still draw by hand. I too have a subscription to Revit and Autocad that I keep up every year and when I need to work on a project I draw up the project by hand and have a student draw it in CAD. I too work on small homes and apartment buildings. Original Message Original Message I've been using Revit for 10 years now...and quite successfully on small projects. I would love to take a project mobile by getting a Surface with Revit installed. Then I can take the entire model to a client, allowing us to collaboratively explore the model through 2d views, 3d perspectives, etc....all generated on the fly with Surface. My question...does anyone have experience with running Revit on Surface? Does Surface have enough power/processing strength to manipulate a Revit model? Similarly, I'm interested in creating new 3d projections, sections, etc. \"on the fly\" in front of the client. None of this works if Surface is bogged down by Revit and it can't perform. Surprise, Microsoft says it has plenty of power, but any \"on the ground\" experience and input is welcome! Axios Architecture LLC | 2218 Lebaron Drive | Atlanta, Georgia | 30345 | 404/636-0611",

      "text": "0 With millions of dollars in funding pledged by two of the men behind software giant Microsoft, the search for intelligent life on other planets got a big boost August 1, 2000 as officials unveiled plans for a massive new telescope to scan the skies. The Allen Telescope Array - named for Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen, who put up $11.5 million for the project - will be \"the world's most powerful instrument designed to seek out signals from civilizations elsewhere in our galaxy,\" the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute said. Reuters \nBecause humans base their search for extraterrestrials on their experience of life forms as they search for world that has similar characteristics of Earth, it limits mankind’s search for intelligent life. Since there is a possibility that the aliens have developed advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence, the search should include sentient alien machines. \nSeth Shostak, a senior astronomer at Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, says aliens may have shed their biological bodies for digital forms , then the search should be in regions where digital life forms would be attractive. The likely places are the centre of the galaxy or places where there are plenty of minerals because these are regions rich in energy, Futurism reports. \nAt the same time, Shostak warns of the lack of plans by the US government in case such aliens would attack Earth, Express reports. He compares the situation to the US Air Force having an encounter with Neanderthals with their primitive culture and defence. \nShostak says to his best knowledge, the US military has no plan in case of an alien invasion . However, he admits the lack of preparedness is also due to false alarms raised by SETI, a California-based institute whose mission is to explore, understand and explain he origin and nature of life in the universe. \nSeth Shostak, a senior astronomer at Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, says aliens may have shed their biological bodies for digital forms. SETI Institute \nHe explains that over the years, the organisation had several false alarms, with the most prominent incident in 1997. SETI astronomers thought they were getting signals from alien life form, but the signal turned out to emanate from a European satellite.",

No color code appears for storage of Apps & Games, system, temporary files, etc. It will simply be the current Accent color you have chosen. Under advanced options for each app, there is a RESET button which will restore the app to its newly installed state. ( apps and games > advanced options). \nTake a look at some screenshots below: ",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/Xbox) Microsoft has revealed the five titles included in the Backward Compatibility program. \nXbox fans recently got treated to five new titles for the Xbox One Backward Compatibility program. For those who are unaware, this means that some games purchased for the Xbox 360 are now available on the Xbox One. \nPlayers who are already in possession of the Xbox 360 version of the games can play the titles on the Xbox One free of charge. The games will automatically be included in the My Games and Apps area of the Xbox One dashboard. \nThe five games available as part of the Backward Compatibility program are: \"Burnout Paradise,\" \"Rayman Legends,\" \"Pure,\" \"Omega Five,\" and \"Military Madness.\" \nAccording to Express , it was revealed last year that \"Burnout Paradise\" would eventually make it to the Backward Compatibility library, and it looks like Microsoft has made good on its promise. Advertisement \nAn open-world racing game, \"Burnout Paradise\" allows players to participate in racing competitions whether online or offline. \n\"Rayman Legends,\" on the other hand, is an award-winning platform video game. \"Pure\" is also a racing game that puts players on an ATV, performing stunts in various race types. \n\"Omega Five\" is a side-scrolling shooter game that requires players to defeat enemies using various weapons. Finally, \"Military Madness\" is a turn-based strategy game that takes inspiration from science fiction. \nIn other news, some fans were left disappointed when the five titles were released. It seems that they were expecting something different from the games that were made available. \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\" and \"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\" were seen on listings on the Xbox Live Black Friday sale that tagged them as Backward Compatible. This led to fans thinking that the two games would be released for the Xbox One soon. \nIt is widely known that the two games have loyal fan bases and their exclusion from the list of titles was not taken well. However, Xbox's Larry Hryb revealed that the listing was a mistake.  ",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Shown in the photo is the Lumia 950 XL. Rumors claim that Microsoft's Lumia line will be replaced by the Surface Phone. \nAfter the Surface Phone failed to make an appearance at Microsoft's event last month, rumors now claim that the alleged latest Microsoft mobile phone will arrive along with the Surface Book 2 and the Surface Pro 5 early next year. \nAlthough there is no confirmation on the existence of the Surface Phone, it is strongly believed that there is one and will arrive soon. In fact, many people thought that Microsoft would surprise the tech world with its reveal at the company's event last month, but the device was a no-show and a non-mention at the said event. \nHowever, according to the latest reports , Microsoft will finally unveil the device next year as the Surface Phone is said to share the spotlight with the Surface Book 2 and the Surface Pro 5, both of which were also expected to be unveiled at last month's Microsoft event. If the reports turn out to be true, the tech world will be treated to the arrival of the three Microsoft devices in February next year, which is only roughly three months away as of this writing. \nWhile there is still no confirmation on whether the Surface Phone is really in the pipeline, there are already numerous rumors and speculations as to what it may boast of. Reportedly, the device will come in an AMOLED Quad-HD or 4K display and will have the highly anticipated Intel Kaby Lake processor as its chipset. Advertisement \nIt is also said that the device will be available in three variants, depending on their RAM and storage capacity, with the premium model offering as much as 8 GB RAM with 512 GB internal storage capacity. \nAlthough the Surface Phone is to run on a Windows OS, rumors claim that it will be capable of running Android and iOS apps as well, which, if turns out to be true, will surely attract more buyers. After all, the lack of apps for Windows is one of the biggest reasons why the Lumia phones that Microsoft acquired from Microsoft failed to get the nod of the consumers. \nReportedly , the Surface Phone will be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017, happening in Barcelona from Feb. 27 to Mar. 2, 2017. In the event that the device is, indeed, revealed at the said upcoming event, only then can it be confirmed if the aforementioned specs and rumors of the Surface Phone are true or otherwise.  ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn recent days, Microsoft has been offering the Lumia 950 XL - its range-topping Windows 10 Mobile handset - for £289 in the UK, including a free Display Dock worth £79 . The cost of the 950 XL, and that of its smaller Lumia 950 sibling, have been falling since before the two handsets officially went on sale; the XL was originally listed at £549 , and its most recent price of £289 was its lowest to date on the Microsoft Store. \nThat offer was scheduled to end on November 28 - but while the small print on the store listing now indicates that it's been extended until December 16﻿ (and while the page still refers to it as a \"Limited Time Cyber Monday Offer, despite supposedly being extended for a further two weeks), Microsoft no longer has stock of the Lumia 950 XL available , in either the black or white models. \nThe 'add to cart' button has now been replaced by an 'email me when available' button - perhaps offering hope that more stock may be on the way. But it's worth noting that the Microsoft Store listing for the Lumia 950 displayed an identical 'email me when available' button for four weeks after stock of that device ran out , and it was only in the last few days that Microsoft finally updated the page with an 'out of stock' notice instead. \nMicrosoft may yet surprise us by replenishing stock of the Lumia 950 XL on its UK store - and some other retailers still have stock remaining - but a year after its Windows 10 Mobile flagships were unveiled, it seems clear that they're now approaching the end of their retail lives. \nMeanwhile, over in the United States this past weekend, Microsoft offered a free Lumia 950 with purchases of the 950 XL for the third time this year . Both devices have now returned to their original prices, but the company has dropped its offer of a free Display Dock with either handset - which had been available since September - and the Dock is no longer listed on its US store.

      "text": "​Microsoft is expected to release a new Windows 10 build this week that would target insiders on both PCs and mobile devices, and according to a recent report, there’ll be at least one new feature for smartphones. Aggiornamenti Lumia has posted a screenshot showing what seems to be a reset app feature integrated into Windows 10 Mobile and which the source claims is slated to make its debut in the next build. The Italian site explains that the purpose of this feature is to remove all cache and settings of an application, returning it to the original state after installing it. It goes without saying that this could come in handy very especially when trying to deal with errors, but resetting can also help with browsers, where removing unnecessary data can help save space. The feature displays information such ...",

      "text": "Pegatron has kicked off production trials for Microsoft's elusive Surface Phone, report claims Pegatron has kicked off production trials for Microsoft's elusive Surface Phone, report claims Posted: Tags : Microsoft - Microsoft + Although Windows Phone devices were not a definitely not a priority for Microsoft in 2016, the tech giant's CEO Satya Nadella recently raised lots of eyebrows by claiming that it's Microsoft's intention to eventually bring forth \"the ultimate mobile device\" . Supposedly, this will be a the ever-elusive Surface Phone, which has been a favorite rumor subject for the Microsoft-loving crowd. A recent report from the Commercial Times of Taiwan doesn't beat around the bush either, claiming that Pegatron has already begun procuring production trials on Microsoft's Surface Phone. Pegatron, as you likely know, does not only produce a large chunk of Apple's iPhone each and every year but is also responsible for the manufacturing of the Surface Studio, Redmond's costly desktop workstation. This ongoing partnership between Pegatron and Microsoft is definitely pouring more oil into the fire, making the rumor rather plausible. On a related note, we seem to know a few more tidbits of info about the Surface Phone. We heard through the grapevine that it might be armed with a Snapdragon 835 chipset and sport a fingerprint scanner embedded in the display. It's might also run x86 apps and Universal Windows Apps uin Continuum mode and further narrow the gap between mobile devices and desktop workstations. Rumors peg a possible release date for the Microsoft Surface Phone in late 2017 or even early 2018... if it comes our way at all. Until then, check out an artist's rendition of what this device might look like right below. Surface Phone concept renders by Behance Popular galleries",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn September, Microsoft cut the price of its Xbox 360 in the UK by 25% , reducing it to £149.99, including a copy of Forza Horizon 2 . When it introduced that new, lower price, Microsoft marked the ageing console as \"reduced to clear\" - but it seems it's now increasing its efforts to shift the last of its remaining stock. \nThe same bundle has now been reduced by a further £20 (13%), and is available to buy for £129.99 . Officially, that new lower price is a 'special offer' due to run until January 6, 2017, but it seems unlikely that it will return to its earlier price.",

( MSFT ) announced Tuesday that Microsoft HoloLens, the world's first self-contained holographic computer running Windows 10, will be available for preorder in Japan starting December 2. It is available exclusively from the Microsoft Store in Japan, with devices starting to ship in early 2017. \nSix weeks earlier, Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition and Microsoft HoloLens Commercial Suite expanded globally to six new markets. \nMicrosoft first announced HoloLens in January 2015 and shipped to developers and commercial partners in Canada and the United States on March 31, 2016. \nThe company noted that HoloLens is now available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, including Puerto Rico. \nAlex Kipman, technical fellow, Microsoft Windows and Devices Group, said, \"Our mission at Microsoft is to bring mixed reality to every person and organization on the planet. Since January 2015 we have been hard at work to bring the vision of mixed reality to life. It has been inspiring to see what has been created by our partners, and the team remains in awe of the way developers are using HoloLens. We can't wait to see what everyone in Japan creates when they get their hands on HoloLens.\" \n ",

In a blog post today, the software giant explains how it uses CallKit to make Skype for Business easily accessible to its customers on iPhones, as this new tech allows applications to handle calls from the lock screen or from the call screen just like the default phone app. For example, Skype for Business customers can now answer calls straight from the lock screen, but also to toggle between Skype and cellular calls from the calling interface. “iPhone users can accept an incoming Skype for Business call right from the lock screen. There is no need to unlock the phone or launch the Skype for Business app to receive the call,” Microsoft explains. “Skype for Business cal...",

      "text": "Is HP Microsoft’s most committed hardware-making partner right now? Until that fabled Surface Phone is formally confirmed once and for all, and the Surface Pro 4 convertible tablet gets a long overdue follow-up effort , you could even say HP believes in portable Windows-powered gear more than the Redmond-based tech giant itself.\nDespite the Elite x3’s apparent lack of mainstream success , fairly credible rumors on a sequel of sorts are starting to build up. Like the first-gen business-focused “3-in-1” device, the mysterious upcoming Windows 10 HP phone should see daylight in Barcelona, at the Mobile World Congress.\nThis time however, the plan is reportedly to target a larger crowd with a more general set of consumer capabilities, humbler overall specifications, and most importantly, lower price point. Don’t ask for a number just yet, although we’re hopeful of something along the $300 lines, since a middling Snapdragon 6xx series processor purportedly runs the hardware show.\nThere are already a handful of W10M phones powered by the Snapdragon 617 SoC, including the NuAns Neo and Vaio Phone Biz , but we expect HP to adopt a slightly faster, newer CPU/GPU combo. Perhaps one Qualcomm hasn’t officially unveiled at the moment.\nWhile mid-range and non-business-centric, the… Elite x4 (?) is still tipped to support Continuum convertibility , possibly working with the same docks and accessories as its predecessor .\nThe post HP Elite x3 may get consumer-oriented sequel at MWC 2017, but likely with mid-range SoC in tow appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "By Justin Luna Neowin LLC @_justinluna · 5 seconds ago Vindows Locker ransomware in action \nRansomware and tech support scams have never sounded like a good combination. However, these two things share something in common, the intent to extort money from innocent victims, usually by demanding large amounts of cash in exchange of 'fixing' the host's computer. Alarmingly enough, in today's connected world, we are seeing more of this, as cybercriminals start upping their game. \nDiscovered by Jakub Kroustek , reverse engineer and malware analyst over at Avast, Vindows Locker (not a typo) employs the use of technical support scams in order to demand the ransom from its victims. It will display the following ransom note, which includes a picture of an Indian tech scammer. \n\"this not microsoft vindows support we have locked your files with the zeus virus do one thing and call level 5 microsoft support technician at 1-844-609-3192 you will files back for a one time charge of $349.99\" \nIt will append a .vindows file extension to all the files it encrypts. If you call the number flashed on the screen, you will be connected to the said scammers in India, who claim that they are from Microsoft who will generously fix your problem. Unfortunately, the fraudsters have no real intention of helping you out. Instead, they are only requiring users to call, so they can collect personal and financial information, and eventually drain your hard-earned money. Payment form from the perpetrators \nTo make it look even more convincing, the scammers will open up a legitimate Microsoft support page once they have gained access to the victim's computer. However, once there, they will quickly paste a link on the address bar, which when opened will lead to a web form, which asks for credit card information. At this point, filling it out will give the scammers the money needed. The cybercriminals, however, will not do anything to save your files. \nFortunately, due to some inconsistencies and mistakes from the developers of the Vindows Locker ransomware, Malwarebytes Labs was able to develop an application, which can be downloaded here , to decrypt affected files. \nWhile this malware can easily be bypassed, the Vindows Locker is a representation of how tech support scams, together with ransomware is evolving together. With this in consideration, it remains important to pay attention to our activity on the internet, as well as the files we download, in order to save our computers from contracting such malevolent software in the future. \nSource and Images: Malwarebytes Labs Tags",

      "text": "\nTensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow v0.12.0 RC0 was released yesterday and it comes with major improvements including the support for Windows.\nTensorFlow now builds and runs on Microsoft Windows (tested on Windows 10, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2016). Supported languages include Python (via a pip package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently supported. The following ops are not currently implemented: DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma, Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool, QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat, QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool, QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape, QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\nTensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google’s Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.\nFind the full change log of this release here .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Reportedly Strengthening Cloud Alliances in China by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 28, 2016 Trades from $ 3 \nShares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT - Free Report ) have been steadily trending higher over the last one year. The stock generated a return of 9.10% as compared with the Zacks Computer-Software Industry’s year-to-date return of 10.17%. \nThe upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products are expected to generate top-line growth in 2016. \nPer a report published in the South China Morning Post , Microsoft is expanding in China by strengthening its bonds with Chinese businesses in the region. \nThe Current State of Affairs \nMicrosoft’s cloud platform Azure currently enjoys nearly 17% share of the cloud computing market in China, second only to Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s ( BABA - Free Report ) Alibaba Cloud. However, Microsoft believes that it can scale up its market share by making some strategic partnerships in the region. \nWe note that Microsoft introduced its business of cloud computing in China nearly two years ago. However, the company is gradually recognizing the importance of partnerships that cloud play a pivotal role in expanding its cloud business presence in the country. \nCurrently, Windows and Office remain Microsoft’s main revenue growth drivers. However, amid declining PC sales worldwide, the revenue stream could get adversely affected. The need of the hour is to diversify into other emerging sectors and Microsoft is doing just that. \nCloud Scope \nAs per an IDC report, worldwide public cloud services spending is estimated to reach a whopping $195 billion by 2020 growing at a CAGR of 20.4%. Given the huge growth prospects the segment offers, it’s no surprise that Microsoft is trying its level best to expand in the aforementioned field. \nMICROSOFT CORP Price \nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nAt present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). \nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Konami Holdings Corp. ( KNMCY - Free Report ) and Rosetta Stone Inc. ( RST - Free Report ) , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \nNotably, the consensus estimate for Konami Holdings’ current year improved to $1.59 from $1.39 over the last 30 days. \nThe consensus estimate for Rosetta’s current year narrowed down to a loss of $1.62 from a loss of $1.94 over the last 30 days. \nZacks’ Best Private Investment Ideas \nIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time? \nOur experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

      "title": "Xbox beat PlayStation as the top console on Black Friday in the U.S.",
      "text": "The holiday-shopping season has kicked off, and both Microsoft’s and Sony’s console brands are doing well.\nXbox was the fifth best-selling electronics brand on Black Friday, according to Adobe’s annual market-tracking data for the United States. It came in behind Apple iPads, Samsung’s 4K televisions, MacBook Airs, and LG’s TVs, but it also outperformed Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s 3DS and Wii U. That means that the Xbox One was likely the top-selling console in the U.S. on the day after American Thanksgiving, which is also one of the most important shopping days of the year. But while Microsoft may have outdone Sony on that day, the launch of the PlayStation 4 Pro earlier in November still has Sony ahead for November as a whole, according to Adobe.\nPlayStation 4 is still the best-selling product between the dates of November 1 and November 24. Xbox One is right behind it. When it comes to game sales, however, Nintendo is on top with Pokémon Sun and Moon. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Activision’s latest entry in its military-shooter franchise, follows Nintendo’s pocket monsters in second place.\nWhat this all adds up to is a ton of spending leading into the December gift-giving holidays — especially when it comes to online purchasing.\n“Shoppers hit the buy button at unprecedented levels as conversion rates were up nearly a full percent across all devices in the evening hours on Black Friday,” Adobe Digital Insights analyst and director Tamara Gaffney said in a statement. “With the full day total coming in at $3.34 billion, Black Friday may have just dethroned Cyber Monday’s position as largest online shopping day of the year.”\nThis spending is coming at the right time. Some analyst have expressed concerns that certain games aren’t selling well at traditional retailers due to the presidential election. But now, Adobe’s data suggests that digital and holiday shopping could make up that difference.\n",

      "text": "Pegatron Reportedly Working on Trial Production of Microsoft Surface Phones Reddit \nOne of Apple's major suppliers is reportedly getting ready with production trials of Microsoft's much-anticipated Surface phone. A China-based daily claims that Taiwan-based Pegatron will start trial production of Surface smartphone. Microsoft is rumoured to launch its Surface Phone in early 2017. \nThe report unfortunately doesn't get into specifics of the trial production of the Surface Phone. For those unaware, Taiwan's Pegatron is an Apple original design manufacturer (ODM). The report claims that Apple's order for iPhone accounts for nearly 60 percent of Pegatron's total sales. \nMicrosoft's Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella in a recent interview had assured the company's continued presence in the mobile space, he stated, \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" The Redmond giant has been rumoured to be working three Surface models targeted at regular consumer, business user, and enthusiast categories. Unfortunately, there have been no details about what features would separate the smartphones in the specific categories. The Surface Phones for the different categories are expected to vary based on processor, storage, and other features . The three Surface phones are also rumoured to be priced in different tiers and meant for different markets.\nA Microsoft executive earlier this year teased the Surface Phone saying that it will be a high-end version catering to the enterprise market and will be 'category innovating' . \nSome reports have pointed that the delay in the launch of the Surface Phones has been caused due to developments in Windows 10 Mobile OS. Late last year, the Microsoft CMO tipped the company was developing a 'breakthrough' Surface Phone .",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Phone ready for testing ahead of potential 2017, early 2018 launch: Report",
      "text": "> Microsoft Surface Phone ready for testing ahead of potential 2017, early 2018 launch: Report Microsoft Surface Phone ready for testing ahead of potential 2017, early 2018 launch: Report The long rumored Microsoft Surface Phone could finally be in the works as the latest reports say that it is ready for tests. News \nMicrosoft ’s Surface Phone has turned into a mythical creature as it’s been in the news since 2012 but there is still no sight of it. Recent reports suggest that Microsoft will finally launch its Surface Phone in 2017. At this year’s Microsoft Windows 10 event, there was still an expectation that the Surface Phone would be launched. Now, a new report shows some development on the Surface Phone, claiming that Chinese ODM Pegatron is set to begin testing Microsoft’s Surface Phone. \nThis news comes from a report by Taiwan’s Commercial Times , which says that Microsoft will launch the Surface Phone sometime in 2017 or early 2018. The report says that Pegatron, which also happens to be one of the main suppliers for Apple, is working on the Surface Phone. It has already worked with Microsoft in producing devices such as the Surface Pro 2 and the recently launched Surface all-in-one PC. The report doesn’t come as a surprise, and this could mean that the Microsoft Surface Phone could finally be a finished product. Microsoft’s Surface Phone has been creating a lot of buzz and anticipation as it is said to stand out among smartphones. From what we’ve heard so far, the Surface Phone is said to run an Intel-based chipset and will also run x86 applications in Continuum. \nThis report comes just a few days after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a daring statement about the Surface Phone – “We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI. We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” All this points out to the launch of the Surface Phone, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves as there still isn’t a definite date for the purpose. \nUp until now, nothing definite has been reported about the Surface Phone but its leaked renders have been posted online and also its specifications. Reliable leakster Evan Blass had tweeted some photos of the alleged Surface Phone which included someone actually using the phone. Looking at the images, the Surface Phone’s design looks do not seem to stand out as such. The rest of the images followed include the Surface Phone being used to click photos, using Maps and reading documents. However, its authenticity cannot be verified yet. Powered by a laptop-class Intel processor, would this have blown your mind? pic.twitter.com/0n2yZPvU65 \n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) November 4, 2016 \nPrevious reports about the Microsoft Surface Phone suggest that it could be launched in three different configurations. One variant would be focused on general customers, one for enthusiasts or ‘prosumers’ (geeks) and the third variant would be targeted at enterprise customers. Either one or all Surface Phone models could also support the Microsoft Pen technology. ALSO READ: Microsoft Surface Phone may launch next year, likely to be available in 3 variants: Report \nRegarding the specifications about the Surface Phone, it could feature a 5.5-inch QHD (1440×2560 pixels) AMOLED display. The Surface Phone could be powered by Intel’s Atom X3 64-bit chipset paired with 4GB of RAM, and come with 64GB or 128GB storage options along with microSD card support for up to 256GB. For photography, the Surface Phone could sport a 21-megapixel rear camera with PureView lens and an 8-megapixel selfie camera. Connectivity options on the smartphone could include USB Type-C, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS and support for wireless charging.

      "text": "\nLast month, Microsoft announced Teams, a new chat-based workspace for Office 365 users. Teams can be accessed via the web, desktop and mobile apps. I recently noticed that many Office 365 consumers are facing difficulties in loading Teams when they are using their corporate networks. When they launch Teams desktop app or Teams service on a browser, they are able to successfully authenticate and the above ‘Loading Microsoft Teams’ image appears. After some time, they are presented with the error message: Doh! Something went wrong.\n\nHere’s the reason behind this error, Microsoft Teams is based on the consumer version of Skype, not Skype for Business. It makes use of various *.skype.com URLs for loading components, etc. Since most of the corporate networks have blocked *.skype.com domain, Microsoft Teams is not loading even after successful authentication. In this case, IT administrators need to do additional configuration work, such as updating firewall policies, to ensure employees can fully use Microsoft Teams.\nIf you’re the IT admin, here’s the information you need to enable the app and configure things correctly. For additional information to set up and configure everything you need to run Microsoft Teams.\nVisit FAQ article for IT admins Check out the training videos available at the Microsoft Virtual Academy See the list of IP URLS and IP address ranges for Microsoft Teams Instead of asking all the IT Admins to allow Microsoft Teams through their networks, I think Microsoft should start using Skype for Business URLs for Microsoft Teams so that millions of users under corporate networks can access it without any issues.",

      "text": "News Hololens Japan To Join The HoloLens Party As Microsoft Announces Pre-Orders Japan becomes the first Asian country to be able to get their hands on Microsoft's mixed reality HMD.   Kevin Eva \nMicrosoft might well be preparing to launch an array of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) onto the market, but they’re not neglecting their first creation either. \nAlready due to receive a Microsoft Windows 10 update early next year (the Windows 10 Creator Update ) which will lead to the greater integration and the addition of a number of new VR and mixed reality (MR) features; Including a future iteration of classic Microsoft utility program Paint called Paint 3D which is set to add HoloLens functionality and more. Microsoft are also looking to move the device into more markets. \nInitially announced back in January 2015 , Microsoft confirmed last week that Hololens would begin shipping to the UK this week, and today it has announced that Japan is joining Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Ireland , Japan , New Zealand and the USA as places where HoloLens will be sold with Japanese pre-orders going live on Friday, December 2nd 2016 exclusively via the Japanese version of the Microsoft Store . Shipping is set to begin in “early 2017”. \nAlready working with partners such as Japan Airlines, SAAB , Volvo and NASA , Microsoft has big plans for the device as Microsoft Windows and Devices Group fellow Alex Kipman explains. \n“Our mission at Microsoft is to bring mixed reality to every person and organization on the planet. Since January 2015 we have been hard at work to bring the vision of mixed reality to life. It has been inspiring to see what has been created by our partners, and the team remains in awe of the way developers are using HoloLens. We can’t wait to see what everyone in Japan creates when they get their hands on HoloLens.” \nWhat does 2017 hold for the Microsoft HoloLens? Stay with VRFocus to find out. \n ",

      "text": "Microsoft and Newspaper Giving Away Windows 10 Tablets (With a Catch) GO Buy a subscription, get a Windows 10 tablet for free Nov 29, 2016 09:49 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Pioneer News Group, a Seattle-based company that owns several newspapers, is offering free Windows 10 tablets to subscribers, after previously collaborating with Microsoft on developing a special newspaper reading app that’s installed on these devices. Pioneer is the company behind 23 daily and weekly newspapers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah, and is giving customers paying $15 a month for a one-year digital subscription a free Windows 10 tablet to read news easier. The application that’s being installed on Windows 10 tablets is called uReporter and is already available for download from the Store, but according to Pioneer, it will also be released on Android and iOS. Program to be expanded in 2017 And it turns out that this campaign is already successful, as many readers who were paying for a subscription decided to switch to the digital world with a free Windows 10 tablet. “In the first few weeks, readers of the Skagit Valley Herald in Mount Vernon, Washington – the first Pioneer paper to offer the system – bought a few dozen tablets and downloaded the app on several hundred devices, even before full marketing efforts had kicked in,” the company explained. The news app is currently available in three markets and the tablets are offered only in two, but an expansion is very likely to be announced soon, as the company is still exploring its options for 2017. “So far, Pioneer is offering the apps in three of its markets, and it’s selling tablets in two. Initially, direct ads have targeted former subscribers – folks who canceled in recent years because they didn’t have time to read and the papers kept stacking up. Pioneer will assess progress in early 2017 and decide whether to scale up or pivot, Johnston says,” Microsoft pointed out in a blog today . There are no details as to what devices the newspaper is giving away, but they all come with an 8-inch display. A closer look at these devices is available with the high-res photo attached to the article.",

      "text": "Microsoft Explains How It Embraces Apple’s iOS CallKit on iPhones GO Skype for Business taking advantage of the CallKit framework Nov 29, 2016 09:26 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: It’s no surprise that Microsoft is trying to make the most of Apple’s latest iOS features to promote its services, and the CallKit framework integrated into iOS 10 makes no exception. In a blog post today, the software giant explains how it uses CallKit to make Skype for Business easily accessible to its customers on iPhones, as this new tech allows applications to handle calls from the lock screen or from the call screen just like the default phone app. For example, Skype for Business customers can now answer calls straight from the lock screen, but also to toggle between Skype and cellular calls from the calling interface. “iPhone users can accept an incoming Skype for Business call right from the lock screen. There is no need to unlock the phone or launch the Skype for Business app to receive the call,” Microsoft explains. “Skype for Business calls will appear and behave just as regular cellular calls do—including being able to see the caller’s name on the lock screen. When you need to, you can also get to the app from the calling interface with just one touch.” Enabled by default CallKit integration makes it possible for users to switch from Skype for Business to cellular lines and to other VoIP application that support the framework, and you can see all information from Skype right in your phone’s call history. It goes without saying that in order to benefit from all these features you must be running the latest iOS version, as well as the fully updated Skype for Business client for iOS. These features come enabled by default in iOS, but if you don’t want to use them, you can head to the Settings screen and disable mobile integration for Skype. IT admins can also block this integration with a special policy, the company says.",

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday Azure customer saves Microsoft from an RHEL disaster Were it not for an alert customer, attackers could have compromised every RHEL instance on Microsoft Azure due to improper configuration of Red Hat Update Appliances InfoWorld | Nov 29, 2016 Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nBroken authentication, improperly secured configuration files, and poor certificate management: Attackers could have exploited these issues to compromise any RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) instance on Microsoft Azure. \nIan Duffy , an Irish software engineer with the e-commerce company Zalando, discovered these flaws when creating a machine image of RHEL that was compliant with the Security Technical Implementation Guide defined by the Department of Defense. Microsoft has since fixed these problems, but they offer an object lesson in the hazards of poorly implemented cloud security . [ Deep Dive: How to rethink security for the new world of IT . | Discover how to secure your systems with InfoWorld's Security Report newsletter . ] \nThe client configuration files in Azure's Red Hat Package Manager contain build host information that could be used to discover all of Azure's Red Hat Update Appliances, Duffy said. The Red Hat Update Appliance is part of the Red Hat Update Infrastructure, which lets cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services run local yum repositories, instead of having individual RHEL instances connect to Red Hat servers every time they need to update a package or install a new application. \nBoth Azure and AWS manage a Red Hat Update Appliance for each region, and each RHEL instance connects to the region's appliance when running yum to install or update packages. Duffy found it was possible to discover all of Azure's Red Hat Update Appliances and gain administrator access in order to upload compromised packages to the servers. Attackers could gain control over all Azure RHEL instances that executed yum against the compromised appliance and received the tampered files. \n\"In theory ... one could have gained root access to all virtual machines consuming the repositories by releasing an updated version of a common package and waiting for virtual machines to execute yum update,\" said Duffy. Exposed update servers \nDuffy was trying to create a secure RHEL image that could be used on Azure and AWS when he uncovered the configuration files and the Red Hat Update Appliances. All the servers were exposing their REST APIs over HTTPS. An application called rhui-monitor.cloudapp.net running on port 8080 (rhui-monitor.cloudapp.net is included in the PrepareRHUI package that runs on all Azure RHEL instances) let him look into the archives containing logs, more configuration files, and the SSL certificates granting full administrative access to the Red Hat Update Appliances. \nThough the application required username and password authentication, Duffy found it was possible to run a back-end log collector and obtain the URLs to the archives without any credentials. \nThe SSL certificates were the same for every instance, and it was possible to copy the SSL certificates from one RHEL instance to another on Azure and still authenticate on the appliance, Duffy found. This wasn't the case with AWS, as the instance also needed to boot from a correctly configured Amazon Machine Image (AMI) before it could use the SSL certificate. \nMicrosoft immediately took steps to prevent public access to rhui-monitor.cloudapp.net and the Red Hat Update Appliances. The company told Duffy it has rotated all secrets, so even if the certificates had been maliciously copied, the attackers would no longer be able to access the appliances in this manner. \nThe appliances were exposing their REST APIs over HTTPS, which meant attackers with full administrator access could upload their own packages into the appliance. Any RHEL instance on Azure running yum to obtain a package with that same name would automatically receive that modified package, not the official one served by Red Hat. All Azure RHEL images are configured without GPG validation checks, so clients built off that image would not be able to tell the package had been tampered with. \nSince the packages frequently execute as root, the attacker would gain full control over the RHEL instance. A specially crafted package capable of encrypting the entire virtual machine could lead to a ransomware attack on a massive scale. Or vandals could take over every RHEL instance for fun. \n\"[Compromising updates] would just be a case of bumping the version number and releasing a package under the same name,\" Duffy said. Exposed storage accounts \nThe issue with the update appliances would have given attackers access to every compromised RHEL instance on Azure, but a different vulnerability within the mandatory Microsoft Azure Linux Agent (WaLinuxAgent) would have had a \"much more widespread\" impact, Duffy said. \nThe Red Hat Enterprise Linux image available on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace had a vulnerable version of WaLinuxAgent that exposed the administrator API keys for the storage account used by the virtual machine. With the API key, the attacker could download virtual hard disks for any RHEL instances using that storage account. Since multiple virtual machines shared a single storage account, an attacker could download multiple virtual hard disks at a time. \nAzure administrators should check to make sure they aren't using RHEL image with the vulnerable agent, WaLinuxAgent 2.0.16. Shared responsibility on the cloud \nMicrosoft has clearly spelled out the expectations for securing its cloud platforms in the Shared Responsibilities for Cloud Computing and Microsoft Azure Security Response in the Cloud whitepapers. Microsoft will take care of all the security for its buildings, servers, networking hardware, and the hypervisor for organizations using Azure for IaaS. The operating system, network configuration, applications, identity management, client security, and data remain under IT control. \nIn this case, because the issue lay with the fact that the appliances and applications were publicly accessible, the fix was Microsoft's responsibility. However, that doesn't absolve IT administrators from regularly monitoring the instances for unusual activity or checking what packages are being installed on their machines. Just because the provider is responsible for that portion of cloud security doesn't mean IT administrators can ease their vigilance. To   Related:",

      "text": "Software Microsoft Office 365 is suffering from the dreaded feature creep Microsoft continues to add more apps to Office 365, but it may be time to ask whether the app deluge is more harmful than helpful. By Mark Kaelin | November 29, 2016, 4:12 AM PST Google Plus \nImage: iStockphoto.com/g-stockstudio \nMicrosoft Office 365 is (and you can argue this point if you wish) the standard by which all other productivity suites are measured. Sure, there is competition from Google Apps and the like, but they all play second fiddle to Office 365. \nOffice 365 offers enterprise users just about every software application that they could want and more. However, that may be where we run into a bit of a problem. Microsoft may have given enterprises too many applications. When does too much of a good thing become a bad thing? Counting apps Want more about Windows? Read more \nAs someone who has spent years writing about technology and software, having a multitude of applications in my productivity suite is perfectly okay with me. It just means there is more to think about, write about, and complain about. But I am far from a normal enterprise user. \nMost users, especially those working in a large enterprise setting, just use the tools they need to perform their job. All the other applications available to them are often considered clutter they have to work around to get to the tools they actually need. So the question is, has Microsoft created a productivity suite in Office 365 that is mostly clutter? SEE: Microsoft launches Teams, goes to war with chat giant Slack \nThe screenshot below shows my installation of Office 365 Business Premium . Notice how many icons are listed on my Home tab. Also, take note of how many third-party Office 365 apps are available to me. There is even an app that makes it easy for me to schedule meetings at Starbucks. Do we really need that? \nOffice 365 is starting to suffer from feature creep and application redundancy. For example, there are at least four presentation applications listed in the current Office 365 Business Premium Home tab: PowerPoint, Sway, Delve, and Stream. Each has its own merits and perhaps even its own niche, but are all four apps really necessary? SEE: Microsoft custom tailors Office 365 and Azure cloud for Department of Defense Bottom line \nUnder CEO Satya Nadella's leadership , Microsoft has emphasized over and over again that it wants to create software for a cloud-based enterprise workforce—a workforce that relies on mobility and collaboration to get its work done. That sounds great and is welcomed by a large percentage of the target market. \nHowever, I can see the number of available apps in an Office 365 subscription quickly becoming more distracting than helpful. Microsoft has reached a turning point in Office 365 development. Adding more applications to the suite could be counterproductive and do more harm than good. \nI am not suggesting that Microsoft remove any applications from Office 365. In fact, I feel relatively certain that many younger users like and expect a plethora of software choices. Trying new applications and throwing out old ones is what they are used to and, frankly, it is how enterprises will get the best out of their younger workforce. \nBut for the more task-oriented, \"This is my job and these are my tools\" crowd, Microsoft has crossed into the realm of distracting clutter when it comes to Office 365 apps. Personally, I would like to see Microsoft spend some resources developing better administrative tools for Office 365 so enterprises can get control of feature creep and reduce the chaos of what has become a messy suite of productivity tools.

How to remove a Vindows infection In case the victim indeed calls the phone number, the fake Microsoft engineer recommends fixes that are available for $350 and in exchange opens forms on the victim’s computer that ask for personal details and credit card information. “To trick users, the technician opens up the real Microsoft support page and quickly pastes a shortened URL in the address bar. This redirects to the payment page which is actually a custom web form, powered by JotForm, a legitimate online form builder. If you proceed to fill in your information, you will be giving your hardearned cash to a bunch of online crooks who will never retrieve your files anyway,” Malwarebytes explains. The security firm has also developed a dedicated tool to remove the ransomware should your computer be infected, and you can download it here .

      "title": "Microsoft Readying New Mobile Device Push in 2017, Reports Say",
      "text": "Rather than abandon it's struggling mobile phone business news leaks suggest the company is preparing new models for release in late 2017. Microsoft may be following BlackBerry into smartphone obscurity, but the Redmond, Wash., software giant refuses to give up. Windows clings to a scant 0.4 percent of the smartphone   market, according to Gartner's latest analysis . Microsoft's mobile OS ran on fewer than 1.5 million of the total 373 million smartphones sold worldwide in the third quarter of 2016. During the same quarter a year ago, Microsoft claimed sales of nearly 5.9 million Windows smartphones for a 1.7-percent share of the overall market. Instead of throwing in the towel, news leaks suggest that Microsoft is making a renewed push to challenge the galaxy of Android devices and Apple iPhones that currently dominate the smartphone market. Nokia Power User is reporting that Microsoft is readying a late-2017 Surface Phone launch. Judging by an early prototype, the device will sport a Snapdragon 835 processor and 6 GB of RAM.Intriguingly, the smartphone is said to be able to run x86 applications in Continuum, a mode-switching technology present in Windows smartphones, like HP's Elite x3 handset. Continuum delivers a desktop-like experience, complete with mouse and keyboard support, when connected to compatible docks, accessories and displays.Eagle-eyed members of the Windows Insider early-access program have spotted possible evidence that Microsoft is working on x86-on-ARM64 emulation technology for its upcoming Windows 10 \"Redstone 3\" update. If successful, it will essentially enable ARM-based Windows devices to run x86 software, potentially allowing users to use full-featured Windows applications in Continuum mode. So far, Microsoft has been able to install x86 apps using the emulation technology, but hasn't yet been able to successfully run them, according to the report. Another early prototype sports just 4GB of RAM and runs a version of Windows 10 mobile that doesn't support x86 Windows apps. Other features include Quick Charge 4.0 support and an estimated 5.5-inch QHD (quad high definition) screen. Meanwhile, Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, has been signaling that his company is taking a step back from the consumer smartphone market and instead is focusing on productivity, security and device management for its next round of mobile devices. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,\" Nadella recently told The Australian Financial Review . Microsoft's checkered smartphone past includes the ill-fated acquisition of Nokia's Devices and Services business, initiated in 2013 by Nadella's predecessor, Steve Ballmer. In the summer of 2015, the company took a massive write-off related to the deal. With what's left of the Nokia handset business, Microsoft has \"stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of,\" added Nadella.",

      "text": "A family inside the Mary’s Place Family Center in North Seattle. (Starbucks Photo / Joshua Trujillo) Starbucks, Microsoft, Alaska Airlines, Expedia, Nordstrom and other businesses in the Seattle region announced contributions totaling more than $3 million to shelter homeless families in King County through the annual “No Child Sleeps Outside” campaign by the nonprofit Mary’s Place.\nThe initiative, described as “an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community,” will support an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place to shelter more homeless families, the companies said in their announcement this morning. They cited a 20 percent increase in the homeless count last year in the city.\n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in a statement. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.”\nThe Starbucks Foundation and the Schultz Family Foundation (co-founded by Howard and Sheri Schultz) will contribute $1 million each to the initiative. In addition, the Starbucks Foundation will match customer donations at 200 stores in the county up to an additional $1 million. Microsoft says it’s also pledging $1 million to address homelessness in King County, including a $250,000 contribution to Mary’s Place.\n“We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing,” said Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement.\nOthers listed as taking part include Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association.\nAmazon isn’t listed as taking part in the effort, but the company and its founder Jeff Bezos have separately supported Mary’s Place financially and provided the organization with a temporary shelter facility on an Amazon-owned property in Seattle.\nIn addition to funding additional emergency announcement, the companies voiced support for Seattle Mayor Ed Murray’s Pathways Home initiative , a longer-term strategy to address the homeless crisis.",

      "text": "COMMENTS SteveÂ Granitz/WireImage Idina Menzel attends the 2016 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on Nov.Â 20, 2016 in Los Angeles. \nLifetime has finally unleashed the first trailer for its remake of the 1988 weepy melodrama Beaches starring Idina Menzel as C.C. and Nia Long as Hillary. In the clip the pair meet as children and pose in a photo booth before we see them as adults, with Menzel taking on the role of an aspiring singer originally played by Bette Midler role and Long playing the supportive best friend character and lawyer, (who, spoiler alert, has a deadly disease) first played by Barbara Hershey. \nLike the original, the remake -- which will air on Jan. 21 at 8 p.m. ET -- chronicles the pair's 30-year friendship and, of course, will feature Menzel's updated cover of the titanic ballad \"Wind Beneath My Wings.\" Midler had one of the biggest hits of her career with the song, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1989 and scooped up Record and Song of the Year at the 1990 Grammy Awards. The other best-known song from the flick, \"The Glory of Love,\" will also be featured in the update. \nWatch the trailer:",

      "text": " 00 AM EST HyperGrid Offering Accelerates App Migration to Microsoft Azure HyperCloud's DevOps and Cloud Automation platform simply enables the ability to \"lift, containerize and shift\" applications to Azure -- start now with no charge, pilot program \nMOUNTAIN VIEW, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/29/16 -- HyperGrid , an application delivery platform that solves the key challenges of DevOps for enterprises, today announced the immediate availability of core HyperCloud capabilities in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. HyperCloud was recently announced as a hybrid cloud service that offers application, platform and infrastructure services to accelerate transformation and delivery of business applications that drive innovation and competitive advantage. \nHyperForm, the core DevOps and Cloud Automation engine in HyperCloud, is now available in the Azure Marketplace. HyperForm drives business innovation by modernizing existing legacy applications without making a single code change and using the existing skill sets within an organization. On-the-fly containerization capabilities allow users to \"lift and shift\" existing Java and .NET applications to containers while taking care of the complex application dependencies, automatic service discovery, auto scaling and integration with any external service (e.g. storage, networking, logging, etc.). HyperForm transforms non-cloud native legacy applications into portable applications that benefit from the auto scaling and deployment agility on Azure. \nFor many IT organizations that inherit legacy applications, the task of modernizing these applications while avoiding application code changes becomes overwhelming. Organizations that are looking for an infrastructure target to \"Lift, Containerize and Shift\" their existing applications before migrating to Azure can use HyperCloud's software-defined infrastructure platform to deliver true cloud agility and economics inside their datacenter. HyperCloud drives your application migration efforts to Azure, providing a full scale-out infrastructure platform to your datacenter as a service with no CapEx and using a pay-as-you-go model.

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio Desktop PC Teardown By iFixit 1:59 pm By Julian Horsey \nThe team over at iFixit have wasted no time taking their tools to the new Microsoft Surface Studio and have today published their in-depth teardown revealing the inner workings of the new desktop computer which was unveiled by Microsoft late last month. \nMicrosoft describes the new Surface Studio desktop PC is a system that transforms your desk into a creative studio offering you a powerful digital canvas and providing a more natural and immersive way to draw, design and work. Specifications of the Microsoft Surface Studio include : \n– 28-inch adjustable PixelSense Display with 4500 x 3000 resolution (192 DPI)—supporting sRGB, DCI-P3, and Vivid color profiles, plus 10-point multi-touch – 6th-Generation Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU with 8 GB, 16 GB, and 32 GB RAM configuration options – NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M GPU (paired with 2 GB GDDR5) or GTX 980M (paired with 4 GB GDDR5) – 1 TB and 2 TB hybrid storage options – 802.11ac Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.0 / Xbox Wireless built-in – Supports Surface Pen and Surface Dial \nAfter taking their tools to the new Microsoft Surface Studio desktop PC iFixit have awarded the new Microsoft computer with a repair ability score of 5. With 10 being the easiest to repair. Points they noted during the teardown include : \n– The base is easy to open and home to several modular components—including the standard SATA hard drive and M.2 SSD—that can be replaced without disassembling the display.– The entire display assembly can be replaced as a piece, without dismantling the display or the base.– The RAM, CPU, and GPU are soldered to the board and cannot be upgraded. You may want to think twice about that 8 GB configuration.– A few components embedded in the display (buttons, front sensors, and speakers) will be difficult to replace if they fail. \nFor the full teardown jump over to the iFixit website via the link below.",

      "text": "Microsoft started shipping Surface Studio orders a little earlier than expected last week, which means iFixit has started tearing down the all-in-one PC. As this is a computer, there aren’t too many surprises to be found, but the teardown does reveal a few things about Microsoft’s approach to this unusual PC. The first is a noteworthy ARM chip found lurking behind the 28-inch display. iFixit doesn’t explain the presence of an ARM chip on an Intel-powered x86 PC, but the processor is actually present to help power Microsoft’s PixelSense display.\nElsewhere, iFixit also reveals just how upgradeable the Surface Studio is, and it’s not good news if you were hoping to upgrade to the latest and greatest hardware in the future. Microsoft has soldered the RAM, CPU, and GPU to the motherboard, so the configuration cannot be changed down the line. However, you can replace the hybrid drive (SSD and HDD) without disassembling the display, as the components are housed in the base. iFixit rates the Surface Studio as 5 out of 10 on the reparability scale, the same score as Apple’s 5K iMac .",

      "text": "Read Comments Microsoft Surface Phone: Everything you need to know \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone is long-awaited, and desperately needed. Here’s what we know about the Microsoft Surface Phone release date, specs, features, price and more. \nMicrosoft has had very limited success with mobile, struggling to acquire any meaningful amount of market share. With titans like Apple and Google currently dominating the industry, Microsoft is under immense pressure to crack mobile successfully. \nUnfortunately, the Surface Phone will probably be the last roll of the dice for Microsoft. Despite the company making much of Windows 10 Mobile, the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL weren’t able to carry Microsoft to mobile glory. Now, Microsoft needs to launch a perfect phone that can convert already invested iOS and Android users to Windows. \nThe Surface team has done a great job of disrupting the computing industry in recent years, with the Surface Pro , Surface Book and Surface Studio devices all proving to be a thorn in the backside of Apple. Can the Surface Phone do the same for mobile? Read on to find out what we know so far. Latest Surface Phone News: \nWhat is the Surface Phone release date? First half of 2017 (possibly) \nHow much will the Surface Phone cost? $699 - $1,100 (£499-£799) approx. \nWhat’s new about the Surface Phone? Rumoured: Three variants, Snapdragon 835 CPU, 5.7-inch display \nWatch Now: Microsoft Surface Studio – First Look \nRelated: Samsung Galaxy S8 Microsoft Surface Phone Release Date UK & US – When will the Surface Phone come out? \nWe can’t say for sure when the Surface Phone is going to come out, but we know that it’s on the way. In November, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the Australia Financial Review that Microsoft is working on the “ultimate mobile device”, admitting that the company “missed the mobile boom”. That’s not confirmation of the \"Surface Phone\" name, but it’s clear-cut proof that a new mobile device is on the way. \nDuring the interview, Nadella explained: “ We will continue to be in the phone market, not as defined by today’s market leaders , but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” \nBut that’s not the only evidence we have. Back in January, it emerged that Microsoft had obtained the following domain name: surfacephone.com. The domain currently redirects to Microsoft’s homepage, but given Microsoft’s existing naming conventions for devices (Surface Book, Surface Pro, etc), it seems obvious what the intentions may be. That said, companies often buy up relevant domain names just to stop competitors bagging them, so the name \"Surface Phone\" may never actually be used. \nAccording to Winbeta, Microsoft plans to finally kill off the Lumia brand – the current Microsoft phone line, formerly of Nokia – in December 2016. That means we’d likely see a Surface Phone that same month, or very shortly afterwards. \nMicrosoft hasn’t announced any press events for such a device, but it’s likely that the company will be attending the CES 2017 tradeshow in Las Vegas in early January next year. That would be a perfect opportunity to launch a new device, although it would mean missing the Christmas spending season. \nIn any case, we’re in agreement with the lion’s share of rumours that suggest we’ll see a Q1/Q2 release in 2017. Microsoft Surface Phone Features – What’s new about the Surface Phone? \nSo we’re all agreed that Microsoft can’t screw this one up, right? Well, it’ll need solid hardware and compelling software to dethrone Apple, Google et al . Here’s what you can expect to see from the Microsoft Surface Phone... Microsoft Surface Phone Design – All-metal, three variants \nRumour has it that the Microsoft Surface Phone will be available in three distinct variants. One report suggests these will be as follows: Consumer Edition, Business Edition, and Enthusiast Edition. So we’re guessing the first will be a reasonably priced flagship, the second will be a BlackBerry replacement, and the third will be a power user device, just like Samsung’s Galaxy Note phones (minus explosions, hopefully). We’ve got no idea if they’ll look any different physically, or if we’re just talking about spec changes, however. \nThe other design rumour is that we’ll see a new all-metal aesthetic adopted, to bring the phone series in line with Microsoft’s Surface Book. Microsoft has reportedly been hard at work to make sure the Surface Phone fits with other Surface devices, and sports the same premium finish you’d expect from the Surface series. \nRelated: iPhone 8 Microsoft Surface Phone Specs – 5.7-inch screen, Snapdragon 835 chip? \nAs I mentioned earlier, we’re expecting three distinct Surface Phone models. Usually, that would mean we’d expect to see three different screen sizes, but leaks thus far suggest all variants will use a 5.7-inch display. \nInstead, the differences will reportedly come in the form of storage and memory upgrades, as follows: \nVersion 1: 3GB RAM / 32GB storage Version 2: 6GB RAM / 128GB storage Version 3: 8GB RAM / 500GB storage \nNow that final version sounds ludicrous, frankly. But this year, we saw Apple introduce a 256GB iPhone 7 Plus , as well as the OnePlus launch of the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T , both of which feature 6GB of RAM. So there’s no real reason why Microsoft couldn’t match such valiant efforts. After all, if Microsoft is hoping to woo business and power users, it’ll need to kit its phones out with the very best components available. \nAnd on that note, it’s highly likely that the Microsoft Surface Phone will come packing Qualcomm’s brand-new Snapdragon 835 chipset. The new chip is set to appear on smartphones early next year, and is a direct sequel to the top-end Snapdragon 820 and 821 chips, which featured in the Galaxy S8, OnePlus 3T, and Google Pixel phones. \nWhat’s exciting about the chip is that it’s Qualcomm’s first 10nm processor, which means it’s significantly more efficient than the old 16nm Snapdragon 820. Qualcomm reckons we’ll see either 40% lower power consumption or 27% higher performance, depending on what manufacturers do with the new Snapdragon 835. If Microsoft wants to go big with the Surface Phone, it’ll need to come packing this chip. \nUnfortunately, we don’t know much else about the Surface Phone in terms of hardware. There have been zero camera leaks, although we’d expect big things from the Surface Phone camera. For a start, Apple, LG, and Huawei have all shipped phones with dual-camera configurations, and Samsung is expected to follow suit next year. So Microsoft is as likely as anyone to utilise similar technology. \nBut it would also seem appropriate if the Surface Phone had some kind of Intel RealSense arrangement that could capture 3D images. After all, Microsoft has made much of HoloLens and Windows Holographic, so being able to capture and import 3D images onto Windows using your smartphone would make complete sense. We’d be very surprised if this wasn’t a feature, but we’ve heard no rumours supporting it – yet. \nRelated: Google Pixel XL review Microsoft Surface Phone Software – Windows 10, Microsoft Wallet, Continuum \nOne thing you can count on is that the Microsoft Surface Phone will run on Windows 10. Microsoft wants Windows 10 to be the “last version of Windows”, and will keep updating it across all platforms. That means Windows 10 Mobile isn’t going away any time soon, despite its limited success. If Microsoft wants to really push Windows 10 to the fore, it will need a great device to carry it there – specifically, the Surface Phone. \nWe’re not exactly sure what changes Microsoft plans to make to Windows 10 to accommodate a new Surface Phone, however. Rumours suggest that Continuum – Microsoft’s cross-platform productivity feature – will play a bigger role on mobile, while another source says we’ll see a new Microsoft Wallet mobile payments system introduced to compete with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay. Microsoft Surface Phone Price – Post-referendum price hike? \nUnless we’re very fortunate with a leak, there’s pretty much no way of knowing how much Microsoft plans to sell the Surface Phone for. \nWe’ve seen one report already, courtesy of the Bitbag, which claims Microsoft will kick off pricing from $699, with a top-end model costing as much as $1,099. At the time, that worked out to around £485 to £765, before VAT is added – so we’d expected prices closer to £499-£799 in the UK. That said, with post-referendum currency fluctuations in mind, we could see far higher prices – think closer to £599 and beyond. \nMost flagship smartphones these days typically start between £500 and £600, with super-premium models going for £900 and above. So expect something in that region, realistically. Should I wait for the Microsoft Surface Phone? \nWe’d only recommend waiting around the the Surface Phone if you have the utmost faith in Microsoft. The company has a proven track record of failure in mobile, so it’s hard for us to believe Microsoft’s next smartphone effort will be any better than previous attempts. \nIt’s also worth noting that there are already plenty of great smartphones to choose from right now. Apple fans may have been swayed by the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, while we’re quite keen on Android flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S7, Google Pixel , and OnePlus 3T. \nAnd don’t forget that early next year, we’re expecting to see the Samsung Galaxy S8 , LG G6 and the much-hyped iPhone 8 – although that’s still nearly a year off. \nIf you’re definitely set on getting a Windows 10 smartphone, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t wait to see what Microsoft is cooking up à la the Surface Phone. But otherwise, we’d recommend just buying one of the many great phones that 2016 has graced us with. \nWatch: Microsoft Surface Keynote Recap \nWhat would you like to see from Microsoft's next smartphone?

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio teardown reveals storage is upgradable, nothing else is 11/29/2016 by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nThe Microsoft Surface Studio is an all-in-one desktop computer with support for pen input and an adjustable 28 inch display that allows you to tilt the screen so that it becomes a surface for writing, drawing, or other surface work that would normally require a separate graphics tablet. It’s a high-end computer with a starting price of $2,999 for a model with an Intel Core i5 processor, NVIDIA graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. \nBut what if you want to buy an entry-level model today and upgrade it later? It turns out your options are limited. \nThe folks at iFixit have posted a teardown of the Surface Studio , and it reveals that the storage is the only thing that’s easy to upgrade or replace. \nThat’s because the RAM, CPU, and graphics processor are all soldered to the motherboard but there are standard 2.5 inch hard drive/SSD and M.2 SSD slots for storage. \nSo if you buy a model with 1TB of storage and decide you want to upgrade to a larger SSD in the future, you can do that. But if you buy a model with 8GB of RAM, that’s all you’re ever going to get. Given the high cost of this computer, that seems like a bad idea. If you’re willing to spend $2,999 on a Surface Studio, you might want to save up until you can afford the 16GB or 32GB models with Core i7 chips, which sell for $3,499 and $4,199, respectively. \nThe iFixit teardown notes that the SATA hard drive and M.2 SSD are both in the base of the desktop, which means they can be accessed without disassembling the display. If there is a problem with the display assembly, it can also be repaired or replaced without opening the base. \nBut generally speaking, this is a what-you-buy-is-what-you-get kind of computer, much like many recent high-end PCs.

      "text": "\niFixit has posted their usual teardown of new devices, with the new Microsoft Surface Studio being the target this time around.\nThe teardown doesn’t reveal much that we couldn’t glean from the specs with one exception. There’s an ARM Chip revealed behind the display of the Surface Studio, the Verge explains that this hidden chip is part of the magic which powers the Surface Studio’s magnificent screen.\nAside from that, the Surface Studio is exactly how you would expect. It is not very upgradeable as many of its parts are soldered on. If you’re they type that likes to replace you7r RAM, CPU and GPU, you’ll quickly find that you would not be able to on this tightly put together All in One. As Microsoft’s Surface Studio ships with year old Intel processors, buyers who are enamoured with having the latest and greatest processors should fully assess the tradeoffs of their purchase.\nOverall, iFixit awarded the Studio with a repairability score of 6, marking it as “average” to repair. This is because the flat base and display assembly can easily be opened and replaced. In addition to this, the Base also houses the hard drive and SSD which allows users to replace those without needing to take the entire device apart. That – taken in account with the un upgradeability of the base was how the firm reached its conclusion.\nWoud you be getting a Surface Studio? Let us know in the comments below.",

      "title": "Bentley Systems to Co-sponsor EFCG’s 2nd Annual A/E/C CIO Conference with Microsoft",
      "text": "Blog This \nBentley Systems, Incorporated, a leading global provider of comprehensive software solutions for advancing infrastructure , today jointly announced with EFCG that it will co-sponsor with Microsoft the 2 nd Annual EFCG CIO Conference. The conference will take place March 2-3, 2017, in New York City at the Harvard Club & New York Yacht Club. Participation in the conference is limited to 75 and is by invitation only. \n“EFCG is very excited to be teaming with Bentley Systems and Microsoft for our second CIO conference. Our inaugural conference was very successful last year, and we’re thrilled to bring the 15-year history of the Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference, developed by Bentley and Farkas Berkowitz, into our event. Our CIO attendees will benefit enormously from a forum that combines the knowledge and insights of Bentley Systems and Microsoft’s technology roadmap with EFCG’s industry-leading approach to profitably managing A/E/C firms,” said Paul Zofnass, president, EFCG. \n“Bentley Systems is pleased to team with EFCG on this event and to jointly explore information technology challenges that are unique to the firms who engineer and construct infrastructure globally. BIM advancements and 'going digital' strategies have the potential to favorably transform A/E/C business performance when empowered by technology leadership,” said Greg Bentley, CEO, Bentley Systems. \n“Microsoft has a longstanding relationship with Bentley Systems,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president and chief evangelist, Microsoft Corp. “Through the use of Microsoft Azure, we are advancing the way architects, engineers, surveyors, contractors, and their supply chains are designing, operating, and maintaining the world’s infrastructure. CIOs are faced with many challenges and complexities around information technology for engineering and construction including connecting users, enabling better collaboration between project teams, and asset management. Co-sponsoring the EFCG CIO Summit with Bentley Systems is a natural fit and enables us both to help move the industry forward.” \nFor 15 years, Bentley Systems was the prime sponsor of The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology, hosted by Farkas Berkowitz & Company. That event, which had been highly valued by CIOs of large engineering and construction firms, is coming to a close with the well-earned retirement of its managing director, Alan Farkas, of Farkas Berkowitz. \n“As Bentley Systems’ partner in holding the Global IT Summit over the last 15 years, I had a ringside seat on the increasingly important contributions that information technology is making to the engineering and construction industry. IT is slowly but surely transforming our industry and, as it does, CIOs and CTOs are increasingly playing more strategic roles at their firms. The Global IT Summit sought to advance this cause, and I am delighted to know that these efforts will continue with the new partnership between Bentley Systems and EFCG,” said Alan Farkas. \nGreg Bentley continued, “Alan Farkas’s leadership and commitment to The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference over the many years was invaluable to Bentley Systems and to members of the A/E/C community who attended the conference. I want to express my gratitude for all that Alan did to make the conference the success that it has been. We now look forward to working with EFCG, and our co-sponsor Microsoft, to continue to provide a forum for CIOs to share best practices and to explore the business implications of technology advancements in the A/E/C world.” \nAbout the EFCG CIO Conference \nEFCG’s inaugural CIO Conference was held in February 2016. The two-day conference is designed to explore driving business value through IT innovation and transformation and the business and financial implications of the key technology challenges facing CIOs. Each year’s conference is developed in coordination with a select group of industry advisors to ensure the sessions are on topic and directly applicable to the CIOs’ ongoing challenges. This event requires participants to complete a detailed IT survey of their respective organization, and the information is collated and analyzed by EFCG and summarized during the conference to illustrate trends, benchmarks, and key issues facing the industry. Conference size is limited to foster an intimate exchange of ideas among participants. For registration information, contact Joan Zofnass ( ), Director of Conferences.

      "text": "Bentley Systems to Co-sponsor EFCG’s 2 nd Annual A/E/C CIO Conference with Microsoft Invitation-only Conference Explores the Transformative Role of Technology on Business Success in the A/E/C Industry  13   \nEXTON, Pa.- Bentley Systems, Incorporated, a leading global provider of comprehensive software solutions for advancing infrastructure , today jointly announced with EFCG that it will co-sponsor with Microsoft the 2 nd Annual EFCG CIO Conference. The conference will take place March 2-3, 2017, in New York City at the Harvard Club & New York Yacht Club. Participation in the conference is limited to 75 and is by invitation only. \n“EFCG is very excited to be teaming with Bentley Systems and Microsoft for our second CIO conference. Our inaugural conference was very successful last year, and we’re thrilled to bring the 15-year history of the Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference, developed by Bentley and Farkas Berkowitz, into our event. Our CIO attendees will benefit enormously from a forum that combines the knowledge and insights of Bentley Systems and Microsoft’s technology roadmap with EFCG’s industry-leading approach to profitably managing A/E/C firms,” said Paul Zofnass, president, EFCG. \n“Bentley Systems is pleased to team with EFCG on this event and to jointly explore information technology challenges that are unique to the firms who engineer and construct infrastructure globally. BIM advancements and 'going digital' strategies have the potential to favorably transform A/E/C business performance when empowered by technology leadership,” said Greg Bentley, CEO, Bentley Systems. \n“Microsoft has a longstanding relationship with Bentley Systems,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president and chief evangelist, Microsoft Corp. “Through the use of Microsoft Azure, we are advancing the way architects, engineers, surveyors, contractors, and their supply chains are designing, operating, and maintaining the world’s infrastructure. CIOs are faced with many challenges and complexities around information technology for engineering and construction including connecting users, enabling better collaboration between project teams, and asset management. Co-sponsoring the EFCG CIO Summit with Bentley Systems is a natural fit and enables us both to help move the industry forward.” \nFor 15 years, Bentley Systems was the prime sponsor of The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology, hosted by Farkas Berkowitz & Company. That event, which had been highly valued by CIOs of large engineering and construction firms, is coming to a close with the well-earned retirement of its managing director, Alan Farkas, of Farkas Berkowitz. \n“As Bentley Systems’ partner in holding the Global IT Summit over the last 15 years, I had a ringside seat on the increasingly important contributions that information technology is making to the engineering and construction industry. IT is slowly but surely transforming our industry and, as it does, CIOs and CTOs are increasingly playing more strategic roles at their firms. The Global IT Summit sought to advance this cause, and I am delighted to know that these efforts will continue with the new partnership between Bentley Systems and EFCG,” said Alan Farkas. \nGreg Bentley continued, “Alan Farkas’s leadership and commitment to The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference over the many years was invaluable to Bentley Systems and to members of the A/E/C community who attended the conference. I want to express my gratitude for all that Alan did to make the conference the success that it has been. We now look forward to working with EFCG, and our co-sponsor Microsoft, to continue to provide a forum for CIOs to share best practices and to explore the business implications of technology advancements in the A/E/C world.” \nAbout the EFCG CIO Conference \nEFCG’s inaugural CIO Conference was held in February 2016. The two-day conference is designed to explore driving business value through IT innovation and transformation and the business and financial implications of the key technology challenges facing CIOs. Each year’s conference is developed in coordination with a select group of industry advisors to ensure the sessions are on topic and directly applicable to the CIOs’ ongoing challenges. This event requires participants to complete a detailed IT survey of their respective organization, and the information is collated and analyzed by EFCG and summarized during the conference to illustrate trends, benchmarks, and key issues facing the industry. Conference size is limited to foster an intimate exchange of ideas among participants. For registration information, contact Joan Zofnass ( ), Director of Conferences.

      "text": "Microsoft HoloLens Is Coming To Japan \nMicrosoft Corp. announced on Tuesday that Microsoft HoloLens, the world’s first self-contained holographic computer running Windows 10, will be available for preorder in Japan starting Dec. 2. Devices will begin to ship in early 2017. Today’s news comes just six weeks after Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition and Microsoft HoloLens Commercial Suite expanded globally to six new markets. With this milestone HoloLens is now available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States (including Puerto Rico). \n\"Our mission at Microsoft is to bring mixed reality to every person and organization on the planet,\" said Alex Kipman, technical fellow, Microsoft Windows and Devices Group. \"Since January 2015 we have been hard at work to bring the vision of mixed reality to life. It has been inspiring to see what has been created by our partners, and the team remains in awe of the way developers are using HoloLens. We can’t wait to see what everyone in Japan creates when they get their hands on HoloLens.\"",

      "text": "0 0 \nWe live in times where everything is undergoing a tech makeover, and paying for things isn’t excluded from the list. More and more companies are starting to develop services that allow people to pay at stores or various locations directly with their phones. \nMicrosoft is no different. The tech giant behind the Windows operating system has its own mobile payment app, but the Wallet app was ultimately found lacking. The main aspect that needed to be addressed was its lack of compatibility for the passbook file type. Passbook extensions are the most likely to be run into at the moment and not having this compatibility made Microsoft’s Wallet app outdated \nThere is good news, however, for Windows Phone users that were also trying to get into the new habit of using mobile payment solutions. Microsoft is pushing out an update that brings new changes to a revamped Wallet app . The new iteration is called Wallet Pass and it includes various new implementations including the much-desired passbook compatibility. \nIt also includes various cross-platform capabilities such as syncing passbook files from a computer, which makes it even easier to manage. Let’s take a look at what other changes users can expect from the updated Wallet app, now Wallet Pass . Passbooks can have their very own live tile pinned in the Start screen; Automatic updates; Internet-File Explorer file transfer capabilities for .pkpass files; PIN security for better file protection; Better management resources for passbooks; Passbook notifications integration with Action Centre; Passbook map location integration with Nokia Here; Full passbook integration into the revamped app. \nAll these features and some others will be available in the new Wallet Pass app that is very likely to have a considerable impact on the mobile payment market. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nWindows 10 is obviously the main focus over at Microsoft, with tons of updates prepared months in advance, with early 2017 already booked for new updates as well. This is part of Microsoft’s plan of not releasing any new version of Windows and instead focusing on improving Windows 10 over the years. \nAlthough users are significantly more pleased with how Windows 10 turned out in contrast to Windows 8/8.1, there are still things that need to be fixed or updated, and Microsoft is working to bring all these upgrades in a timely manner. There are also things that haven’t been improved at all since Windows 8, meaning that the relevance of those features has drastically deteriorated to the point where they cannot correctly function in today’s environment anymore. \nSuch is the case of various Share-based functionalities which no longer meet the norm. This has gotten users asking about updates pertaining to this specific concern, and the answers seem to have finally appeared. It looks like Microsoft is preparing to solve the Share related problems as pointed out by update builds pushed through their Windows Insider program. \nMicrosoft official Peter Skillman has responded on Twitter to a series of questions about the highly required Share implementations for Windows 10 in a vague manner characteristic to Microsoft. He assured those inquiring about it that Microsoft is “on it” and that users would be able to see changed made to the specific area of the OS “soon”. \nWhile not very satisfying since no specific date was made available, Windows 10 users can at least take comfort in the fact that Peter Skillman’s answer shows us Microsoft is on the right path. With the next major update (Creators Update) scheduled for 2017, it remains to be seen if Microsoft will be pushing any additional updates containing the changes or if users will have to wait until the beginning of next year to receive improved Share functionalities. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

According to his LinkedIn profile, Kim spent three and a half years at Microsoft and will now join Tesla Motors to take up the role of Lead Designer . \nDuring his work at Microsoft, Kim was highly involved in HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality project, so it's no wonder that everyone's asking what does Elon Musk have next in mind for his electric cars. \nPerhaps we will soon see a first vehicle that uses augmented reality to its fullest. Imagine your windshield turning into a map, or your mirrors into monitors, etc. \nAlthough it isn't certain what exactly Kim will be doing at Tesla, there's no doubt that Elon Musk has big plans and wants to be a pioneer in his field .",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5, iPad Pro 2 and the Google Nexus 7 (Pixel 7) are some of the best upcoming tablets of 2017. However, none of these tablets have been officially confirmed. ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nRumors of a number of tablets that are expected to be launched in 2017 are swirling in the tech space. \nSome of the rumored upcoming tablets of 2017 that are eagerly awaited by consumers are the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, iPad Pro 2 and Google Nexus 7 (Pixel 7). \nHere is what to expect from these tablets. Surface Pro 5 \nMicrosoft launched and released the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015 and the launch of its successor is long overdue, which makes Surface Pro 5 one of the most anticipated tablets of 2017. \nThe Surface Pro 5 tablet is expected to come running on Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor. The Surface Pro 4 is available with 4 GB / 8 GB / 16 GB RAM configurations and with up to 256 GB of internal storage capacity. \nThe Surface Pro 5 may come with the same RAM options but customers will want that the tablet also has a model with 512 GB of on-board storage capacity. \nThe Surface Pro 4 was plagued with battery drain issues . Customers will hope that Microsoft takes care of the problem in the upcoming Surface Pro 5. \nMicrosoft's next tablet is estimated to come running on Windows 10 Redstone 2 and support USB Type-C, which is not present in the Surface Pro 4. \nA previous Tech Times report suggests that the Microsoft may launch the tablet as early as January 2017. However, the report also notes that Microsoft may announce the detachable in the second half of 2017. iPad Pro 2 \nApple launched the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in September 2015 while the 9.7-inch iPad Pro made an appearance in March this year. \nSpeculations are rife that Apple is expected to launch three iPads in 2017 with different form factors: 9.7-inch screen, 12.9-inch screen and a new model with 10.5-inch screen. \nAll the three iPads are expected to come running on A11 chip and 3 GB of RAM. The tablets could include 32 GB / 128 GB / 256 GB on-board storage capacities. Given that iPads do not support microSD card that allows for storage expansion, customers will hope that Apple also introduces a 512 GB model of the iPad Pro 2. \nAccording to a DigiTimes report , shipments of the 10.5-inch iPad may reach 2 million units in Q1 2017 and 5 to 6 million units for the entire year. This means that Apple could launch its new iPad sometime in the first quarter of 2017. Google Nexus 7 \nThe Google Nexus 7 may also be called Pixel 7. Undoubtedly, the Pixel 7 will come running on Google's latest mobile operating system — Android 7.1 Nougat — straight out of the box. \nThe Pixel 7 is rumored to feature a 7-inch Quad HD screen with a display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. Under the hood could be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4 GB of RAM and Adreno 530 GPU. \nThe Pixel 7 could offer 64 GB of internal storage with the option to expand the memory to up to 2 TB with a microSD card. The Google tablet may include a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. \nRumors suggest that Google is in track to launch the tablet by the end of 2016, which means customers may see the tablet hit the shelves sooner than later.

      "text": "\nThis year, at HPE’s Discover conference in London, Scott Guthrie joined Antonio Neri of HPE on stage to share how the two companies are expanding their relationship that was announced last year. Announced last year was that HPE would recommend Azure to its clients for cloud services and in return, Microsoft named HPE a preferred provider of the platform.\nDuring the past year, the two companies have collaborated on Hyper-Converged systems based on Microsoft’s Cloud Platform System standard and a few months ago, HPE announced an upcoming Azure stack solution that will make it easier for companies who are interested in, or are moving towards a hybrid environment, transition faster. Finally, HPE also has its consulting arm that is helping customers transition from on-premises to hybrid and full cloud environments.\nThis year, the two companies have announced a joint innovation center that will host workshops to help customers’ setup Azure Stack solutions. The first center is in Seattle with plans to open another center in Europe in the near future.\nSeeing as HPE is in a transition mode, where the company is shifting how it operates and is streamlining its operations, partnerships like the one with Microsoft are a critical component to its evolving strategy. While HPE is working to become the leader in the hybrid IT environment, they are also becoming Azure Stack specialists which has a long-tailed future as Azure becomes more dominant in the cloud space.\nThe post Microsoft and HPE Further Relationship To Expand The Hybrid Cloud appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "title": "“This webpage is not responding”, why I eschew Microsoft’s Edge for Google’s Chrome",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft Edge is great for your battery life on Windows, it is also one of the fastest browsers to start up, it eats less RAM than the notorious Chrome and claims to be more secure than Firefox. Despite all that, I’m still using Chrome on my PC in lieu of Microsoft’s internet browsers. Actually, that’s not entirely accurate. I’m not “still” using Chrome so much as I switched to using Chrome after Edge replaced Internet Explorer.\nFor most people, why they don’t use Edge is simple, it is single platform. Microsoft’s Edge is limited to Windows 10, and does not work on the Mac, the iPhone or Android devices, This means you can’t experience a continuity of browsing history, or open tabs viewed on one device on a second more contextually appropriate device (Edge doesn’t offer this even between Windows phones and PCs). For others, it’s due to a lack of extensions. Grammarly- for one – is a very useful extension for writers, journalists and bloggers which I use daily. It is also one which exists on Chrome but not Edge. For many other people, I’m sure they have their own “dealbreaker” extension that simply doesn’t exist on Edge – preventing them from making the jump.\n\nWhile these are irritating issues, I can easily get over them and adapt one way – or another. The most peculiar and bothersome issue is Edge’s reliability or lack thereof. To use the words of Edge – “This webpage is not responding”. When I use a browser, I use it for a multidude of purposes. I use it to watch videos, to stream music, to read articles, both long and short – sometimes I like to open multiple tabs for research purposes, and sometimes I put my PC in sleep mode while I do other things. The problem with Edge is that it doesn’t like to handle these scenarios as well as Chrome. Often it throws up an error “This webpage is not responding” leading to the entire web page freezing , and often times the whole browser failing to work requiring it to be shut down via the task manager and then relaunched – losing all work. Other times, it just randomly slows down and showcases Windows’ trademark spinning circle of death.\nEdge is a decent browser like I said above. It is the only one so far to offer 4K Netflix streaming, is very light on battery and – when it works as it should – light on RAM and the processor as well. However, reliability issues make it very hard to trust, and consequently to work with.\nTo its credit, Edge keeps getting better and better, with Microsoft adding support for more and more extensions and features in addition to constant bug fixes in newer builds of Windows 10. Hopefully, it won’t be long now till Edge is as stable and useful as any modern browser ought to be. On the other hand, If Microsoft can’t even keep someone who is actively trying to use its Edge browser hooked, how can it hope to appeal to sceptics.\n",

      "title": "Bentley Systems to Co-sponsor EFCG’s 2nd Annual A/E/C CIO Conference with Microsoft",
      "text": "Bentley Systems to Co-sponsor EFCG’s 2 nd Annual A/E/C CIO Conference with Microsoft\nInvitation-only Conference Explores the Transformative Role of Technology on Business Success in the A/E/C Industry\nBentley Systems, Incorporated, a leading global provider of comprehensive software solutions for advancing infrastructure , today jointly announced with EFCG that it will co-sponsor with Microsoft the 2 nd Annual EFCG CIO Conference. The conference will take place March 2-3, 2017, in New York City at the Harvard Club & New York Yacht Club. Participation in the conference is limited to 75 and is by invitation only.\n“EFCG is very excited to be teaming with Bentley Systems and Microsoft for our second CIO conference. Our inaugural conference was very successful last year, and we’re thrilled to bring the 15-year history of the Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference, developed by Bentley and Farkas Berkowitz, into our event. Our CIO attendees will benefit enormously from a forum that combines the knowledge and insights of Bentley Systems and Microsoft’s technology roadmap with EFCG’s industry-leading approach to profitably managing A/E/C firms,” said Paul Zofnass, president, EFCG.\n“Bentley Systems is pleased to team with EFCG on this event and to jointly explore information technology challenges that are unique to the firms who engineer and construct infrastructure globally. BIM advancements and 'going digital' strategies have the potential to favorably transform A/E/C business performance when empowered by technology leadership,” said Greg Bentley, CEO, Bentley Systems.\n“Microsoft has a longstanding relationship with Bentley Systems,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president and chief evangelist, Microsoft Corp. “Through the use of Microsoft Azure, we are advancing the way architects, engineers, surveyors, contractors, and their supply chains are designing, operating, and maintaining the world’s infrastructure. CIOs are faced with many challenges and complexities around information technology for engineering and construction including connecting users, enabling better collaboration between project teams, and asset management. Co-sponsoring the EFCG CIO Summit with Bentley Systems is a natural fit and enables us both to help move the industry forward.”\nFor 15 years, Bentley Systems was the prime sponsor of The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology, hosted by Farkas Berkowitz & Company. That event, which had been highly valued by CIOs of large engineering and construction firms, is coming to a close with the well-earned retirement of its managing director, Alan Farkas, of Farkas Berkowitz.\n“As Bentley Systems’ partner in holding the Global IT Summit over the last 15 years, I had a ringside seat on the increasingly important contributions that information technology is making to the engineering and construction industry. IT is slowly but surely transforming our industry and, as it does, CIOs and CTOs are increasingly playing more strategic roles at their firms. The Global IT Summit sought to advance this cause, and I am delighted to know that these efforts will continue with the new partnership between Bentley Systems and EFCG,” said Alan Farkas.\nGreg Bentley continued, “Alan Farkas’s leadership and commitment to The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference over the many years was invaluable to Bentley Systems and to members of the A/E/C community who attended the conference. I want to express my gratitude for all that Alan did to make the conference the success that it has been. We now look forward to working with EFCG, and our co-sponsor Microsoft, to continue to provide a forum for CIOs to share best practices and to explore the business implications of technology advancements in the A/E/C world.”\nAbout the EFCG CIO Conference\nEFCG’s inaugural CIO Conference was held in February 2016. The two-day conference is designed to explore driving business value through IT innovation and transformation and the business and financial implications of the key technology challenges facing CIOs. Each year’s conference is developed in coordination with a select group of industry advisors to ensure the sessions are on topic and directly applicable to the CIOs’ ongoing challenges. This event requires participants to complete a detailed IT survey of their respective organization, and the information is collated and analyzed by EFCG and summarized during the conference to illustrate trends, benchmarks, and key issues facing the industry. Conference size is limited to foster an intimate exchange of ideas among participants. For registration information, contact Joan Zofnass ( jzofnass@efcg.com ), Director of Conferences.

      "text": "\nBack at the NodeSummit, Microsoft announced experimental support for Node-ChhakraCore on Linux. Today, the company has announced experimental support for Node-ChakraCore on macOS. With Node-ChakraCore, developers can use Node.js with ChakraCore. For those unfamiliar, ChakraCore is Microsoft’s open sourced, cross-platform JavaScript engine which is mainly found on Microsoft Edge in Windows 10. In a blog post today, Microsoft’s Arunesh Chandra stated:\n“Bringing cross-platform support to Node-ChakraCore has been a key goal on our roadmap from the beginning. At NodeSummit we announced experimental support for Node-ChakraCore on Linux, and today bringing that same experimental support is available on macOS as well. These early experimental builds have been validated against Node.js unit tests as well as some synthetic tests. We are looking for help hardening Node-ChakraCore further, so if you run into bugs while trying out these builds, please let us know. Performance is a work in progress, with ongoing investments in the underlying ChakraCore engine.”\nIf you are interested in trying out Node-ChakraCore, you can grab the nightly builds here. ",

      "text": "Sponsored: FedTech Microsoft’s HoloLens Headset Will Allow Real Tank Operators to See the Battlefield Outside \nA Ukrainian tank moves at the Desna training center outside Chernihiv, some 80 km north of Kiev, Ukraine, Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016. // Sergei Chuzavkov/AP By Ananya Bhattacharya Quartz 11:07 AM ET Increase size \nMicrosoft’s HoloLens, often used for virtual and augmented reality-enhanced battle games , is finding its way onto the actual battlefield. \nThe Ukrainian company LimpidArmor has created a Circular Review System for armored vehicles, consisting of helmets with integrated Microsoft HoloLens glasses so soldiers can see their surroundings without leaving their tanks—and deploy weapons from the relative safety of inside a tank. The 360-degree view extends over 300 meters. \nUkraine’s army has agreed to trial this technology —the device’s debut on a real battlefield. In August, the Israeli army bagged two Hololens devices to train soldiers and medics for different scenarios that could crop up during service. \nChanneling first-person shooter games like \"Call of Duty,\" the augmented reality headset is able to overlay incoming feeds from cameras fitted outside the vehicles with labels highlighting “allies” and marking “enemies” in real time. The company’s software can also tailor the system to command drones, “locking onto targets through the headset,\" according to Inverse . \nAnother VR headset, a version of LimpidArmor’s, is already in military use: the F-35 fighter jet’s $400,000 helmet, weighing up to 5 pounds, combines noise-canceling headphones , night vision, a forehead-mounted computer, and a projector to display similar live video on its clear visor. But compared with that device, the $3,000 HoloLens is a steal. \n“[The technology] would give us the best of both worlds: It would take the human warfighter out of harm’s way, but it would also give robotic systems the sophistication of human judgment,” Patrick Lin, director of the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, told Quartz in an interview. \nOn the other hand, augmented reality’s use in battle poses some ethical concerns: Would fighters become desensitized to violence, as gamers are, and as a result make less empathetic decisions? Scholars and humanitarian groups argue violent video and computer games often allow players to commit international law violations like “shooting wounded prisoners, torturing detainees or using prohibited chemical weapons to defeat an enemy force—with no negative consequences,” The Washington Times reported . \nTracking and aiming at real opponents with VR from inside a tank could fuel similar dissociation and desensitization, Lin says. As with drone warfare, removing soldiers from the direct action could “decrease the costs and political barriers to seeking military solutions,” Lin said. “Emerging technologies could make war easier to choose.” \nSo far, Microsoft’s virtual reality headset has primarily been used in entertainment and design . But the company can’t fully control what its technology is used for. Any third-party vendor can load software of their choice onto the HoloLens Development Edition . \n“Given this unprecedented link between military and civilian technologies, it would be difficult for, say, Microsoft to tell the government that it could not use its operating system or software for military operations,” Lin said. Because the technology is basically a blank slate, Microsoft can’t fully control what it’s used for—especially in cases like this, where the Army wasn’t even the direct buyer. Microsoft did not respond to Quartz’s requests for comment. \nLin argues general military operations are fair game, but says vendors should have the right to limit how their technology is used when it comes to an armed attack. Tesla announced its customers may not earn money as Uber or Lyft drivers by using the car-maker’s self-driving feature, for example. Microsoft could, in theory, add similar clauses for use by armed forces. More from",

      "title": "How to Install Games on Xbox One",
      "text": "For a new generation of console gaming, both Microsoft and Sony made big bets on new ways to get games. The Xbox One, Microsoft’s video game console for the living room, makes games available in two ways. You can purchase a game at a retail store, or through its digital store as a download. Whichever you decide, you have to install games on Xbox One.\nAdvertisement\nMicrosoft worked hard to make installing games on the console as simple as possible. Games purchased at a retail store, like GameStop or Target, are ridiculously straight forward. There’s only a single step and you lose out on almost nothing, except time. Time is also something that those that purchase a game for Xbox One digitally need to worry about. Installing games on Xbox One from the Xbox Store can take hours because of a game’s size. Still it isn’t too complicated.\nHere’s how to install games on Xbox One, no matter which way you decided to purchase your game.\nHow to Install Games on Xbox One: Disc If you’re going to install games on Xbox One from a disc, the process is simple. Once you’ve got your Xbox One all setup, place the disc that you purchased with the game on it into the slot loading disc drive on the Xbox One or Xbox One S. Both will allow you to begin installing the game you just inserted.\nAdvertisement\nDepending on how big the game is, installing a disc game on Xbox One can go quickly or take some time. Games on Xbox One are bigger than the Xbox 360 titles that you might be used to. You don’t have to keep the console on the Home screen for the installation to continue. Your console will let you know when it’s safe to start the game.\nAdvertisement\nRead: How to Play Xbox 360 Games on the Xbox One\nDon’t trade-in Xbox One games that you plan to continue playing. Despite you installing a game from a disc, the console still requires you to insert that disc as a way of verifying that you own it. Microsoft had plans to do away with this requirement, but changed them when buyers made it clear they wanted the option to play games offline and not have the console connect to the internet at least once a day.\nWhen a physical game is in your Xbox One, the fourth icon on the Xbox One will always show that game with a disc icon overlay. If you uninstall the game, you can always insert the disc and install it again.\nAdvertisement\nIf you have an internet connection, Xbox One will check to make sure that you have the latest version of any game that you install. You can choose to install that update immediately, or wait until later.\nHow to Install Games on Xbox One: Digital There’s a lot more you need to know if you want to install games on Xbox One from the Xbox Store.\nYou can acquire digital games through buying them from the Xbox Store in the Store area, or from codes that you purchase online through Amazon and GameStop. Disc games sometimes come with digital codes that unlock downloads too.\nAdvertisement\nRead: Xbox One Digital Games: 5 Things You Need to Know\nIf you have an Xbox One with a Kinect sensor, simply say, “Xbox, use a code.” This command will take you to a screen that lets you input the code you have. If you don’t have a code but do want to purchase a digital game, go to the Store area and find the game in Microsoft’s catalog. You’ll need to have a credit card associated with your Microsoft Account or a credit card on file. Xbox will prompt you to add a payment method once you try to buy a game digitally.\nOnce you’ve used a code or purchased a game through the store, the download should start immediately. It’s going to take some time to finish though. How much time passes between when you hit “Buy” and when it finishes depends on the game’s size and your internet connection. All isn’t lost though.\nSome games will let you begin playing, even before you’ve finished them. Again, you don’t have to stay on the store page or home area, your console will tell you when enough of a game has been installed that you can play, or when the download is finished.\nAdvertisement\nHow to Install Games on Xbox One: Managing Games It’s from the My Games and Apps screen that you can manage everything about your games, whether they came from a disc or a download. Highlight a game in My Games and Apps and press the Menu button on your Xbox Controller.\nSelect Manage game from the pop-up screen.\nFrom this area you can monitor games for updates, find out whether you installed it on your console’s internal drive and find out the last time you played. The screen also gives you access to any downloadable content that you’ve purchased and saved data that you have stored on your console. If you ever need to delete a game to make room for another, that’s done here. Xbox One manages game saves and updates on its own. As such, there’s no reason that you should need to go into the manage area for those activities.\nRead: 33 Xbox One Tips for a Better Experience\nThat’s how to install games on Xbox One. Good luck with your new console.",

      "text": "\nAdobe today released its 2016 online shopping data for Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day. Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the three-billion-dollar mark for the first time at $3.34 billion (21.6 percent growth YoY) while Thanksgiving accounted for the remaining $1.93 billion. Black Friday became the first day in retail history to drive over one billion dollars in mobile revenue at $1.2 billion, a 33 percent growth YoY.\nBased on their report, Microsoft Xbox was among the five top-selling electronic products on Black Friday. And since PS4 was not on the top five list, we can assume that Xbox One sales surpassed PS4 sales on the Black Friday day. But for the entire season so far (Nov. 1 – 24), PlayStation 4 is the best-selling video game console, followed by Microsoft Xbox One. PS4 is leading the overall sales of November because their next generation console PS4 Pro went on sale earlier this month. Microsoft’s next generation console “Project Scorpio” is coming next year with support for true 4K games and VR.",

      "text": "The smartphone market is expected to show significant deceleration in 2016, according to the latest forecast by industry tracker IDC. Worldwide shipments are expected to reach 1.45 billion, which would represent a year-over-year growth rate of 0.6% compared with 10.4% in the year-earlier period. Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Android operating system is expected to show the only growth, rising an estimated 5.2% year-over-year to 1.2 billion, fueled by Android's expansion in emerging markets and the that hit the market this fall. Shipments of phones operating Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iOS, the second most-used operating system behind Android, are forecast to fall 11% year-over-year to 206 million, despite the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) smartphone shipments are expected to plunge 79%. Shares of Google rose 0.5% to $789.94 in morning trade and have risen 2.3% in the past year. Apple's shares fell 1.1% on Tuesday and are down 6.3% in the past year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed both stocks on the year, rising 7.3%.\n-Jennifer Booton; 1033ET\n ",

      "title": "Surface Studio Teardown Shows Microsoft's AIO Not That Repairable With RAM, CPU And GPU Soldered Down",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly   Surface Studio Teardown Shows Microsoft's AIO Not That Repairable With RAM, CPU And GPU Soldered Down Microsoft recently announced its first desktop PC, the Surface Studio , a sleek looking all-in-one with some unique features. As is the trend these days, the Surface Studio is pretty thin. It's also not a system that is easy to repair at home, a teardown analysis reveals. Much of the reason for that is because Microsoft opted to solder several key components to the motherboard. Getting into the 21-pound Surface Studio isn't all that difficult, though finding a pathway isn't all that obvious, either. Flipping the AIO on its base reveals a strip of air vents that border the entire bottom panel. In each of the four corners there is a rubber foot. Each one hides a Torx screw that must be removed in order to open up the Surface Studio. The two screws on the front corners are extra long, though it's better than having to deal with adhesive. Microsoft could have glued the whole thing shut, as device makers like to do these days, but decided not to. Score Microsoft some geek points for that decision. Once the screws are removed, there are still several clips to contend with before removing the heavy bottom cover. The reward for all that effort is a glimpse of the guts, but only a glimpse—most of the parts still are not accessible after removing the base, as there's a mid-frame that gets in the way. Lifting away the mid-frame reveals the Surface Studio's innards all neatly arranged. Up top sits the gum stick-sized M.2 SSD, which is easily removed and upgraded. There's also a SATA hard drive visible, though getting to it requires the removal of a cooling solution that gets in the way.\"It took a little work to get here, but it seems there is indeed a complete storage upgrade path for your $3,000-4,000 desktop machine, as there should be,\" iFixIt notes.Digging even deeper isn't all that difficult, though there is only so much that is user serviceable. On the plus side, the entire display assembly can be replaced as a piece rather than having to dismantle the display or base. However, the RAM, CPU, and GPU are all soldered to the board and can't be upgraded. The Surface Studio also lost points because a few components embedded in the display (buttons, front sensors, and speakers) are a bit difficult to replace if they fail.When the tallying was done, the Surface Studio earned a 5 out of 10 Repairabilty Score.",

      "text": "The heavy hitters — Microsoft, Amazon, and Google — call it home. So do plenty of other big startup names , like Zillow or Tableau. And the best news, for you business policy wonks, is the total lack of a state income tax. If all our coverage of the recent Seattle Startup Week wasn’t enough to convince you, Seattle’s getting to be a pretty big startup hub.\nSo, as we already did with Chicago , we at Tech.Co decided to round up a group of CEOs, founders, and entrepreneurs with two things in common. They’re all Seattleites and they all have a little insight to share about their experience starting up in the city. Here’s the rundown.\nIt’s Collaborative, Not Competitive Rutu Mulkar-Mehta, CEO of boutique AI consulting firm Ticary Solutions , summed up one of the more frequent praises I heard while chatting with CEOs about their views of Seattle’s startup ecosystem. They tend to love the open, approachable attitude:\n“I have discovered that the Seattle culture and community has a huge part to play in the startup scene. Most people in Seattle are open, friendly, non-threatening and approachable, this effectively bleeds into the startup community. Investors, CEO’s and CTO’s make public appearances regularly in events and meetups, consequently being very approachable and easy to connect with. The startup scene is largely collaborative, rather than competitive, and at the same time, it is extremely diverse. I have lived in NY, Bay Area, San Diego and LA, and if I were to choose, there is no other place that is as non-threatening, diverse and advanced in technology as Seattle to start a startup!”\nIt’s Having a Moment Sarah Adler, founder of Simply Real Health , started her company in Seattle in 2012 and is still located there. She highlights another benefit to the city:\n“Seattle is in this amazing, creative place right now. There’s so many more doers, makers, and shakers following their version of their dreams, than even four years ago — and you can feel it. The best part about it, is that unlike other cities that are much larger, Seattle has like this understated cool-kid vibe, with people so willing to help each other out, collaborate and support new ideas and businesses- no matter the category. The food scene, the tech scene, the artist scene- they all intersect here. Which for anyone who owns their own business, its like a hidden gem. More of that, please!”\nYes, Sarah mentioned that well-loved collaboration again. Hey, I told you it was a common praise.\nAnd Solid Infrastructure I don’t just mean the tax perks, though some entrepreneurs I talked to mentioned that, too. Here’s Robi Ganguly, co-founder and CEO of Apptentive:\n“After living in San Francisco for eight years, I moved to Seattle to found our startup, Apptentive. There were several drivers of this: Seattle has a better cost of living, more favorable infrastructure (better public schools, more investment in public transit and density) and a history of doing rather than talking.”\nThe Big Weakness? Lack of VCs I spoke with Robb Monkman, founder and CEO of React Mobile , on his experience with starting a company in Seattle. While Seattle gave Robb “amazing access to smart, talented people,” he still had one major problem:\n“I think Seattle’s tech scene is as vibrant as ever, but to be perfectly honest, founding a startup in Seattle has been tough. Despite having proven products, growing sales, and reputable local area customers like Seattle University, Windermere Real Estate, Costco and others, attracting investment from the Seattle venture community has not been easy.\n[…] New entrepreneurs need to be careful about which angel groups they approach as many are not worth the time. While many angel groups offer entrepreneurs a great stage to practice their pitch and garner awareness, there are very few serious investors who attend these pitch events. Bottom line: Some angel groups (not all) have lots of tire kickers, egos and people selling you their professional services. Unless you are practicing your pitch, spend your time making real connections with serious investors who share your vision and believe what you believe.”\nIt’s a view shared by many, including Ty Griffin, Entrepreneur in Residence at the Center for Financial Services Innovation and co-founder/CEO of Prism:\n“Seattle was a fantastic location for starting our company. There is a tremendous pool of talent here, and the cost of living is reasonable (at least relative to many startup hubs). […]\nWe also have an excellent angel community up here, with many engaged and experienced investors ready to step in and help launch a business. Our only real weakness is that we have a small VC community up here. I would love to see a real ecosystem develop so that more companies that are raising these larger venture rounds could do so locally.”\n…But Maybe That’s a Strength, Too Aaron Suzuki, CEO of SmartDeploy, offers a different take on that same situation, the limited amount of VC funds available in the Seattle ecosystem:\n“There are fewer local sources of capital compared to the Bay Area which I think makes Seattle startups more creative and scrappy, and my company is no exception. We incubated an IT software concept within a consulting firm I founded. Having boot-strapped the development and early market validation of the product we went out looking for funding to spinoff and scale-up the business. (Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do?) We were rejected everywhere we went.\nHaving exhausted our coffers and my patience we began scaling back. Revenue increased with every move we made. We fired our PR agency and revenue doubled. We laid off 90 percent of engineering and revenue doubled again. It seems that we had turned a corner just as I was about to give up. We focused 100 percent of our attention on the customer. Suddenly the business was profitable.”\nUnless VCs Just Find People Who Look Like Them Fran Dunaway, CEO and co-founder of underwear label TomboyX, raised another VC-related concern. VCs, like Hollywood directors , might recruit from the ranks of those who remind them of themselves, a move that leaves female founders high and dry:\n“We closed on our Series Seed round earlier this year and raised $1.6M and only about 10 percent of that came from Seattle investors. I attribute that to a few things. First of all, the data clearly shows that women-owned companies have a more challenging time raising money, especially if they don’t have a tech component and are in the e-commerce space. So here we were, 40+ year old lesbian women, with absolutely no experience. hocking underwear of all things.\nDespite our 4x growth year over year, our impressive margins and exciting KPI’s – it was a hard sell. Except to the women. In fact, 90% of our current investor pool are women who got on board early, believed in us and our vision. The takeaway lesson I have from that is that, for the most part, you have to find people who look like you to write you a check. Most angel groups are primarily comprised of men or have men as gatekeepers. We should have been more selective early on but the practice really did make our pitch that much more perfect. There are so many female angel funds springing up across the country because they recognize that we have to support each other in our endeavors. It’s awesome to see.\nTomboyX is here today because of that trend (Thank you Cheryl Sandberg!) and has investors from angel groups in Kansas City, Los Angeles, Boulder and New York. Seattle doesn’t have a similar group yet, but I would hope that we can get something like that started soon.”\nSeattle Has Larger Incumbents, Too  \nChad Wittman, VP of Product and co-founder of Dolly, weighed in on the need for non-startup tech companies in a startup ecosystem:\n“The other part I love about building a company in Seattle is that there are a lot of big old powerful tech companies. There are many people in the ranks willing to jump onto a startup and I think they feel safe enough that they can retreat back into another big organization. It creates a safety net which can be helpful for more conservative team members looking to push themselves.”\nIt’s Changing Fast Simon Robinson, CEO at Intuitive IP , knows what he’s talking about: He’s been a partner and collaborator to three Seattle-based startups. In addition to nailing the collaborative benefit and the low funding disadvantage, Simon had this to say on the future of Seattle as a startup hub:\n“There is a huge influx of talent coming into the city so I think the desire to innovate and begin the projects will grow, there needs to be a change in philosophy with regard to investing and also the need for companies and individuals who have had successful exits to come back and mentor with the next wave startups.”\nVolt Athletics CEO and co-founder Dan Giuliani backs this up:\n“Seattle boasts a workforce that is exceptionally savvy and experienced in companies of different sizes, from startups to Microsoft and Amazon. The quality of available workforce talent (engineers, marketers, business developers) is impressive, as is the demand for their skills. That might be one of the biggest changes we’ve seen since founding Volt in 2011; the number of Seattle-based professionals with quality startup experience across a variety of sectors.”\nIt’s Still the Wild West Perhaps Dave Hebert, SVP Product at Bellevue-based AI startup DimensionalMechanics , best sums up Seattle’s allure:\n“Seattle’s startup and investment environment really is still a bit like the Wild West. We are not held to a traditional, cookie-cutter approach. Entrepreneurs are free to follow their own path in terms of talent, investment and development strategy. We’ve loved the freedom – and it’s been successful. Co-founders of a startup could not ask for a better combination of circumstances and resources.”\nImage: Wikimedia \n",

      "text": "  10:13 AM EST Bentley Systems to Co-sponsor EFCG’s 2nd Annual A/E/C CIO Conference with Microsoft Bentley Systems today jointly announced with EFCG that it will co-sponsor with Microsoft the 2nd Annual EFCG CIO Conference March 2-3, 2017 in New York City. \nBentley Systems, Incorporated, a leading global provider of comprehensive software solutions for advancing infrastructure , today jointly announced with EFCG that it will co-sponsor with Microsoft the 2 nd Annual EFCG CIO Conference. The conference will take place March 2-3, 2017, in New York City at the Harvard Club & New York Yacht Club. Participation in the conference is limited to 75 and is by invitation only. \n“EFCG is very excited to be teaming with Bentley Systems and Microsoft for our second CIO conference. Our inaugural conference was very successful last year, and we’re thrilled to bring the 15-year history of the Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference, developed by Bentley and Farkas Berkowitz, into our event. Our CIO attendees will benefit enormously from a forum that combines the knowledge and insights of Bentley Systems and Microsoft’s technology roadmap with EFCG’s industry-leading approach to profitably managing A/E/C firms,” said Paul Zofnass, president, EFCG. \n“Bentley Systems is pleased to team with EFCG on this event and to jointly explore information technology challenges that are unique to the firms who engineer and construct infrastructure globally. BIM advancements and 'going digital' strategies have the potential to favorably transform A/E/C business performance when empowered by technology leadership,” said Greg Bentley, CEO, Bentley Systems. \n“Microsoft has a longstanding relationship with Bentley Systems,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president and chief evangelist, Microsoft Corp. “Through the use of Microsoft Azure, we are advancing the way architects, engineers, surveyors, contractors, and their supply chains are designing, operating, and maintaining the world’s infrastructure. CIOs are faced with many challenges and complexities around information technology for engineering and construction including connecting users, enabling better collaboration between project teams, and asset management. Co-sponsoring the EFCG CIO Summit with Bentley Systems is a natural fit and enables us both to help move the industry forward.” \nFor 15 years, Bentley Systems was the prime sponsor of The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology, hosted by Farkas Berkowitz & Company. That event, which had been highly valued by CIOs of large engineering and construction firms, is coming to a close with the well-earned retirement of its managing director, Alan Farkas, of Farkas Berkowitz. \n“As Bentley Systems’ partner in holding the Global IT Summit over the last 15 years, I had a ringside seat on the increasingly important contributions that information technology is making to the engineering and construction industry. IT is slowly but surely transforming our industry and, as it does, CIOs and CTOs are increasingly playing more strategic roles at their firms. The Global IT Summit sought to advance this cause, and I am delighted to know that these efforts will continue with the new partnership between Bentley Systems and EFCG,” said Alan Farkas. \nGreg Bentley continued, “Alan Farkas’s leadership and commitment to The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference over the many years was invaluable to Bentley Systems and to members of the A/E/C community who attended the conference. I want to express my gratitude for all that Alan did to make the conference the success that it has been. We now look forward to working with EFCG, and our co-sponsor Microsoft, to continue to provide a forum for CIOs to share best practices and to explore the business implications of technology advancements in the A/E/C world.” \nAbout the EFCG CIO Conference \nEFCG’s inaugural CIO Conference was held in February 2016. The two-day conference is designed to explore driving business value through IT innovation and transformation and the business and financial implications of the key technology challenges facing CIOs. Each year’s conference is developed in coordination with a select group of industry advisors to ensure the sessions are on topic and directly applicable to the CIOs’ ongoing challenges. This event requires participants to complete a detailed IT survey of their respective organization, and the information is collated and analyzed by EFCG and summarized during the conference to illustrate trends, benchmarks, and key issues facing the industry. Conference size is limited to foster an intimate exchange of ideas among participants. For registration information, contact Joan Zofnass ( ), Director of Conferences.

      "text": "Bentley Systems to Co-sponsor EFCG’s 2nd Annual A/E/C CIO Conference with Microsoft Invitation-only Conference Explores the Transformative Role of Technology on Business Success in the A/E/C Industry \nEXTON, Pa., U.S.A. – Bentley Systems, Incorporated, a leading global provider of comprehensive software solutions for advancing infrastructure , today jointly announced with EFCG that it will co-sponsor with Microsoft the 2nd Annual EFCG CIO Conference. The conference will take place March 2-3, 2017, in New York City at the Harvard Club & New York Yacht Club. Participation in the conference is limited to 75 and is by invitation only. \n“EFCG is very excited to be teaming with Bentley Systems and Microsoft for our second CIO conference. Our inaugural conference was very successful last year, and we’re thrilled to bring the 15-year history of the Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference, developed by Bentley and Farkas Berkowitz, into our event. Our CIO attendees will benefit enormously from a forum that combines the knowledge and insights of Bentley Systems and Microsoft’s technology roadmap with EFCG’s industry-leading approach to profitably managing A/E/C firms,” said Paul Zofnass, president, EFCG. \n“Bentley Systems is pleased to team with EFCG on this event and to jointly explore information technology challenges that are unique to the firms who engineer and construct infrastructure globally. BIM advancements and 'going digital' strategies have the potential to favorably transform A/E/C business performance when empowered by technology leadership,” said Greg Bentley, CEO, Bentley Systems. \n“Microsoft has a longstanding relationship with Bentley Systems,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president and chief evangelist, Microsoft Corp. “Through the use of Microsoft Azure, we are advancing the way architects, engineers, surveyors, contractors, and their supply chains are designing, operating, and maintaining the world’s infrastructure. CIOs are faced with many challenges and complexities around information technology for engineering and construction including connecting users, enabling better collaboration between project teams, and asset management. Co-sponsoring the EFCG CIO Summit with Bentley Systems is a natural fit and enables us both to help move the industry forward.” \nFor 15 years, Bentley Systems was the prime sponsor of The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology, hosted by Farkas Berkowitz & Company. That event, which had been highly valued by CIOs of large engineering and construction firms, is coming to a close with the well-earned retirement of its managing director, Alan Farkas, of Farkas Berkowitz. \n“As Bentley Systems’ partner in holding the Global IT Summit over the last 15 years, I had a ringside seat on the increasingly important contributions that information technology is making to the engineering and construction industry. IT is slowly but surely transforming our industry and, as it does, CIOs and CTOs are increasingly playing more strategic roles at their firms. The Global IT Summit sought to advance this cause, and I am delighted to know that these efforts will continue with the new partnership between Bentley Systems and EFCG,” said Alan Farkas. Greg Bentley continued, “Alan Farkas’s leadership and commitment to The Global Summit for Leaders in Information Technology conference over the many years was invaluable to Bentley Systems and to members of the A/E/C community who attended the conference. I want to express my gratitude for all that Alan did to make the conference the success that it has been. We now look forward to working with EFCG, and our co-sponsor Microsoft, to continue to provide a forum for CIOs to share best practices and to explore the business implications of technology advancements in the A/E/C world.” About the EFCG CIO Conference \nEFCG’s inaugural CIO Conference was held in February 2016. The two-day conference is designed to explore driving business value through IT innovation and transformation and the business and financial implications of the key technology challenges facing CIOs. Each year’s conference is developed in coordination with a select group of industry advisors to ensure the sessions are on topic and directly applicable to the CIOs’ ongoing challenges. This event requires participants to complete a detailed IT survey of their respective organization, and the information is collated and analyzed by EFCG and summarized during the conference to illustrate trends, benchmarks, and key issues facing the industry. Conference size is limited to foster an intimate exchange of ideas among participants. For registration information, contact Joan Zofnass ( ), Director of Conferences.

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio Packs A Hidden ARM Processor By Adnan Farooqui on 11/29/2016 09:06 PST \nThe Microsoft Surface Studio is a very powerful all-in-one Windows PC that’s made by Redmond itself. It has now started sending out units to pre-order customers which means that it was only a matter of time before the folks over at iFixit did a teardown to see what’s inside. They have found something interesting. Apparently, the Microsoft Surface Studio packs a hidden ARM processor inside. \nA hidden ARM processor that the company didn’t talk about when it announced this device was the interesting discovery. This Atmel ATSAMS70N21 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 process is actually used to aid in powering the Surface Studio’s PixelSense display. iFixit notes that “here’s way more silicon hiding in this unit than in the base.” \niFixit has awarded Microsoft’s first all-in-one PC with a repairability score of 5 out of 10. It’s not that easy to repair even though the base can be easily opened and there are some modular components like the SATA hard drive and M.2 SSD. The display can be replaced easily as well. \nHowever, some of the most important components are not easily replaceable. The CPU, GPU , and RAM are all soldered to the motherboard so they can’t be swapped out easily. That was to be expected from an all-in-one as slim as the Surface Studio. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nMicrosoft wants to stop supporting its Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) because all of the security features have been baked into Windows 10. A vulnerability analyst says Windows with EMET offers additional security protections not available in standalone Windows 10. \n\"Even a Windows 7 system with EMET configured protects your application more than a stock Windows 10 system,\" said Will Dormann, a vulnerability analyst with the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute. [ InfoWorld's deep look: Why (and how) you should manage Windows 10 PCs like iPhones . | The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. ] \nOriginally introduced in 2009, EMET adds exploit mitigations, including address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP), to Windows systems to make it harder for malware to trigger unpatched vulnerabilities. Since Windows 10 includes EMET’s anti-exploit protections by default, Microsoft is planning to end-of-life the free tool in July 2018. CERT’s Dormann said Microsoft should keep supporting the toolkit because Windows 10 does not provide all of the application-specific mitigations available in EMET. \n“Windows 10 does indeed provide some nice exploit mitigations. The problem is that the software you are running needs to be specifically compiled to take advantage of them,” Dormann said. OS-level vs application-level defenses \nDormann argues that Microsoft should keep supporting the toolkit -- currently EMET 5.51 -- because it provides both system-wide protection and application-specific mitigations that make the toolkit relevant for Windows security, even on Windows 10 systems. \nEMET’s system-wide protections include the aforementioned ASLR and DEP, Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), Certificate Trust (Pinning), and Block Untrusted Fonts. EMET’s application-specific protections include DEP, SEHOP, ASLR, Null Page Allocation, Heapspray Allocations, Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF), Export Address Table Access Filtering Plus (EAF+), Bottom-up Randomization (BottomUP ASLR), Attack Surface Reduction (ASR), Block Untrusted Fonts, and Return-Oriented Programming mitigations. \nMicrosoft’s principal lead program for OS security, Jeffrey Sutherland, recently said that users should upgrade to Windows 10 since the latest operating system natively includes the security features provided by EMET. That is true to some extent, as DEP, SEHOP, ASLR, BottomupASLR, and ROP mitigation (as Control Flow Guard) are part of Windows 10, but many of the application-specific mitigations are not. \nWhat Sutherland neglected to consider was that most Windows administrators rely on EMET to apply all of the available exploit mitigations to applications. Consider that a Windows 10 system with EMET properly configured has 13 additional mitigations -- the application-specific controls -- than a standalone Windows 10 system. \n\"It is pretty clear that an application running on a stock Windows 10 system does not have the same protections as one running on a Windows 10 system with EMET properly configured,\" Dormann said. Application defenses still lagging \nWindows 10 may be the most secure Windows ever , but the applications have to be compiled to utilize the exploit mitigation features to actually benefit from those enhanced security features . For example, if the application isn’t designed to use Control Flow Guard, then the application doesn’t benefit from Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) defenses, despite the fact that Control Flow Guard is part of Windows 10. \n\"Out of all of the applications you run in your enterprise, do you know which ones are built with Control Flow Guard support? If an application is not built to use Control Flow Guard, it doesn't matter if your underlying operating system supports it or not,\" Dormann said. \nThe problem isn’t limited to just third-party and custom enterprise applications as there are some older -- but still widely used -- Microsoft applications which don’t access the advanced exploit mitigations. For example, Microsoft does not compile all of Office 2010 with the /DYNAMICBASE flag to indicate compatibility with ASLR. An attacker could potentially bypass ASLR and exploit a memory corruption vulnerability by loading a malicious library into the vulnerable application’s process space. \nIronically, administrators would protect the application from being targeted in this way by running EMET with application-specific mitigations. \n\"Because we cannot rely on all software vendors to produce code that uses all the exploit mitigations available, EMET puts this control back in our hands,\" Dormann said. Don’t pick sides; do both \nMicrosoft says to start migrating to Windows 10 and stop using EMET by 2018. A senior engineer at CERT, tasked by the United States Department of Homeland Security to make security recommendations of national significance, says EMET still offers better security than standalone Windows 10. What is a Windows administrator to do? \nThe answer, according to Dormann, is to follow both recommendations: Upgrade to Windows 10 to take advantage of native exploit mitigation features, and install EMET to apply application-specific mitigations. \nEMET will continue to keep working even after its end-of-life date, which means administrators can still use the tool to protect unsupported software against possible zero-day vulnerabilities. Several other Microsoft applications are nearing their end-of-life dates, including Microsoft Office 2007. Administrators can continue to use EMET to protect these applications from attacks looking for zero-day vulnerabilities. \n“With such out-of-support applications, it is even more important to provide additional exploit protection with a product like EMET,” Dormann said. \nIt’s possible that with Microsoft’s new Windows-as-a-service model, the remaining EMET defenses will be added to Windows 10 before the end-of-life date, at which point Windows 10 would be able to handle the application-specific protections without EMET. \nUntil then, EMET is “still an important tool to help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities,” Dormann said.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 12 minutes ago \nLast week, among its many Black Friday deals in the US, Microsoft launched the 'HP Elite x3 Holiday Bundle', priced at $1,149 . It was the first discount on HP's Windows 10 Mobile flagship phone since it launched in September for $799, including the Desk Dock accessory that supports the operating system's PC-like Continuum mode . \nThe Holiday Bundle included not just the Desk Dock, but also the notebook style Lap Dock - which is usually priced at an additional $599 - as well as a case and screen protector for the phone. Microsoft reduced the cost of the bundle further over the holiday weekend, dropping its price to just $999 . \nThe small print on the Microsoft Store listing for the bundle stated that the deal was due to end on Cyber Monday, November 28. But Microsoft has quietly extended that offer; it's now scheduled to continue until December 3 instead. \nAt its current price of $999, the bundle offers savings of $462 (around 32%) compared with buying each item separately at full price. \nIf you're thinking of buying the Elite x3, make sure you read our detailed review first .",

The Node.js platform is already available on a variety of VMs, like Samsung’s JerryScript , a lightweight JavaScript engine for the Internet of Things. While many steps are needed to allow Node.js to work in VM environments outside of V8, the work the Node.js API working group and ChakraCore are doing are important steps to offer greater choice. Today, we are excited to announce several initial milestones in these efforts. The first is centered around Node.js API (ABI Stable Module API or NAPI for short), which is focused on defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in V8.",

      "text": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Gets in Bed With the Enemy Microsoft and Linux? Yes. And it's a match made in heaven for MSFT stock. By Aaron Levitt , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 29, 2016, 10:15 am EST View All Posts \nTech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) just did one of the biggest 180-degree turnarounds in policy history. The move wasn’t announced with much fanfare or an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) style release party. No, it was basically swept under the rug. \nBut the move could be one of the biggest in Microsoft’s history, signal a massive shift in business operations and boost MSFT stock to boot. \nMicrosfot is embracing open-source software. What a time to be alive! \nThis might not seem like a big deal, but it’s a complete reversal of “Mister Softee’s” previous take on Linux and other open-source programming software suites. And it could be huge over the long-term. Microsoft and Linux (Typically) Don’t Mix \nTo say that Microsoft and Linux haven’t exactly been buddies over the last few years is putting it mildly. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer once called Red Hat Inc’s (NYSE: RHT ) distribution of the open-source program a “cancer.” \nThere was good reason, at least initially. Microsoft dominated the home and business computer market. It created an ecosystem that it wanted total control of, and open source software — or software platforms developed and built on user collaboration — was a threat to its licensing business model. You couldn’t give away your code for free and risk losing out on that revenue or potential patents if someone were to tweak it and make it better. \nTo that end, MSFT spent the good part of a decade battling Linux and trying to snuff it out . That even included legal action at the federal level. \nSo the fact that Microsoft has decided to join the main open source trade group — the Linux Foundation — as a high-paying Platinum member is earth-shattering. This is oil and water, cats and dogs, Red Sox and Yankees … all playing nice. \nAnd that ultimately should benefit MSFT stock. Microsoft’s Future Is in Enterprise \nHas Microsoft had a change of heart under new CEO Satya Nadella? Nope, this isn’t a kinder and cuddlier company. This is just about making money. \nNadella knows that the PC is dying — or at least becoming less relevant in its current form, and that’s likely to continue down the road. That’s why MSFT has been pushing so hard into the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and cloud enterprise/server markets. \nThe thing is, tech people like to tinker, and that’s not necessarily possible within a locked system. Cloud, server and super computers are predominantly run on Linux and other open-source programs because it provides the freedom most IT/tech people want and crave. All of its major competitors — Amazon.com, Inc’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Compute, OpenStack and more run on Linux.",
