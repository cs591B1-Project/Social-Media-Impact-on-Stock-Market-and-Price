Fights, witty lines, secret marriages, and untimely deaths--the play is unforgettable! \nHere are a some of the most significant and memorable lines from this beloved late-Sixteenth Century play. \"What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? / Not having that, which, having, makes them short. /In love? / Out -- / Of love? Out of her favor, where I am in love.\" -William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet 1.1 \n\"One fairer than my love?

      "text": "Summary \nDonald Trump's trade agenda is aggressive to say the least. \nIf he manages to actually break down NAFTA, companies like Ford will be faced with big decisions. \nConsidering he is working with a large Republican Congress, I'm led to believe that a combination of tax incentives would need to be infused into any such trade moves. \nIf there can somehow be a combination of Trade barriers infused with economic incentives for producing within the states, a better end result can be achieved. An imperative problem Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) makes a ton of money from manufacturing in Mexico. The damage of a 35% tariff would be a big deal.. There is a strong case for how much auto manufacturing we're losing in non competitive free trade. Consider the simple fact that over $23 billion worth of cars are imported from Mexico every year. In hilarious contrast, the United States is shipping a measly $3.1 billion to Mexico. Nissan sends 40% of what it makes in Mexico into the states. As a non American firm, Trump makes a fair point in questioning why we would let this slide. Considering we want American firms to be more competitive, why let Nissan cheat American workers on manufacturing in Mexico and then ship them here to sell? When it comes to Ford it hits closer to home. We don't really want policies that will damage an American corporation. That's not to say frustrations are unjustified. Ford has made it clear that it doesn't consider itself wholly American. Chief Executive Mark Fields has made it clear that the multinational company will work in its best interests before those of the United States. This isn't inherently a bad thing. All business is first and foremost about growth and profitability. The imperative to our country is to make sure corporate profits benefit the United States more than anywhere else. It doesn't add up to allow companies to boost margins whilst using less American workers. To me, the ideal situation is to lower corporate tax rates on all firms that move operations home, while increasing tariffs on those that remain abroad. You have to provide incentive, not just a punishment. Alas my economic ideology holds no value here. We're dealing with something else. What will Trump's ideas do to Ford and subsequently its stock? Leveraging the cost of Trumponomics A tariff situation would obviously be meant to remove the disparity between foreign manufacturing costs and those here. While I doubt the situation will actually go all the way a 35% tariff, Mexican wages in Autos are only 18% of the American alternative. So forcing work home will take a chunk out of Ford profits. Returning all work from Mexico would involve an 82% jump in wage costs across a large section of the firms overall labor. There are two ways to look at that. 1. You're drastically increasing payouts to American workers. 2. You're hampering Ford's margins, which would in turn drive up prices of cars. Again my feelings come back into play here. This is the moment in the equation where they should eliminate Ford's taxes so that they can keep car prices down, whilst still paying the more expensive American salaries. Considering that Trump is working with a majority party that likes tax cuts, I'm hopeful that driving up costs for companies that forcing more production the United States would be followed with tax cuts that can offset those expenses. That way you're improving employment while lowering taxes. It's a win-win. Another very important thing is that you cannot simply do this to American car companies like Ford and General Motors (NYSE: GM ). You have to make sure foreign competitors don't keep the advantage. Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) would all have to be taxed. In the coming chaos as the debate grows, it is very possible that these stocks take a hit as the tariff threat grows. This chaos could present a buying opportunity.

      "text": "\n[Spoilers below.]\nWhere would Westworld be without mystery? From Ford’s backstory to “How’d they make that sex robot orgy ?,” each episode piles on the questions, and it doesn’t help that HBO is encouraging us to keep the fan theories coming . That’s why we made a video diving into one of the most important mysteries: Is Arnold, the park’s co-creator, still alive? And is he working to destroy Westworld?\nWhat if instead of dying in an accident, Arnold managed to upload his consciousness into the Westworld mainframe? This would allow him to communicate directly with the hosts and influence how they act. There have been clues supporting this, such as Dolores hearing a voice in her head and the bandit host Walter calling out to Arnold after his crazed killing spree. (This capability would also be why the Man in Black is so hellbent on finding the mainframe — he wants to upload his own consciousness and live forever.) As a part of the mainframe, Arnold is trying to figure out how to control the hosts, which is is why so many hosts seem to be malfunctioning and going against their programming. And once he can command an army of hosts, there would be nothing stopping him from fulfilling his last words to D0lores by destroying Westworld.\nBut why would he want to do this? On possibility: It all comes back to his love for Dolores. It’s what ruined them both. Arnold realized that even though he created her, she had a soul, so he wanted to set her free. This goes directly against Ford viewing Dolores and all other hosts as nothing more than pleasure bots. Ford blames her for corrupting Arnold, which is why he punishes her with cruel fates every day of her existence. So in order to free the woman he loves, crush Ford, and destroy the prison he helped to create, Arnold has to use its inhabitants to bring it all come crashing down.\n",

      "text": "Call it the Jonathan Gruber election. Gruber is the Ford professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He got his Ph.D. at Harvard. As a White House consultant, he helped to design Obamacare and was then caught afterward on videotape explaining its passage by talking about \"the stupidity of the American voter.\"\nWell, if anyone is \"stupid\" in this story, it's not the voters, but the academics that in their hubris designed an Affordable Care Act that became so unpopular that it became a decisive factor in Hillary Clinton's defeat. These economists and health care experts—Jonathan Gruber and people like him—have fancy graduate degrees, but they designed a law whose results aren't exactly making them or the politicians they advised look like geniuses.\nAsra Q. Nomani, a Muslim woman immigrant who voted in Virginia for Donald Trump, explained in a Washington Post column that she did so in part because, \"I am a single mother who can't afford health insurance under Obamacare.\"\nA friend of mine reported that while volunteering for the Clinton campaign in Pennsylvania, she encountered one voter who had just gotten off the phone with her health insurance company, \"battling an astronomical increase in premiums. A cancer survivor, she had lost her favorite doctor when she went onto Obamacare two years earlier. Now her rates were going up.\" That voter wound up supporting Trump, too.\nA Politico postmortem of the Clinton campaign reported, \"The soaring Obamacare premiums announced last month hurt Clinton, some said.\"\nEven Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, conceded in a post-election article : \"Americans want reform to Obamacare— Democrats included. We must bring down the costs of health insurance and the cost of health care.\"\nWhat was Obamacare, in the end, but an arrogant overreach by an elite out of touch with the rest of America?\nIf that seems like an exaggeration, look at the election data. In Cambridge, home to Harvard and MIT—Gruber Country—Clinton won won 89.2 percent of the vote. That's nearly Saddam Hussein level. It was the highest percentage of any town or city in the entire state, 28.4 percentage points ahead of Clinton's 60.8 percent of the vote statewide in Democrat-leaning Massachusetts. In New Haven—the Cambridge of Connecticut, home to Yale—Clinton drew 86 percent of the vote. The only place she did better in the entire Nutmeg State was Hartford, where she drew 90.2 percent. In Hanover, N.H., home to Dartmouth College, Clinton won 84.9 percent of the vote—by far her strongest showing in any town in that entire swing state. F\nFor a comparative baseline, Clinton drew 54.5 percent of the vote statewide in Connecticut, 47.6 percent statewide in New Hampshire, and about 48 percent nationwide.\nOther than Ivy League college towns, areas that went overwhelmingly for Clinton include places like Manhattan (85.9 percent); San Francisco (85.3 percent), and Washington, D.C. (93 percent).\nTrump mentioned Professor Gruber by name in the second presidential debate. When a reporter from the Boston Business Journal reached Professor Gruber for his reaction after the election, he pronounced himself \"stunned\" at Trump's victory but nonetheless characterized the Affordable Care Act as \"one of the greatest social accomplishments of our lifetime.\"\nIf the \"accomplishment\" is that the American electorate is now blaming their high health care bills on Democratic politicians, rather than on doctors, drug companies, or insurance executives, it is indeed pretty great, though perhaps not exactly in the way Professor Gruber intended it to be.\nIt is, as well, however, a cautionary tale for Republicans who hope to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. If voters are going to start blaming politicians for their health insurance and medical bills, the anger in the next election could be directed at the Republicans who now hold control of the White House and both houses of Congress. If the Republicans hope to do better than President Obama, Clinton, and Professor Gruber, they may want to start from the premise that American voters aren't stupid.\n",

      "text": "by Jack Browne 12m ago Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports / Reuters \nStatistics don't always truly highlight how well a player is performing, especially early on in the season when anomalies are frequent. \nBut normally after 10 weeks of the NFL season, the cream has risen to the top of the statistical charts, with the usual names leading categories like passing yards, tackles, and interceptions. \nSome of the 2016 season's stats, however, are led by some names that'll make you double take: Passing yards - Matt Ryan \nAs a noted franchise quarterback, Ryan is not exactly an obscure name. But after a disappointing 2015 season, few predicted the Atlanta Falcons pivot would be leading the NFL in passing with 3,247 yards in 10 games. Admittedly, Drew Brees is right with him, having thrown 255 less yards with a game in hand, but that shouldn't take away the fact that not only would Ryan's on-pace mark of 5,200 yards shatter his previous career best, it would be the fourth-highest total all time. Sacks - Lorenzo Alexander/Dee Ford \nA journeyman player who's spent most of his career on special teams and a supposed first-rounder bust lead the league in sacks. Alexander of the Buffalo Bills and Ford of the Kansas City Chiefs both have 10 sacks, edging usual sack star Von Miller , who has 9.5. They're taking advantage of a down year for sack artists with the likes of J.J. Watt and Justin Houston sidelined, but even the most optimistic Bills or Chiefs fan couldn't have imagined this kind of production. Yards per attempt - Jay Ajayi \nAjayi looked close to being done with the Miami Dolphins after the running back was a healthy scratch for disciplinary reasons in Week 1. But Arian Foster's injuries - and subsequent retirement - opened the door for Ajayi, and he hasn't looked back. The second-year player is leading the league with a 5.7 yards per attempt average that's boosted by back-to-back 200-yard games. If Ajayi had been the Dolphins' featured back for the whole season, he'd likely be the league's leading rusher, or close to it. Tackles - Christian Kirksey \nYes, Kirksey , a third-year linebacker for the Cleveland Browns , is an actual player. Not only that, but he has more tackles (94) than the likes of Bobby Wagner and Luke Kuechly . Kirksey has already blown past his career-best marks, and while his stats are more reflective of the Browns constantly being run on when down big rather than his talent, it's still a shock to see him sitting atop the chart. Rushing touchdowns - LeGarrette Blount \nNow that Marshawn Lynch has retired, New England Patriots running back Blount has become the epitome of the old-school, punishing style of running back. His greatest asset has always been his skills at the goal line, as highlighted during his first stint with New England in 2013 when he produced seven rushing scores. But Blount is playing at a whole new level in 2016. His three scores in Week 10 pushed his season total to 12, three more than the closest player. Even more surprising is that his numbers have gotten better since the return of Tom Brady .",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nThe Blue Oval's smallest crossover SUV has been a staple of its lineup in Europe, South America, and Asia for a few years now. Now the EcoSport, which shares some of its underpinnings with the subcompact Fiesta, will make its U.S. debut in L.A. \nThe U.S. version of the EcoSport may get a new face, but it's otherwise expected to be similar to the European version, shown. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A new global Jeep to replace two current models \nFCA gave us a preview of the all-new 2017 Jeep Compass in September, including the photos you see below (and not much else). FCA hasn't shared a lot of details yet, but we know that the Compass will replace both the current Compass and its brawnier (but similarly sized) sibling, the Jeep Patriot, when it arrives in the U.S. early next year. It's expected that FCA will build the all-new Compass in Mexico . \nThe all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will replace Jeep's current Compass and Patriot models. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. \nThe all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will arrive at U.S. dealers in the first quarter of 2017. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Toyota gears up to take on Honda's HR-V \nToyota is jumping into the small-crossover fray with its all-new C-HR, a model that was originally planned for the discontinued Scion brand. The C-HR is built on the highly flexible Toyota New Global Architecture that also underpins the new-for-2016 Prius. \nIn U.S. trim, the C-HR is expected to come with Toyota's mainstay 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. \nToyota showed off the all-new C-HR crossover at the Paris Motor Show in October. The U.S. version is expected to be similar. Image source: Toyota. Something brand-new: A big Subaru \nFuji Heavy Industries ' (NASDAQOTH: FUJHY) quirky-but-beloved Subaru brand is expected to launch a \"three-row\" 7-passenger crossover SUV in L.A. This new Subaru will replace the Tribeca, a model that never quite caught on with brand loyalists. Being a Subaru, standard all-wheel drive is a safe bet, as is a choice between the brand's mainstay 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and its larger 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. Will Volkswagen bring a new electric car to Los Angeles? \nVolkswagen (NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) took the wraps off its overhauled Golf lineup in Germany earlier this month. But it didn't show an expected battery-electric version of the compact hatchback, leading your humble Fool (among others) to speculate that VW was saving its electric Golf for the L.A. show. \nAlong with (maybe!) the battery-operated Golf, VW will surely show off its new 2018 Atlas crossover . The Atlas was designed specifically for the U.S. market as a direct competitor to rivals like Toyota's Highlander and Ford's Explorer. \nThe all-new 2018 VolkswagenAtlas. Image source: Volkswagen. \nThe Atlas will be built at VW's factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, starting next spring. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Ford wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7 , 2016 John Rosevear owns shares of Ford.

      "text": "What is it? A subcompact crossover packed with technology. Or maybe it’s a high-tech playroom that happens to move people around. Ford’s putting the focus on features, more than the vehicle itself. It’s aimed at people “choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff,” Ford said. It “keeps you connected with family and friends when on the move.”\nFord EcoSport subcompact crossover Ford Motor Ford EcoSport subcompact crossover Ford EcoSport subcompact crossover (Ford Motor) Why it matters Until now, Ford’s been a non-player in the hot market for subcompact crossovers. Now it hopes to leap ahead by appealing to young customers who are more interested in smartphones than engine specs. Ford is “kind of late to the party,” said Karl Brauer, analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “But there’s still plenty of juice left in the market. If (the EcoSport) is well executed they’ll get attention and sales.”\nWhat’s new Two USB ports. A 12-volt power outlet. Up to 30 stowage pockets, bins and hooks. Ford’s Sync 3 information system with voice recognition. Seven ambient lighting options for the cabin. An eight-inch “floating” touch-screen that you don’t quite have to touch with your finger. An extra-sensitive FM antenna. An 675-watt B&O sound system for the highest-end model.\nEcoSport interior features an eight-inch touchscreen. Ford Motor EcoSport interior features an eight-inch touchscreen. EcoSport interior features an eight-inch touchscreen. (Ford Motor) The competition It’s a crowded field, but potential buyers are likely to look at the Honda HR-V and the Mazda CX-3. Both are packed with dashboard technology, though not as packed at the EcoSport (only 1 USB port!). All are more traditional looking than the boxy Kia Soul and the curvy Nissan Juke.\nThe details Almost as an afterthought, Ford notes that two engines will be offered, a 1.0-liter three-cylinder and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with four-wheel drive, in four trim levels, all with six-speed automatic transmissions. The EcoSport hits dealerships early in 2018.\nCaption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides , California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses , UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years , and L.A.

      "text": "Jack's Journal: The Ford Mustang Posted: Updated: By Jack O'Malley \n“The Mustang debuted in April of 1964, and it absolutely was a runaway sales success and it created a new segment for American car manufacturers,” says Jonathan Klinger, Hagerty. \nThe Mustang was introduced at the New York World’s Fair early in 1964 and it created a storm. \nUp to then, Detroit was building large heavy comfy cars. There was nothing to rival the European lightweight, tight handling car, until the Mustang. \nIt introduced the pony car, the smaller vehicle with the big engine to the muscle car segment and Ford gave the buyer options. \n“So out comes the Mustang and it was an instant success. The neat thing was you could order a Mustang as simple as a six cylinder engine, low options and very affordable. Within a couple of years, Ford cranked out examples of big block engines, high horse power. Absolutely fueled the muscle car craze of the late 60s and early 70s,” explains Jonathan. \nThe other car companies were now in catch up mode. Another great idea from Ford was to contact the young racing hero of the day, Caroll Shelby and had him design versions of the Mustang. That also attracted the gear head of the day. \n“He loves tinkering and modifying cars. Ford made a genius decision teaming up with him. Caroll Shelby is synonymous with Mustang and Ford. Right up to his death a few years ago,” says Jonathan. \nThe Mustang, an instant American classic, has been continuously made since 1964 and still leads the pony car competition. \nIt was also one of the cars that started the retro movement in the mid-2000s with its retro version Mustang always leading the pack.

      "title": "Ford EcoSport finally comes to America",
      "text": "By : Jeff Perez , Editor Ford's feisty new EcoSport CUV is ready for its American debut. Ford has officially tossed its hat into the ring for the largest range of SUVs in the industry. This is the new EcoSport – the smallest SUV in Ford's global lineup and destined, finally, for the North American market. Making its debut at the LA Auto Show this week, the EcoSport introduces an all-new design and range of engine options, building on the versatile Fiesta B2E platform that was first introduced in 2002. The most noticeable changes are in the fascia, which foregoes the gaping lower grille and slim upper grille on previous models in place of a more family-friendly look – the Ford family, that is. Equipped with the choice of either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (depending on the trim), the new EcoSport utilizes a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine, or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, both paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive can be had exclusively with the 2.0-liter engine and upper-level SES and Titanium trims. In the cabin, Ford’s Sync 3 entertainment system sits front and center in an 8-inch screen that juts up from the dash. The new EcoSport also includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing for seamless connectivity between smartphones, and an available Sync Connect with FordPass app that allows users to start, lock, and unlock the vehicle using Bluetooth. All that connectivity is good news, considering the EcoSport also comes equipped with two fast-charging USB ports, a 12-volt power outlet, an available 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console, and another 12-volt outlet in the rear. As many as 30 stowage pockets, bins, and hooks also line the interior, putting to use nearly every inch of available storage space. Pictured here in SES trim, the interior is seen wearing a black and copper finish with two-tone leather and cloth seats. The exterior is available in 10 different color options, while the interior offers as many as seven ambient lighting options. Ford has yet to announce pricing options, but expect it to cost around $20,000 when it goes on sale later next year.

The EcoSport – a fun, capable, connected compact SUV – stars in the world’s first-ever vehicle reveal on Snapchat, kicking off a Hollywood pop-up event open to the public through Wednesday evening. \nThe interactive event showcases how EcoSport is a perfect companion for those who believe in going small and living big. “More people are choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff,” said Chantel Lenard, executive director, Ford U.S. marketing. “EcoSport fits perfectly into this growing lifestyle. It’s our smallest SUV, packed with features and personality.” \nFun sound, color and style \nEcoSport’s available premium B&O PLAY audio system brings your music to life. HARMAN acoustic engineers spent hundreds of hours perfecting the in-vehicle music experience. The Ford-exclusive B&O PLAY audio system, standard on EcoSport Titanium, features 10 speakers, including B&O PLAY-branded tweeters and woofers in the front doors and a subwoofer in back. The 675-watt system unlocks the power of your favorite music and transforms every drive into a “living big” experience. \nEcoSport also features available HD Radio technology, SiriusXM® satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals. \nCustomers looking to stand apart from the crowd will find plenty of ways to personalize their EcoSport. Along with 10 exterior color choices, there are seven ambient lighting options and four trim level offerings – S, SE, SES and Titanium. All series feature a swing-gate-style tailgate. The personality-packed SES series makes the biggest splash. It features Intelligent 4WD, sport- tuned suspension and steering, and unique styling cues inside and out – including bold copper accents for the interior and sport seats. \nConnected technology \nEcoSport makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family with SYNC® 3, Ford’s communications and entertainment system. Faster, more intuitive and easier to use, the system provides more conversational voice recognition and enhanced response to driver commands. Optimized for hands-free use, SYNC 3 for EcoSport is coupled with a touch screen similar to a smartphone or tablet. The 8-inch screen gives front-row occupants easy access to operate available Apple CarPlayTM and Android AutoTM commands, and B&O PLAY audio settings. Drivers also have the ability to start, lock, unlock and locate their vehicle from almost anywhere using available SYNC Connect with FordPass®. The mobile app lets owners view vehicle information, such as the fuel level and odometer reading, when not in the vehicle. \nEcoSport features two fast-charging USB ports to ensure owners’ devices are always juiced. Plus, there’s a 12-volt power outlet. An available 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console and another 12-volt outlet allow rear seat passengers to stay plugged in, too. Capable, powerful and sporty Equipped with either the award-winning, 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost® or 2.0- liter four-cylinder, EcoSport provides power and control. Drivers opting for the 2.0-liter engine get Ford’s Intelligent 4WD standard. Both come with six-speed automatic transmissions. As many as 30 stowage pockets, bins, hooks make efficient use of every interior inch. A cargo management system at the rear features a movable floor board and fold-away second-row seats to provide a flat area for moving furniture and other larger items. \nEcoSport consumer experience in Hollywood \nLocated at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, the Ford EcoSport Go Small, Live Big experience is open to the public Tuesday and Wednesday from 2 to 10 p.m. Registration and tickets are managed by FordPresents.com. \nThe EcoSport event consumer experiences include: \nSmall stage, big entertainment: A sound and light environment showcases the EcoSport \naudio system, ambient lighting and LED display.

      "text": "\n-Ford was one of the early contenders in the compact-crossover segment, beating most of its competitors to market when it launched the Escape back in 2000 as a 2001 model. Among subcompact crossovers, however, which are surging in popularity much like compacts did 15 years ago, Ford has been remiss in not offering one here in its home market. Ford didn’t have to look far to solve that problem, since it already has the EcoSport that it has been selling in numerous other markets around the world for some time. Freshened for 2018, the EcoSport finally will come to America, and Ford is underscoring its arrival by choosing the Los Angeles auto show as the site of the revised model’s global debut.

      "text": "Android Auto \nFord may be an American car company, but it doesn’t sell every model it makes in the United States. Since 2003, one of the holdouts has been the EcoSport , a mini SUV sold in South America, China, and Asia, but not here. \nThat’s about to change, though. The EcoSport made its North American debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, and will go on sale here in “early 2018,” according to Ford. The version to be sold in North America will be an updated version of the second-generation EcoSport that has been available in other parts of the world since 2012. \nThe EcoSport is much smaller than the current Ford Escape , giving the Blue Oval an entry into the burgeoning subcompact crossover segment that includes models like the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, and Mazda CX-3. Just as the larger Escape is based on the Focus compact, the EcoSport is based on the Fiesta subcompact. \nMore: 2017 Chevrolet Spark Activ debuts at 2016 L.A. Auto Show \nStyling is a case of “honey, I shrunk the Escape.” The grille and headlights bear a familial resemblance to the larger Ford and, like the Escape, the overall shape isn’t as boxy as a traditional SUV, but isn’t as sleek as a car, either. The EcoSport features a swing-gate-style tailgate rather than the roof-hinged versions offered on most other crossovers. This roof-hinged style accommodated a tailgate-mounted spare tire, an old-school feature Ford no longer offers on the EcoSport. \nIn the U.S., the EcoSport will be offered with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, or the 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost three-cylinder engine already used in the Fiesta and Focus. Both engines will be paired with six-speed automatic transmissions, and all-wheel drive will be standard with the 2.0-liter unit. \nThe EcoSport will be available with Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system , which features an 8-inch touchscreen display and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. A 10-speaker B&O Play audio system will also come standard on the top Titanium trim level. it’s one of the first products of a partnership between Ford and B&O Play parent Harman announced in September . Given the EcoSport’s scheduled 2018 arrival in dealerships, it’ll be a while before anyone can test out the fancy system.",

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Carlos Osorio/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, November 14, 2016, 11:49 PM \nFrom sports to politics, 2016 has been a year for surprises and upsets, but in the automotive world, these four overdogs still reign supreme. \nFord, Honda, Porsche and Mazda all landed on U.S. News & World Report’s list of Best Vehicle Brands for the second year in a row. \nPart of a series of car rankings produced by U.S. News that includes Best Cars for the Money and Best Cars for Families, the annual Best Vehicle Brand awards recognize automakers for their safety, reliability and a standing in the auto industry based on a composite of scores from their latest models. \nBoasting the best-selling truck lineup, yet again, was Ford for the Best Truck Brand. For the 2017 model year, the F-150 adds a 2.5-liter EcoBoost V6, Ford’s new 10-speed automatic transmission and a redesigned, high-performance Raptor offering. \nA freshly redesigned Super Duty lineup includes all-aluminum bodies with high-strength steel frames to match the updated F-150 rolled out during the 2015 model year. They also offer increased maximum towing capacity and payload to go along with the more power gas and turbodiesel engines. 2016 Honda CRV. (Honda) \nWith a redesigned Pilot in the midsize SUV segment, high accolades for the HR-V and CR-V crossovers, as well as the Odyssey minivan, Honda once again earned the title of Best SUV Brand. \nThrough the first 10 months of this year, the Honda CR-V has been the best-selling SUV in the U.S., but don't expect Honda to be complacent. Redesigned for the 2017 model year, the CR-V will feature new styling inside and out, a brand-new turbocharged four-cylinder engine, fresh body and chassis designs as well as a more spacious interior. \nAlso, look for Honda to add to its SUV lineup when it rolls out the highly-anticipated C-HR compact crossover for the 2018 model year. \nCredit Porsche's back-to-back run as Best Luxury Brand to the popularity of comfortable crossovers, such as the Cayenne and Macan, coupled with sporty stalwarts like the Cayman, Boxster and 911. Even the recently redesigned Panamera sedan earned a shout-out from U.S. News. 2016 Porsche Cayenne (Porsche) \nPorsche has been a rare bright spot for the Volkswagen Group this year, as it the German company deals with the fallout from an emissions scandal that broke last fall. \nLast but not least, Mazda reclaims the title of Best Car Brand thanks to the popularity of the Mazda3 sedan and MX-5 Miata sports coupe. Those vehicles, along with the Mazda6, CX-3 and CX-5, all earned recognition in the inaugural Daily News Autos Awards given out during the New York Auto Show in March. \nMazda has developed a reputation for building fun, reliable vehicles that won't break your bank. Look for more of the same from refreshed versions of the Mazda3, Mazda6, CX-3 and Miata in 2017. Join the Conversation:",

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Ford EcoSport will be imported from India. It is making its debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Ford Ford EcoSport is the newest, smallest SUV in the lineup Ford Ford says EcoSport delivers a fun, capable and connected driving Ford All Ford EcoSport models feature swing-gate-style tailgate.

And the introduction came with a big surprise. \nIn what may be a first among Detroit's Big 3 automakers, EcoSport is going to be made in India and imported into the U.S. \nGeneral Motors recently started importing the Buick Envision SUV from China, but Ford is rare in choosing to import EcoSport -- what will become its smallest crossover -- from Chennai, India, when it goes on sale in 2018. \nFord has come under attack in recent months from President-elect Donald Trump for moving production of small cars from the U.S. to Mexico. All other major automakers also have expanded and built new plants in Mexico. EcoSport is also made in Brazil. \n\"We build EcoSport in six locations around the globe. We sell it in 100 markets, and so, just like we make Explorers and export from here into other global markets, we are going to export EcoSport from Asia Pacific, and we are going to sell it here in the U.S,\" said Michael O'Brien, Ford marketing manager for SUVs. \nFord has made the EcoSport in India since 2013. The EcoSport also is assembled in Brazil, Thailand and Russia and will be made in Romania starting in autumn 2017. When Ford introduced the Transit Connect small delivery vehicle into the U.S., it was imported from Turkey. \n\"We are a global company, we have a logistics operation shipping Explorers, F-Series and Escapes all over the planet,\" O'Brien said. \"We know how to do it.\" \nFord is launching the subcompact EcoSport at a time when sales of small SUVs are exploding. U.S. sales of compact SUVs topped 276,000 in 2015. Ford predicts that number will double over the next five years, to more than 550,000. \nSome would argue that Ford is late to the subcompact SUV game. EcoSport will compete with vehicles such as the Chevrolet Trax, Fiat 500X, Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3 and Nissan Juke. \n\"I think our view is that while (the) segment has grown significantly, there is lots more growth coming in 2020. We love our position. ... We think our timing is going to be just great,\" O'Brien said. \nFord says it sells more SUVs and crossovers than any automaker. It has sold more than 12.5 million SUVs globally over the past 25 years. Since 2003, Ford has sold 1.7 million EcoSports. \nIn the U.S., Ford is aiming the EcoSport at two main consumer groups — Millennials and empty nesters. That's why Ford choose to reveal the EcoSport right off the Hollywood Walk of Fame at an event headlined hip-hop producer and Snapchat king DJ Khaled titled \"Go Small, Live Big.\" \nKhaled is an American record producer and radio personality known for short, esoteric speeches on Snapchat. Snapchat is a social media service that sends a photo or video to someone that lasts only up to 10 seconds before it disappears. \n\"He's the king of Snapchat. ... He gets about 3 to 4 million views per day from his content,\" said Chantel Lenard, executive director of U.S. marketing. \"So he is very well known in that space, and we think it connects well with the millennial audience.\" \nThe styling of the EcoSport reflects that of the Ford Escape, but in a smaller, bolder and more athletic package. It will be powered by a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine with front-wheel drive, or an optional 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine with all-wheel drive. Ford did not release information on horsepower, fuel economy or pricing. \nThe EcoSport will be sold in four versions, starting with the S, moving up to the SE, then the SES and finally, the titanium. \nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport Titanium will come equipped with a 10-speaker, 675-watt sound system developed by B&O Play, a Harman brand. Ford says Harman's acoustic engineers spent hundreds of hours perfecting the in-vehicle music experience. \nThe EcoSport also will have optional HD Radio technology, SiriusXM satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals.

And the introduction came with a big surprise.\nIn what may be a first among Detroit's Big 3 automakers, EcoSport is going to be made in India and imported into the U.S.\nGeneral Motors recently started importing the Buick Envision SUV from China, but Ford is rare in choosing to import EcoSport -- what will become its smallest crossover -- from Chennai, India, when it goes on sale in 2018.\nFord has come under attack in recent months from President-elect Donald Trump for moving production of small cars from the U.S. to Mexico. All other major automakers also have expanded and built new plants in Mexico. EcoSport is also made in Brazil.\n\"We build EcoSport in six locations around the globe. We sell it in 100 markets, and so, just like we make Explorers and export from here into other global markets, we are going to export EcoSport from Asia Pacific, and we are going to sell it here in the U.S,\" said Michael O'Brien, Ford marketing manager for SUVs.\nFord has made the EcoSport in India since 2013. The EcoSport also is assembled in Brazil, Thailand and Russia and will be made in Romania starting in autumn 2017. When Ford introduced the Transit Connect small delivery vehicle into the U.S., it was imported from Turkey.\n\"We are a global company, we have a logistics operation shipping Explorers, F-Series and Escapes all over the planet,\" O'Brien said. \"We know how to do it.\"\nFord is launching the subcompact EcoSport at a time when sales of small SUVs are exploding. U.S. sales of compact SUVs topped 276,000 in 2015. Ford predicts that number will double over the next five years, to more than 550,000.\nSome would argue that Ford is late to the subcompact SUV game. EcoSport will compete with vehicles such as the Chevrolet Trax, Fiat 500X, Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3 and Nissan Juke.\n\"I think our view is that while (the) segment has grown significantly, there is lots more growth coming in 2020. We love our position. ... We think our timing is going to be just great,\" O'Brien said.\nFord says it sells more SUVs and crossovers than any automaker. It has sold more than 12.5 million SUVs globally over the past 25 years. Since 2003, Ford has sold 1.7 million EcoSports.\nIn the U.S., Ford is aiming the EcoSport at two main consumer groups — Millennials and empty nesters. That's why Ford choose to reveal the EcoSport right off the Hollywood Walk of Fame at an event headlined hip-hop producer and Snapchat king DJ Khaled titled \"Go Small, Live Big.\"\nKhaled is an American record producer and radio personality known for short, esoteric speeches on Snapchat. Snapchat is a social media service that sends a photo or video to someone that lasts only up to 10 seconds before it disappears.\n\"He's the king of Snapchat. ... He gets about 3 to 4 million views per day from his content,\" said Chantel Lenard, executive director of U.S. marketing. \"So he is very well known in that space, and we think it connects well with the millennial audience.\"\nThe styling of the EcoSport reflects that of the Ford Escape, but in a smaller, bolder and more athletic package. It will be powered by a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine with front-wheel drive, or an optional 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine with all-wheel drive. Ford did not release information on horsepower, fuel economy or pricing.\nThe EcoSport will be sold in four versions, starting with the S, moving up to the SE, then the SES and finally, the titanium.\nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport Titanium will come equipped with a 10-speaker, 675-watt sound system developed by B&O Play, a Harman brand. Ford says Harman's acoustic engineers spent hundreds of hours perfecting the in-vehicle music experience.\nThe EcoSport also will have optional HD Radio technology, SiriusXM satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals.\n COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fUp0XA",

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Carlos Osorio/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, November 14, 2016, 11:49 PM \nFrom sports to politics, 2016 has been a year for surprises and upsets, but in the automotive world, these four overdogs still reign supreme. \nFord, Honda, Porsche and Mazda all landed on U.S. News & World Report’s list of Best Vehicle Brands for the second year in a row. \nPart of a series of car rankings produced by U.S. News that includes Best Cars for the Money and Best Cars for Families, the annual Best Vehicle Brand awards recognize automakers for their safety, reliability and a standing in the auto industry based on a composite of scores from their latest models. \nBoasting the best-selling truck lineup, yet again, was Ford for the Best Truck Brand. For the 2017 model year, the F-150 adds a 2.5-liter EcoBoost V6, Ford’s new 10-speed automatic transmission and a redesigned, high-performance Raptor offering. \nA freshly redesigned Super Duty lineup includes all-aluminum bodies with high-strength steel frames to match the updated F-150 rolled out during the 2015 model year. They also offer increased maximum towing capacity and payload to go along with the more power gas and turbodiesel engines. 2016 Honda CRV. (Honda) \nWith a redesigned Pilot in the midsize SUV segment, high accolades for the HR-V and CR-V crossovers, as well as the Odyssey minivan, Honda once again earned the title of Best SUV Brand. \nThrough the first 10 months of this year, the Honda CR-V has been the best-selling SUV in the U.S., but don't expect Honda to be complacent. Redesigned for the 2017 model year, the CR-V will feature new styling inside and out, a brand-new turbocharged four-cylinder engine, fresh body and chassis designs as well as a more spacious interior. \nAlso, look for Honda to add to its SUV lineup when it rolls out the highly-anticipated C-HR compact crossover for the 2018 model year. \nCredit Porsche's back-to-back run as Best Luxury Brand to the popularity of comfortable crossovers, such as the Cayenne and Macan, coupled with sporty stalwarts like the Cayman, Boxster and 911. Even the recently redesigned Panamera sedan earned a shout-out from U.S. News. 2016 Porsche Cayenne (Porsche) \nPorsche has been a rare bright spot for the Volkswagen Group this year, as it the German company deals with the fallout from an emissions scandal that broke last fall. \nLast but not least, Mazda reclaims the title of Best Car Brand thanks to the popularity of the Mazda3 sedan and MX-5 Miata sports coupe. Those vehicles, along with the Mazda6, CX-3 and CX-5, all earned recognition in the inaugural Daily News Autos Awards given out during the New York Auto Show in March. \nMazda has developed a reputation for building fun, reliable vehicles that won't break your bank. Look for more of the same from refreshed versions of the Mazda3, Mazda6, CX-3 and Miata in 2017. Did you find this article helpful?

      "text": "The Ford EcoSport finally makes its way to the USA Text: Aurick Go / Photos: Ford   14:56 Pint-sized crossover comes with new look, varying engine options \nWhile the rest of the world have had their mitts on Ford’s smallest SUV, it appears the Blue Oval held back on revealing the EcoSport in their home market. \nConsidering perhaps that the EcoSport was made for markets with smaller footprints such as Asia and Europe, it makes sense that the tiny SUV would not have made headway against the towering trucks that call North America home. With its success across the globe though, it seems the EcoSport is now ready to dive into the US market. \n\nFord recently held a first-ever ‘Snapchat reveal’ of the EcoSport in downtown Los Angeles to showcase the compact lifestyle SUV and its plethora of tech. Following the reveal, a two-day event featuring various activities surround people with varying ways to make good use of the Ford EcoSport. \nThe move to bring the EcoSport into the US was sparked by a noticeable trend of people spending resources on experiences and travel versus outright purchasing of products. “More people are choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff,” said Chantel Lenard, ‎executive director, Ford U.S. marketing. “(The) EcoSport fits perfectly into this growing lifestyle. It’s our smallest SUV, packed with features and personality.” \nThe US version of the EcoSport will come with either the 1.0-liter three cylinder turbo EcoBoost or a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four cylinder. Both motors will be mated to a six-speed automatic, while the 2.0-liter version will be fitted with Ford’s Intelligent 4WD system. \nIn terms of interior, the EcoSport has been filled with 30 storage bins and cubbyholes to make the most out of its already tiny stature. Second row seats fold flat to accommodate larger items as well. As for features, the EcoSport comes standard with Ford’s SYNC 3 entertainment and communications system for ease of connection with the user’s devices. \nAn 8-inch touchscreen gives users access to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for seamless connectivity with their devices. Ford has also outfitted the EcoSport with ‘SYNC Connect with Fordpass’ to allow users to locate, lock, unlock, and start the vehicle wherever they are via an app for the vehicle. Data such as fuel level and odometer readings may be viewed via the app as well. \nNorth America can expect the EcoSport to make its debut in their shores sometime in 2018. Related Articles",

      "text": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   11:04 AM \nWhen it comes to SUVs, a brand can’t have too many and they can’t be too small, hence the creation of the subcompact crossover segment and the decision by Ford to bring another such vehicle to the North American market. \nPopular in various other markets, including South America and Mexico, the Ford EcoSport makes its U.S. debut at this year’s Los Angeles Auto Show ahead of a projected sales launch in early 2018. \nConsider this an entry-level SUV aimed at millennial drivers, hence why Ford unveiled the U.S. spec version on Snapchat. Pander much? Ford unveiled the 2018 EcoSport subcompact crossover at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. (Ford) \nPronounced “echo sport,” the small SUV offers either a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with all-wheel drive to go along with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. Both powertrain offerings are, as one might expect, equipped with turbochargers to make up for the diminutive engine sizes. \nSlotted below the Escape in Ford’s SUV lineup—which also includes the Edge, Flex, Explorer and Expedition—the EcoSport will be offered in 10 exterior colors, with seven ambient interior light options. It also comes in four trim levels: the S, SE, SES and Titanium. The Ford EcoSport, shown here in SES trim, features an 8-inch \"floating\" infotainment screen. (Ford) \nThe SES features standard all-wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension and steering, sporting seats with copper accents, and other signature styling details both inside and out. The Titanium package includes a B&O Play premium sound system from Harman that includes 10 speaks with 675 watts of power. \nFord’s Sync 3 infotainment system will be available in an 8-inch “floating” touchscreen display. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available along with HD, satellite and dual-antenna FM radio options. The EcoSport also comes equipped with the Sync Connect system which connects to the FordPass smartphone app and allows the driver to start, lock, unlock and locate their car remotely. All Ford EcoSport models feature swing-gate-style tailgate as well as a cargo management system and a bevy of storage spaces. (Ford) \nWhile the EcoSport is small by SUV standards, Ford promises a “surprisingly spacious rear” to go along with a variety of interior storage compartments. \nLook for the EcoSport to arrive with a base MSRP in the low $20,000 range.

      "text": "Ford CEO Fields Looking Forward To ‘Very Productive’ Discussion With Trump About U.S. Economy November 15, 2016 10:53 AM Filed Under: Donald Trump , Ford , Mark Fields \nDETROIT (WWJ) – The president and CEO Ford Motor Co. says he’s ready and willing to work with President-elect Donald Trump. \nSpeaking to WWJ’s Jeff Gilbert from the LA Auto Show, Mark Fields said now that election is over, it’s time for Trump to focus on policy — and he’s optimistic. \n“We believe the right policies are going to be put in place because I think, Jeff, we have, we all have the same common goal which is you know, we want a healthy U.S. economy,” Fields said. “And as we think about some of the policies that may be put in place we’ll engage, I think, in a very productive discussion all with that in mind, of keeping the U.S. economy very healthy.” \nTrump has criticized Ford for importing vehicles from Mexico — something that other carmakers also do — and has threatened tariffs of 35 percent on those cars. The president-elect has called NAFTA a “worst trade deal in history,” and a “disaster,” and has said as president he would negotiate for better terms with both Mexico and Canada. \nIf those countries don’t agree to his adjustments Trump said that he just may scrap the deal all together. \nWithout specifically addressing those issues, Fields said he’s very much looking forward to a conversation with Trump. \n“We have a proven track record going all the way back to the administration of Teddy Roosevelt, since when we were first founded, of having good working relationships with policy makers on both sides of the aisle,” Fields said, adding that he does believe there’s some common ground. \n“Of course we agree with the president-elect it’s about bringing people together and we look forward to working with him and the administration and growing the economy,” he said. \nMeantime, at this week’s auto show , Fields said he’s focused on engaging with the public about the future of the auto industry. \n“It’s really interesting because this is the first show that’s actually merging traditional auto show day with a connected car expo, so it’s the industry’s first integration of both a tech and an auto show,” Fields said. “So we’re making news on both sides as we transform to an auto and a mobility company.”",

      "text": "Like most things at Ford that don't have GT or RS in their name these days, the new Ford EcoSport is about 90% hype and 10% car.\nFortunately, underneath all that ad-speak, it's a cute little thing, with some cool features.\nIf Ford can deliver it with the right driving experience, for the right price, those in the market for a fun and functional pint-sized crossover will likely have another great option.\nRecommended: Are you a smart car buyer? Take the quiz. If you think the EcoSport looks familiar, you may be well-traveled; Ford has sold the EcoSport in markets outside the U.S. since 2003, launching the current, second-generation vehicle in 2013. In fact, we've even driven it .\nTest your knowledge Are you a smart car buyer? Take the quiz. We're getting an updated version for the U.S. launch. However, since the EcoSport isn't hitting the market here until early 2018, details like price and specifics on options packages, features, technology, and driver assistance systems are still undecided--or at least unannounced.\nWhat we can tell you is that it looks pretty good, it has a nice interior, and it ticks the major boxes most small crossover buyers will want to have ticked.\nPrimary among those boxes is Ford's SYNC 3 system, complete with an 8.0-inch floating touch screen, bringing with it Android Auto and Apple Car Play.\nWhile Ford is eager to play this up as \"living big\" despite \"going small,\" the truth is, the availability of a proper smartphone-integrated entertainment system is nearly a pre-requisite for relvance today--let alone in early 2018.\nBut Ford's SYNC 3 system is quite good, and with the major phone-system integration bases covered, you'll get all the features Google and Apple see fit to bake into their hardware and software as well.\nThe other key to the EcoSport is the combination of a ride height that matches some light trucks and an available all-wheel drive system. Yes, Ford calls it \"Intelligent 4WD,\" but there is no low-range function, or any other function that's driver-controlled, however, and you can't even make it operate all the time in inclement conditions.\nUnder normal driving, the \"intelligent\" part of the system disengages the rear wheels for better fuel economy; when the system detects wheel slip, yaw, or other metrics that fall within its pre-determined grid, it will activate the all-wheel-drive system, sending an unspecified amount of power rearward.\nDespite the murky marketing message (by the way, it's pronounced \"echo-sport,\" not like \"eek-o-boost\" despite offering an EcoBoost engine as the base configuration) the package is about on par with other compact crossovers, and should be serviceable in snow and light mud when equipped with the right tires.\nSpeaking of EcoBoost, there are just two engine options for North American versions of the EcoSport, and both will share a 6-speed automatic transmission. The base engine, which comes only in front-wheel drive, is the 1.0-liter three-cylinder that has been used in several other Ford vehicles.\nThe upgrade option is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which brings with it your only route to all-wheel drive. Horsepower, torque, and gas mileage figures are still forthcoming, and should be released closer to the vehicle's on-sale date in early 2018.\nOn the tech front, aside from the SYNC 3 system, the EcoSport will also offer an available B&O PLAY (yes, as in Bang & Olufsen) stereo system, featuring 10 speakers (six of them B&O PLAY-branded) and 675 watts of output.",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nLOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields said the Trump administration’s potential 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico could have a “huge impact” on the U.S. economy, but the automaker has no plans to change its investments in Mexico. \n“A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Fields said today following his keynote address at the Los Angeles auto show. “I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail. I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.” \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has attacked Ford repeatedly for moving some production south of the border, vowing to impose a tariff that would force the automaker to bring jobs back to the U.S. Fields said the automaker still plans to move Ford Focus production to a $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico and replace that with two vehicles at the company’s Michigan Assembly Plant. \nFields said he sent Trump a congratulatory letter and that Ford is in “constant communication” with Trump’s transition team. \n“We have a proven track record of working with policymakers going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt,” he said. “We expect to work very effectively and positively with the president-elect’s administration, as well as the new Congress.” \nFields said Ford’s priorities remain the same: currency-manipulation protection, fuel economy requirements that “are aligned with market realities,” tax reform and the safe adoption of autonomous cars. \n“We look forward to working with the new administration,” he said.

      "text": "The Ford EcoSport has been in the Indian market since 2012 and the first significant update for the compact crossover, since its launch, has been unveiled at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. It will make its debut in the North American market in 2018 and is expected to arrive in the Indian market in late 2017.\nUp front, the redesigned fascia of the EcoSport noticeably takes its cues from the Ford Escape. The changes include the Ford’s hexagonal grille, revised headlamps and redesigned bumper. There are new triangular fog lamps and as well as subtle creases on the hood. A faux skid plate has also been added as a part of the update.\nThe facelifted EcoSport retains the character side profile of the compact crossover. The new alloy designs suit the car pretty well. The rear mounted spare wheel is absent in the US-spec. The silver-finished skid plate on the bumper and the roof rails at the top add to the SUV-ish character.\nThe cabin gets a new instrument cluster, dashboard and steering wheel. The centre console now incorporates an eight-inch touchscreen which integrates Ford’s new Sync 3 infotainment system. It features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration compatibility with seamless smartphone connectivity.\nThe US spec EcoSport will be offered with the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine or 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine. Both engines will only get the option of a six-speed automatic transmission. In India, however, we’ll also get the 1.5-litre petrol engine and the 1.5-litre TDCi diesel engine mated to a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic.\nThe sales of the facelifted Ford EcoSport will commence in the American market by 2018. But is expected to go on sale in India by next year. The manufacturing and export of the new EcoSport will continue at the Ford’s Chennai facility. The EcoSport faces competition from the Renault Duster and the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza.",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico.\nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles.\nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.\nAssociated Press",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Mark Fields, President & CEO, Ford Motor Company, speaks at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, …\nBy Alexandria Sage\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) is moving ahead with plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, while \"two very important products\" will be built in its U.S. factories, Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\"We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,\" Fields said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.\"\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production of Focus small cars to Mexico in 2018, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords.\nFord Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said last month he met with Trump to discuss the issue. Ford has countered Trump's criticism, saying the automaker, founded by his great-grandfather, makes more cars and trucks in the United States than any other automaker.\nFord also is moving ahead with plans to use factory capacity in other markets to fill gaps in its U.S. lineup. Company executives used the Los Angeles auto show to promote a small sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport that the company plans to ship into the United States from India. \n\"We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.,\" Fields said, pointing to the money invested to launch a new SuperDuty pickup at a plant in Kentucky.\nFord has cautioned investors that it sees demand for cars and light trucks hitting a plateau in the United States. Fields said heading into the last two months of the year \"we are seeing a tougher pricing environment.\"\n\"We expect the industry to be about the same as it was last year, probably a little lower on the retail side, and a continuing competitive pricing environment,\" Fields said.\n\n(Writing by Joe White; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Jeffrey Benkoe)",

      "title": "Ford's Fields Doubles-Down on Move to Mexico | Fox Business",
      "text": "Ford CEO Mark Fields discusses why the company's small-car production move from the U.S. to Mexico won't impact American jobs. Ford's Fields Doubles-Down on Move to Mexico \nPublished November 15, 2016 \nFord won’t be changing its plan to move small-car production from the U.S. to Mexico, despite Donald Trump winning the 2016 presidential election. \nContinue Reading Below \nSpeaking to the FOX Business Network on Tuesday, Ford CEO Mark Fields doubled down on the strategy, even though Trump, while on the campaign trail, said he would put a 35% tax on the company’s vehicles made in Mexico and sold in the United States. \n“We’re just implementing our business plan,” Fields said. “And just like we’re making investments in Mexico and moving our focus down there, our plans haven’t changed to introduce two very important products into the plant that the focus is moving out of.” \nThe decision by Ford, one of the “Big Three” automakers in the U.S., will have “zero impact” on jobs, according to Fields. More on this... Ford CEO: No U.S. jobs are going overseas \n“We’re a multi-national company, but our home is here in the U.S.,” he said. “In North America the majority of our capital expenditures, our research is done here. And just like we’re investing in Mexico, we’ve been there for 90 years, we’re investing here in the U.S.” \nWhile stumping for the Oval Office, President-elect Trump frequently criticized U.S. trade deals that left the country at an unfair disadvantage, including the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) — something Trump said he would seek to renegotiate or eliminate, calling it the “worst trade deal in history.” \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nFields, however, had a different view on NAFTA. \n“It’s been very good for the hemisphere… And when you look at NAFTA, you look at the production and the supply chains — they’re deeply integrated between the three countries and they support a lot of American jobs,” he said. What do you think? ",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nTue, Nov 15, 2016, 23:53 GMT - UK Markets closed Ford still plans to move some production to Mexico AFP – 37 minutes ago View Photo \n\nFord Motor Company (LSE: 0P4F.L - news ) still plans to relocate some production to Mexico despite the election of Donald Trump, who denounced the move and has threatened to impose hefty tariffs on car imports. \n\"We look forward to working with the new administration. Our plan is to move our Focus down to Mexico to make room for two very exciting products that will be coming down to the Michigan Center,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields told reporters Tuesday. \nSpeaking at the opening of the Los Angeles auto show, Fields said a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, which Trump threatened during the campaign, would hurt the US economy. \n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector that could have a major impact on the US economy,\" he said. \n\"I continue to think that the right policies will prevail because we continue to share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant US economy.\" \nAsked by AFP about the consequences of renegotiating or pulling out of free trade agreements such as NAFTA -- something Trump has pledged to do -- Fields said Ford remains \"a big supporter of free and fair trade\" but added: \"We'll see how things play out.\" \nHis remarks echoed those made by BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) chief Harald Krueger in the wake of the real estate tycoon's surprise election last week. \nFields said of Trump, \"We look forward to working with him to consolidate the US economy.\" \nFord will continue to advocate for policies on currency manipulation and fuel standards that are \"in line with market realities,\" as well as tax reform and \"the safe adoption of autonomous cars.\" \nDuring the bitter campaign for the White house, Trump criticized American companies for relocating production abroad. Computer giant Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) has been one of his main targets. \nFord in early April unveiled a $1.6 billion investment in a new facility in Mexico, where the workforce is very cheap compared to the United States. The plant will be operational in 2018. \nCar (HKSE: 0699-OL.HK - news ) companies that move US factories offshore have become a frequent target of politicians and local elected officials, not least because General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) and Chrysler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) -- although not Ford -- were saved from bankruptcy in 2009 with a government bailout. \nJessica Caldwell, an analyst at the Edmunds.com automotive website, the most immediate challenge created by a Trump administration, even more so than the renegotiation of international trade agreements, is to question government subsidies on electric cars. \nTrump, who has denied the existence of climate change in the past, suggested during his campaign that he would close the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and his government may decide to eliminate federal incentives for the purchase green cars. \n\"The big concern now is the government subsidies for green cars,\" she says, adding that the manufacturers have spent tens of millions of dollars to reduce gasoline consumption and polluting emissions. 7,000 cities around the world are way ahead of targets to cut carbon emissions Quartz - 4 hours ago Cities are home to over half the world’s population and produce around 75% of its carbon emissions, but they’re leading the way in the global fight against climate change.

      "text": "The Nov. 15 article “In St. Paul, a glimpse at the future of Ford site” coaxed me to put pen and paper to St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman’s numbers. If you take 122 acres, less roughly 20 percent for roadways, sidewalks and private/public easements, you are left with about 100 acres. In order for that to produce $22 million in annual tax revenue, as the politicians seem focused upon getting their hands on, the governmental grab would be roughly $200,000 per acre. That means each acre would need a building worth $5 million, taxed at 4 percent of that value. Now say that four homes, shops, gas stations or office buildings are squashed in per acre. The governmental fee for roads, sewer, schools and salaries would need to be $50,000 per building owner. Ouch!\nHopefully, the city won’t allow developmental blight to occur, as Bloomington has, by pushing four- to five-story wood-construction apartments covering every allowable inch of property, while leaving inadequate parking and open space. If there isn’t another employer to replace the lost Ford jobs, why not build a few 30- to 40-story condo/apartment buildings? Then maybe add a hotel, with mixed retail to serve the new residents, with the remaining 70 to 80 acres left as a park similar to New York with its Central Park?\nC.W. Howard, Minneapolis\nThe writer is a real-estate broker. \nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n‘Discontent in the Heartland?’ Yes, but not the kind proposed\nScott Gillespie’s Nov. 15 analysis of the election results in Trempealeau County, Wis., ( “Clinton failed to grasp discontent in the Heartland” ) can’t see the forest because he’s afraid to call it trees.\nUnfilled jobs and needed workers who were willing to process chickens and milk cows, according to Gillespie, began to change the look of the “virtually all-white town.” Local employers likely tried to fill job openings from “small government” and “Second Amendment advocates” born and raised in the area, but apparently they find certain jobs distasteful. Rather than close their businesses and move elsewhere — causing economic devastation to the county — the employers use “strong verification systems” and hire those willing to work.\nWhat has happened in Trempealeau County is a growing local economy, a local population unwilling to fill the jobs and resent of those who are willing to take them. Then, as they see faces of an unfamiliar color, often bilingual, like the newly hired priest, they tap into their “high suspicion” and listen to a candidate who calls out to their fear and racism.\nThat is what Gillespie and the Clinton campaign failed to recognize. That a small rural county experiencing strong job growth not filled by the local residents would resent those willing to fill the void, not because they are jobless vagrants, but because they look and sound different. One campaign counted on our Better Angels. The other, Building a Wall.\nTodd Embury, Ramsey\n• • •\nDemocrats need to rebuild after the drubbing they took nationally in Tuesday’s election, and N.Y. Sen. Charles Schumer, who is expected to be the Senate minority leader, supports Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota as head of the Democratic National Committee. Talk about alienating the base, much less trying to expand the base. Republicans have to be dancing in aisles. Which we are!\nJim Farrell, Bloomington\n• • •\nRegarding efforts to rebuild the Democratic Party so it can rise from the ashes of its defeat in the presidential election, I have a suggestion: How about being more inclusive? They say that liberalism is all about tolerance. Try telling that to the many good Democrats who were tossed out of their party for being prolife.\nMany assume that only conservatives oppose abortion — this is a bad mistake. There are many in the center and left who are prolife. Many of whom believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death (consistent life ethic). Many right-wingers favor abortion — they believe in the theory of eugenics — Hitler was a big supporter of that theory. I hope and pray that the party of Robert F. Kennedy will return someday, so that I can once again refer to myself as a Democrat.\nKay Kemper, Crystal\n• • •\nMy wife and I started out very poor. I ran a punch-press in a Minneapolis factory, and my wife stayed home with our two children. I worked full time and went to computer technology school at night. Eventually I worked my way into management in the computer business. Because of my “roots,” I have always considered myself to be a blue-collar man. My father also worked in a Minneapolis machine shop.\nI vote for Democrats. Democrats fight for the common man. Democrats fight to increase the minimum wage. In hard times, they fight to extend unemployment benefits. They fight for bigger budgets to educate our children. Democrats saved General Motors and Chrysler when they needed help. Democrats help labor unions keep the ability to bargain for their workers. Democrats fight to preserve Social Security benefits.\nRepublicans have always fought against these causes. After this election, where blue-collar voters determined the outcome, I am completely bewildered. Where do I fit in now?\nMichael Thomas Burns, Prior Lake\nTHE TRUMP TRANSITION\nA sad signal has been sent; it’s time for us to stand up to bigotry\nOur president-elect has chosen a white supremacist as his top adviser in the White House ( “From the fringe to the White House,” Nov. 15). This is not OK on any level. I urge everyone who is horrified by the choice of Stephen Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president-elect to visit the website of, and donate to, the Southern Poverty Law Center — www.splcenter.org . This organization fights racial and social injustice by tracking hate groups in the U.S. and reporting their activities to law enforcement agencies, the media and the public. It teaches tolerance, and it uses the courts to help victims of discrimination and hate crimes. If we do nothing, we are accomplices to the elevation of hatred and bigotry.\nRebekah Richards, St. Paul\nTHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE\nRemember why the process was designed in the first place\nYet again we had a presidential race where the popular vote doesn’t agree with the Electoral College map. Thus the rational thought is the Electoral College must be outdated and is a poor system. The Electoral College is in place because founding fathers James Madison and Alexander Hamilton feared that “factions” of society would become too powerful and vote in their preferred choice. Also, a states’ rights balancing act was essential to the formation of our current form of government. So, when you are part of an Electoral College conversation, simply remind yourself and others that if it were not for the Electoral College, the voices of the majority could drown out the voices of the few. Places like California, New York, Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania could decide the president if we scrapped the Electoral College for a true form of democracy.\nChris Lund, Hamburg",

      "text": "Nov 15 - Ford small cars production moving out of US to Mexico Fords small cars are about to become a product of Mexico following the announcement that production will shift out of the US. However, the carmaker maintains that two very important products will continue to be produced in US factories. Ford Motors CEO Mark Fields announced that they would be moving forward on relocating small car production to Mexico, despite President-elect Donald Trumps promises to impose tariffs on vehicles made outside of the US.\"Were going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly thats to make room for two very important products well be putting back into Michigan plants,\" Fields told Reuters. Fields did not elaborate on what the two very important products would be. However, he insisted there will be no job impact whatsoever with this move. He blamed the need to move production on low gasoline prices, which may coax some consumers into buying larger cars that use more fuel. As a result, \"it's very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the US\" in the small car segment, he said. How that will stand up to Trumps promises to place a 35 percent tariff on cars and trucks imported from Mexico remains to be seen, but Fields has made pleas to Trump to reconsider the plan.\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the US economy,\" Fields told USA Today. Fields acknowledged that he had spoken with Trumps transition team and had congratulated the president-elect, but also hopes to work with him to undo climate-friendly regulations on cars. For example, a group representing Ford allegedly asked the transition team to review regulations over fuel economy standards, Reuters reported.",

      "text": "Ford to still move some production to Mexico   12:33am File: President-elect Donald Trump has denounced the move by Ford of some production to Mexico and has threatened to impose some hefty fines on the motor company, however Ford is still planning to go ahead as planned. Photo: Scott Olson \nLOS ANGELES – Ford Motor Company still plans to relocate some production to Mexico despite the election of Donald Trump, who denounced the move and has threatened to impose hefty tariffs on car imports. \n\"We look forward to working with the new administration. Our plan is to move our Focus down to Mexico to make room for two very exciting products that will be coming down to the Michigan Centre,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields told reporters Tuesday. \nSpeaking at the opening of the Los Angeles auto show, Fields said a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, which Trump threatened during the campaign, would hurt the US economy. \n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector that could have a major impact on the US economy,\" he said. \n\"I continue to think that the right policies will prevail because we continue to share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant US economy.\" \nAsked by AFP about the consequences of renegotiating or pulling out of free trade agreements such as NAFTA, something Trump has pledged to do, Fields said Ford remains \"a big supporter of free and fair trade\" but added, \"we'll see how things play out.\" \nHis remarks echoed those made by BMW chief Harald Krueger in the wake of the real estate tycoon's surprise election last week. \nFields said of Trump, \"We look forward to working with him to consolidate the US economy.\" \nFord will continue to advocate for policies on currency manipulation and fuel standards that are \"in line with market realities,\" as well as tax reform and \"the safe adoption of autonomous cars.\" \nDuring the bitter campaign for the White house, Trump criticised American companies for relocating production abroad. Computer giant Apple has been one of his main targets. \nFord in early April unveiled a $1.6 billion investment in a new facility in Mexico, where the workforce is very cheap compared to the United States. The plant will be operational in 2018. \nCar companies that move US factories offshore have become a frequent target of politicians and local elected officials, not least because General Motors and Chrysler, although not Ford, were saved from bankruptcy in 2009 with a government bailout.",

      "text": "Ford Targets an Urban Future Joins Michael Bloomberg’s “Coalition of Cities\" By: Todd Lassa November 15, 2016 \nL OS ANGELES, California – Is Ford Motor Company the leading major automaker in the move toward a post auto-ownership world? CEO Mark Fields would like you to think so. Ford is joining ex-New York City Mayor and media magnate Michael Bloomberg’s Coalition of Cities, a growing list of global urban entities considering how to reduce congestion and carbon emissions in the near future, Fields announced at his keynote address at Automobility L.A., ahead of the Los Angeles Show press days , Tuesday. \nThe United Nations-backed Coalition will “collect the best ideas from around the world and implement them,” Fields said. \nFord’s partnership with Chariot, a car-sharing service that operates in San Francisco and Austin, Texas, will expand to four more cities in the next 15 months, Fields said. He pointed to Ford Go Bikes, its urban bike-sharing program, and plans to field fully autonomous ride-hail cars on city streets by 2021 as examples of how the company is moving past its traditional role as an automaker. \n“We really are on the cusp of a mobility revolution,” Fields said in his opening remarks. “We at Ford have spent the past 100 years getting ready for that.” \nWhile cars like the Ford GT “are still very important,” Fields said, the company’s focus is on helping “build the city of tomorrow.” It’s a forward-looking stance coming from the company that put the world on wheels with the Model T, from a founder who grew up on a farm and generally eschewed urban life. The Ford Motor Company of 2016 feels more like the offspring of the company once run by Henry Ford’s cosmopolitan son, Edsel.",

      "text": "Ford announced the EcoSport for the U.S. market ahead of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. The EcoSport will be imported to the country from India. ( Ford ) Advertisement \nAmerican automaker Ford has announced its subcompact SUV the EcoSport for the North American market. \nFord revealed the 2018 Ford EcoSport at the Walk of Fame in Hollywood on Monday, Nov. 14 ahead of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show that starts on Wednesday, at a party with famed hip-hop producer and Snapchat king DJ Khaled. \nThe EcoSport has been in the market outside the United States since 2003. The car is currently being produced in a number of countries such as India, Brazil, Russia and more. \n\"We build EcoSport in six locations around the globe. We sell it in 100 markets, and so, just like we make Explorers and export from here into other global markets, we are going to export EcoSport from Asia Pacific, and we are going to sell it here in the [United States],\" says Michael O'Brien, the marketing manager for SUVs at Ford. \nThe company will start making the EcoSport in Romania from autumn 2017 but the U.S. versions will be made in India and imported to North America. Ford's facility in Chennai, India has been making the EcoSport since 2013. US Subcompact SUVs Market \nThe market for subcompacts is booming in the United States and it is the perfect time for Ford to introduce a new model in the market. Reports suggest that compact SUV sales exceeded 276,000 in 2015 and the carmaker estimates that the numbers will increase to 550,000 in the next five years. Features Of The EcoSport \nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport will be available in the United States with either a 1-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost or 2-liter four-cylinder engine. The 2-liter version will include the company's Intelligent 4WD as standard. Both models will come with six-speed automatic transmissions. \nThe EcoSport will offer plenty of storage solutions to its owner. \n\"As many as 30 stowage pockets, bins, hooks make efficient use of every interior inch. A cargo management system at the rear features a movable floor board and fold-away second-row seats to provide a flat area for moving furniture and other larger items,\" says Ford. \nThe subcompact will be available in 10 exterior colors, seven ambient lighting options and four trim level offerings. \nThe EcoSport will come packed with a number of connectivity features. All models of the 2018 Ford EcoSport will include the company's Sync 3 infotainment system as standard, which means customers will find Android Auto smartphone and Apple CarPlay integration. The primary interface will be an 8.0-inch touch screen display. \nThe car will also include a couple of fast-charging USB ports, which will ensure customers can charge their devices on the go. There will be two 12-volt power outlets in the car: one in the front and another at the back, which will allow everyone to be connected. Price And Fuel Efficiency \nFord has not revealed any details of fuel efficiency or pricing of the upcoming EcoSport.  ",
