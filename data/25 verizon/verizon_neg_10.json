We guess kids that this tablet is aimed at probably won’t care too much about specs, but for adults who are buying it, it features an 8-inch display with a 1920×1200 resolution. Under the hood, an octa-core Snapdragon 617 chipset can be found with 16GB of storage and a microSD card slot. \nWe’re also looking at an 8MP rear-facing camera, a 5MP front-facing camera, Android 6.0 .1 Marshmallow preinstalled, and a decently sized 5,100mAh battery. Moving onto the educational factor, the GizmoTab will also come with 300 premium educational apps, a Parent Dashboard that gives them control and an overview of how their kid uses the tablet, such as what apps can be used, as well as controlling passwords and accounts. \nThe tablet is priced at $250 outright , or alternatively customers can get one for $80 with a two-year agreement, or a $0 downpayment followed by $10.41 per month over the course of the next 24 months. \nFiled in Tablets .

      "title": "FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps",
      "text": "By TALI ARBEL\nAP Technology Writer NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones.\nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices.\nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns.\nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers.\nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day.\nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch.\nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations.\nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services.\nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office.\nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.\n ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones.\nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices.\nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns.\nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers.\nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day.\nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch.\nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations.\nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services.\nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office.\nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.",

      "text": "Mark Wilson/Getty Images\nIf you thought plans from Verizon and AT&T to exempt streaming videos from only some services from data plans sounded a little unfair, you weren’t alone. In a sternly worded pair of letters sent to the carriers, the Federal Communications Commission accused them of a potential violation of the net neutrality rules it approved in 2015.\nNet neutrality, for the uninitiated, is the principle that broadband providers should treat all content, sites, and platforms equally in terms of traffic. Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who’s credited with coining the term, compares the idea to an electric grid. “The electric grid does not care if you plug in a toaster, an iron, or a computer … [It’s] a model of a neutral, innovation-driving network.”\nMore: T-Mobile’s family plan has net neutrality advocates pissed off\nIn 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband providers as so-called “Title II” common carriers, or services bound to “act in the public interest.” That includes ensuring that they can’t make any “unjust” or “unreasonable” charges, for one, or introduce any regulations that would actively suppress competing services.\nCarriers like AT&T and Verizon have attempted to sidestep those rules with so-called “zero-rating,” a policy that exempts certain applications and services from counting against subscribers’ data plans. Zero-rated music streaming doesn’t contribute to your overall data bucket, for example, and neither do video services.\nAT&T began zero-rating its DirecTV on-demand and live-streaming mobile app in September and plans to do the same for its forthcoming DirecTV Now streaming service when it launches later in December. Verizon currently waives data charges for National Football League games, its Go90 video platform, and other participants affiliated with its FreeBee Data 360 program.\nMore: Net neutrality advocates cool on T-Mobile’s Binge On\nThe FCC’s net neutrality rules do not expressly prohibit zero-rating, but the agency evaluates implementations on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they “hinder competition.” It found that AT&T and Verizon’s programs did. “[We have] reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet,” John Wilkins, head of the FCC’s wireless division, wrote in Thursday’s letter. “It would [be] very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service.”\nAT&T and Verizon beg to differ.\n“We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves customers money,” AT&T said Friday. A spokesperson for Verizon said that the carrier remains “quite confident that [its] practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.”\nBoth carriers contend they provide competitors like Netflix, YouTube, and others a means to the same zero-rated status as their first-party services. AT&T exempts streaming services from subscribers’ data caps on a metered basis, charging roughly $16 a month for each customer who uses 10 minutes of streaming video a day up to $47 a month for customers who use 30 minutes a day. But the FCC argues that the policy is discriminatory, especially toward smaller startups which that might not be able to swallow the cost.\nMore: T-Mobile is giving unlimited data to every customer, but there’s a catch\n“[The program] strongly favors AT&T’s own video offerings while unreasonably discriminating against unaffiliated edge providers and limiting their ability to offer competing video services to AT&T’s broadband subscribers on a level playing field,” Wilkins wrote.\nThe FCC has requested responses from both carriers by December 15. It asked AT&T to provide the average median usage of DirecTV streaming compared to competing services, and the names of companies that have purchased data cap exemptions from AT&T.\nThe FCC first raised concerns about zero-rating in a letter to AT&T in November. The carrier responded, arguing that the practice was to its customers’ benefit. “These initiatives are precisely the kind of pro-consumer challenges to cable that the Commission heralded in approving AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV,” Robert Quinn, AT&T’s policy chief, wrote in a letter to the agency.\nMore: Who has the best family plan? Shake-ups from T-Mobile and Sprint tilt the balance\nAnother major U.S. carrier, T-Mobile, adopted a policy of zero-rating last year with the launch of Binge On, a video streaming service that exempts approved video and music streaming services from customers’ data caps. Wheeler has characterized the plan as “pro-innovation,” “pro-competition,” and in full compliance with the government’s net neutrality rules, but consumer advocacy groups have voiced concerns about the program’s exclusivity. Content providers must meet certain technical specifications that allow T-Mobile to identify their content as Binge On-friendly, for instance. And Binge On reduces the quality of streaming indiscriminately — even those hosted on services that haven’t opted into T-Mobile’s plan.\nT-Mobile’s new One plan offers data-free video streaming, but at reduced quality. Subscribers can unlock improved definition for $25 a month on top of what they pay for the plan itself, an option that’s raised the ire of net neutrality advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nAn FCC spokesperson told Digital Trends in August that the Commission’s policy review was “ongoing.”\nThe future of the FCC’s net neutrality policy is unclear. Roslyn Layton, Jeffrey Eisenach, and Mark Jamison, advisors that will oversee the FCC’s transition under president-elect Donald Trump’s administration, are outspoken opponents of the FCC’s Title II rules, and have argued that government regulations are not necessary to protect net neutrality. A Republican-led Commission, which Trump will have the power to appoint when he takes office on January 20, could choose to overturn the current rules entirely.\nAT&T Stream Saver will let you throttle video to standard-def starting next year FCC fines T-Mobile $48M for allegedly misleading unlimited data customers Report: Facebook in talks with White House to introduce Free Basics in the U.S.",

      "text": "Verizon's FiOS set to come online in Boston within weeks Jordan Graham Sunday, December 04, 2016 Credit: The Associated Press Verizon comments The first Boston customer accounts for Verizon’s high speed FiOS internet service could come online in the next few weeks, the company says, as the city prepares to grant a crucial license to the cable and communications giant.\n“We are planning to begin offering FiOS in parts of our very first service area later this month,” said Michael Murphy, a spokesman for Verizon. “We estimate that by year’s end Fios services will be available to approximately 25,000 premises in Dorchester, the Dudley Square Innovation District of Roxbury, Roslindale and West Roxbury.”\nVerizon said earlier this year it would spend $300 million over six years to install high-speed fiber optic lines throughout the city, beginning with Dudley Square, parts of Dorchester and West Roxbury.\nBoston has no authority to oversee internet service in the city, but does have the power to regulate cable television providers, which Verizon aims to offer as well.\nA draft cable license — a requirement to offer cable television — is expected to be approved soon, clearing the way for Verizon to begin selling and marketing FiOS.\n“My expectation is we will make a decision quite quickly, as soon as next week,” said Jascha Franklin-Hodge, chief information officer for Boston. “We anticipate being able to reach an agreement on a final agreement in the near term.”\nThe license only grants Verizon the ability to serve certain neighborhoods, but can be expanded. The license says Verizon must offer service to anyone who wants it, with some exceptions experts said are relatively standard.\nOne thing the license does not include is requirements for Verizon’s workforce, including mandating union labor, which advocates pushed for — and got — in license negotiations between Verizon and Philadelphia last year. But Myles Calvey, business manager for IBEW Local 2222, which represents Boston’s Verizon workers, said those provisions weren’t necessary because Local 2222’s contract says Verizon must use union workers and cannot hire non-union contractors.\nCalvey said the FiOS installation has brought some much-needed work for the union.\n“This has been a resurrection for us, we had been dying on the vine, no one was taking copper wires,” Calvey said, referring to copper lines historically used for phone and slower internet connections. “Nobody was getting landlines anymore, this brought new work and good work.”\nVerizon also said it would also fund a mobile hotspot lending program through the Boston Public Library and work with city officials on “smart city” projects. Neither of those are included in the license, but a BPL spokeswoman said the hotspot lending program is in development.",

      "text": "The Federal Communications Commission initially liked the idea of letting ISPs charge nothing to stream select content . The commission now has determined that it doesn’t like seeing the content providers zero-rate their own internet service for their own content.\nIn letters to AT&T and Verizon (which we have just linked), the FCC has expressed concern over the cellular carriers’ practices in offering their content — through DIRECTV NOW and go90 , respectively — free to stream for their customers without incurring data charges. The commission believes that by limiting zero-rating opportunities to their own franchises, the two telcos come into breach with the 2015 Open Internet Order — part of the order’s goal is to “increase choice and lower costs for consumers.”\nEssentially, while it costs nothing on a consolidated basis for AT&T and Verizon to zero-rate their own programs, that would not necessarily the case for any other content provider wishing to participate in zero-rate activities with the two companies.\nUsing AT&T’s figures for DIRECTV NOW, it would cost a content provider over $1.50 every month to zero-rate a minute of video streamed daily over LTE. Multiply that cost over multiple shows watched per day by many own-brand customers and the bill may prove too burdensome for competitors to shoulder.\nWireless Telecommunications Bureau Chief Jon Wilkins has requested that both companies provide specific usage data for its services as well as competing services on its network and/or for its customers, including how much of the traffic is zero-rated. Wilkins also asks for expectations of consumers’ use of all services regarding internet and content. Responses are due on December 15.\nThe post FCC policy on zero-rate streaming hardens towards AT&T and Verizon appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

Buy out for $240\n\nThe Verizon DPP deals at Best Buy have been good this year. Most have at least read about one of the deals. For the sake of those who are unfamiliar, here are some things to know:\n\nIf you have a VZW account already, Buy the phone, pay the sales tax at purchase and assume the $9.99 payment for 24 Months. As soon as the agreement is on your Verizon account, you can pay it off, thus restoring the line to upgrade eligible. Of course, you can maintain the monthly payment for as much of the 24 months as you like. Buy out at any time without losing the original sales price. \n",

I had no trouble setting this up last summer but it seems something has changed. I just got off the line with Verizon after my attempt to set up international service online returned an error message and to call their customer service. The Verizon agent told me that my CDMA global phone won't work and that Cunard has its own carrier. All I found on Cunard's FAQ was this: https://ask.cunard.com/help/life-on-...mobile_onboard Any insights? Something isn't making sense here and perhaps the agent has no familiarity with accessing a network from a ship. BlueRiband",

      "text": "0 Intel iPhone 7 does not work at all with Verizon - confirmed As Verizon has had their prepaid starter packs on sale for $20, I thought I might as well see what happened when I tried to use it in my non-CDMA capable iPhone 7 Plus (model A1784). When I first put the SIM card in, it would just search constantly. It popped up that there was a carrier update available, but this was apparently just a generic one, as the Verizon carrier profile would not even download. I activated the SIM with the IMEI of a compatible phone, and after, the Verizon name popped up with 1 bar of LTE showing, yet soon went to No Service and Searching... I put the SIM into an iPhone 6 Plus, and it worked as expected. After, I put the SIM back into the 7 Plus, and interestingly it showed the full name \"Verizon Wireless\" in the bar, with 5 empty signal dots. So, it's been definitively confirmed - the Intel version of the 7 Plus doesn't work at all on Verizon, even though it has the technical capability to work on LTE and VoLTE. While I understand why Apple made a GSM-only version, I am a bit disappointed that it won't even work on VoLTE. My fastest speed tests:",

      "title": "FCC asks Verizon and AT&T to not exempt their video apps from customer data caps",
      "text": "U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers’ cellphones. This may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices.\nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country’s biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as “zero rating,” can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T’s response did not ease its concerns.\nOther services – say Hulu or Netflix – can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers.\nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day.\nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T’s new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC’s wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn’t zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch.\nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn’t put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. Verizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama’s administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. The agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC’s zero-rating warnings were “yet another broadside against free data for consumers” and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. The FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.\nAssociated Press \nThe post FCC asks Verizon and AT&T to not exempt their video apps from customer data caps appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "US FCC Says AT&T and Verizon Video Apps Violate Net Neutrality Reddit \nU.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. For example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day.\nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now , whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.",

      "text": "Verizon’s recent release of 5G standards and protocols highlights the carrier push for next-generation network technologies. There’s a lot of hype around the next “G” generation. In July, Verizon Communications announced a key milestone in the journey to “5G” – a new set of standards and protocols. It tells the company’s partners – everyone from smartphone makers to the contractors that maintain its network – exactly what they’ll have to do to build, maintain and offer devices that play well with Verizon Wireless’ 5G network.\nWhile there are a few conflicting reports about the timeline of 5G becoming a reality (despite the Federal Communications Commission’s push this summer) on the devices we carry around every day, the announcement feels like the first of many on our trek to the new 5G future in North America. Not only that, but according to an estimate by Chetan Sharma Consulting, spending on 5G equipment will reach $400 billion globally. But for what?\nChanging CX across industries and technology The 5G future is more than just a set of standards for a faster version of the internet. It offers the potential to accelerate the adoption of some of the hottest technological trends including connected cars, smart homes, artificial intelligence and robotics, in industries spanning from health care, to finance, to manufacturing and beyond. For example, the ability to transfer information instantaneously is critical and even life changing when it comes to something like self-driving cars. Traffic detected ahead? The car will process this information from Google Maps and reroute accordingly. So really the 5G network has the power to completely change the customer experience forever. In fact, 5G has the potential to change our daily lives.\nUsers expect on-demand access to data and applications from anywhere they are on a network (both wireless and wired) and that demand is on the rise. Whether you’re collaborating on a document on your phone or streaming a YouTube video, faster network connections coupled with more powerful devices allow companies to meet these demands while optimizing the customer experience and improving worker productivity and collaboration. And that’s where 5G comes into play. \nFrom content to connections For mobile carriers and industry veterans, it used to be about how much data can be stored and pushed through a given system. Now, there’s a shift in transforming connections through this fifth-generation network with the promise to address responsiveness and latency issues the industry has tried to solve for years. And while that’s been a major issue facing carriers, rather than focusing solely on corrected buffering issues and accelerated streaming, there’s a broader, more holistic approach to improving the customer experience with the advent of 5G.\nThat’s not to say that storage won’t still be an issue that carriers need to address. Recent analysis of data from more than 30 million Synchronoss customers revealed over a 10-month period between April 2015 and January 2016, the average amount of user content created and stored per subscriber increased by a staggering 55%. With the advancement in 5G, look for video traffic and storage to skyrocket. \nCarrier competition 5G will undoubtedly changed the competitive landscape and carriers will need to be more cognizant of the mobile content explosion and the impact it will have on subscribers in order to maintain customer loyalty. Carriers will be expected to support smartphone sales by providing a secure way to move and manage large amount of subscriber data, which will greatly improve the user experience across carrier channels. (My guess is Verizon is well aware that the mobile content explosion is just beginning, considering its acquisitions of AOL and most recently Yahoo).\nThe goal is to be better than broadband internet by making wireless data transmission faster and more effective and to create a data infrastructure that will support everything the “internet of things” has to offer – from refrigerators that inform you when you’re running low on a product to a farmer getting a notification on his cellphone that a tractor in one of his fields needs repair. \nSo where do mobile carriers come into play? All are vying to build the nuts and bolts of the new networks and their ability to rein in contracts could determine whether some of these companies even survive. Verizon’s announcement is likely the first of many from carriers that want to edge ahead of the competition and become the pioneers to this new network. \nBillions of dollars are being allocated to the advancement of 5G networks – and that number will only increase. With its promise to greatly improve the customer experience it’s no wonder carriers like Verizon have stepped ahead of the pack to identify themselves as a leader in the 5G future. However, we’ve just scratched the surface when it comes to the possibilities with 5G, and while we’re not entirely sure of the implications this next-gen network will have, it’s a truly exciting time to be a part of the evolution. \nEditor’s Note: In an attempt to broaden our interaction with our readers we have created this Reader Forum for those with something meaningful to say to the wireless industry. We want to keep this as open as possible, but we maintain some editorial control to keep it free of commercials or attacks.

      "text": "FCC Questions AT&T and Verizon Over “Zero-Rated” Data December 4, 2016 - Written By Joshua Swingle \nThis was inevitably going to happen someday due to net neutrality rules, the FCC has thrown a number of questions at AT&T over their offer that allows customers to use their DIRECTV service without it counting towards their data allowance. AT&T is not alone, though, with Verizon also being questioned over their Go90 service which offers the same zero-rated deal. \nThe reason both companies have been questioned is simple, the FCC launched an investigation into the offers and has come to the conclusion that both companies are violating net neutrality rules by favoring their own services over competing ones. Both companies argue that the data isn’t given out for free, with the video service providers paying for the cost of consumer data, instead of the consumers themselves, but the FCC believes that both carriers are at an advantage since they are the owners of both the network and video services, meaning the data that consumers use is essentially free. The FCC also stated that this harms consumers because they may feel forced to use their carrier’s own video service, essentially giving them a significant advantage over rivals. \nNow, looking at AT&T’s DIRECTV service, consumers have to pay a monthly fee of $35 to gain access to the service, a price that is incredibly competitive considering the fact that it would cost the likes of Netflix or Hulu up to $47 a month per customer to offer just 30 minutes of free data every day on AT&T’s network, without considering the charge of the service itself, a price the FCC considers too expensive for them to compete. AT&T believes their service only benefits consumers, though, and the company has been asked to provide additional information to the FCC before they make a final decision on December 15. The FCC will have to act fast, though, because Donald Trump takes over office on January 20th, and, historically, he has stated that he is not a fan of net neutrality rules. Regarding Verizon , the company has stated that they are still reviewing the inquiry, though they do believe that their service is non-discriminatory and obliges with current net-neutrality rules. \nIt remains to be seen what ends up coming from both of these investigations, but there is the possibility that, once Donald Trump becomes president, both investigations will be ignored and net neutrality rules could be significantly modified, therefore allowing both carriers to carry on as usual, but we’ll see what happens.

A fresh update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow ensures it’ll remain that way for a while longer. \nVerizon is pushing out the goods in a package that’s tagged with the build number MCG24.251-5 . You should expect the usual suite of Marshmallow features to come along for the ride, and if you’ve forgotten what those are be sure to Great deal here if you missed out on Black Friday!. \nOf course, it’s not Nougat and that’s what most of us are worried about getting these days, but Marshmallow is still pretty fresh, and we’re sure those who have been stuck on Lollipop all this time will be quick to agree. Head to the settings menu on your phone to check for it if it doesn’t push its way onto it automatically.",

      "text": "by Karl Bode Monday Dec 05 2016 10:00 EST \nDespite the current FCC being halfway out the door, it continues to pressure companies like AT&T and Verizon on their use of zero rating (exemption from usage caps) to give their own content a distinct market advantage. In letters sent to both AT&T (pdf) and Verizon (pdf), the regulator said that it believes such behavior unfairly tilts the playing filed in favor of incumbent providers, given that competitors face usage penalties that these companies' content and services do not. The FCC had already sent AT&T a letter expressing \"serious concerns\" regarding its zero rating of AT&T's DirecTV Now, and doesn't appear swayed by AT&T's explanations of the effort.\nThe FCC said that AT&T's response to the agency's original inquiry \"tends to confirm our initial view that the Sponsored Data program strongly favors AT&T's own video offerings while unreasonably discriminating against unaffiliated edge providers and limiting their ability to offer competing video services to AT&T's broadband subscribers on a level playing field.\" \nThe agency also stated that it \"reached the preliminary conclusion that (the company's) practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.\" \nThe FCC expressed similar concerns with Verizon regarding the company's \"Free Bee\" sponsored data plan, which lets companies enjoy the same cap-exempt status as Verizon's own Go90 streaming content -- for a notable fee. The FCC notes that Verizon is \"acting in ways that may harm the open Internet, such as preferring [its] own or affiliated content [and] demanding fees from edge providers.\" \nThe FCC's original rules don't specifically ban zero rating, but do give the agency the ability to take a look at the practices on a \"cases by case basis\" to determine if there is competitive harm. In this case, the FCC clearly now believes both companies are hurting competition via the use of zero rating. \nThe problem here is that the FCC's behaviors on zero rating come too little too late. The agency will be overhauled by the incoming Trump administration, and Trump's advisors on guiding telecom policy and picking a new FCC boss are closely allied with the industry and have made it abundantly clear they hope to both dismantle net neutrality rules completely -- and defang and defund the FCC as a consumer watchdog. \nCurrent FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, among several in the running for top FCC spot under Trump, made it clear any zero rating enforcement wouldn't stand under a new administration. \n\"This end-run around Congress’s clear instruction is sad—and pointless,\" proclaimed Pai in a statement (pdf). \"For any unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the Chairman’s direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017.\" Even though it's not clear that the current FCC will actually be able to hold Verizon and AT&T's feet to the fire on the subject, the letters urge both companies to respond to the FCC by December 15.",

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nIt's getting to be the time of the month when we watch our status bars with increasing intensity. Monthly security patches are all well and good, but this time we're also expecting Google devices (including the Pixel) to be bumped up to Android 7.1.1. Verizon has posted some details of the NMF26O update, which should start rolling out today. We believe this may be 7.1.1. \nAccording to Verizon, NMF26O includes the following. \nThis update fixes these issues: Customers couldn't retrieve their Visual Voicemail messages and were getting an error 9999 in some areas. Voicemail icon notification was not displaying when a new voicemail message was received. Device stopped playing voicemail messages over Bluetooth® after the screen timed out. Device occasionally went to blue screen during an inbound call. Email font was too small. Text was garbled on the call screen/dialer and the text was corrupted on the Recent Calls and contact list screens. \nThis update improves: You can now choose Cellular or Wi-Fi as your preferred way of calling while roaming internationally. Latest Android™ security patches. \nSo, nothing Earth-shattering in there. We are expecting some changes to Moves in the next update as well (i.e. tap to wake and lift to check). Verizon didn't mention any of that, though. Updates like this also tend to have a myriad of small changes that aren't significant enough to make it into a changelog. \nIf Google keeps up the pattern from last month, there will be a specific build for Verizon, then one each for North American and international unlocked phones. We'll keep an eye out and let you know when Google posts OTA and system image links. Source:",

      "title": "Verizon to roll out Google Pixel update today with December’s Android security patch",
      "text": "\nGoogle Pixel and Pixel XL owners on Verizon’s network should be receiving an over-the-air update sometime today, coming in at build number NMF26O. Along with the December Android security patch, this new update includes a number of bug fixes like email font improvements, fixes to Visual Voicemail errors and more:\nCustomers couldn’t retrieve their Visual Voicemail messages and were getting an error 9999 in some areas. Voicemail icon notification was not displaying when a new voicemail message was received. Device stopped playing voicemail messages over Bluetooth after the screen timed out. Device occasionally went to blue screen during an inbound call. Email font was too small. Text was garbled on the call screen/dialer and the text was corrupted on the Recent Calls and contact list screens. See also: Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective October 27, 2016 Unfortunately, this update does not appear to contain the ‘double-tap to check phone’ and ‘lift to check phone’ gestures that were rolled out for the Google Pixel phones by Canadian carriers a few weeks ago. The changelog also does not show that it contains Android 7.1.1. Nougat , which Vodafone Australia claims would begin rolling out on Tuesday, December 6 . However, it’s possible that Verizon’s update does contain 7.1.1 and simply does not mention it on the support page. Hopefully we will get more information soon when it actually begins rolling out.\nAs with all OTA updates, it may take a few days for this latest build to hit all of Verizon’s Google Pixel phones. For more details on this update, head to the source link below.",

      "title": "FCC Republicans try to protect AT&T and Verizon in net neutrality case",
      "text": "The two Republican members of the Federal Communications Commission criticized the FCC for investigating AT&T and Verizon in a net neutrality case centering on data cap exemptions. Any action taken now will be overturned under President Donald Trump, they promised.\nThe FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau last week said it reached a preliminary conclusion that AT&T is violating net neutrality rules by using data cap exemptions (or \"zero-rating\") to favor DirecTV video on its mobile network. The FCC also kicked off a similar examination of Verizon's data cap exemptions. AT&T and Verizon are exempting their own video services from mobile data caps while charging other companies for the same zero-rating treatment. Further Reading FCC says AT&T is violating net neutrality with DirecTV data cap exemption\nBut Republicans, who opposed the net neutrality rules and will gain the FCC majority from Democrats after the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, are trying to protect AT&T and Verizon from FCC action.\n\"Chairman [Tom] Wheeler launched yet another broadside against free data for consumers, notwithstanding the objections of Republican commissioners,\" Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai said Friday . \"This end-run around Congress’s clear instruction is sad—and pointless. For any unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the Chairman’s direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017.\"\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, recently urged Wheeler to \"avoid directing its attention and resources in the coming months to complex, partisan, or otherwise controversial items that the new Congress and new Administration will have an interest in reviewing.\" Other Republicans in Congress said the FCC should focus \"only on matters that require action under the law\" and an ongoing spectrum auction.\nWheeler agreed to halt any controversial rulemakings in his remaining time as chair, but he did not say that he would stop investigating potential violations of current rules. The FCC's Republicans want Wheeler to hold off on both rulemakings and the investigation of AT&T and Verizon.\n\"In light of the multiple directives we have received from Congress to avoid directing attention and resources to complex or controversial matters, the staff of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau is inappropriately pressing forward and escalating its investigation of certain providers’ zero-rated video services,\" Republican Commissioner Michael O'Rielly said . \"It would be difficult to come up with a better example of a complex, controversial policy at the current Commission than this attempt to intimidate providers in order to shut down popular offerings to consumers.\" Any action taken now \"can be reviewed and potentially reversed within weeks,\" he said.\nThe Republicans aren't necessarily opposed to any enforcement action taken in Wheeler's last couple months. The FCC on Friday also proposed a fine against NECC Telecom for allegedly charging excessive and unlawful universal service fees to customers; Pai and O'Rielly haven't publicly objected to that action. Further Reading FCC abides by GOP request, deletes everything from meeting agenda\nBut whether zero-rating schemes should be outlawed has been controversial, even among Democrats. The FCC's net neutrality rules don't ban zero-rating, but they let the commission decide on a case-by-case basis whether a particular implementation harms consumers or competitors.\nSome small ISPs are worried about data cap exemptions offered by large providers. AT&T's proposed purchase of Time Warner, the owner of HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros., would help AT&T expand zero-rating of its own content and further disadvantage small ISPs, according to the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA).\n\"AT&T has recently begun to 'zero-rate' (i.e. exempt from data caps) its DirecTV content, and it has stated its intention to expand zero-rating to the Time Warner content it would obtain through this proposed merger,\" said WISPA , which represents hundreds of small ISPs. \"Allowing any ISP to favor certain content has a direct, harmful impact on thousands of small, competitive ISPs that do not own content and lack the ability to negotiate fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to content.\"",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Dec 5th, 2016 \nThe Verizon Pixel and Pixel XL are getting a big bundle of bug fixes today. Build NMF260 is making its way out of the oven with a bunch of fixes, most of which pertain to visual voicemail. Here’s all that the company has solved: Customers couldn’t retrieve their Visual Voicemail messages and were getting an error 9999 in some areas. Voicemail icon notification was not displaying when a new voicemail message was received. Device stopped playing voicemail messages over Bluetooth® after the screen timed out. Device occasionally went to blue screen during an inbound call. Email font was too small. Text was garbled on the call screen/dialer and the text was corrupted on the Recent Calls and contact list screens. \nBeyond that, you can now choose whether you want to use Cellular or Wi-Fi as your preferred calling method when you roam internationally, a feature that’s sure to save you some dollars by making sure you don’t accidentally place an expensive call abroad. \nVerizon also mentions that the devices have gotten the latest security patches. These patches may have plugged up some holes which granted access to the device’s bootloaders, so you tinkerers will probably want to avoid taking it in for now as we get word from the development community on all that’s gone down. For those not worried about such issues, be sure to check for the upgrade over-the-air.",

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nThe first DROID Turbo is over two years old at this point, and since it's a Motorola phone on Verizon, you might think that its software update days are numbered. Perhaps they are, but nevertheless users are starting to see an over-the-air update to Android 6.0.1 for the former flagship phone. Reports started popping up on the dedicated XDA-Developers forum this weekend following a soak test from last month, and it seems the update is going out en masse now. \nSince Android 7.0 has been out for a couple of months (and Pixel phones are getting 7.1.1 starting today ), the update to a year-old operating system might seem like small potatoes. But the Turbo was on the initial list of Marshmallow recipients that Motorola published way back in October of last year, so it's good to see that commitment honored even if it is late. (And it is very late - the newer DROID Turbo 2 received Marshmallow in February .) Oddly, Motorola's support site isn't listing the newest update, or even the previous one. \nThe update is version 24.81.5 in the internal nomenclature of Motorola/Verizon, and the AOSP security patch is from September 1st. For users who've unlocked their bootloader with the Sunshine tool or something similar, XDA members have already posted a ROM file that's flashable via custom recovery, along with an OTA file for those who prefer to stick to stock software. Take note: a greater than normal amount of users seem to be reporting bricked devices after the update, possibly related to incompatible manual file flashes via fastboot. If you're rooted, it seems safest to flash all the associated new files at once. Source:",

      "text": "2016 Holiday Retail Index by Verizon tracking digital commerce traffic By: Maria Montenegro The Holiday Retail Index by Verizon monitors daily traffic volume to the top 25 U.S.-based online retailers throughout the holiday shopping season. 1 Methodology \nThe Verizon Retail Index tracks ecommerce traffic across Verizon’s broadband networks to the top 25 U.S.-based online retailers as identified by eMarketer based on annual revenue. The Index monitors network traffic throughout the holiday shopping season, including during signature events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Additionally, the Index tracks mobile traffic across Verizon’s wireless network to provide ‘mcommerce snapshots’ of the season. Key findings for the first weekend of December Sunday eCommerce traffic change 2015 vs 2016 10% Increase (decrease) in traffic volume measured against each year’s 15 day average (Nov. 1-15) to account for year-over-year general network growth. Sunday eCommerce peak traffic change 2015 vs 2016 27% Increase (decrease) in peak traffic measured against each year’s 15 day average (Nov. 1-15) to account for year-over-year general network growth. Weekends can make it or break it for retailers. \nA healthy spike in weekend traffic demonstrates the importance of getting promotions right when consumers are focused on ticking items off their holiday shopping lists. Ecommerce traffic volume to U.S.-based retailers was up by 4% on Saturday and 10% on Sunday from these same days last year. Peak ecommerce volume was also higher – up by 26% on Saturday and 27% on Sunday – capping off a pattern of increasing peaks during the weekend. Michele Dupré GVP of Retail, Hospitality & Distribution, Verizon Enterprise Solutions With special offers now a holiday season norm, the challenge is in spreading promotions out to keep consumers interested and coming back. It’s early in the season –with Christmas and Hanukkah three weeks out – and plenty of selling still to be done. \nKey findings for Cyber Monday eCommerce traffic change 2015 vs 2016 (-2%) Increase (decrease) in traffic volume measured against each year’s 15 day average (Nov. 1-15) to account for year-over-year general network growth. eCommerce peak traffic change 2015 vs 2016 20% Increase (decrease) in peak traffic measured against each year’s 15 day average (Nov. 1-15) to account for year-over-year general network growth. Cyber Monday not all it’s cracked up to be \nDespite the hype, Cyber Monday as a single day for online shopping may be losing its luster. Ecommerce traffic volume to U.S.-based retailers on Cyber Monday was down from this same day last year. Though still 11% higher than the 15-day average, last year it was 13% higher than on a typical day. Peak ecommerce volume was 20% higher than average which represented a sharp decline from the previous weekend’s highs of 44 and 40% respectively. Michele Dupré GVP of Retail, Hospitality & Distribution, Verizon Enterprise Solutions The focus on bridging Black Friday to Cyber Monday with strong weekend promotions proved effective before consumers likely began to tune out. The key will be to continue driving consumer engagement with creative promotions into the weekend. \nKey findings from the holiday weekend Sunday eCommerce traffic change 2015 vs 2016 15% Increase (decrease) in traffic volume measured against each year’s 15 day average (Nov. 1-15) to account for year-over-year general network growth.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAT&T apparently isn’t going to take the news that Verizon has started testing 5G without doing anything itself — in fact, AT&T is now set to start testing the next generation of data transfer technology itself. In a new blog post, the company said it would begin testing 5G out in the real world in partnership with Intel and Ericsson. The tests are taking place in one of AT&T’s Austin, Texas, offices. \nAs mentioned, AT&T isn’t the only company testing the new technology — all four of the major carriers are working on 5G, but Verizon and AT&T seem to be the furthest ahead in the testing process. \nMore: Hands on with DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service starting at $35 \nThe news isn’t all that surprising — AT&T announced earlier this year that it would be testing 5G in Austin by the end of the year. According to the company, it specifically wants to test how 5G handles 4K video, butit will be testing a range of use cases, including using 5G for VoIP. \nBefore you get too excited, it’s important to note that it will probably be a while before we mere humans have access to 5G. The 5G standard still has yet to be defined, which means it will still likely be a few years before it can actually be implemented. Most companies seem to be targeting a 2020 launch for the new standard, but whether they can hit that goal still remains to be seen. \nIt’s also likely that once 5G implementation begins, it will only be in select areas. The new standard is likely to require all-new infrastructure, especially considering that it uses millimeter wave technology, which can’t really travel long distances or through many obstacles.

      "text": "0 Experimenting with an unsupported phone I don't think any GSM only phones work on Verizon. There was a LTE only phone (no CDMA) at one point, but I don't know if anyone ever got it to work by doing a SIM swap, and if the SIM swap doesn't work I'm not sure what could. I have a blue tooth Join Date Nexus 6, Xperia Z3 Compact, iPhone 5S Carrier(s) Verizon UDP, Bluegreen Mobile, RingPlus Feedback Score 0 The solution is to get an unsupported LTE phone with Band 13. Verizon whitelists the IMEI's of any B13 device they run into - though on a niche device, it can take some time and paperwork to get the message across. LTE only devices work just fine on Verizon. I have a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 that I use daily with a Verizon nano-SIM and a T-Mobile nano-SIM, depending on if I'm in a B12 market ( my Nexus 6 gets the T-Mobile SIM when I go into a T-Mobile B12 market ). The one thing you have to do is use Google Hangouts Dialer for (VoIP) calls, but it can be routed to work with your Verizon number . There is no (legal) way to get a B4-only device to stay on Verizon. Verizon doesn't want them there, and legally, they have every right to deny them access. Do I think it's good business? No, but I understand their logic all the same.",

      "text": "Sun., Dec. 11, 6:00pm \nLater, she explained that she got her look by copying her hometown’s “working lady.” \n“I’d tell ’em all, 'I want to be just like her when I grow up! She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen!' But they’d all say, 'Dolly, you don’t want to be like her. She’s trash.' And I’d think, 'Oh! I’m going to be TRASH when I grow up!'” \nThere were absurd moments too, like the time she said she was feeling “a little saxy” and brought out a teeny tiny saxophone, then whipped through that Benny Hill theme on the thing while dancing around in her glittery high heels. \nShe talked about the fires back home and how she can’t wait to go help. And about how after this tour ends she’s going to call on all of her famous friends to help her raise money for the area. (And because she’s Dolly Parton, she’ll do this the most adorable way possible: with a telethon.) \nShe spoke about how stressful politics are this year — without taking sides, just pointing out all of the fear and unrest in the world. Then she churned out a medley of old protest music ranging from singalong hits by Don McLean to Pete Seeger. Soon, she had a sold-out auditorium swaying back and forth, belting out old family car drive tunes about unity, love and togetherness. \nAnd when it came time to close the night out — after every pairing of best friends or sweethearts danced to \"9 to 5\" — she proved why she’s the nation’s great unifier. \nShe pleaded with her crowd to resist the fear and hate in the world and to do our part to pump it back full of love, to change the tide of things. Dolly’s perseverance and contribution to American music have earned her the right to have whatever she wants: even world peace. Contact:",

      "text": "att g testing austin at t More Jonathan Weiss/123RF\nAT&T apparently isn’t going to take the news that Verizon has started testing 5G without doing anything itself — in fact, AT&T is now set to start testing the next generation of data transfer technology itself. In a new blog post, the company said it would begin testing 5G out in the real world in partnership with Intel and Ericsson. The tests are taking place in one of AT&T’s Austin, Texas, offices.\nAs mentioned, AT&T isn’t the only company testing the new technology — all four of the major carriers are working on 5G, but Verizon and AT&T seem to be the furthest ahead in the testing process.\nMore: Hands on with DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service starting at $35\nThe news isn’t all that surprising — AT&T announced earlier this year that it would be testing 5G in Austin by the end of the year. According to the company, it specifically wants to test how 5G handles 4K video, butit will be testing a range of use cases, including using 5G for VoIP.\nBefore you get too excited, it’s important to note that it will probably be a while before we mere humans have access to 5G. The 5G standard still has yet to be defined, which means it will still likely be a few years before it can actually be implemented. Most companies seem to be targeting a 2020 launch for the new standard, but whether they can hit that goal still remains to be seen.\nIt’s also likely that once 5G implementation begins, it will only be in select areas. The new standard is likely to require all-new infrastructure, especially considering that it uses millimeter wave technology, which can’t really travel long distances or through many obstacles.\nMicrosoft shrinks bandwidth requirements for its Holoportation system Start getting ready for 5G!

      "text": "By Mike Shields\nAOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong said he's \"cautiously optimistic\" that Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo will go through despite the internet company's disclosure this fall that it suffered a significant data breach.\nSpeaking during a keynote interview at Business Insider's Ignition conference in New York on Monday, Mr. Armstrong said the deal has a better chance of going through than not.\nMeanwhile, the digital media veteran said he's been working closely with Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer on strategy and structural planning as if the deal will close. And he's been impressed with some of Yahoo's plans for 2017 outside of the integration work.\n\"The data breach that happened at Yahoo slowed things down,\" Mr. Armstrong acknowledged. \"There's been a constructive dialogue.\" He said the next 60 days will be crucial for putting the pieces together assuming Yahoo becomes part of the Verizon family.\nIn September, Yahoo revealed it had been hit with a data breach that potentially impacted 500 million users. The next month, Verizon's legal representative indicated that the breach left an opening for the terms of Verizon's agreement to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion to be revisited.\n\"Marissa and her team are doing the best job they can of dealing with it, \" Mr. Armstrong added. \"[Data hacking] is a reality that many people are dealing with today.\"\nBeyond the Yahoo deal, Mr. Armstrong predicted that over the next few years, as more companies in digital media grapple with Google and Facebook's advertising dominance , there will be more consolidation driven by a desire to build larger audience scale.\nThe ad market is headed toward a place where in terms of audience reach for media companies, \"millions are less important than billions,\" he said.\nNaturally, he believes that AOL, coupled with Verizon's data and potentially Yahoo's audience, will be a player in that future. Mr. Armstrong has in fact said that the company is looking to reach 2 billion consumers by 2020.\nHe said Verizon's opportunity to challenge Facebook and Google will be to go after traditional brand marketers -- that is, companies that have traditionally spent big on TV ads.\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com\n 18:58 ET (23:58 ",

However, Verizon has an update of its own for both devices, which brings a few more improvements and bug fixes. Although the Big Red does not mention anything about Android 7.1.1 Nougat, Google announced that the update is available for all Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones starting today. Still, since this OTA update will be rolled out in stages it may take several weeks until it reaches all compatible devices. Anyway, if you own the Verizon Pixel/Pixel XL , you should be looking for a software update with build number NMF26O. We also have a complete changelog for the update, so read on if you want to know what changes it brings. Play Video First of all, the update fixes a couple of issues that were reported by users, like the fact that they couldn't retrieve their Visual Voicemail messages and were getting an error 9999 in some areas. Furthermore, Google also addresses an issue with the Voicemail icon notification, which was not displaying when a new voicemail message was received. From time to time, Pixel/Pixel XL devices stopped playing voicemail messages over Bluetooth after the screen timed out. This bug should be fixed by the latest update, too. Another issue that would make the phone occasionally go to blue screen during an inbound call has been patched as well. The email font is now slightly bigger, as many customers complained that it was smaller than it should be. The last issue addressed by the update concerns the text that was garbled on the call screen/dialer, and corrupted on the Recent Calls and contact list screens. After the update, you should not have problems of this kind any longer. A new option that allows users to choose Cellular or Wi-Fi as their preferred way of calling while roaming internationally has been included too. Also, Verizon has confirmed that the update contains the latest Android security patches .",

The Index monitors network traffic throughout the holiday shopping season, including during signature events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nThe next edition of the 2016 Verizon Retail Index will capture digital shopping activity from Saturday and Sunday ( Dec. 10-11 ) and will be released on Monday, December 12 by 1pm Eastern time .

      "text": "att g testing austin at t More Jonathan Weiss/123RF\nAT&T apparently isn’t going to take the news that Verizon has started testing 5G without doing anything itself — in fact, AT&T is now set to start testing the next generation of data transfer technology itself. In a new blog post, the company said it would begin testing 5G out in the real world in partnership with Intel and Ericsson. The tests are taking place in one of AT&T’s Austin, Texas, offices.\nAs mentioned, AT&T isn’t the only company testing the new technology — all four of the major carriers are working on 5G, but Verizon and AT&T seem to be the furthest ahead in the testing process.\nMore: Hands on with DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service starting at $35\nThe news isn’t all that surprising — AT&T announced earlier this year that it would be testing 5G in Austin by the end of the year. According to the company, it specifically wants to test how 5G handles 4K video, butit will be testing a range of use cases, including using 5G for VoIP.\nBefore you get too excited, it’s important to note that it will probably be a while before we mere humans have access to 5G. The 5G standard still has yet to be defined, which means it will still likely be a few years before it can actually be implemented. Most companies seem to be targeting a 2020 launch for the new standard, but whether they can hit that goal still remains to be seen.\nIt’s also likely that once 5G implementation begins, it will only be in select areas. The new standard is likely to require all-new infrastructure, especially considering that it uses millimeter wave technology, which can’t really travel long distances or through many obstacles.\nMicrosoft shrinks bandwidth requirements for its Holoportation system Start getting ready for 5G!

Smith said she thought that when cars left the garage after the game, “that will be a challenge.”\nIt was not immediately clear when repairs would be finished.\nHowever it appeared that the sinkhole was relatively limited in size. Neither length nor width appeared to exceed 5 feet . By about 10 p.m., efforts were well advanced to place a steel plate over the hole.\nNo cause for the hole could be learned.",

      "text": "By Mike Shields\nAOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong said he's \"cautiously optimistic\" that Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo will go through despite the internet company's disclosure this fall that it suffered a significant data breach.\nSpeaking during a keynote interview at Business Insider's Ignition conference in New York on Monday, Mr. Armstrong said the deal has a better chance of going through than not.\nMeanwhile, the digital media veteran said he's been working closely with Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer on strategy and structural planning as if the deal will close. And he's been impressed with some of Yahoo's plans for 2017 outside of the integration work.\n\"The data breach that happened at Yahoo slowed things down,\" Mr. Armstrong acknowledged. \"There's been a constructive dialogue.\" He said the next 60 days will be crucial for putting the pieces together assuming Yahoo becomes part of the Verizon family.\nIn September, Yahoo revealed it had been hit with a data breach that potentially impacted 500 million users. The next month, Verizon's legal representative indicated that the breach left an opening for the terms of Verizon's agreement to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion to be revisited.\n\"Marissa and her team are doing the best job they can of dealing with it, \" Mr. Armstrong added. \"[Data hacking] is a reality that many people are dealing with today.\"\nBeyond the Yahoo deal, Mr. Armstrong predicted that over the next few years, as more companies in digital media grapple with Google and Facebook's advertising dominance , there will be more consolidation driven by a desire to build larger audience scale.\nThe ad market is headed toward a place where in terms of audience reach for media companies, \"millions are less important than billions,\" he said.\nNaturally, he believes that AOL, coupled with Verizon's data and potentially Yahoo's audience, will be a player in that future. Mr. Armstrong has in fact said that the company is looking to reach 2 billion consumers by 2020.\nHe said Verizon's opportunity to challenge Facebook and Google will be to go after traditional brand marketers -- that is, companies that have traditionally spent big on TV ads.\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com\n 05, 2016 18:58 ET (23:58 ",

      "title": "Equinix to Acquire Portfolio of 24 Data Center Sites from Verizon in $3.6 Billion Deal",
      "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif.   Equinix, Inc. (Nasdaq: EQIX ), the global interconnection and data center company, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a portfolio of 24 data center sites and their operations from Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ ) for $3.6 billion in an all cash transaction. The 24 sites consist of 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas.  The addition of these strategic facilities and customers will further strengthen Equinix's global platform by: increasing interconnection in the U.S. and Latin America ; opening three new markets in Bogotá, Culpeper and Houston ; and accelerating Equinix's penetration of the enterprise and strategic market sectors, including government and energy.\nThe acquisition of these assets will enable Equinix customers to further respond to a key market trend that is enabling their evolution from traditional businesses to \"digital businesses\" -- the need to globally interconnect with people, locations, cloud services and data.  Additionally, customers will have the opportunity to operate on an expanded global platform to process, store and distribute larger volumes of latency sensitive data and applications at the digital edge, closer to end-users and local markets.\nEquinix expands global leadership with proposed acquisition of Verizon data centers Equinix to expand footprint of 24 new data center sites containing 29 data center buildings, across 15 metro areas including 3 new metros of Bogatà, Houston and Culpeper, VA. The acquired portfolio includes approximately 900 customers, with a significant number of enterprise customers new to Equinix's platform, and it adds approximately 2.4 million gross square feet.  It will bring Equinix's total global footprint to 175 data centers in 43 markets and approximately 17 million gross square feet across the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific markets.  \nThe transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nHighlights / Key Facts \nThe transaction includes 29 data center buildings across 24 sites in 15 metro areas, including Atlanta ( Atlanta and Norcross ), Bogotá, Boston ( Billerica ), Chicago ( Westmont ), Culpeper , Dallas ( Irving , Richardson -Alma and Richardson-Pkwy), Denver (Englewood) , Houston , Los Angeles ( Torrance ), Miami ( Miami and Doral ), New York (Carteret, Elmsford and Piscataway), São Paulo, Seattle ( Kent ), Silicon Valley ( Santa Clara and San Jose ), and Washington, D.C. ( Ashburn , Manassas and Herndon ). The addition of the new data center assets will greatly expand Equinix's global platform for enterprises by adding new markets and Fortune 1000 enterprise customers. It expands capacity in existing markets, such as Atlanta , Denver, Miami , New York , São Paulo, Seattle and Silicon Valley, and it provides a platform for the future expansion of the acquired data centers. The NAP (Network Access Point) of the Americas facility in Miami is a key interconnection point and will become a strategic hub and gateway for Equinix customer deployments servicing Latin America . Combined with the Verizon data centers in Bogotá and the NAP do Brasil in São Paulo, it will strategically position Equinix in the growing Latin American market. The NAP of the Capital Region in Culpeper, VA is a highly secure campus focused on government agency customers, strengthening Equinix as a platform of choice for government services and service providers. Approximately 250 Verizon employees, primarily in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.

      "title": "Equinix to buy 24 data centers from Verizon in $3.6 billion deal",
      "text": "Data center giant Equinix has revealed plans to buy 24 data center sites and their associated operations from Verizon in a $3.6 billion all-cash deal.\nFounded in 1998, Equinix already offered more than 150 data centers to companies and cloud-service providers in 40 markets, and counts some big-name clients such as Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. Its 24 new sites will be spread across 15 metro areas in the U.S. and Latin America, with the deal expanding on its existing presence in some areas while opening the doors to a handful of completely new markets, namely Bogotá, Culpeper, and Houston.\n“It enables us to enhance cloud and network density to continue to attract enterprises, while expanding our presence in the Americas,” explained Steve Smith, president and CEO at Equinix, in a press release . “The new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros.”\nAlongside the infrastructure acquisition, Equinix says that it will also acquire 900 new customers from Verizon as part of the deal, which it expects to close in mid-2017.\nAssuming the deal is seen through to completion, the company will count a total of 175 data centers in 43 markets across Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions.\n",

      "text": "Verizon to Sell Data Centers to Equinix for $3.6B \nPublished December 06, 2016 \nVerizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers to Equinix Inc for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. \nContinue Reading Below \nThe data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas in the United States and Latin America, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. \nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. \nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. \nVerizon has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US and Sprint, which have been offering deep discounts on cellphone and data plans. \nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. \nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. \nThe acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. \nEquinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities and Davis Polk & Wardwell. \nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. \nShares of Verizon and Equinix were up marginally in premarket trading. \n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook Inc. \nThe sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon’s cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction. \nVerizon’s advisers were Citigroup Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Equinix was advised by Evercore Partners Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. ",
