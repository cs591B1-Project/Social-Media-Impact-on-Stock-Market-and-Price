      "text": " 29 pm By Staff Writer Jones Auto Group opens Ford dealership \nFor four decades, the Gerald Jones Auto Group carved out its niche in the metro area auto market selling imports such as Volvos, Volkswagens, Hondas and Audis. \nBut when the former owners of the Bobby Jones Ford Lincoln dealership on Wrightsboro Road started looking for a potential buyer in 2015, it was a deal company President Andy Jones couldn’t refuse – especially when the Ford F-series pickup perennially ranks as America’s best-selling vehicle. \n“If I sold a couple an Audi or a Honda, the No. 1 other vehicle in the household was a Ford truck,” Jones said. “So I knew I wouldn’t be stealing from my other customers to sell Fords.” \nBased on Thursday’s grand opening event at the dealership – renamed Gerald Jones Ford Lincoln – the Jones Auto Group appears to be making the transition to domestic brands quite well. \n“Sales are just growing every month,” Jones said of the dealership, which was functionally completed in September. “Looking back over the last three years, last month was a record.” \nA crowd in the hundreds attended the event, many of them for a meet-and-greet with retired NASCAR driver Bill Elliott, who was voted its “Most Popular Driver” a record 16 times. The Georgia native, known as “Awesome Bill from Dawsonville,” drove Fords. \nJones purchased the dealership from the children of Frank Lawrence, who owned the dealership from 1991 until his death in 2012, and his wife, Marguerite, who died in August 2015. \nFinancial terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Jones said Lawrence’s heirs retained a minority stake in the dealership. Earlier this year Jones said the entire acquisition, including inventory, represented a nearly $25 million investment – the largest since the auto group developed its auto mall near the intersection of Washington and Columbia roads more than a decade ago. \nMost Bobby Jones Ford employees were retained during the purchase, Jones said, adding that 15 positions have been added at the dealership since its purchase, bringing total employment to 95. All sales consultants are equipped with iPad tablets to give on-the-spot information and customer assistance. \nThe most visible change at the 20-acre property was the demolition of its iconic office and showroom, which bore an unmistakable likeness to Augusta National Golf Club’s clubhouse. The new dealership, a sleeker and more modern Ford-approved facade, features “green” amenities such as LED interior and exterior lighting. \nKevin Giacomini, Ford Motor Co.’s Atlanta-based regional sales manager, said the project was completed in near record time. \n“Andy cut the time in about half, just because of his ability to hit all the timelines and push the contractors to get things done,” he said. “He did an amazing job.” \nJones said Ford was “very, very supportive” through the construction process, as were the county’s construction, code and permit officials who “never held us up.” \n“Had they held us up at all, we wouldn’t have made it,” Jones said. \nThe eight-brand dealership group is named for Andy Jones’ father Gerald, who opened his first dealership in 1974. \nReach Damon Cline at (706) 823-3352 or damon.cline@augustachronicle.com Advertisement",

      "text": "(LINK) \nThe deep-dive back story that was only discussed here is below: \nSEPTEMBER 15TH 2016 – This is a really important interview to grasp the scope of the America-First economic challenge in front of Donald Trump and specifically U.S. workers. Unfortunately, what follows below is the best version of the interview we can find and it has edits, significant edits by CNN, to the initial portion of the interview as it originally aired. \nFor those unfamiliar with how structured these types of interviews are, there are a few key aspects worth noting in advance of watching the video: \n♦ CEO Mark Fields is not alone in this interview. Off camera there are key corporate executive advisers, PR, Marketing, HR, Risk Mgmt., etc. positioned to give immediate feedback toward any sound bites that can have an adverse impact on the corporate objectives. There’s a few times when you can see Fields taking cues from those voices. \n♦ The CEO corporate culture (starts in MBA school) teaches executives how to use code words and phrases to avoid pitfalls, and unless you are skilled -or familiar- in detecting the nuance, much of the significant verbiage can be missed. Words and phrases matter. \nThere’s a big difference between a major corporate CEO saying “ investment in North America “, and “ investment in America “. The former references international trade agreements such as NAFTA which apply to Mexico the U.S. and Canada, the latter is directed to the United States. Pay close attention and you’ll note the importance. \n♦ Notice how Mark Fields will not answer key and specific questions directly. Instead choosing to use parseltongue and politispeak coded language. This is a trained skill much like a professional politician is trained in non-answers that leave the viewer/listener the impression of an answer. \n♦ Pay additional attention to phrases such as: • “ retained or created jobs “, you’ll notice the similarity to “saved or created jobs” vis-a-vis the Obama stimulus. The use of the phrases holds a similar intent. • “ most of our investment is here in the U.S. “, this is a slight-of-word use. Of course Ford has most of their investment here in the U.S., the historic valued infrastructure is part of that phrase. The issue for this conversation is “future investment or reinvestment”, and that’s where you see the verbiage shift (use of) “North America” coming into play. • “value market” is the term for cheaper cars. In this example the Ford Focus model. \nNotice also Poppy Harlow was finally able to pin Fields down on “40% labor savings”. That specific number is where you hear the counter Trump approach of a 35% tariff which would eliminate that incentive. If Ford saves 40% labor cost on Ford Focus vehicles by building in Mexico, and they face a 35% Tax upon re-import, the incentive to have Mexican workers build the vehicle is lost. Notice Mark Fields avoids answering that question. \nNotice also Harlow asks about the 40% savings and where that profit is reinvested. Notice how Fields says the monies return to the corporate structure (U.S.A.) where reinvestment determinations are made. However, the reinvestment determination, as previously outlined, is “a North American” and/or “global” determination. Parseltongue. \nOn one hand the CEO states the goal is to remain competitive in the “value market” (ie. cheap car market like Kia etc.), however, at the same time Fields never mentions lowering the price, because it’s the profit margin actually driving the decision – not any consumer savings. The U.S.A market (consumer) will not see Ford Focus vehicles drop in price; instead they’re just made in Mexico at a lower cost. \nThis key distinction is the heart of the Economic Patriotism argument. \nAn argument that Bernie Sanders has made effectively, Donald Trump has also recognized, and one which through the course of time -and history has empirically evidenced- creates terrible long-term consequences for the rapidly diminishing middle class U.S. worker. \nThe economic patriotism distinction is also where traditionally minded conservatives, like myself, have reevaluated the bigger picture and accepted the following: In a global world the concept of traditional economic models (for free-market capitalism) are no longer working on behalf of the United States of America – because there is no national pride or incentive attached to the end goal, profit. \nPaul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recalled that John Maynard Keynes once was challenged for altering his position on some economic issue: “When my information changes,” said Keynes “ I change my mind. What do you do Sir?” \nWhile I have never agreed with Keynesian economic theory, Keynes attributed quote itself is never more apropos than today’s 2016 American economics argument amid various conservatives. What good is Mark Levin’s definition of conservatism, when there’s no middle class America left to conserve? \nWhat good are George Will’s free market theories when the end result is the outflow of American wealth into poorer, less economically developed countries, while we EBT ourselves into a national debt crisis because we are trying to sustain the diminished value of the American worker? \nNot only is this historic approach now rapidly becoming the pathway into an unrecoverable American economic death spiral, it is also global wealth distribution done by Wall Street, not Main Street. \nThe result, our result, is an ever expanding, seemingly impossible to stop, wealth gap, creating an unnatural and profoundly unhealthy class system, in America, between the “Rich” and “Poor”. \nWe do not need socialism to fix the problem, we need economic patriotism from industrial giants, Main Street, who value the principles behind putting American-workers-First. \nNow, watch the video [ *Note* ignore the pontificating liberalism of Poppy Harlow or you’ll miss important stuff ]: \nFord is willing to spend $1.6 BILLION to create 2,800 jobs in Mexico, to save 40% on the price of their “value product line” of automobiles. \nIf a Ford Focus costs $8,000 to manufacture (in Mexico). How many Focus’s would they need to sell at an additional 40% profit margin to make up for their initial investment of $1.6 BILLION. Do the math, and you’ll realize why I shall never again purchase a Ford vehicle. \nFord CEO Mark Fields, like many modern vulture capitalists, is a globalist – not an America-First CEO.",

Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nHe followed up shortly afterward, tweeting, “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” \nFord has two Louisville plants that produce Lincoln vehicles. It was not immediately clear whether Ford had ever said it intended to move Lincoln production. \nThe Louisville Assembly Plant makes the Lincoln MKC and Ford Escape. The facility employs 4,705 people, according to the Ford website. Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant produces the Lincoln Navigator, as well as Ford Expedition, F-250 through F-550 series of trucks and Super Duty pickups, according to the website. It has 5,091 employees.",

      "text": "World News | Fri Nov 18, 2016 | 9:16am IST Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico A Lincoln MKX SUV concept car is displayed at Auto China 2014 in Beijing April 20, 2014. REUTERS/Jason Lee/Files By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Bill Rigby) Next In World News ",

Posted 18 Nov 2016 10:35 Updated 18 Nov 2016 11:40 U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appears at a campaign roundtable event in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S., October 28, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo A \nWASHINGTON: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest US$2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further US$1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Bill Rigby) - Reuters",

      "text": "Ford hit the right note with the EcoSport in the Indian markets, cracking open the compact SUV segment in the peninsula. But the car couldn’t really compete for aesthetics against its rivals in the US. Perhaps that’s why the facelift of the car was recently unveiled and its India-made version is all set to be exported to The States, where sales are slated to commence by 2018.\nThis also makes the EcoSport the first vehicle to be imported by the US from India. Prior to this announcement, the company was under fire from President-elect Donald Trump for moving the manufacturing of all its smaller cars to Mexico. Though the move has not affected any jobs for American workers, Trump has vowed to impose a 35 percent tax on cars that are built in Mexico for the US market, which, he says, will force automakers to bring jobs back to US plants.\nThus, Ford has now resorted to India to at least take care of the EcoSport supplies in the American market. But exports are nothing new for the India-made EcoSport that is rolled out of the company’s Chennai plant. The facility caters to more than 100 markets across the globe. Notably, around 15 percent of the total production is consumed domestically.\nTalking about the car, its forthcoming iteration broke cover earlier this week, ahead of the Los Angeles Motor Show. In India, the car has been a shadow of itself ever since the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza was launched in the summer of 2016. An update was long due and with the US launch slated for 2018, it would be safe to say that the new EcoSport will make its way onto the subcontinent sometime before that.\nRead More on: Ford Ecosport \nRead full article on cardekho.com",

      "text": "Trump: Ford Not Moving Lincoln Model Production to Mexico, Keeping Plant in Ky. \nDonald Trump (AP Photo) By Todd Beamon | Thursday, 17 Nov 2016 10:00 PM Close A A \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said late Thursday that Ford Motor Co.'s executive chairman told him the automaker would not move its Lincoln MKC production to Mexico — remaining instead in Kentucky. \nTrump announced the move by William Clay \"Bill\" Ford Jr. on Twitter: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nFord is the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford. The company is based in Dearborn, Mich. \nThe automaker was planning to shift the production of its Lincoln and Escape SUV models from the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky to Mexico. The plant has 4,500 employees. \nIn October, Ford shut down production at the plant because of slow demand, The Louisville Courier-Journal reported . \nThe Mexico decision was part of an overall effort by Ford to shift production of several models to Mexico to lower costs. \nEarlier this fall, the company said it would move all of its small-car production from the United States to a new $1.6 billion plant in Mexico that would create 2,800 jobs. \nTrump had slammed the plan since it became public, saying at the Bethel United Methodist Church in Flint in September \"it used to be that cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico . \n\"And now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\" \nTrump had made returning jobs to Rust Belt crucial to his campaign.

      "text": "The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n10:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. But it was unclear where the MKC would be built. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC would stay in Louisville. A spokeswoman wouldn't say whether the SUV was destined for Mexico. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n--- \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n--- \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n— By Julie Pace \n--- \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n--- \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n--- \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n--- \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n--- \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n—By Julie Bykowicz \n--- \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n--- \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n-- \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n--- \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son — visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n--- \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n--- \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n--- \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n--- \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n--- \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n--- \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n--- \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n--- \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Email report this ad \nEl Trumpo is up to his old tricks again – lying to his gullible supporters who will believe anything he tweets. Here’s what he’s posting tonight: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nBut as some on Twitter are pointing out, this seems rather impossible, since Bill Ford had already met with Trump for saying similar things before, and tried to correct him on the lies he was tweeting out: \nFord Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford has met with Donald Trump to talk about the Republican presidential candidate’s extensive criticism of the automaker’s investments in Mexico. \nFord today told the Economic Club of Washington that he thought Trump’s criticism of the No. 2 automaker’s foreign investments were “infuriating” and “frustrating” because of its extensive investments and employment in the U.S. Trump has threatened if elected to impose hefty tariffs on Ford imports from Mexico. \nHe also told el Trumpo that there would not be any loss of jobs from the plant in Kentucky, but that doesn’t matter to Trump: \nFord rejected the criticism from Trump, noting that it employs more U.S. workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than its rivals. “We should be celebrated I think in some ways as the great American car company,” Ford said. “We make more cars and trucks here than anyone else.” \nFord announced last month that all of the company’s small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from the White House hopeful. The automaker is expected to replace lost production at its Wayne, Mich., plant with a new Ford Ranger pickup and Bronco SUV., but has not publicly confirmed the plan. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move, noting it has even moved jobs back from Mexico to the U.S. Trump called Ford’s decision “horrible.” He has criticized Ford’s Mexican investments for more than a year and vowed to pressure the automaker to reverse course if elected. “We shouldn’t allow it to happen,” Trump said. \nThis was Trump’s response to that meeting: Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2015 Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2015 \nSo, did he save them then, or now? I guess both times. Also, neither, according to the guy he talked to. \nGet used to this – he has his own propaganda machine, and they will never believe any facts contrary to what Emperor Trump says.",

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n10:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. But it was unclear where the MKC would be built. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC would stay in Louisville. A spokeswoman wouldn't say whether the SUV was destined for Mexico. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "title": "Trump: Ford keeping Lincoln plant in Kentucky",
      "text": "Trump tweets Ford is keeping Lincoln plant in Kentucky 10:52 PM, Nov 17, 2016 Share Article   President Elect Donald Trump says he has received assurances from Ford Motor Company that they will be keeping a Kentucky plant in operation. \nTrump tweeted about his conversation with company CEO Bill Ford Jr. Thursday night. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord released the following statement following the tweets: We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team – and the new Congress – as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs – building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years. Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone. Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States. We will have more details to share on our future plans at the appropriate time. \nTrump was critical of Ford both during the primary and general election campaigns, due to their plans to move some production overseas. \nFord had previously announced that they will move small car production to Mexico, and that they have no plans to close any US plants.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n10:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. But it was unclear where the MKC would be built. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC would stay in Louisville. A spokeswoman wouldn't say whether the SUV was destined for Mexico. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York.   \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n10:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. But it was unclear where the MKC would be built. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC would stay in Louisville. A spokeswoman wouldn't say whether the SUV was destined for Mexico. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico.\n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump posted on Twitter. “He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico.”\nFord f has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019.\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker “confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.”\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” she added, in a statement.\nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border.\n\nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs.\nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months.\nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico.\nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018.\nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company’s small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result.\nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move – and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars.\nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker’s investments in Mexico.\nFord said Trump’s criticism was “infuriating” and “frustrating” because of the company’s extensive investments and employment in the United States.",

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nBut there's one problem: Ford never planned to move its Louisville, Kentucky plant to Mexico. \nFord originally had plans to shift production of its Lincoln MKC vehicle from its Louisville plant to Mexico, according to The Courier-Journal, but the shift was not expected to affect employment levels at the plant.\nFord has now opted to keep building the line at the Louisville facility.\nThe company never announced it would be shutting down the plant and moving it across the border as Trump asserted. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Donald Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Ford said in a statement. \nFord announced on Tuesday that it would move production of its Ford Focus line of vehicles from Michigan to Mexico in order to make room at the factory for two new products. There will be no job loss due to the move however, CEO Mark Fields told Reuters.\n \nDuring his campaign Trump railed against American companies that he said outsourced jobs overseas and left some Americans unemployed. \nThe president-elect  threatened  to put a 45% tariff on goods from China to in an effort to punish companies that build products overseas.  \nNOW WATCH: Here's the ad that Ivanka Trump reportedly doesn't want America to see \n",

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on Donald Trump&apos;s transition to the presidency (all times EST):\n11:15 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won&apos;t move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn&apos;t change the company&apos;s plan.\n---\n8 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker.\nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration&apos;s approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n---\n7:20 p.m.\nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.\nThat&apos;s according to a senior Trump official.\nThe official wouldn&apos;t say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition.\nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity.\n- By Julie Pace\n---\n7:10 p.m.\nJapan&apos;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence.\nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust.\nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details.\n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today&apos;s discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting.\n---\n6:02 pm\nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump&apos;s representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president&apos;s priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\"\nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department&apos;s transition process.\nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members.\n---\n4:30 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump&apos;s transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information.\nCoordination was on hold until Trump&apos;s team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump&apos;s team.\nBut Trump&apos;s team still hasn&apos;t submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn&apos;t saying which agencies are missing.\nHoffine says the White House expects Trump&apos;s team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\"\n---\n4:26 p.m.\nIsrael&apos;s Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration.\nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies.\nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\"\nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right&apos;s platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.\n---\n3:27 p.m.\nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump.\nThat&apos;s according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president&apos;s transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced.\nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"\nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\"\nBut the two began mending fences after Trump&apos;s victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.\n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\"\n-By Julie Bykowicz\n---\n3:15\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he&apos;s confident Donald Trump&apos;s administration can find common ground with Democrats.\nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington.\nPence says he&apos;s looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\"\nHe adds: \"I&apos;m very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect&apos;s agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\"\n---\n3:07 p.m.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill.\nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition.\nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care.\nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can.\nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser.\n--\n2:40 p.m.\nAmerica&apos;s future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris.\nThat&apos;s according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s transition website, GreatAgain.gov.\nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\"\nIt&apos;s a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\"\nThat version was later removed from the website.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n---\n2:15 p.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists.\nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.\n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here.\nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.\n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\"\nSlavin says it&apos;s great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn&apos;t have recognized Pence if other people hadn&apos;t mentioned his name.\n---\n1:50 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower.\nTrump&apos;s transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union.\nIt comes ahead of Trump&apos;s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election.\nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n---\n1:40 p.m.\nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump.\nMoskowitz said Thursday she&apos;s taken herself out of the running. She heads New York&apos;s largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower.\nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned.\nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump&apos;s campaign.\"\n---\n10:47 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he&apos;s confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\"\nThat&apos;s what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders.\nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn&apos;t in disarray.\n---\n10:44 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\"\nThat&apos;s the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday&apos;s closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor.\nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won&apos;t be the slow process they&apos;re used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama&apos;s record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs.\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.\nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family.\n---\n10:10 a.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He&apos;s also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon.\nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy.\nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon.\nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\"\nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises.\nHe&apos;s speaking to reporters in Washington.\n---\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated.\n---\n8:50 a.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration.\nCruz tells Fox News Channel&apos;s \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower.\nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country.\n\"I&apos;m eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin&apos; Ted.\"\n---\n8:05 a.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump&apos;s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it&apos;s Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\"\nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.\n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC&apos;s \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday.\n\"He&apos;s there sitting at his desk, he&apos;s on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He&apos;s ready.\"\nConway said the pace of Trump&apos;s transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.\n ",

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Despite Trump victory lap, Ford wasn't planning to move plant to Mexico by Chris Isidore @CNNMoney November 17, 2016: 11:53 PM ET Ford CEO: 35% tariff would impact U.S. workers President-elect Donald Trump took credit Thursday night for stopping Ford from moving jobs from Kentucky to Mexico. \nThe only problem with the claim? Ford had never said it planned to move its Louisville, Ky, assembly plant to Mexico. \nIn fact the automaker had already made a commitment to the United Auto Workers union in their legally binding contract a year ago to invest $700 million in the plant and to build the Ford Escape there. On Thursday it said it will also keep production of the Lincoln MKC at the plant as well, though that won't change employment. \nIt had planned to shift production of the much smaller volume Lincoln MKC to another plant as Escape production increased. Mexico was a possible location for that luxury model. But even under that plan, it had planned to keep employment near the current 4,700 workers. \nThat decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was enough for the president-elect to take a victory lap on his favorite medium of Twitter on Thursday night. \n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" he tweeted. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nFord issued a statement Thursday in which it repeated earlier statements that it has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants and added 28,000 jobs there in the last five years. That represents nearly a 50% increase in U.S. jobs at Ford during that period. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" said the statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nFord had temporarily shut its Louisville plant the weeks of Oct. 17 and Oct. 31. \nBut that is due to slowing sales and excess inventory, not a plan to move production to Mexico. And most of the 4,700 workers there continued to receive 80% of their normal play during this temporary shutdown. \nRelated: Ford will be the first automaker to import cars to India to the U.S. \nFord has announced plans to move small car production to a new plant under construction in Mexico, but the workers who now build those models -- the C-Max and Ford Focus -- will keep their jobs and be put to work building more profitable and popular vehicles, likely the new Ford Bronco SUV. \nFord did announce plans this week to be the first automaker to import a passenger vehicle from India to the United States when it introduces the EcoSport to the U.S. market in 2018. That compact crossover SUV has always been built at the plant in India, though, and has never been built in the United States. \nThis is not the first time that Trump has claimed credit for getting Ford to change its mind on Mexico production when in fact Ford was only following the terms of a contract it had reached with the UAW. \nA year ago when Ford started building the heavy duty F-Series trucks in Ohio rather than in Mexico, where they had been built, Trump again claimed credit. \n\"I brought [Ford's Mexican investment plans] up in so many speeches, and frankly I think I embarrassed 'em,\" he told a crowd in New Hampshire in October 2015. \"But Ford is now gonna build a massive plant in the United States, and every single person, even my harshest critics gave me credit for it.\" \nHowever Ford wasn't building a new plant, simply shifting production to an existing U.S. plant. And that shift had been agreed to four years earlier in a 2011 labor deal with the UAW. CNNMoney (New York) First published November 17, 2016: 11:45 PM ET ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.\nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.\nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"",

Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

The defiance of those who protest and the fear of those entrapped. More > \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Share Tweet \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars.

      "text": "Nov 17 - Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico.\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville a.ssembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\"\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. The U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. The company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville a.ssembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. Ford has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. The Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. Ford said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. Ford has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. In October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.",

(Photo: Perkins + Will Gallagher & Associates) \nThe Motown Museum’s ambitious $50 million expansion initiative has landed its first major backers: Ford Motor Co. and UAW-Ford, which have announced a $6 million investment in the project.\nThe announcement was made early Friday. As part of the arrangement, the upgraded Motown Museum will include a new state-of-the-art performance venue, the Ford Motor Company Theater, according to a release announcing the deal.\nLast month, officials at the Motown Museum revealed plans for Hitsville’s overhaul and renovation, which would upgrade the current 10,000-square-foot building on West Grand Boulevard to a 50,000-square-foot attraction with new recording studios, interactive exhibits and an enlarged museum store.\nNo timeline was given for the project, which would sit on 10 city lots on Ferry Park behind the current building, real estate the museum acquired over the past 18 months.\nFord’s investment also will help fund educational efforts through the museum, according to a release.\n“Motown and Ford Motor Co. have wide and deeply connected roots,” Motown Museum CEO and chairwoman Robin R. Terry said in a statement.\nDetroit News Fine Arts Writer Michael H. Hodges contributed to this story.\nagraham@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2284\n@grahamorama",

      "text": "Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images An American flag sticker is seen on the assembly line at the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, in the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump Thursday tweeted out that he had a great talk with Ford Motor Company chairman Bill Ford and said the automaker had agreed not to move Lincoln production to Mexico and keep it in Kentucky. \nTrump called it a victory for American workers. \nFord reps we contacted were initially wondering what Trump was talking about since the auto company has never said it plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC (a small SUV) out of The Louisville plant and down to Mexico. \nshow chapters \nFord CEO on Trump: We all share the same objective\nCNBC's Phil LeBeau interviews Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company president and CEO, about whether Trump's presidency changes his company's objectives.\nFord CEO on Trump: We all share the same objective      Tuesday, 15 Nov 2016 | 12:13 PM ET | 04:13 What the company has said is that at some point in the future it would likely move the MKC out of Louisville ... when the current model runs out (within the next couple years). Where production of the MKC might go has never been finalized, BUT Ford's plants in Mexico MIGHT have been a possibility. Emphasis on the word \"might\". \nThere are also other assembly plants in the U.S. where MKC production could have also been shifted to depending on a number of factors (UAW contracts, assembly line capacity, etc.). \nBottom line: Bill Ford has told President-elect Trump the Lincoln MKC is NOT going anywhere. \nSo yes, Trump can claim a victory in getting Ford to reverse plans to move the MKC out of Louisville at some point in the future. \nThat is no longer happening. \nQuestions?

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico 11:18 p.m. 11:18 p.m. 0 \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate   Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n7:20 p.m. \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \nBy Julie Pace \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \nBy Julie Bykowicz \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico - WSMV Channel 4 Member Center: Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Posted: By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

More > By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n7:20 p.m. \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \nBy Julie Pace \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \nBy Julie Bykowicz \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico Reuters Photo: \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production. \nOn Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \n\"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" the President-elect tweeted. \nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president. \nSpokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky\". \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the \"Lincoln plant\" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nIt is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. \nFord has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs. \nFord said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. \nIn 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nSCATHING CRITICISM \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nHe has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico. \nIn April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Ford's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler, Bill Rigby and Himani Sarkar) Related Links",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Updated: November 18, 2016 — 12:18 AM EST Share TOM KRISHER The Associated Press \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Published: ",

A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border.

      "text": "Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico Updated: November 17, 2016 — 10:38 PM EST Share Mail icon \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Bill Rigby) Published: November 17, 2016 — 9:33 PM EST | Updated: November 17, 2016 — 10:38 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n7:20 p.m. \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \nBy Julie Pace \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \nBy Julie Bykowicz \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": " \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \n  0 Pending",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): 11:15 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter   move   Trump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. Ford had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville   The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal   Ford confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. Trump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move   Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential   ___ 8 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. What set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. He took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. In recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. ___ Donald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. That's according to a senior Trump official. The official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. The national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. The official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. — By Julie Pace ___ 7:10 p.m. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. Abe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. Abe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. ___ 6:02 pm Defense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" Defense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. The Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. ___ 4:30 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. Coordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. But Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. Hoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" ___ 4:26 p.m. Israel's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. Ron Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. Dermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" Trump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. ___ 3:27 p.m. Mitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. That's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. Romney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" Trump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" But the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" —By Julie Bykowicz ___ 3:15 Vice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. Pence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. Pence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" He adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" ___ 3:07 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. Pence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. Pelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. She says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. A spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. __ 2:40 p.m. America's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. That's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. The biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" It's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" That version was later removed from the website. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment ___ 2:15 p.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. Pence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son — visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. Next up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" Slavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. ___ 1:50 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. Trump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. It comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. Kissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. ___ 1:40 p.m. New York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. Moskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. She says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. But she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" ___ 10:47 a.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" That's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. Pence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. ___ 10:44 a.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" That's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. Congressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. Pence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. ___ 10:10 a.m. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. The president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. Sanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. But he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" Sanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. He's speaking to reporters in Washington. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. ___ 8:50 a.m. Sen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. Cruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. But when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" ___ 8:05 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" Conway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" Conway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico - CBS News 8 - San Diego, CA News Station - KFMB Channel 8 Member Center: Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Posted: Updated: Friday,   By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

More >> By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. Updated: Friday,   \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won’t move Lincoln assembly to Mexico  18 am 11/18/2016 12:18am Share \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

      "text": "The Latest: Trump tweets about Ford decision on auto plans Thursday Nov 17, 2016 at 11:23 PM Nov 18, 2016 at 4:02 AM   \nWASHINGTON (AP) \" The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n10:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. But it was unclear where the MKC would be built. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC would stay in Louisville. A spokeswoman wouldn't say whether the SUV was destined for Mexico. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n\" By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n\"By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son \" visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico   Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Copyright  ",

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson). Two women stop to take a selfie from the sidewalk across the street from Trump Tower where President-elect Donald Trump continued meetings with members of his transition team, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST): \n11:15 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news. \nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky. \nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. \nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon. \nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. \nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. \n___ \nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. \nThat's according to a senior Trump official. \nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. \nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president. \nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity. \n- By Julie Pace \n___ \n7:10 p.m. \nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence. \nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust. \nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details. \n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting. \n___ \n6:02 pm \nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up. \nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\" \nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. \nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. \nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. \nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. \nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\" \n___ \n4:26 p.m. \nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. \nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. \nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" \nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \n___ \n3:27 p.m. \nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. \nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. \nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" \nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\" \nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump. \n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\" \n-By Julie Bykowicz \n___ \n3:15 \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. \nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. \nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\" \nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\" \n___ \n3:07 p.m. \nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill. \nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition. \nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. \nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. \nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. \n__ \n2:40 p.m. \nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. \nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. \nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\" \nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\" \nThat version was later removed from the website. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. \nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups. \n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here. \nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair. \n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\" \nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. \nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. \nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. \nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. \nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. \nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. \nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\" \n___ \n10:47 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\" \nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. \nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. \n___ \n10:44 a.m. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\" \nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. \nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. \nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. \nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. \n___ \n10:10 a.m. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. \nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. \nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. \nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\" \nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. \nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. \nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower. \nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country. \n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\" \n___ \n8:05 a.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency. \n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday. \n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\" \nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico - WNEM TV 5 Member Center: Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Posted: By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico - WFSB 3 Connecticut Member Center: Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Posted: By TOM KRISHERAP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump claimed credit on Thursday night for persuading Ford to keep an automaking plant in Kentucky rather than moving it to Mexico. The only wrinkle: Ford was not actually planning to move the plant. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after 9 p.m. that Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., had just told him that Ford “will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.” Minutes later, Mr. Trump wrote in a second post : “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Mr. Trump won 62.5 percent of the state’s popular vote in the presidential election. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made there. \n  Ford makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. On Thursday night, after Mr. Trump’s Twitter messages, the company said that Mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep MKC production in Kentucky. But Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses. “Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,” Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press . “They cannot make enough Escapes.” Now, thanks to Mr. Trump, the plant will make fewer Escapes — and more MKCs. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Ford said in a statement.",

It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate   Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.  ",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nBill Ford , the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.\nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail.\nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appears at a campaign roundtable event in Manchester, …\nBy David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production.\nOn Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \n\"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" the President-elect tweeted.\nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019.\nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president.\nSpokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky\". \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement.\nThe company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the \"Lincoln plant\" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs.\nIt is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. \nFord has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs.\nFord said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. \nIn 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere.\n\nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border.\n\nSCATHING CRITICISM\nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nHe has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there.\nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico.\nIn April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018.\nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars.\nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Ford's investments in Mexico.\nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler, Bill Rigby and Himani Sarkar)",

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "Cancel \nBy TOM KRISHER, AP Auto Writer \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \n ",

      "text": "View Comments Print By TOM KRISHER   12:18 a.m.,   \nDETROIT (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",
