      "text": "December 1, 2016 5:27 PM Boeing breaks ground on new Auburn training site Boeing’s Jim Ockerman, vice president of Manufacturing and Safety for Boeing Fabrication, speaks to an audience of about 100 people gathered to celebrate the groundbreaking of the first new building to be erected on the Auburn site in nearly 25 years. Seated with him on the stage is Auburn mayor Nancy Backus and Boeing Auburn site Leader Jack Meehan. Marian Lockhart The Boeing Co. i   \nBoeing Auburn on Thursday had a groundbreaking celebration for its first new building in nearly 25 years. \nThe $16.7 million Workforce Readiness Center “represents a critical piece supporting the site’s central role in fabricating parts for Boeing Commercial Airplanes production,” the company said in a news release. \nThe site will have a robotics lab and offer training for the more than 5,000 Boeing Auburn workers. It also will become the new home for Auburn’s employee medical clinic and become headquarters for IAM/Boeing Joint Programs in the south Puget Sound. \n“At a time Boeing is watching its spending very carefully to improve our competitiveness, this investment is significant,” said Jack Meehan, Boeing Auburn’s site leader, in Thursday’s news release. \nThe clinic’s former building will be replaced with an Operations Readiness Center, which will have a spare-parts warehouse. \nThe two buildings will replace a World War II-era structure. Construction is scheduled to begin on the second building in 2018, according to the news release. Related content",

      "title": "Boeing Unit Wins $559M Air Force Contract to Upgrade Radars",
      "text": "The Boeing Co. ’s ( BA - Free Report ) business unit, Defense, Space & Security, has won a modification contract from the U.S. Air Force to upgrade F-15 Combined APG-63 Version 3 Radar Improvement Program Version 3 and APG-82 Version 1 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) radar.\n\nContract Details \n\nThe contract is valued at $558.5 million. It was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.\n\nPer the contract, Boeing will procure, install, supply initial spares and provide support for 42 Version 3, and 29 RMP radars.\n\nWork is scheduled to be complete by Jan 15, 2019. The company will execute the work in St. Louis, MI. The contract will use fiscal 2015 and 2016 procurement funds.\nBOEING CO Price \n \n\nBOEING CO Price | BOEING CO Quote \nWhat’s APG-63 and APG-82? \n\nAPG-63 is an all-weather multimode radar system designed by Raytheon Company ( RTN - Free Report ) for the F-15E air superiority fighter. It boasts multi-role capability, long-term support, and future growth options. The APG-63 Version 3 radar offers powerful, adaptable radar technology, with established performance and strategic flexibility. This innovative, highly reliable technology is compatible with the F-15C and F-15E aircraft.\n\nThe APG-82 Version 1 optimize the F-15E’s multirole mission capability. It includes extended-range, superior multi-target tracking and precision engagement potential. This version also provides enhancement of system reliability over the legacy F-15E APG-70 radar. This unique level of reliability and maintainability will help the Air Force generate cost savings.\n\nWhy Boeing? \n\nBoeing is the manufacturer of the F-15. The company has received several contracts from the Pentagon in the past to install the APG-63 Version 3 radar on its F-15C/D jet fighters and APG-82 radar systems on its F-15E fighter-bombers. With the installation of these radar systems, high-resolution ground-mapping data has been enabled in the F-15, which helps crews identify targets at great distances and increases situational awareness, lethality and survivability.\n\nThe company witnesses a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon and other international customers. It is one of the major players in the defense business. Its defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.\n\nPrice Movement \n\nBoeing’s stock has improved about 2.45% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks Categorized Aerospace/Defense industry’s gain of 10.82% over the same time frame. This could be because Boeing continues to face challenges from the uncertainties related to high-cost programs, risks related to key project executions, order cancellations as well as stiff competition.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks \n\nBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense space include Engility Holdings, Inc. ( EGL - Free Report ) and Leidos Holdings, Inc. ( LDOS - Free Report ) .\n\nOn an average, Engility delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.19% in the trailing four quarters. The company’s 2016 estimate has increased 13.4% over the last 30 days. Engility sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "title": "CAL plane departs after repairs…Boeing inspectors arrive to assess grounded Fly Jamaica aircraft",
      "text": "Dec 02, 2016 News 0 \nA Caribbean Airlines aircraft that was involved in a collision, Tuesday, with Fly Jamaica plane has been repaired and has since left the Cheddi Jagan International Airport, Timehri airport. Civil aviation officials yesterday confirmed that the Boeing 737-800 aircraft operating as BW 527 has returned to its home port in Trinidad and Tobago after being cleared for departure. A team had come from that Twin-Island Republic to conduct repairs to the damaged wing of the CAL aircraft. Yesterday, also, a team from Boeing arrived in Guyana to assess the damage to the Fly Jamaica plane. The assessment will determine what repairs will have to be made before the plane is allowed to fly again. Meanwhile, according to Lieutenant Colonel (ret’d) Egbert Fields, Director General of the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), the task of his organization as regulator of the aviation industry, is not to apportion blame. Rather, it is to present a report to the stakeholders, including to CAL and Fly Jamaica. The two operators will then decide on how to settle the matter- whether through legal channels or via settlement. On Tuesday, authorities announced that a probe had been launched into an incident that occurred that morning in which the tail of a Fly Jamaica aircraft was struck off by a plane belonging to Caribbean Airlines Limited (CAL). The two planes were grounded at the CJIA with flights to North America – the US and Canada – affected. There has been worry about flights availability as the Christmas peak season is almost here. Thousands of Guyanese live in New York, US and Toronto, Canada. According to a brief statement from CJIA on Tuesday, its investigators and those of the GCAA are currently probing the incident that occurred between the two aircraft around 07:20 hrs on the international apron. The Fly Jamaica flight had reportedly landed about an hour earlier than the Caribbean Airlines flight. Caribbean Airlines, also in a short statement, said that one of its planes, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft operating as BW 527, from JFK International, New York to CJIA, Guyana, was involved in an incident on the ramp. The Trinidadian-owned airline said that all passengers and crew were safely disembarked. “The aircraft has since been temporarily withdrawn from service and all appropriate inspections and procedures, along with an investigation are in progress.” Fly Jamaica also issued a release Tuesday evening on the incident, it read: “ At approximately 07:20hrs this morning at Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA) in Guyana, Fly Jamaica Airways’ B767-300, which was parked at an assigned gate, was struck by the wing tip of a taxiing Caribbean Airlines (CAL) B737-800 aircraft. Fly Jamaica Airways’ B767-300 aircraft has been withdrawn from service, and the airline awaits the findings of the investigation currently being conducted by the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). The Directors and staff of Fly Jamaica Airways wish to reassure their customers that they are working assiduously to lessen the inconvenience caused by this incident, and to ensure that all of their passengers are accommodated in the most efficient and convenient manner. Both airlines have been playing a critical role in offering air transport linkages to especially the US and Canada. Fly Jamaica, partially owned by Guyanese, will be more affected by the incident as it only has two planes. Caribbean Airlines, headquartered in Trinidad and Tobago, has several aircraft, including B737-800. Share this:",

      "text": "Video: Boeing Using Drones and Augmented Reality to Fight Wildfires Peter Brown 01 December 2016 \nFighting wildfires is extremely dangerous for firefighters and support personnel. While aerial firefighting has helped in this regard, Boeing is working on making the process much safer by using unmanned aerial systems and holograms. \nThe aircraft manufacturer is using holographic tactical maps of its ScanEagles UAVs, helicopters and firefighters to direct resources to where they are needed the most. The engineers hope to be able to use augmented reality (AR) technology to one day control an entire fleet of UAVs for commercial use. \nWildfires are not just dangerous to those that are on the ground or in the air, but also very labor intensive and costly. Dangers also arise when multiple aircraft, vehicles, departments and support services are moving about, trying to contain the blaze. Unmanned systems help to reduce this cost, reduce the danger, and get a better idea of where the fire is moving and what are the right targets to hit to better control it faster. \nHow It Works \nUsing Microsoft’s HoloLens, Boeing has taken tactical map displays from its ScanEagles drones and put them in AR. Engineers can put an aircraft in a 3-D mixed reality map, and the drone knows how to fly its orbit or pattern automatically. \nThe drones are equipped with infrared cameras and other sensors in order to provide a real-time map of where the fire is, the areas that may be affected next, and where those on the ground may not see areas burning. \nUsing AR, multiple people can wear HoloLens at the same time in order to interact with each other and communicate with others in the field to provide them with the best up-to-date information about the wildfire they are trying to contain. \nBeyond fighting fires, Boeing sees this technology as a useful tool in large-scale reconnaissance work such as monitoring shipping or train loads, or allowing farmers to gauge how their crops are performing from the air.   0 comments  ",

      "text": "MEBAA: Boeing looks to Middle East potential of Max 7 MEBAA: Boeing looks to Middle East potential of Max 7 02 December, 2016 BY: Murdo Morrison London \nBoeing believes the just-launched business jet version of its smallest 737 Max variant will open up a new market in the Gulf by offering the capability of flying non-stop to the US East Coast for the first time. \n“The 737 Max 7 is an airplane we’ve been waiting to offer for 20 years,” says David Longridge, president of Boeing Business Jets. “It has enormous significance to the Middle East.” \nUnlike the larger versions of the re-engined Max series – the Max 8 and Max 9 – the Max 7, which was announced at the National Business Aviation Association exhibition in Orlando in early November, has a range of 7,000nm (13,000km), making New York just within range of Dubai under private flight rules. \nCurrently, the only in-service, non-widebody business jet capable of such a mission is the Gulfstream G650ER. “I have a lot of respect for Gulfstream,” says Longridge. “I think their success in this region shows there is a market for this type of aircraft.” \nHe adds: “The [BBJ Max 7] is slightly larger than the BBJ2 and that is calculated with realistic interior weights. We are very proud of the fact that we put a lot of discipline into how we quote the ranges of these aircraft.” \nAs deliveries of the current-generation 737-based BBJs taper off – of 164 orders, 156 are in service and a further seven in completion – Boeing is pushing its successor. It has 11 orders for the Max 8 variant – first delivery of which will be in 2018 – and one for the Max 9. \n“We are hoping to add to that very soon,” says Longridge. \nHe maintains that the big advantage of the Max 8 over the current aircraft is that it is the same size as the BBJ2, but has a longer range – at 6,500nm – than the BBJ1. “The Max 9 is over 1,100ft 2 (102m 2 ) larger again, and its range is almost 6,400nm,” he says. “We are talking about really large aircraft that fly a really long way.” \nLongridge is also optimistic about selling more 787-based BBJs, of which Boeing has so far taken 15 orders and delivered nine green aircraft. Three are in service, including with Chinese operator Deer Jet. \n“This an aircraft with 10,000nm range, with a speed of Mach 0.85, with huge windows and an extraordinary range of technology that you won’t find anywhere except a business jet,” says Longridge. “We never expected to sell 15, but we continue to get interest from heads of state and private individuals.” \nHe adds: “Boeing Business Jets was set up 20 years ago and I think in another 20 years’ time we will be selling two variants – a Max or a narrowbody like the Max – and a 787.” \nBoeing has delivered a total of 71 VIP-configured jets to the Middle East, its biggest region, ahead of North America with 58. \nBoeing will be pushing two products in the aftercare and remarketing areas at MEBAA. It is offering sellers of a BBJ an additional package of benefits to sell on to their buyer, which entitles the used-aircraft buyer to the same suite of services that the operator of a new aircraft receives, such as training and entry into service assistance. \nBoeing has also agreed with nine completion centres to offer a power-by-the-hour type guarantee to operators that guarantees their maintenance costs – including on the interior – for up to 10 years.",

      "text": "News   \nMUKILTEO — The Institute of Flight is trying to make a record-breaking birthday card for the Boeing Co., which turned 100 earlier this year . \nThousands of people already have signed three giant paper scrolls at Future of Flight Aviation Center &Boeing Tour, which the institute manages at Paine Field. But thousands more signatures are needed. \nThe scrolls are about three feet tall and 1,000 feet long. That is enough space to hold the more than 71,542 signatures needed to set a new world record for most contributions to a greetings scroll , a record maintained by Guinness World Records. The current record was set in 2012 in Mexico City with a scroll containing well wishes for the New Year. \nThe institute started collecting signatures in July and is making a final push through the end of the year, said Pamela Drake, who is managing the effort. \n“We are close to making it,” but more signatures are needed, she said. \nThe scrolls are in the Future of Flight Aviation Center’s gallery, which means you need to pay admission to sign the scroll in person. The center is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. seven days a week. \nPeople also can sign electronically via the institute’s website at www.futureofflight.org/guinness-world-records . Click on the link “Virtually sign the card” to open the entry form. Generally speaking, each electronic entry has to come from a unique email address. However, immediate family members may use the same email address if necessary, Drake said. \nThe online submissions are then transferred — by hand — onto the scroll by Drake and other institute employees. The institute also needs volunteers when the center is open to witness and tally in-person signatures. People interested in volunteering can contact the Institute of Flight by email at info@futureofflight.org or by phone at 888-467-4777. \nThe nonprofit group began in 2005 as the Future of Flight Foundation, and changed to its current name in late 2015. \nIt is in the early part of an ambitious plan — estimated to cost as much as $20 million — to add meeting rooms, improve exhibits and offer new educational programs at the Future of Flight Aviation Center, which it operates for Snohomish County. The institute coordinates the Boeing Tour with Boeing. \nDan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole. Most Read",

The program was piloted last year, reaching several thousand students, and will expand this year with the additional funding provided by Boeing. \nState parks receiving the research equipment include Galveston Island, the Johnson and Isle du Bois branches of Ray Roberts Lake, Cedar Hill, Brazos Bend and Guadalupe River. Ten middle and high schools near those parks will use them in the coming school year. Latest News ",

      "title": "Amazon won’t resume work with one of its airlines until it’s sure the pilots won’t strike again",
      "text": "Stephen Brashear | Getty Images An Amazon-branded Boeing 767 freighter, nicknamed Amazon One, flies over Lake Washington during the Seattle Seafair Air Show on August 5, 2016 in Seattle, Washington. A week after unhappy pilots who fly cargo planes for Amazon were forced by a judge to end their strike, the online retailer has still not resumed shipping packages with the cargo airliner, one of the pilots told Recode. \nAnd it sounds like Amazon won't do so until it is confident the pilots won't strike again. \n\"We rebalanced capacity across our carrier partners and we are leaving the adjustments in place until we are certain there will be no further disruptions,\" an Amazon spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday evening. \nThe cargo airline in question, ABX Air, is one of several Amazon has contracted in the last year to operate a total of 40 planes on Amazon's behalf. The goal, Amazon has said, is to make sure it has enough shipping capacity to handle the annual increases in demand it is seeing, especially during the fourth-quarter holiday season. Amazon is also starting to build out its own transportation network because it believes it will lead to shipping savings over time. \nMore from Recode:\n16 things to get IPO-ready (or just build a really strong business) \nIs it possible to outsmart Amazon this holiday season? \nApple will need the FAA's blessing if it wants to use drones to improve its Maps \nBut taking more control over the movement of packages after they leave an Amazon warehouse obviously comes with downsides, especially in a case like this where Amazon is leasing the planes but not hiring its own pilots to fly them. Amazon has said the current disruption has not affected customers, but one could imagine it increasing costs for the quarter because of the last-minute nature of the change of plans. \nAbout 250 ABX pilots, who belong to a local Teamsters union in Ohio, first went on strike before Thanksgiving because of what they say is an understaffing crisis resulting in 8,000 emergency flights for customers like Amazon and DHL this year that upended some of their lives. (Amazon, for its part, is notoriously anti-union.) \nThe steady flow of emergency flights, \"exacerbated\" by bringing Amazon on as a client, made it difficult for pilots to use the comp days they receive in exchange for working an emergency flight on a day off, according to ABX Air pilot and union rep Tim Jewell. The Amazon work has also led to pilots being forced to change between day and night shifts more often than is allowed under their contract, Jewell said. \nOn Nov. 23, a judge issued a two-week, temporary restraining order that forced the pilots back to work and to negotiate with the airline while working. The two sides have not yet come to a resolution, and it's unclear if the pilots will attempt to strike again at the end of the restraining order window. \n\"We hope very much to resolve it and not have to go down that road,\" Jewell told Recode. \"We hope that this period here woke up the company enough that they're willing to work with us to mutually come to an agreement to move forward.\" \nA spokesman for ABX Air's parent company says they expect \"these minor disputes to be resolved without further work stoppages.\" \n— By Jason Del Rey, Recode.net . \n\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "Boeing CEO Says U.S. Must Lead on Trade or Lose Out to Rivals Julie Johnsson Dec 02, 2016 2:23 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on the Trump administration and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy, from a reformed tax code to financial support from the moribund U.S. Export-Import Bank. For Chicago-based Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a “fair” global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and opening the ex-im bank for business, Muilenburg said Friday in prepared remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. The U.S. needs to continue to play a leading role when it comes to global trade agreements, he said. “If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” he said. “For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” The ex-im bank, which helps finance foreign customers’ purchases of U.S. goods, has remained effectively closed for business for more than a year because it doesn’t have a quorum of directors needed to approve financing for sales over $10 million. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank’s board, criticizing it as “corporate welfare” for companies such as Boeing and General Electric Co. Read more: Jump-starting the ex-im bank Reauthorization for the bank was approved by a super-majority of U.S. Congress last year, “which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,” Muilenburg said. He warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs. The White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9. --With assistance from Rossella Brevetti To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Johnsson in Chicago at jjohnsson@bloomberg.net.

FAA orders Boeing 787 safety fix: Reboot power once in a while By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter \nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing a rule requiring urgent attention by operators of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner to avoid the possibility all three computer modules that manage the jet’s flight-control surfaces could briefly stop working while in flight. \nOperators must periodically shut and restart the electrical power on the planes, or the power to the three flight control modules. That will avoid the problem until Boeing has a permanent software fix. \nIn an airworthiness directive to be published Friday, the FAA said it is reacting to indications that “all three flight control modules on the 787 might simultaneously reset if continuously powered on for 22 days.” \nIt said such a simultaneous reset in flight “could result in flight control surfaces not moving in response to flight crew inputs for a short time and consequent temporary loss of controllability.” \nA person with knowledge of airline practices, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it is “extremely rare” for any operator to leave the jet powered on for longer than a week. \nIn a statement, Boeing said the new rule mandates actions the jet maker has already recommended to 787 operators during the past two months. \n“Boeing recommended that operators cycle power to flight control modules periodically to ensure overlapping resets do not occur,” Boeing stated. “A permanent software fix is anticipated in the second quarter of 2017.” \nThe FAA is mandating that the roughly 99 Dreamliners registered in the U.S. act on the directive within a week. \nForeign airlines typically follow the FAA’s lead on such directives. To date, 489 Dreamliners have been delivered worldwide. Published: Dec. 2, 2016, 12:06 p.m.",

Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy, from a reformed tax code to financial support from the moribund U.S. Export-Import Bank. \nFor Chicago-based Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and re-opening the ex-im bank for business, Muilenburg said Friday in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. \nThe U.S. needs to continue to play a leading role when it comes to global trade agreements, Muilenburg said. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying the pact with Canada and Mexico has drained jobs. \n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Muilenburg said. “For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” Read more: China’s importance to Boeing \nMuilenburg said Boeing had been concerned by the anti-trade rhetoric voiced by Republicans and Democrats during the recent election cycle. About 75 percent of the planemaker’s near-record order backlog is bound for overseas customers, up from 35 percent in 2000, he said. Around 90 percent of Boeing’s total workforce and 80 percent of its suppliers are U.S.-based. \n“Our business thrives on free and open global trade,” Muilenburg said. “And it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank’s board, criticizing it as “corporate welfare” for companies such as Boeing and General Electric Co.\nReauthorization for the bank was approved by a super-majority of U.S. Congress last year, “which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,” Muilenburg said. He warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs. \nThe White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9.

      "text": "Washington lawmakers should hold off tinkering with Boeing tax break Originally published December 2, 2016 at 1:32 pm Washington state should refrain from tinkering with its Boeing tax-subsidy program until WTO appeals are complete. Share story Seattle Times editorial board The Seattle Times \nThe World Trade Organization’s (WTO) ruling against Boeing tax subsidies puts Washington state in an awkward position. \nUntil appeals are exhausted and provide more clarity, the state should hang tight and refrain from tinkering with the complex and controversial subsidy legislation. Besides, the 2017 Legislature has more than enough work to do already. \nIn its ruling last Monday , the WTO decided that a business-and-occupation tax break created to retain Boeing’s 777X wing and assembly in Washington is prohibited by trade rules. \nIn particular, the trade body objects to a clause in the 2013 tax deal that requires Boeing to assemble the plane and its wings within the state. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nThis is prohibited because it favors a local product over imported products; a key principle of WTO trade agreements is that domestic and foreign goods should be treated equally. \nWhile Washington is a state that supports and depends on free trade, it also needed the protection of the “build local” clause in the Boeing tax package. Especially after Boeing received a similar package for the 787 and then opened a second production line in South Carolina. \nWhen the Boeing tax package was extended in 2013, the state needed assurance that it wasn’t subsidizing a product that would be built elsewhere. The clause was included and Boeing received tax breaks worth potentially $8.7 billion over 25 years. \nBenefits of the state investment can be seen in Everett, where Boeing has now spent more than $1 billion on its facility for building advanced, composite wings for the 777X. \nThis work involves a constellation of suppliers. It also expands the cluster of companies and expertise working with advanced composites in Washington. \nThat cluster, the jobs it supports and the future opportunities it creates should continue, regardless of what happens with the WTO. \nThe U.S. is expected to appeal last week’s ruling, which will further extend an interminable feud over aerospace subsidies that began with a 2004 complaint about Airbus product-launch subsidies. That led to European complaints about Boeing subsidies. \nSuch trade disputes seem distant and inconsequential until the WTO authorizes retaliatory tariffs — a tool it uses to press governments to comply with trade rules. Then people’s jobs and income are jeopardized by the loss of international business. \nThat’s the last thing we need in the current political climate, with Democrats and Republicans questioning the benefits of free-trade agreements and a blustery, protectionist president-elect. \nWaiting for the WTO process to work its course for a few more years could be a way for Washington state and the Boeing dispute to ride out this political storm over trade. \nWashington may eventually have to modify its aerospace-retention plan to help the U.S. comply with WTO trade agreements. But the state should wait to tinker until appeals are complete and there’s more clarity about what, if any, changes are needed. Editorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.

Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying the pact with Canada and Mexico has drained jobs. \n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Muilenburg said. “For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nMuilenburg said Boeing had been concerned by the anti-trade rhetoric voiced by Republicans and Democrats during the recent election cycle. About 75 percent of the planemaker’s near-record order backlog is bound for overseas customers, up from 35 percent in 2000, he said. Around 90 percent of Boeing’s total workforce and 80 percent of its suppliers are U.S.-based. \n“Our business thrives on free and open global trade,” Muilenburg said. “And it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs.” \nThe Ex-Im Bank, which helps finance foreign customers’ purchases of U.S. goods, has remained effectively closed for business for more than a year because it doesn’t have a quorum of directors needed to approve financing for sales over $10 million. Sen. Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank’s board, criticizing it as “corporate welfare” for companies such as Boeing and General Electric. \nReauthorization for the bank was approved by a supermajority of the U.S. Congress last year, “which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,” Muilenburg said. He warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens of other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs. \nThe White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9.

      "text": "Boeing CEO Says U.S. Must Lead on Trade or Risk Losing (1) Julie Johnsson Dec 02, 2016 6:38 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy, from a reformed tax code to financial support from the moribund U.S. Export-Import Bank. For Chicago-based Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and re-opening the ex-im bank for business, Muilenburg said Friday in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. The U.S. needs to continue to play a leading role when it comes to global trade agreements, Muilenburg said. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying the pact with Canada and Mexico has drained jobs. “If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Muilenburg said. “For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” Read more: China’s importance to Boeing Muilenburg said Boeing had been concerned by the anti-trade rhetoric voiced by Republicans and Democrats during the recent election cycle. About 75 percent of the planemaker’s near-record order backlog is bound for overseas customers, up from 35 percent in 2000, he said. Around 90 percent of Boeing’s total workforce and 80 percent of its suppliers are U.S.-based. “Our business thrives on free and open global trade,” Muilenburg said. “And it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs.” The ex-im bank, which helps finance foreign customers’ purchases of U.S. goods, has remained effectively closed for business for more than a year because it doesn’t have a quorum of directors needed to approve financing for sales over $10 million. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank’s board, criticizing it as “corporate welfare” for companies such as Boeing and General Electric Co. Reauthorization for the bank was approved by a super-majority of U.S. Congress last year, “which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,” Muilenburg said. He warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs. The White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9.

      "title": "Boeing CEO Says U.S. Must Lead on Trade or Risk Losing",
      "text": "Boeing CEO Says U.S. Must Lead on Trade or Risk Losing (1) Julie Johnsson Dec 03, 2016 1:31 am ET (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy, from a reformed tax code to financial support from the moribund U.S. Export-Import Bank. For Chicago-based Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and re-opening the ex-im bank for business, Muilenburg said Friday in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. The U.S. needs to continue to play a leading role when it comes to global trade agreements, Muilenburg said. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying the pact with Canada and Mexico has drained jobs. “If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Muilenburg said. “For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” Read more: China’s importance to Boeing Muilenburg said Boeing had been concerned by the anti-trade rhetoric voiced by Republicans and Democrats during the recent election cycle. About 75 percent of the planemaker’s near-record order backlog is bound for overseas customers, up from 35 percent in 2000, he said. Around 90 percent of Boeing’s total workforce and 80 percent of its suppliers are U.S.-based. “Our business thrives on free and open global trade,” Muilenburg said. “And it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs.” The ex-im bank, which helps finance foreign customers’ purchases of U.S. goods, has remained effectively closed for business for more than a year because it doesn’t have a quorum of directors needed to approve financing for sales over $10 million. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank’s board, criticizing it as “corporate welfare” for companies such as Boeing and General Electric Co. Reauthorization for the bank was approved by a super-majority of U.S. Congress last year, “which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,” Muilenburg said. He warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs. The White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9.

      "text": "Source: The Boeing Co. After a delay of nearly three years, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) on Friday approved a license for Norwegian Air Shuttle’s Ireland-based unit to fly to and from the United States. The airline already flies across the Atlantic and to other international destinations, but because Norway is not part of the European Union, Norwegian Air’s ability to expand depends on negotiations with every country from which it seeks a license. Gaining recognition for its Irish subsidiary as an EU member gives the airline the same rights as any other EU nation.\nThis is not a small thing from Norwegian Air Shuttle (ICAO code: NAX) or for its aircraft vendor, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). NAX is a low-cost carrier that currently flies Boeing 737-800s exclusively. Boeing has delivered 79 of the planes to the airline since the first delivery in 2009, and NAX is one of Boeing’s top 10 customers measured by backlog of orders.\nBoeing’s order book shows 21 more 737-800s still to be delivered and 108 737 MAXs on order for delivery beginning next year. Boeing has also delivered three 787-8s to NAX and has orders for 19 787-9s. That is a total of 148 new Boeing planes, before the U.S. licensing decision was announced.\nNAX will be an early, if not the first, Boeing customer to fly the 737 MAX, and that includes transatlantic flights the airline now flies with the 787. The new planes could open new routes between smaller cities in the United States and Europe and threaten to cut into the revenues of legacy carriers United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL), Delta Air Lines Co. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL). There is no question that NAX fares will undercut legacy carriers’ transatlantic fares.\nThe DoT’s decision was widely praised by consumer advocacy and travel and leisure groups and generally opposed by airline employee unions and U.S. legacy carriers. U.S. Travel Association CEO Roger Dow said:\nThe American travel community is ecstatic at the decision by the Obama administration to allow new service to U.S. cities by Norwegian Air International. If ever there were a trade policy that brings jobs to U.S. soil, this is it: [NAX] is flying and will buy more American-made planes, their passengers will spend money in American businesses, and American travelers will have more and cheaper options when they fly. This announcement is an unmistakable endorsement of competition, connectivity and Open Skies agreements, and a welcome repudiation of protectionist, anti-competitive policymaking.\nAssociation of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson condemned the license approval:\nThis decision must be reversed immediately by the Obama administration. It is a betrayal to hundreds of thousands of aviation workers. The DOT decision overrides carefully negotiated worker rights and designs a new playbook that rolls out the red carpet for foreign corporation by trampling workers’ rights. This decision puts a rubber stamp of approval on the ‘flag of convenience model’ that destroyed over a hundred thousand U.S. shipping jobs. …\nCongress must be prepared to act next week. President Obama must reverse this harmful decision and stand up for working people all across the country. We will not accept this. We will act. We will never stop. We will never accept abrogation of our rights.\nNo legacy carrier has yet commented on the license, but Southwest Airlines Co.’s (NYSE: LUV) Southwest Pilot’s Association (SWAPA) also condemned the license. Union President Jon Weaks said:\nBy approving [NAX]’s application despite it being in direct violation of Article 17 bis of the EU-US Open Skies Agreement, the Obama Administration has unilaterally undermined every trade agreement the U.S. has ever signed – including the Open Skies agreements we have with more than 100 countries across the globe. In the process, President Obama and Secretary Foxx have turned their backs on the tens of thousands of American workers employed in the aviation industry.\nTo be clear, this decision gives a single foreign carrier an advantage unavailable to a single one of its competitors – including those in the U.S. Norwegian Air International will possess an unparalleled advantage over U.S. carriers if allowed to proceed with its Flag of Convenience scheme. This reckless decision sets a dangerous precedent in aviation and further underscores the unwillingness to ensure a level playing field for American workers when executing trade agreements that have been a hallmark of the Obama Administration.\nThe question now falls into the lap of President-Elect Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a champion of maintaining U.S. jobs. SWAPA has called on Trump “to preserve a fair and level playing field for U.S. workers by denying [NAX] the Foreign Carrier Permit unjustly awarded by President Obama.”\nThe DoT explained its rationale in a statement cited by The Wall Street Journal:\nRegardless of our appreciation of the public policy arguments raised by opponents, we have been advised that the law and our bilateral obligations leave us no avenue to reject this application.\nThere is no evidence, yet, that the NAX license will cost a single U.S. airline-industry job. The Norwegian carrier does, however, use contract crews hired by Asian staffing agencies to fly its Ireland-based routes. The airline has promised to use only EU and U.S. crews on transatlantic flights, but that has not been sufficient for U.S. and international labor unions.\nBoeing on one side, legacy airlines and unions on the other. Welcome to the White House, President Trump.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

Ultimately, Kuwait chose to buy fighters from Airbus, which was quicker to approve the deal.\nOr not.\n\nCould Boeing's F/A-18 regain air supremacy? Image source: Getty Images.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called on President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to ensure U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy — from a reformed tax code to financial support from the moribund U.S. Export-Import Bank.\nFor Chicago-based Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and re-opening the ex-im bank for business, Muilenburg said Friday in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers' Association.\nThe U.S. needs to continue to play a leading role when it comes to global trade agreements, Muilenburg said.\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying the pact with Canada and Mexico has drained jobs.\n\"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,\" Muilenburg said. \"For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.\"\nMuilenburg said Boeing had been concerned by the anti-trade rhetoric voiced by Republicans and Democrats during the recent election cycle.\nAbout 75 percent of the planemaker's near-record order backlog is bound for overseas customers, up from 35 percent in 2000, he said. Around 90 percent of Boeing's total workforce and 80 percent of its suppliers are U.S.-based.\n\"Our business thrives on free and open global trade,\" Muilenburg said. \"And it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs.\"\nThe ex-im bank, which helps finance foreign customers' purchases of U.S. goods, has remained effectively closed for business for more than a year because it doesn't have a quorum of directors needed to approve financing for sales over $10 million.\nSen. Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank's board, criticizing it as \"corporate welfare\" for companies such as Boeing and General Electric.\nReauthorization for the bank was approved by a super-majority of U.S. Congress last year, \"which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,\" Muilenburg said.\nHe warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs.\nThe White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9.",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nKuwait is a nation of just 3.4 million people. At a cost of roughly $2,700 per citizen, the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoons from Airbus represents a huge investment for the country. (Note: Airbus is the largest shareholder of the Eurofighter consortium that makes the Typhoon. BAE Systems owns a 33% stake in the consortium.) And yet, it seems Kuwait has not yet run out of money to spend. \nTwo weeks ago, in a rather surprising announcement , the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notifiedCongress of Kuwait's continued interest in buying F/A-18s from Boeing (apparently in addition to the Typhoons from Airbus). As explained in DSCA's notification, Kuwait intends to purchase 32 F/A-18E fighter jets and eight more advanced F/A-18F fighters from Boeing. Total cost: $10.1 billion. \nContinue Reading Below \nNor was this the only good news Boeing shareholders got last week. Cast your eyes south \nSimultaneous with the announcement of the Kuwait fighter deal, DSCA notified Congress of a second -- even bigger -- sale of Boeing fighter jets to the Middle East. Just a few hundred miles to the south of Kuwait likes the peninsular nation of Qatar, and the Qataris seem even more infatuated with Boeing planes. \nAccording to DSCA , Qatar is seeking permission to purchase 72 F-15QA fighter jets from Boeing for the princely sum of $21.1 billion. That makes the total value of Boeing contracts being sought here $31.2 billion. What it means for Boeing -- and its investors \nIt's hard to overestimate the importance of these defense deals to Boeing, now that the Obama administration has permitted them to proceed. (Congress has literally never rejected a foreign arms deal once the DSCA has given official notification). \nFrom a sheer dollars-and-cents perspective, Boeing's military aircraft division earns 9.8% pre-tax profit margins on the planes it sells -- the second-highest profit margin of any Boeing division. Ultimately, the $31.2 billion in revenue flowing from the two deals named above should earn Boeing pre-tax profits well in excess of $3 billion, worth nearly 43% of all the profits that Boeing generated from all its businesses last year. \nBut the significance of these deals is even greater than that. \nWith demand for its fourth-generation fighter jets waning, Boeing had been planning to shut down production of its F-15s by 2019. F/A-18 production was likely to cease in 2017. Boeing Defense head Leanne Carethas been heard talking about how Boeing needed to \"evolve\" beyond fighter jets entirely, and refocus its efforts on building planes it can actually sell -- KC-46 Pegasi, C-17 Globemasters, and P-8A Poseidons. \nThanks to these last-minute sales, though, Boeing's fighter jets business has a new lease on life. \nConsider: Last year, Boeing produced and delivered 35 F/A-18 model aircraft to its customers around the world. At that build rate, the Kuwaiti deal will extend F/A-18 production by more than a year. Indeed, if Boeing can slow its production rate just a bit, the production line could operate even longer -- giving Boeing more time to find even more buyers, to extend its lifeline even further. \nMeanwhile, Boeing's F/15 was already producing at the much slower rate of just 12 planes per year. Qatar's order for 72 new F-15s extends the lifespan of that model aircraft by six more years! \nTurns out, thanks to these two last-minute contract wins, Boeing may not have to quit the defense business after all. \n10 stocks we like better than Boeing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Boeing CEO Says U.S. Must Lead on Trade or Risk Losing (1) Julie Johnsson Dec 03, 2016 11:15 am ET (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy, from a reformed tax code to financial support from the moribund U.S. Export-Import Bank. For Chicago-based Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and re-opening the ex-im bank for business, Muilenburg said Friday in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. The U.S. needs to continue to play a leading role when it comes to global trade agreements, Muilenburg said. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying the pact with Canada and Mexico has drained jobs. “If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Muilenburg said. “For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” Read more: China’s importance to Boeing Muilenburg said Boeing had been concerned by the anti-trade rhetoric voiced by Republicans and Democrats during the recent election cycle. About 75 percent of the planemaker’s near-record order backlog is bound for overseas customers, up from 35 percent in 2000, he said. Around 90 percent of Boeing’s total workforce and 80 percent of its suppliers are U.S.-based. “Our business thrives on free and open global trade,” Muilenburg said. “And it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs.” The ex-im bank, which helps finance foreign customers’ purchases of U.S. goods, has remained effectively closed for business for more than a year because it doesn’t have a quorum of directors needed to approve financing for sales over $10 million. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and opponent of the bank, has blocked nominations to the bank’s board, criticizing it as “corporate welfare” for companies such as Boeing and General Electric Co. Reauthorization for the bank was approved by a super-majority of U.S. Congress last year, “which only makes the current lack of a board quorum all the more frustrating,” Muilenburg said. He warned that international buyers of American-made goods, from tractors to airplanes, may take their business to one of the dozens other countries offering export credit, costing U.S. jobs. The White House last month asked Congress to jump-start the credit agency as part of a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the government open after Dec. 9.

      "text": "President Obama's Parting Gift to Boeing: $31.2 Billion in Defense Contracts newsfeedback@fool.com (Rich Smith) Updated 6 min ago \nWhen Kuwait announced in April that it will be buying $9.1 billion worth of fighter jets from Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , that sounded like bad news for Boeing (NYSE: BA) . For months, the Obama administration had been dragging its feet on approving a sale of Boeing's competing F/A-18 fighter jet to Kuwait. Ultimately, Kuwait chose to buy fighters from Airbus, which was quicker to approve the deal. \nOr not. Could Boeing's F/A-18 regain air supremacy? Image source: Getty Images. Saved by the bell \nKuwait is a nation of just 3.4 million people. At a cost of roughly $2,700 per citizen, the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoons from Airbus represents a huge investment for the country. (Note: Airbus is the largest shareholder of the Eurofighter consortium that makes the Typhoon. BAE Systems owns a 33% stake in the consortium.) And yet, it seems Kuwait has not yet run out of money to spend. \nTwo weeks ago, in a rather surprising announcement , the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of Kuwait's continued interest in buying F/A-18s from Boeing (apparently in addition to the Typhoons from Airbus). As explained in DSCA's notification, Kuwait intends to purchase 32 F/A-18E fighter jets and eight more advanced F/A-18F fighters from Boeing. Total cost: $10.1 billion. \nNor was this the only good news Boeing shareholders got last week. Cast your eyes south \nSimultaneous with the announcement of the Kuwait fighter deal, DSCA notified Congress of a second -- even bigger -- sale of Boeing fighter jets to the Middle East. Just a few hundred miles to the south of Kuwait likes the peninsular nation of Qatar, and the Qataris seem even more infatuated with Boeing planes. \nAccording to DSCA , Qatar is seeking permission to purchase 72 F-15QA fighter jets from Boeing for the princely sum of $21.1 billion. That makes the total value of Boeing contracts being sought here $31.2 billion. What it means for Boeing -- and its investors \nIt's hard to overestimate the importance of these defense deals to Boeing, now that the Obama administration has permitted them to proceed. (Congress has literally never rejected a foreign arms deal once the DSCA has given official notification). \nFrom a sheer dollars-and-cents perspective, Boeing's military aircraft division earns 9.8% pre-tax profit margins on the planes it sells -- the second-highest profit margin of any Boeing division. Ultimately, the $31.2 billion in revenue flowing from the two deals named above should earn Boeing pre-tax profits well in excess of $3 billion, worth nearly 43% of all the profits that Boeing generated from all its businesses last year. \nBut the significance of these deals is even greater than that. \nWith demand for its fourth-generation fighter jets waning, Boeing had been planning to shut down production of its F-15s by 2019. F/A-18 production was likely to cease in 2017. Boeing Defense head Leanne Caret has been heard talking about how Boeing needed to \"evolve\" beyond fighter jets entirely, and refocus its efforts on building planes it can actually sell -- KC-46 Pegasi, C-17 Globemasters, and P-8A Poseidons. \nThanks to these last-minute sales, though, Boeing's fighter jets business has a new lease on life. \nConsider: Last year, Boeing produced and delivered 35 F/A-18 model aircraft to its customers around the world. At that build rate, the Kuwaiti deal will extend F/A-18 production by more than a year. Indeed, if Boeing can slow its production rate just a bit, the production line could operate even longer -- giving Boeing more time to find even more buyers, to extend its lifeline even further.   \nMeanwhile, Boeing's F/15 was already producing at the much slower rate of just 12 planes per year. Qatar's order for 72 new F-15s extends the lifespan of that model aircraft by six more years! \nTurns out, thanks to these two last-minute contract wins, Boeing may not have to quit the defense business after all. \n10 stocks we like better than Boeing \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For months, the Obama administration had been dragging its feet on approving a sale of Boeing's competing F/A-18 fighter jet to Kuwait. Ultimately, Kuwait chose to buy fighters from Airbus, which was quicker to approve the deal. Latest Business Achievements",

      "text": "Boeing made a big deal about the 787 using the green ISO 'running man' exit signs vs. the traditional white and red EXIT signs. One of the reasons was to reduce the number of bilingual signs needing to be made depending on the airline's country.\n\nI was therefore surprised when I flew on UA's 787 that they have the white and red EXIT signs instead.\n\nAnyone know the reason why? Is this something Boeing installs at UA's request, or does UA have to modify this post-delivery?\n\nI noticed in this video does show one of UA's first 787s with the running man signs: United 787 Dreamliner Pre-delivery Walkthrough at Boeing HQ | Engadget - YouTube United 787 Dreamliner Pre-delivery Walkthrough at Boeing HQ | Engadget - YouTube \nI doubt this is a US regulatory issue as Boeing sought FAA approval to use these signs during the 787 development process, and both AA's 787s and DL's new A321s use the running man signs.

      "text": "Top News | Sat Dec 3, 2016 | 11:58pm EST U.S. Navy aims to buy more Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets: source A F/A-18E/F Super Hornets of Strike Fighter Attack Squadron 211 (VFA-211) is lined up for take off on the flight deck of the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) aircraft carrier in the Gulf June 18, 2015. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo By Andrea Shalal | SIMI VALLEY, Calif. \nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. The U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model Boeing Co ( BA.N ) F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers, a Navy official said. \nThe plan, which is still being finalized, could be implemented as early as part of the fiscal 2018 budget, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \n\"To decrease the strike fighter shortfall and to best prepare future air wings for likely threats we will soon divest from legacy Hornets, look to buy several squadrons worth of Super Hornets and continue with efforts to bring on the F-35 carrier variant,\" said the official. \nThe Navy also plans to field and deploy a new unmanned carrier-based refueling plane, the official said. \nSources familiar with Navy plans say delays in the fielding of the carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) F-35 fighter jet, longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model Hornets, and higher usage rates have left the Navy facing a shortfall of about 70 fighter jets in coming years. \nIf implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years. \n\"We would welcome an opportunity to develop a plan, with the Navy, that would allow us to continue providing the robust capabilities of the Super Hornet well into the future,\" said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher. \nThe company had suffered a setback last month when Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill, opening a potential gap in the Boeing production line until several foreign orders for Kuwait and Canada are finalized. The $618.7 billion bill was passed Friday by the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure next week. \nNavy officials say the jets could still be added to the fiscal 2017 budget as part of a supplemental budget that lawmakers are urging Republican President-elect Donald Trump to submit after he takes office. \nRepublicans, who will control both houses of Congress and the White House after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a 2010 law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending. \nThe older model Hornets could be transferred to the Marine Corps, which has faced its own maintenance issues, including a lack of spare parts. \n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Nick Macfie) Next In Top News Cuba's Raul Castro vows to defend brother's legacy in final tribute \nSANTIAGO, Cuba President Raul Castro led tens of thousands of Cubans on Saturday in a pledge to defend the socialist legacy of his brother Fidel Castro, who died last week aged 90 and will be interred in the city where they launched the Cuban Revolution.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nOut in the wilds of YouTube you can find a compilation of videos depicting athletes and sports teams prematurely celebrating victory. They jump, they laugh and hug, they play to the crowd, all the while oblivious to the other team scoring the winning goal/point/run. Cheers quickly turn to shock, and then to tears. \nThose inclined to celebrate a World Trade Organization ruling in September that Airbus has been relying on subsidies that are illegal under international trade law, or agree with Boeing that a WTO decision last week striking down Washington state’s subsidies to it is really a Boeing victory, might spend some quality time with that video. \nThe lesson they should take away is that “it ain’t over till it’s over.” And in trade fights, it’s almost never over, and never almost over. \nIt’s especially not almost over in the current U.S. political environment, with a new administration that got there in part on the appeal of its stance on trade. \nThrough the campaign, and continuing after the election, a constantly voiced criticism of Donald Trump’s rhetoric on trade was that he would wind up touching off trade wars across the globe, to the ultimate detriment of the U.S. economy, its companies and workers. \nNot exactly. Trump as president may pour a few buckets of gasoline on already smoldering disputes, and he may find a few new ones to ignite. But one reason Trump did well with the trade issue is the perception in much of the country that the United States is already involved in multiple trade wars, and is on the losing side of many of them, to the detriment of the economy, companies and workers. \nThat point tends to get ignored in our corner of the world which, on balance, tends to come out on the positive side of the trade ledger. Boeing sells airplanes all over the world. Washington farmers grow wheat, apples, hay and dozens of other commodities sold beyond our borders. Locally based companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks export tech and retailing services. Even tourism is an export of sorts when foreign visitors check out our mountains, museums and wineries. \nBut even in Washington you can find pockets where communities, industries and workers haven’t fared as well in the trade equation. And in places such as the Midwest, it’s not pockets but swaths of the region where people see trade as a losing proposition. \nWhile Boeing benefits from globalization of the aerospace industry, it also benefits from the sort of practices that trigger trade disputes, as well as popular sentiment about trade, which it can harness in making its case for more support at home and for enforcement against competitors from abroad. \nHence the unceasing wrangling between Boeing and Airbus. The latest WTO case involves state incentives for building the 777X in Washington. The WTO ruling was a mixed bag, allowing for wide interpretation, in which both sides happily indulged. Airbus crowed that the ruling “extends the WTO’s earlier condemnation of massive illegal subsidies to Boeing to $26 billion in the form of wholly nonrefundable corporate welfare. This is the single largest state-level instance of corporate welfare in U.S. history.” \nBoeing was having none of that. “Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington state and Boeing,” said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel, in a statement. “The WTO found in September that Airbus has received $22 billion in illegal subsidies from the EU and that without these subsidies neither Airbus itself nor any of its airplanes would even exist today. By contrast, in rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.” \nBefore anyone gets too giddy about their victory, this saga has many more chapters to run, involving negotiations and filings and appeals. The next chapter, however, may come in the form of a WTO decision on Airbus’ contention that the U.S. hasn’t complied with an earlier ruling on subsidies for the 787. \nAnd where is China, a frequent villain in arguments about trade policy, in all this? Not as far removed as you might guess. There’s a school of thought that says China will continue milking both Boeing and Airbus for production investment and technical know-how until it can get its own commercial aviation industry established to dominate a market both companies are counting on for growth. When that day arrives, look for trade disputes that dwarf the present tiffs by comparison. \nIn the meantime, U.S. trade negotiators can occupy their time fighting with their counterparts over, to name a few industries of local interest, commodities like logs and softwood lumber and software-embedded intellectual property. Administrations in the other Washington come and go; fighting about trade, however, is a permanent resident. \nBill Virgin is editor and publisher of Washington Manufacturing Alert and Pacific Northwest Rail News.

REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo \nDecember 4, 2016 \nBy Andrea Shalal \nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) – The U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model Boeing Co <BA.N> F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers, a Navy official said. \nThe plan, which is still being finalized, could be implemented as early as part of the fiscal 2018 budget, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \n“To decrease the strike fighter shortfall and to best prepare future air wings for likely threats we will soon divest from legacy Hornets, look to buy several squadrons worth of Super Hornets and continue with efforts to bring on the F-35 carrier variant,” said the official. \nThe Navy also plans to field and deploy a new unmanned carrier-based refueling plane, the official said. \nSources familiar with Navy plans say delays in the fielding of the carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N> F-35 fighter jet, longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model Hornets, and higher usage rates have left the Navy facing a shortfall of about 70 fighter jets in coming years. \nIf implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years. \n“We would welcome an opportunity to develop a plan, with the Navy, that would allow us to continue providing the robust capabilities of the Super Hornet well into the future,” said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher. \nThe company had suffered a setback last month when Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill, opening a potential gap in the Boeing production line until several foreign orders for Kuwait and Canada are finalized. The $618.7 billion bill was passed Friday by the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure next week. \nNavy officials say the jets could still be added to the fiscal 2017 budget as part of a supplemental budget that lawmakers are urging Republican President-elect Donald Trump to submit after he takes office. \nRepublicans, who will control both houses of Congress and the White House after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a 2010 law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending. \nThe older model Hornets could be transferred to the Marine Corps, which has faced its own maintenance issues, including a lack of spare parts. \n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Nick Macfie)",

      "text": "print \nBy Andrea Shalal \nSIMI VALLEY, Calif., Dec 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model Boeing Co F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers, a Navy official said. \nThe plan, which is still being finalized, could be implemented as early as part of the fiscal 2018 budget, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \n\"To decrease the strike fighter shortfall and to best prepare future air wings for likely threats we will soon divest from legacy Hornets, look to buy several squadrons worth of Super Hornets and continue with efforts to bring on the F-35 carrier variant,\" said the official. \nThe Navy also plans to field and deploy a new unmanned carrier-based refueling plane, the official said. \nSources familiar with Navy plans say delays in the fielding of the carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model Hornets, and higher usage rates have left the Navy facing a shortfall of about 70 fighter jets in coming years. \nIf implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years. \n\"We would welcome an opportunity to develop a plan, with the Navy, that would allow us to continue providing the robust capabilities of the Super Hornet well into the future,\" said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher. \nThe company had suffered a setback last month when Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill, opening a potential gap in the Boeing production line until several foreign orders for Kuwait and Canada are finalized. The $618.7 billion bill was passed Friday by the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure next week. \nNavy officials say the jets could still be added to the fiscal 2017 budget as part of a supplemental budget that lawmakers are urging Republican President-elect Donald Trump to submit after he takes office. \nRepublicans, who will control both houses of Congress and the White House after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a 2010 law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending. \nThe older model Hornets could be transferred to the Marine Corps, which has faced its own maintenance issues, including a lack of spare parts.

      "text": "U.S. Navy aims to buy more Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets: source Reuters 21 mins ago By Andrea Shalal © REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo A F/A-18E/F Super Hornets of Strike Fighter Attack Squadron 211 (VFA-211) is lined up for take off on the flight deck of the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) aircraft carrier in the Gulf The U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model Boeing Co (BA.N) F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers, a Navy official said.\nThe plan, which is still being finalized, could be implemented as early as part of the fiscal 2018 budget, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\"To decrease the strike fighter shortfall and to best prepare future air wings for likely threats we will soon divest from legacy Hornets, look to buy several squadrons worth of Super Hornets and continue with efforts to bring on the F-35 carrier variant,\" said the official.\nThe Navy also plans to field and deploy a new unmanned carrier-based refueling plane, the official said.\nSources familiar with Navy plans say delays in the fielding of the carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet, longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model Hornets, and higher usage rates have left the Navy facing a shortfall of about 70 fighter jets in coming years.\nIf implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years.\n\"We would welcome an opportunity to develop a plan, with the Navy, that would allow us to continue providing the robust capabilities of the Super Hornet well into the future,\" said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher.\nThe company had suffered a setback last month when Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill, opening a potential gap in the Boeing production line until several foreign orders for Kuwait and Canada are finalized. The $618.7 billion bill was passed Friday by the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure next week.\nNavy officials say the jets could still be added to the fiscal 2017 budget as part of a supplemental budget that lawmakers are urging Republican President-elect Donald Trump to submit after he takes office.\nRepublicans, who will control both houses of Congress and the White House after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a 2010 law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending.\nThe older model Hornets could be transferred to the Marine Corps, which has faced its own maintenance issues, including a lack of spare parts.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Nick Macfie)\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Boeing Co. The U.S. Navy is reported to be looking to replace its F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets with new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Both planes are built by The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and if the Navy can make a strong argument to the Congress and the Trump administration, the appropriation needed to buy “dozens” of the Super Hornets could be included in the fiscal year 2018 budget.\nAccording to a Saturday report from Reuters, “sources familiar with the Navy’s plans” attribute the plan to delivery delays in the carrier version of the Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) of the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35.\nThe Air Force plans to buy 1,773 of the F-35A fighters and Lockheed is looking forward to robust sales to international buyers of the Air Force variant of the plane. The Marine Corps variant of the plane, the F-35B, will achieve its initial operational capability (IOC) milestone in December, with the Navy variant, the F-35C, scheduled to achieve IOC by February 2019. All told, the services planned to buy 2,443 of the fighter jets.\nBoeing got some bad news last month when the Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. That could cause Boeing to experience gaps in its Super Hornet production line until recent foreign orders from Kuwait and Canada are finalized and slotted into the line.\nKuwait’s order could include up to 40 Super Hornets and Canada last month cancelled its intended purchase of 65 F-35s, choosing instead to order 18 Super Hornets until the country has time to complete a review of its needs for new fighter planes.\nThe U.S. Navy’s reported plan to purchase more Super Hornets could still be added to the 2017 budget as a supplemental authorization approved by Congressional Republicans and the incoming Trump administration which are both viewed as more amenable to defense spending.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "By Andrea Shalal\nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model Boeing Co F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers, a Navy official said.\nThe plan, which is still being finalized, could be implemented as early as part of the fiscal 2018 budget, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\"To decrease the strike fighter shortfall and to best prepare future air wings for likely threats we will soon divest from legacy Hornets, look to buy several squadrons worth of Super Hornets and continue with efforts to bring on the F-35 carrier variant,\" said the official.\nThe Navy also plans to field and deploy a new unmanned carrier-based refueling plane, the official said.\nSources familiar with Navy plans say delays in the fielding of the carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model Hornets, and higher usage rates have left the Navy facing a shortfall of about 70 fighter jets in coming years.\nIf implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years.\n\"We would welcome an opportunity to develop a plan, with the Navy, that would allow us to continue providing the robust capabilities of the Super Hornet well into the future,\" said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher.\nThe company had suffered a setback last month when Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill, opening a potential gap in the Boeing production line until several foreign orders for Kuwait and Canada are finalized. The $618.7 billion bill was passed Friday by the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure next week.\nNavy officials say the jets could still be added to the fiscal 2017 budget as part of a supplemental budget that lawmakers are urging Republican President-elect Donald Trump to submit after he takes office.\nRepublicans, who will control both houses of Congress and the White House after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a 2010 law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending.\nThe older model Hornets could be transferred to the Marine Corps, which has faced its own maintenance issues, including a lack of spare parts.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Nick Macfie)",

      "text": "U.S. Navy aims to buy more Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets: source Updated: December 3, 2016 — 11:58 PM EST Share \nBy Andrea Shalal \nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model Boeing Co F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers, a Navy official said. \nThe plan, which is still being finalized, could be implemented as early as part of the fiscal 2018 budget, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \n\"To decrease the strike fighter shortfall and to best prepare future air wings for likely threats we will soon divest from legacy Hornets, look to buy several squadrons worth of Super Hornets and continue with efforts to bring on the F-35 carrier variant,\" said the official. \nThe Navy also plans to field and deploy a new unmanned carrier-based refueling plane, the official said. \nSources familiar with Navy plans say delays in the fielding of the carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet, longer-than-expected maintenance times for older model Hornets, and higher usage rates have left the Navy facing a shortfall of about 70 fighter jets in coming years. \nIf implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years. \n\"We would welcome an opportunity to develop a plan, with the Navy, that would allow us to continue providing the robust capabilities of the Super Hornet well into the future,\" said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher. \nThe company had suffered a setback last month when Congress failed to include 12 Super Hornets in the fiscal 2017 defense authorization bill, opening a potential gap in the Boeing production line until several foreign orders for Kuwait and Canada are finalized. The $618.7 billion bill was passed Friday by the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure next week. \nNavy officials say the jets could still be added to the fiscal 2017 budget as part of a supplemental budget that lawmakers are urging Republican President-elect Donald Trump to submit after he takes office. \nRepublicans, who will control both houses of Congress and the White House after Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a 2010 law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending. \nThe older model Hornets could be transferred to the Marine Corps, which has faced its own maintenance issues, including a lack of spare parts. \n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Nick Macfie) Published: December 3, 2016 — 11:58 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Bellevue startup BoldIQ gets Boeing boost for business-aviation tool Originally published December 4, 2016 at 5:00 pm A small startup scores big with a deal in which it developed a business-aviation system that Boeing’s Jeppesen division offers to its customers. Share story Rachel Lerman Seattle Times business reporter \nBoldIQ, a growing Bellevue software company, scored a big deal this winter when Boeing debuted a business-aviation system that uses the small company’s technology. \nBoeing’s Jeppesen division launched a new operating system that helps business-airplane companies keep their planes fully staffed and running on time. The cloud-based system, known as Jeppesen Operator, puts flight scheduling, crew management, trip planning, pricing and many other tasks into one place. \n“Today in the current state, without a solution like this, what operators have to do is acquire and maintain and use multiple systems that are disparate from each other,” said Mike DiDonato, director of industry services at Jeppesen. \nWith Jeppesen Operator, a business airline would use BoldIQ’s scheduling software to allow them to plan for flight crews and planes. But the biggest draw is yet to come. Most Read Stories \nBoldIQ specializes in optimizing scheduling using an automated system that recognizes priorities and makes sure everything runs smoothly. It automatically readjusts personnel and jobs if a pilot calls in sick or a flight is grounded or something else pops up. \nIt can reschedule hundreds of factors in minutes. \nThat optimization functionality is being added to Jeppesen Operator and is expected to launch in early 2018. \nThe Bellevue company has 21 employees and is hiring six more, partly bolstered by the Boeing deal. The contract gives it an extra layer of credibility, BoldIQ CEO Roei Ganzarski said. \n“It also helps with market access,” he said. “What we’re able to tap into, we could never do that on our own.” \nBoldIQ makes scheduling software for aviation and ground-transportation companies, and is developing technology for the health-care industry. \nThe Operator software, which launched in November, now has six business-aviation company customers, and may branch into commercial airlines to help with cargo planning and other unscheduled areas.

      "text": "Anyone who has ever interacted with a tech department, or watched episodes of The IT Crowd , knows that when something goes wrong with your PC it's best to try turning it off and on again. Chances are it will fix the problem. Now it turns out that same technique is being employed to fix an issue with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner passenger aircraft.\nAccording to The Seattle Times , the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discovered a glitch which can result in all three of the Dreamliner's flight control compute modules resetting themselves without warning at the same time. That includes while a Dreamliner is in flight.\nThe control modules on board a Dreamliner manage a whole host of systems, but the one most concerning to the FAA is the \"flight control surfaces.\" This system allows the flight crew to control the flight of the aircraft. If it resets without warning then the crew loses control temporarily.",

      "text": "OSLO: Budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle plans to order more aircraft from Boeing and Airbus after its Irish subsidiary received long-awaited flying rights from US authorities, its Chief Executive told Reuters.\nAfter a three-year application process, the US Transportation Department granted those rights on Friday, setting the stage for a new battle among airlines for leisure travellers across the Atlantic.\n“There is no doubt we’ll need even more planes after this,” Bjoern Kjos said in an interview on Monday, adding that he expected the airline to place orders from both Airbus and Boeing.\nNorwegian Air is working on new transatlantic routes from Irish cities like Cork, Dublin and Shannon, and plans to double its staff in the United States, he said.\n“We expect to start flying from Cork and Dublin already next summer with at least four weekly routes,” said Kjos. \n“But there, we expect to add more routes, both from Shannon and also from some cities in Scotland.” Shares in Norwegian Air surged 12.4 per cent by 1146 GMT on Monday in reaction to the ruling. It gives the carrier’s Irish-based international arm the right to fly to the United States, and benefit from the European Union’s aviation agreement with the United States, which is much more comprehensive than Norway’s.\nKjos said he now expected the Norwegian low-cost carrier to open several new bases in the United States, with staff using such locations as their home base, in the coming years.\n“We will now start working on establishing bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. LA will most likely be in place in 2018 and hopefully San Francisco as well,” said Kjos.\nThe airline expects to double the number of employees in the United States to over 2,000 in 2018, he said.\nLast week Ryanair said it was in talks with Norwegian Air about feeding passengers into Norwegian’s long-haul flights from large cities in Britain. Kjos said the decision from US authorities on Friday makes these talks even more relevant.\n“We are in talks with Ryanair right now where we are looking at the technical solutions. We hope to have a deal in place sometime next year”, said Kjos.\n“After that we would like similar deals with EasyJet/sand other airlines who want a cooperation”, said Kjos.\nKjos said Norwegian would use European and US crew on these routes, depending on where the hubs are.\n“We will create a lot of jobs in the US and we will fly in a lot of tourists who will spend a lot of money over there.”",

Analysts have suggested that President-elect Donald Trump's talk about tougher trade policies with China, in particular, could impact some aircraft buying overseas. \n\"Revised trade policies emerging from the recent U.S. election could negatively affect the competitiveness of North American commercial aerospace companies,\" Fitch said in its 2017 Outlook: Global Aerospace & Defense report. \"More restrictive trade policies could also disrupt the global aerospace supply chain.\" \nOverall, the rating agency said it expects the stable outlook is justified given positive trends within aerospace and defense segments \"offsets political risks, new aircraft program ramp-ups and business jet sector weakness.\" \nOn the large commercial aircraft side, the ratings agency said the number of aircraft from Boeing and Airbus is expected to rise about 8 percent next year and grow by 4 percent in 2018. It also sees global airline passenger traffic trends supporting the positive trends as well as industry forecasts for improved global airline profits due to continued low fuel costs. \nFitch also observed there is additional political risk from the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank, which Boeing's commercial airplanes business and other manufacturers depend on for financing international customers. \n\"The future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) is another development to watch, as shutting the Ex-Im bank could negatively affect the competitiveness of U.S.-based aerospace manufacturers,\" said Fitch. \nSome lawmakers consider the Ex-Im Bank, which provided financing for just over 10 percent of Boeing's aircraft sales in 2015, a form of corporate welfare and would like to eliminate it. That said, backers of the financial institution say if that happens U.S. companies with international sales could potentially find themselves at a disadvantage against foreign competitors. \nAccording to Fitch, Airbus and Boeing combined had 12,345 aircraft on their order books as of October 2016, which it said was roughly equivalent to eight years' worth of deliveries. The total value of those orders was as much as $875 billion. \nAlthough the ratings agency didn't mention it, some industry analysts also have pointed to potential risk from higher interest rates that they believe could result in some airlines slowing their aircraft replacement buying programs. \nFor 2017 alone, Fitch estimated that around $120 billion to $125 billion in global financing would be needed for new commercial aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer. \nMeantime, on the defense side Fitch said it sees 3 percent to 5 percent spending growth on a global basis over the next three years. It projected that the U.S. budget accounts for 45 percent to 50 percent of the total defense market, but added that the growth domestically is less than the international market. \nFitch said it expects the results of the U.S. elections could result in \"upside\" potential for U.S. military spending and more business for defense companies. \nAs reported, President-elect Trump has promised to increase the number of U.S. Navy ships and add more aircraft to the military. Also, he has pledged to boost the number of U.S. troops, which has been seen as a positive for both ammunition companies and missile manufacturers. \n\"Cost overruns or delays on new programs are risks to the outlook in both the commercial and defense sectors,\" Fitch said. \"On the defense side, risks include the budget cap overhang in the U.S., additional continuing resolutions and political disruptions.\"",

      "text": "In recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals... \nAs a new American president bent on retaining American jobs prepares to take office, the Obama administration and the U.S. defense industry are working on a deal with the Indian government to build iconic U.S. combat aircraft in India. \nIn recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals... (Annie Gowen) \n\"Taxes tend not to be a big deal in these decisions,\" said Bob Chirinko, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \nFor example, the $7 million Carrier would receive from Indiana is \"small potatoes\" compared with the $65 million that state officials have said Carrier told them the company would save every year by shifting production to the new plant outside Monterrey, Mexico, Chirinko said. He suggested that for United Technologies , the conglomerate that owns Carrier, the cost of producing in Indianapolis might be an investment in goodwill with the new Republican administration. \nIn a CNBC interview on Monday, United Technologies chief executive Greg Hayes suggested that business with the federal government was a consideration in his decision on the deal. \n\"There was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open,\" Hayes said. \"I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.\" \nIt might be a good strategy for United Technologies, but for the president-elect, peddling goodwill to firms nationwide could become costly, Chirinko warned. \n\"You could talk about serious money,\" he said. \"One deal looks good, but then you have to think about the ramifications.\" \nMost states that use tax incentives to recruit businesses say they've made good deals. Several states in the South, including Alabama and Georgia, have used nine-figure deals to lure automakers with the hopes that a major manufacturer such as Hyundai or Kia can create a constellation of new suppliers, with varying success. \nOn Georgia's state economic development web site -- available in Korean and Japanese -- the state, after a 2006 investment in Kia, says it now has a network of 40 automotive companies that employ 7,000. \nBut in Alabama, the benefits of similar subsidies were limited, and held the state back from other kinds of spending, according to a 2015 study. Officials in Alabama paint a different picture - one in which a 1993 investment in Mercedes has helped launch a statewide automotive revival, with a massive Hyundai plant in Montgomery and a Honda light truck facility in Lincoln. Suppliers for those automakers have spread into rural Walker County. \nThe report, by George Crowley, an associate chair for economics and finance at Troy University in Troy, Alabama, said the tax incentives have created thousands of jobs, but they've \"come at a significant cost, both in taxpayer dollars and potentially lost opportunities.\" \nOfficials in Alabama paint a different picture - one in which a 1993 investment in Mercedes has helped launch a statewide automotive revival, with a massive Hyundai plant in Montgomery and a Honda light truck facility in Lincoln. Suppliers for those automakers have spread into rural Walker County. \n\"It's a tool that we use, but it's used wisely,\" David Knight, executive director of the Walker County Development Authority, said of the subsidies. He said the region needed to diversify its economy after a glut of job losses in the coal industry. \nPerhaps no state has suffered more from tax incentives than Louisiana, which pushed itself into a fiscal crisis in part by generously awarding corporations with various breaks. Earlier this year, Louisiana's governor said the state was doling out more to corporations in refunds and credits than it was receiving in corporate taxes, many aimed at oil and gas companies that later cut employment during a commodities price crash. The state's unemployment rate has risen to 6.3 percent. \n\"We don't have a tax code. It's an exemption code,\" said Greg Albrecht, the state's chief economist. \"These programs are very expensive. I personally say it's an unhealthy situation.\" \nIn Indiana, efforts by Pence and his predecessor, former governor Mitch Daniels , have been broadly successful in attracting businesses to the state, said Timothy Slaper, an economist at Indiana University. \n\"Being aggressive in showing that there's a climate and environment that's hospitable to business is a good thing,\" he said. \nOne important victory was Honda's decision to open a new plant in Greensburg, Indiana, in 2008. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation has committed $26 million in inducements to the Japanese automaker over the years, and the plant in Greensburg employs just over 2,100, state data show. \nThe state's efforts have received criticism. While the corporation makes some information public, exact data on spending and employment is not available, hindering an objective evaluation of the policy, said Marcus, the economist. \nIt is a common problem for such programs. \n\"We don't have a complete statistical picture of what's going on so that we can evaluate whether or not these decisions have been successful,\" Marcus said. \nMoreover, unlike many other states, Indiana does not place statewide requirements for employment on firms that receive credits. The result is that employers can receive assistance for hiring more workers at one facility, while shifting production at another facility in the state overseas, as detailed in an investigation by the Indianapolis Star earlier this year. \nAbby Gras, a spokeswoman for the IEDC, said the agency keeps a close eye on companies that get the incentives. \n\"If a company chooses to neglect its commitment to the state and to its Hoosier employees,\" Gras said, \"we aggressively seek to claw back any incentives the company has received.\" \nExpanding such deals to federal policy draws more skepticism. Critics on the left and right say this approach risks enriching certain firms and their lobbyists, potentially straining public coffers with little way of evaluating the benefits to the broader economy. Some economists also argue that such subsidies allow bureaucrats, rather than the logic of the free market, to influence decisions about investment and employment. \n\"These are supposedly conservative Republicans who don't want government interference with private business decisions,\" said Morton Marcus, an economist in Indiana who writes a syndicated column on state affairs. \"They're interfering with private business decisions.\"",

      "text": "In recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals... \nAs a new American president bent on retaining American jobs prepares to take office, the Obama administration and the U.S. defense industry are working on a deal with the Indian government to build iconic U.S. combat aircraft in India. \nIn recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals... (Annie Gowen) \n\"I think a president wants to get involved any time it's about jobs being created in America, and I think that's healthy,\" McCarthy argued Monday. \nA few moments later, though, he appeared to contradict himself, asserting: \"You want to know my philosophical belief? I believe in the free market, I don't think government should be picking winners or losers.\" \nTrump would likely need congressional approval to impose tariffs on a specific company or a group of companies, trade law experts said. The president has broad authority to impose tariffs on specific categories of imported goods, but not to single out individual companies that make them. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was also asked about the tariff issue Monday, in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in his home state of Wisconsin. He declined to comment directly, the paper reported, and, like McCarthy, focused on tax reform instead. \n\"We can get at what he's talking about through smart tax reform. What his concern is, is legitimate — American companies are moving overseas, are shifting headquarters and factories overseas,\" said Ryan, blaming \"our terrible tax code.\" \nOutside GOP-friendly groups, meanwhile, lined up against Trump's tariff proposal. \n\"Tax cuts and deregulation will make the American economy great again, but tariffs and trade wars will make it tank again,\" said Club for Growth president David McIntosh. \"The president-elect is spot on when he calls for cutting taxes and federal regulations, but 35-percent tariffs would be devastating to consumers and businesses.\" \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief economist, J.D. Foster, called tariffs \"self-destructive\" in an appearance on Fox Business' \"The Intelligence Report with Trish Regan,\" adding: \"You can make companies want to come into the U.S. by making the U.S. a better place to do business.\" \nAssociated Press",

The window will be available as a feature on the BBJ, BBJ 2, and all three members of the BBJ MAX family – including the new BBJ MAX 7 – with scheduled entry-into-service in 2018. \"We are thrilled to formally confirm our partnership with GKN Aerospace's Fokker business for the development of this fantastic feature on the BBJ, the largest airplane window available in the market,\" said Boeing Business Jets President David Longridge. The Skyview Panoramic Window, measuring approximately 4.5 feet by 1.5 foot (1.4 x 0.5 m), is created by effectively joining three existing 737 windows together. Situated aft of the wing with multiple potential locations based on the airplane type, it offers customers an unparalleled perspective of the world. \"We are proud to announce the next step for the Skyview Panoramic window together with Boeing Business Jets,\" said Peter Somers, President of GKN's Fokker Services business. \"The innovative technology applied in the largest window in the market, enhances passenger comfort and is now also available for BBJ MAX airplanes.\" The window will be available through GKN Aerospace's Fokker business as a retrofit on existing BBJs, and through Boeing Business Jets as a priced feature. It will be delivered on BBJ MAX airplanes starting in 2018. Contact:",

Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nAnd the result... \nAs a reminder, Boeing is 5.5% of The Dow, and with Ex-Im bank on the wires (defending its existence), we note that Boeing's employee base is near the lowest since 1993... Boeing: Number of Employees: pic.twitter.com/diDPzXpizv \n— Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) December 6, 2016 \nThis seemed to sum things up nicely... \"everyone had a plan until the President Tweeted out that the stock market was in a big fat ugly bubble\"",

      "text": "The brain trust at Boeing, among city's largest companies and a global aerospace and defense powerhouse, must cringe every time President-elect Donald Trump riffs on foreign policy, especially when it comes to dealing with China.\nAdmittedly, that's my supposition because Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO, has made only measured comments about the administration's emerging international views.\nBut count on a mercurial Trump administration to test the Boeing CEO's statesmanship, especially when it comes to dealing with China — a multibillion-dollar Boeing commercial airline customer.\nIt looks like Trump is eager for a China confrontation. This week, he launched a Twitter barrage chiding that country's trade, monetary and political policies. His comments came after he participated in a controversial phone call with the leader of Taiwan that China — which considers the island a rebel province — viewed as an insult.\nPresident-elect Trump's business adventure has only begun, so hang on Robert Reed Think about this: Donald Trump , chief executive officer of the United States of America.\nYes, it's going to take time for everyone, especially business people, to wrap their minds around this new situation. Just as challenging, however, will be trying to gauge what our volatile president-elect will...\nThink about this: Donald Trump , chief executive officer of the United States of America.\nYes, it's going to take time for everyone, especially business people, to wrap their minds around this new situation. Just as challenging, however, will be trying to gauge what our volatile president-elect will...\n(Robert Reed) The last thing Boeing, with $96 billion in annual revenues, wants is an international trade war that could raise tariffs or greatly disrupt long-standing, albeit imperfect, global agreements. Boeing risks retaliation and facing greater state-backed overseas competition.\nHowever, in remarks before the Illinois Manufacturers' Association last week, Muilenburg conceded there's more populist concern about international pacts than before the 2016 election campaign.\n\"I'm not a political pundit or prognosticator — we have too many of those — but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said.\nMuilenburg argues that international trade is essential to the U.S. economy and its importance is reflected in the \"large and growing percentage of our business\" coming from international sales, including commercial jet orders from China.\n\"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every 3 of those 737s were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers. This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985,\" said Muilenburg, who began his Boeing career as an aerospace engineer.\nTrump courted small business. Now entrepreneurs wait to see if he's for real. Robert Reed There's a maxim about small business and politics: Before an election, politicians say they love entrepreneurs. But after an election, they usually break up.\nRight now, small-business owners hope President-elect Donald Trump will become a faithful partner, yet they wouldn't be very surprised if...\nThere's a maxim about small business and politics: Before an election, politicians say they love entrepreneurs. But after an election, they usually break up.\nRight now, small-business owners hope President-elect Donald Trump will become a faithful partner, yet they wouldn't be very surprised if...\n(Robert Reed) A steady influx of China commercial jet orders means more work for Boeing's thousands of U.S. workers while also providing lift for its network of domestic parts supplier and vendors.\nAround 90 percent of Boeing's total workforce of 151,000 people and 80 percent of its thousands of suppliers are U.S.-based, according to Boeing.\nLast year, Boeing racked up $66 billion in revenues from its commercial aircraft business.\nAnd while international sales grow, so does the competition. Boeing is up against European rival Airbus while Canada, Brazil, Russia — and yes, China — are trying to get pieces of the aerospace business.\nMuilenburg suggests the Trump team, and Congress, back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric and perceived threats to punish other countries with higher tariffs or fees.\nInstead, he suggests they get down to the business of advocating a stronger U.S. agenda during ongoing or upcoming trade negotiations with other countries.\n\"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,\" he said.\nBusinesses snagged by web of new Internet scams Robert Reed Norb Tatro, a former local TV news producer and friend of mine, was recently cloned. On Facebook, that is.\nI know this because his cyber alter ego contacted me one evening with some \"happy\" news: He'd just won $250,000 from a new U.S. government/Facebook grant program.

What's more, my name was...\n(Robert Reed) The big unknown is Trump, who hasn't seen a major trade deal he likes yet.\nHe has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement , a U.S. pact with Mexico and Canada, and wants to withdraw from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nTrump has blasted these deals for enabling U.S. companies to export work to less-expensive countries, hurting American workers. He also says too many countries are dumping cheap, government-subsidized steel and other goods into the U.S., which depresses demand for U.S.-made products and hurts job creation.\nHow nationalist will his new administration actually be and what form will that protectionism will take? Does that mean higher tariffs, sanctions, backing out of trade deals or more drastic measures?\nGoing into the next presidential administration, there's a lot of unanswered questions and concerns.\nRight now, Boeing's CEO is waiting to see what comes next.\nHe's not alone.\nroreed@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @reedtribbiz \n  Canada Donald Trump North American Free Trade Agreement",

(Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, Special for USA TODAY) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the U.S. government to cancel a deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing for development of a new Air Force One. \nThe Air Force signed deals with Boeing in January and July to design certain aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior, electrical and power system, and maintenance systems. \nThe exact costs of the project were not immediately clear Tuesday. \nBut that didn't stop Trump from tweeting: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J.

The Air Force expects the planes to have the range to fly between continents and comparable interiors to the current 747, whose features include work and sleeping quarters for the president and first family.\nBoeing fell 0.7 percent to $151.07 before the start of regular trading in New York.

      "text": "Stewart Airport lands first, scheduled international service A Norwegian Boeing 737 PHOTO VIA MID-HUDSON NEWS NETWORK By Mid-Hudson News Network \nNEW WINDSOR, N.Y. >> Low-cost airline Norwegian Air Shuttle will operate daily flights between Stewart International Airport and European destinations. \nThe airline already flies to other U.S. cities. \nStewart Airport will be added to the route schedule, initially with service to Ireland and, eventually, to other destinations, said Norwegian spokesman Anders Lindstrom. \nService is expected to start in mid 2017 and continue to grow to other destinations. Introductory fares may be as low as $69 one-way, he said. Advertisement \nNorwegian has 100 new Boeing 737 Max aircraft on order to be delivered within two years. The airline will base two jets at Stewart. \n“We will be creating a lot of jobs at Stewart because we will base two aircraft to begin with in mid 2017 and that will require some 75, 80 pilots and cabin crew that will be recruited locally in the greater New York area,” Lindstrom said. \nStewart Airport Commission Chairman Louis Heimbach is looking beyond just the flights from Europe. \n“Having those tourists come to Stewart means that many of them will want to transfer to other airplanes to fly to different places in the United States, so I hope this is incentive for many of our U.S. carriers to Stewart also,” Heimbach said. \nOrange County Executive Steven Neuhaus said locating the carrier at Stewart will also translate into ancillary services and jobs. \n“You are going to have a big impact on ground transportation providers like Coach USA — the bus company — as well as the Boeing company, which is now going to be doing the maintenance on those planes. They will now be looking for mechanics and people to maintain the 737 Max,” Neuhaus said. \nNorwegian currently operates 45 daily routes from the United States and is the fastest growing airline in Europe , Lindstrom said.",
