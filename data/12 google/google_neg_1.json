      "text": "This secret Google Street View trick lets you travel back in time By Ariyanna Norman, Komando.com \nWe've all used Google Street View to look at photos of our home. Hopefully, the Google cars passed by on a day when our front lawns were presentable. \nBut did you know that you can use this same feature to look at old photos of locations all over the world? Use Google Street View to get a blast from the past! You can look back as far as 2007. \nFirst, go to Google Maps , type the location's name or address in the search bar in the top left corner and hit \"Search.\" Then in the bottom right corner, click the \"Show Imagery\" icons and select the \"Street View\" picture. Once the image loads, you will see a black box in the top-left corner. There is a month and year timestamp next to a clock, click that to select a different month and year to view. \nGoogle's official blog says they're trying to create a \"digital time capsule of the world.\" This feature was released in 2014 but not every photographed location has images from the past. Even still, this is pretty interesting. You will probably get more results if you search landmarks and public places instead of private residences. \nThe Komando headquarters is among the places you can view. Our staff relocated to our current location during the summer of 2015. Before then, a few different tenants shared the building. \nBut don't just look at the past, you can also go on a virtual tour of some of the most beautiful places in the world. For starters, look at our list of 10 amazing places you can visit with Google Maps' Street View . Their website also has a page full of suggestions .

      "text": "Producers of movies and TV shows in Russia say they want companies including Google, Yandex and Microsoft to wipe piracy from their search engines. The rightsholders want the companies to remove links to pirate sites from their search listings on demand, or face being held liable for third party infringement. While millions of users visit pirate sites directly to get their content fix, others prefer to use the services of search engines.\nAs a result, companies like Google and Bing are considered major drivers of traffic to torrent and streaming sites, a point not lost on the world’s entertainment industry groups.\nIn an effort to stem the flow, both get hit with millions of DMCA-style notices every week. The engines comply by removing millions of links.\nOver in Russia the situation is more complex and content groups want a change in the law to tip the balance in their favor. They’re demanding that search engines remove links to pirate sites from their results entirely, or face being held liable for third-party infringement.\nThe proposals from the Association of Film and Television Producers (APKIT) have already been sent to the Ministry of Culture, which is currently drafting a new anti-piracy law. They foresee companies like Google, Yandex and Microsoft being forced to deal with infringement, or else.\n“The members of our association believe that search engines are the main problem of piracy,” APKIT’s Sergey Semenov told Izvestia .\n“Search engines – this is the best place to stop the infringement. We want direct instructions in the law that search engines themselves become responsible for infringement, if they do not remove the links after they became aware of copyright infringement.”\nAccording to anti-piracy chief Maxim Ryabyko of AZAPO, there is a difference of opinion among lawyers when it comes to search engine liability and whether they need to remove links. It all comes down to whether they can be defined as information brokers, information intermediaries, or something else.\nAPKIT’s Semenov says that since there is no clarity on what defines an information broker, it is necessary to write into law where search engines stand and from there determine liability. Yandex, on the other hand, believes that clarity already exists.\n“Regulation of the activities of search engines in the form offered by the rightsholders – including holding them liable for copyright infringement – is inappropriate and legally incorrect, as existing legislation and judicial practice have a clear understanding of the impossibility of holding search engines liable for violating intellectual property rights,” a Yandex spokesperson said.\n“The courts take the position that the search engines are not information intermediaries due to the nature of their work. This position is confirmed by numerous judicial practice.”\nBack in August, Eksmo, a publisher responsible for around 30% of all Russian books, filed a complaint with Yandex which demanded it removed links to infringing content indexed by leading Russian torrent site, RuTracker.\nYandex was given 48 hours to “cease publishing any information necessary to access the forbidden resource rutracker.org.” Yandex refused to comply and the case went to court, with rightsholders demanding that the search engine should be blocked by ISPs. The Moscow Court rejected the application.",

      "text": "Diana Shi — Nov 6 2016 \nAll GIFs and screencaps by the author \nWhat does a mild-mannered dad dream of conquering when he hits his late-fifties? Maybe hurtling through space at 800 miles per hour wearing only a space suit. Alan Eustace , a computer scientist and former Google Senior Vice President of Knowledge, endured the task of dropping 135,000 feet through the earth’s stratosphere with only an expandable balloon strapped to his back in 2012. The project eventually earned him the title of highest free-fall in the world. The complete harrowing process, from the initial plans sketched on a napkin three years prior, to the final customized suit, is captured in the 85-minute film, 14 Minutes from Earth . \nThe setup sounds a lot like the typical daredevil parachuting from a plane, but in Eustace’s case, the singular twist involved less of a jump, and more of a lift followed by a potentially deadly drop. Eustace sacrificed himself in the name of science by committing himself to a mission that turned him into a human spacecraft. The ultimate goal for Eustace involved dropping through the earth’s stratosphere without an outside shell for support—thus launching him “higher than any man has gone without a rocket ship.” \nSoundbites from the film’s preview describe the implicit danger of the 14-minute undertaking while also painting Eustace as more of an accomplished techie than a stuntman with a death wish. In a foreboding voiceover, one source remarks, “We’re dealing with a human life in this endeavor, and we all need to draw our own lines of what is an acceptable risk.” \nA preliminary sketch of Eustace's space suit—appropriately drawn on a napkin \nEustace’s wife, Kathy Ann Kwan, shares how many were surprised at her relatively low-key husband’s new project. “People ask me if Alan is in the middle of a mid-life crisis. My response is, this has been going on for years.” \nFormer Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, also makes an appearance, genially commenting that “under [Eustace’s] mild manner, is a man of steel.” \nTake a look at the full preview of 14 Minutes from Earth right here, before its public release: \n14 Minutes from Earth will be available on demand and in HD, November 8, 2016.

      "text": "print \nGoogle cloud boss Diane Greene Google \nGoogle's $625 million acquisition of Apigee announced in September hasn't closed yet, but should be done after Apigee's November 8 stockholder meeting, someone familiar with the matter told Business Insider. \nThat will be a relief to Apigee employees, whose morale was pretty low when the company went public in 2015. \nAnd it will set in motion a plan by Google's new cloud boss Diane Greene to bolster its business and step up the fight with cloud superpower Amazon. \nAlthough Google's largest acquisition of the year was widely viewed a means for the company to get its hands on specialized app developer technology, Greene appears to have seen something else in Apigee, a bruised enterprise cloud company with a turbulent past. Hanging by a thread \nApigee's troubles go back to its 2015 IPO. Usually employees are thrilled when their startup graduates to the public markets because it means that they will soon be able to sell the shares they earned (often in lieu of higher pay). \nBut in this case, just before the IPO, Apigee told its employees that it was doing a massive 1-for-7.6 reverse stock split . Every 7.6 shares became a single share. That dashed many employees hopes of making a ton of money on the IPO. \n\"It was very demoralizing, the day before the IPO, they reverse split the stock by 8x. That was a jerk move to be very honest, but at the same time, the company wouldn’t have IPO'd if they didn’t do that,\" this person said. \nNone of the investors sold shares in the IPO either. They were under similar lock-up constraints as employees. That's not uncommon, especially with a soft and sketchy IPO market. IPO bankers don't want to flood the market with more shares when investors are lukewarm. \nAnd then Apigee's IPO was not a stunning success. It was labeled an \"IPO down-round,\" a company that went public at a lower valuation than its private investors had given it. It priced at $17 a share, valuing the company at $494.5 million . It's VCs had valued it at $600 million when it last raised cash in the summer of 2014. \nOn the first day of trading, the shares ended the day below its IPO price . And things tanked from there. By the summer of 2016, the stock was below $6.50 a share. When the lockup expired in October, 2015, shares were in the $10 range. \n\"Apigee has always been hanging on by a thread,\" this person told us. \"Everybody was locked up and the market was very volatile. Existing VCs who had been in there for a long time, didn't really get a chance to really let their shares go. So Apigee had been looking for a buyer, basically since the day of the IPO.\" \nAnd that means that when the shares crashed even further last winter, under $6 a share, prospective buyers like Microsoft or Amazon could have swept up Apigee for a practical pittance, a fraction of its IPO valuation. \nBut they didn't. Enter a frustrated Google \nMeanwhile, Google hired Diane Greene late last year to help it become cloud computing giant. Although Google had poached Amit Singh from Oracle a few years earlier, and he had been successfully nabbing big companies for Google Apps (renamed Google for Work under Singh and recently renamed G-Suite under Greene), Google really wasn't set up to be an enterprise cloud company. \nApigee CEO Chet Kapoor Apigee \nGreene, co-founder and previous CEO of VMware and a current Google board member, set about hiring and reorganizing at Google. She built a cloud sales and support team and added more enterprise friendly features to Google's cloud. \nWhile Greene says she is pleased with the progress , it's an open secret within the tech industry that Google is having a hard time landing big contracts with big customers the way Amazon and Microsoft are doing. \nSome say that Google isn't even being invited to bid on those contracts. \nOn top of that, there are signs that Google's biggest marquee customer to date, Snap (parent of Snapchat) may soon be leaving Google to build its own data center, as it readies for an IPO. Snap has been hiring data center experts. And Snapchat is no longer featured prominently on Google's cloud customer pages . \nAnd that's where Apigee can fits in. Stepping stone \nGoogle agreed to pay $625 million cash, $17.40 a share, a 6.5% premium over Apigee's previous closing price. This was Google's largest disclosed acquisition in 2016. \nThat was not an excessively high price. In October, Apigee announced annual revenue of $92,027 and a net loss of $41,512, with revenue growing by over 30% and losses narrowing over the previous year. That's a bit over 6x revenue, not untypical . \nStill, it was a lot more than it would have paid just a few months earlier. It basically paid Apigee's final valuation before it went public, giving investors a face-saving, profitable exit. \nApigee offers a service for creating and hosting application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs allow computer program to work together, for instance, when a mobile app adds an appointment to your calendar, it's using the calender's API. \nWhile Google can use Apigee's tech, the technology wasn't the real focus, the person with knowledge of the matter told us. \nOf all the features Google needs to add to its cloud to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft, API hosting isn't top of the heap, this person says, although Amazon does offer its own . (But Amazon is miles ahead of every other cloud in terms of all the features it offers.) \nFlickr/Will Merydith \n\"Why is this the first thing Diane bought? And why would Google pay the most money for Apigee when no one else would pay that much? Because Google is dead last in cloud, and behind on every metric. It's not like Google needed an API platform,\" this person said. \"But they did need revenue. They did need executive talent, they did need logos.\" \nApigee has an experienced enterprise salesforce who have landed a long list of enterprise customers such as Allstate, AT&T, Burberry, First Data, Kaiser Permanente, Walgreens etc. All told, Apigee has more than 335 customers, it says. \nMore importantly, Apigee is a big AWS customer . Apigee's cloud service is built on Amazon's Web Service and a number of its customers also host their API apps on AWS as well. \nOnce Google moves Apigee to Google's cloud, it has a compelling inside sales track to convince 335 more enterprise customers to do the same. \nAnd once these customers try Google's cloud for their API's, Google intends to be invited to bid for their other cloud needs. \nIf it works as planned, Google just might take its pocketbook out and buys some more cloud companies next year. \nAs Google's CEO Pichai Sundar said on CNBC last week : \"And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth.\" \nApigee declined comment and Google did not respond to request for comment.

      "text": "Tweet \nHaving recently said that it will show different search results to mobile and desktop users , Google now has another search related announcement. Reacting to the fact that most searches are conducted from mobile devices, search results will be ranked according to sites' mobile content. \nGoogle says that it has \"begun experiments to make [its] index mobile-first\", and it's a move that essentially says that mobile searchers are more important than the rest. In light of the recent splitting of mobile and desktop indexing, the announcement is hardly a bolt out of the blue, but it's still something that many site owners will need to take action about. \nWhile the change has just been announced, Google says that it will be gradually introduced over the coming months. Ranking algorithms will ultimately look to the mobile index to determine how results should be ordered, Google says desktop users are not going to be abandoned. \nAnnouncing the change, Google says : \nAlthough our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site's content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results. Of course, while our index will be built from mobile documents, we're going to continue to build a great search experience for all users, whether they come from mobile or desktop devices. \nWe understand this is an important shift in our indexing and it's one we take seriously. We'll continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale and we'll ramp up this change when we're confident that we have a great user experience. \nTo help webmasters to ensure that their sites don't slip right to the bottom of search results, Google has a number of hints and tips relating to the change: If you have a responsive site or a dynamic serving site where the primary content and markup is equivalent across mobile and desktop, you shouldn’t have to change anything. If you have a site configuration where the primary content and markup is different across mobile and desktop, you should consider making some changes to your site. Make sure to serve structured markup for both the desktop and mobile version.Sites can verify the equivalence of their structured markup across desktop and mobile by typing the URLs of both versions into the Structured Data Testing Tool and comparing the output.When adding structured data to a mobile site, avoid adding large amounts of markup that isn’t relevant to the specific information content of each document. Use the robots.txt testing tool to verify that your mobile version is accessible to Googlebot. Sites do not have to make changes to their canonical links ; we’ll continue to use these links as guides to serve the appropriate results to a user searching on desktop or mobile. If you are a site owner who has only verified their desktop site in Search Console, please add and verify your mobile version . If you only have a desktop site, we'll continue to index your desktop site just fine, even if we're using a mobile user agent to view your site.If you are building a mobile version of your site, keep in mind that a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site. It's better for you to build up your mobile site and launch it when ready.",

      "text": "\nThe team behind LeapDroid, an Android emulator made for the PC that was first released publicly in June, have announced that they are joining Google. The announcement also comes with some bad news as the emulator will no longer continue to be developed.\nSee also: Best Android emulators for PC 192 In their announcement, Huan Ren and Huihong Luo, the co-founders of LeapDroid, stated:\nWhile it’s too soon to comment on specific plans, we look forward to working with our new colleagues at Google to continue pushing the frontier of technology.\nThe team emphasizes that LeapDroid itself is not affiliated with Google, so this is not a flat-out acquisition of the company behind the emulator. It sounds like Google was more interested in hiring the team behind the software. If you already have LeapDroid installed on your PC, you can still continue to run it, but there will be no further updates and the official downloads for the emulator have been taken offline. We reviewed LeapDroid in July and found it to be a very solid emulator with only a few issues and hiccups.\nWhat do you think of Google’s latest business move, and what do you think it means for the future of Android development as a whole?",

      "text": "Google tries basing its search index around mobile websites It would rank pages primarily on their phone versions. Save Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nGoogle isn't just splitting its search indexes into desktop and mobile versions... it could start prioritizing mobile, too. The internet firm has started experimenting with a \"mobile-first\" index that primarily ranks sites based on their phone-friendly pages. The company will take the months ahead to refine the experience and make sure that computer users aren't left by the wayside, but your PC will no longer be the absolute center of Google's search universe. \nThe change won't affect responsive websites that automatically resize to fit your device (like Engadget), and desktop-only sites are fine. The only serious concern is for sites that have separate content for desktop and mobile. Creators will want to check that they aren't neglecting their mobile sites and make them as easy to search as their PC counterparts. \nGoogle makes no bones about why it's looking at such a big shift in priorities. Most people search from mobile devices these days -- shouldn't the index reflect the pages you're more likely to see? While the company has made numerous efforts to improve mobile search in recent years, it's at the point where it has to make fundamental changes if it wants to stay in sync with reality.",

      "text": "Google’s New Play Store UI Is Already Surfacing For Some November 6, 2016 - Written By Justin Diaz \nAs with just about anything else that Google puts out, the Play Store has gone through quite a few updates visually, and just recently they started testing a new UI for it. The start of these changes began appearing back on October 26th , and now it looks like some users are actually starting to see these changes come through on their devices. Although, it is worth noting that the changes in question do not seem to be rolling out to very many users at the moment, which suggests that this is more of a small test instead of the actual push of the changes to the public. \nThese visual touches are not major sweeping changes or any sort of a complete overhaul, but they are different enough that users will take notice. Included in these changes is a new more slender looking install button for content. Upon opening the dedicated page for any app or game, the button for the install no longer takes refuge to the right side of the screen just under the icon at the top of the page. Instead, it spans the length of the page, and below it sit slightly different looking icons for the download numbers and the star rating. \nWhile the new install button will certainly be noticeable, the first thing that uses will see once the UI has been updated is the tweaks Google made to the main screen of the Play Store upon opening it. The green is darker than before and is now matching the color used for Hangouts, and the app carousel that used to sit in the header with the search bar is now below the search bar. In addition to the new placement, Google has also given each application that sits in the scrollable list of featured apps a visual touch up by using a card-style layout instead of banner image that takes up the length of the header like it used to. Some of the visual updates in the Play Store seem to be appearing for some users in India, so Google’s test is likely a regional thing, although there’s no indication that only users in India are seeing the changes. There’s also no way of knowing when Google will roll these changes out to all uses. Post navigation",

      "title": "The unintended ways self-driving cars will change our lives",
      "text": "Join the network Six years ago, Google raised a lot of eyebrows when it announced it was developing a self-driving car . At the time, very few people took the technology seriously. However, things have been gearing up, and now self-driving cars are about to be part of our everyday life. Just last August, Uber rolled out its first batch of 100 driverless taxi-cars in Pittsburgh. This is one of the most transformative technologies of the last decade. The ways these cars will impact your everyday life, from potentially losing your right to drive to losing your job altogether, can’t be overstated. The transportation industry is the first victim, but there will be more to come. In fact, Oxford researchers estimate that automation is expected to wipe off about half of US jobs within the next two decades . \nAutomation itself isn’t bad. It’s a process that has been going on for centuries. History is filled with jobs that disappeared because of technology. How many of these would you want to bring back? Future generations will think of human drivers the same way as we now think of town criers or elevator operators . 1/7 Driving could become illegal \nLet’s put it bluntly: humans are shitty drivers. In America alone, there’s hasn’t been a year since WW2 where car crash didn’t kill over 30 000 people . And over 94% of those are caused by human error . \nMeanwhile, computers are just much better. A recent study estimates that mass-adoption of self-driving cars could reduce over 90% of traffic accidents . Facts back this up. Since their inception, Google self-driving cars have driven almost 2 million miles , and have only been involved in one accident where the computer was at fault. What happens when self-driving cars become mainstream, and the authorities realize how overwhelmingly better at driving they are? They outlaw driving . Elon Musk made a lot of people angry because he believe s this might happen. In the end, safety is about money. In the US, accidents cost about $871 billion /year and that alone, means it’s reasonable to believe changes could be afoot. 2/7 The technology will lead to massive public surveillance \nRussian dash cam videos have become an Internet running gag. But comedy aside, they’re a necessity because the corrupt law enforcement and legal system in Russia force drivers to get a dash cam to protect their rights. In the U.S., the proliferation of camera-enabled smartphone has shed light on another important issue. Videos capturing police violence brought widespread media attention, leading to nationwide protests and the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement. But ultimately, the violence isn’t new; it’s the cameras that are . \nStill, surveillance by the public can lead to dangerous surveillance OF the public. While the staggering amount of information collected could massively improve public safety by identifying roadblocks, accidents or potential dangers and immediately contact the right service (and crime prevention software could detect assaults as they unfold and warn the authorities), this constant surveillance would bring us closer to an Orwellian society. 3/7 Owning a car will be a foreign concept to your kids The prevailing business model of every large company with a self-driving initiative seems to be electrified, autonomous ride-sharing services. By eliminating human salaries and gasoline costs, the price of a car ride could drop as low as $.35 per miles — cheaper than public transportation right now. In the end, you get all the benefits of owning a car, pay less, and you never have to worry about maintenance or finding a parking spot. With perks like that, say goodbye to your kids’ really knowing the joys of the surreptitious road-trip, cutting class and joy-riding, or making out at the drive-in. Considering that the car is likely the world most underutilized assets , this is a much welcome change. Ultimately, driverless technology will let us achieve improved efficiency in transportation while reducing up to 90% of the cars off the road . For a country like the United-States, research estimates it could amount to a whopping 240 million cars. 4/7 Traffic will be virtually nonexistent Beyond the obvious benefit for the environment, having fewer cars on the road is the first step towards eliminating traffic. Self-driving cars could remove traffic entirely. A team of researchers did an experiment in 2008 demonstrating how traffic can appear from seemingly nowhere. They put 22 vehicles on a 750-foot single-lane circuit and directed everyone to drive at about 30 mph. Within a short time, the cars were jammed. In a system where every car can communicate with each other at the speed of light, an overarching traffic management system could make this traffic jam an impossibility. The environmental benefits for this are huge. Currently, American commuters collectively waste 5.5 billion hours per year in traffic, releasing into the atmosphere an unnecessary 56 billion pounds of CO2 and wasting about $124 billion in the process. Advertisement 5/7 Driverless cars will wipe millions of jobs… \nHere’s a picture of a dumbfounded police officer who pulled over a Google car for “driving too slow.” This picture a great metaphor for our automated future. In a world without any drivers, parking spots, or traffic lights, there is not a lot of work left for traffic cops. While the thought of never getting speeding tickets anymore sounds amazing, it isn’t so great for the people who lose their job. And this goes beyond cops –think taxi, bus and truck drivers. Money is a big factor of change in our society. It turns out, self-driving cars don’t need money. They can also work 24/7 without any breaks. When employing them, you don’t need to worry about hiring, managing or giving benefits either. All of this means huge savings for transportation businesses, which they are definitely going to seek. 6/7 Scott Santers perfectly illustrated how disruptive of a change this will be with this map. As you can see, driving is one of the most popular jobs in the US. With an average salary of about $40,000 per year , it’s also one of the few remaining careers that can provide a good middle-class income without requiring a degree. In the US, there are 3.5 million professional truck drivers , in addition to the 665,000 bus drivers , 240,000 taxi drivers , and the many Uber and Lyft drivers. All those jobs will ultimately be replaced by self-driving cars. 7/7 …And transform the economy as we know it Self-driving cars are a part of a much broader automation phenomenon, where advances in robotics and artificial intelligence slowly replace humans in the workplace . Technology is ushering us into an era where there will be fewer jobs than there are people. This is why we build things in the first place. In a sense, driverless technology is the Transcontinental Railroad or Interstate Highway of our time. It is a generation of entrepreneurs and engineers working together to make life easier for future generations.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Google's DeepMind turns to StarCraft II after conquering Go Blizzard and DeepMind have created an open test environment within the StarCraft II game for artificial intelligence researchers to use worldwide. | Topic: Artificial Intelligence \nGoogle's DeepMind has announced that it will be making use of game development studio Blizzard's StarCraft II game as a testing platform for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning research, opening the environment worldwide. \nThe announcement, made during Blizzard's BlizzCon conference at Anahaim on Sunday, has seen both companies build an open research environment to be used by anyone across the globe as of 2017, as well as by DeepMind itself. \n\"We've worked closely with the StarCraft II team to develop an API that supports something similar to previous bots written with a 'scripted' interface, allowing programmatic control of individual units and access to the full game state (with some new options as well),\" DeepMind said . \n\"Ultimately, agents will play directly from pixels, so to get us there, we've developed a new image-based interface that outputs a simplified low-resolution RGB image data for map and minimap, and the option to break out features into separate 'layers', like terrain heightfield, unit type, unit health, etc.\" (Image: Screenshot by Corinne Reichert/ZDNet) \nThe two are also working on creating \"curriculum scenarios\" -- a ladder of increasingly complex tasks so that AI researchers of any level can get their system running, benchmark algorithms, and advance. StarCraft II will also have editing tools to enable flexibility and control for the researchers taking part. \nAccording to DeepMind, video games are one of the best ways to test and develop AI, with the company calling StarCraft II \"the pinnacle of 1v1 competitive video games\". \n\"DeepMind is on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem without needing to be told how,\" DeepMind said. \n\"Games are the perfect environment in which to do this, allowing us to develop and test smarter, more flexible AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, and also providing instant feedback on how we're doing through scores.\" \nDeepMind added that it has also used 2D games on Atari and complex games such as Go to test its AI system. What's Hot on ZDNet There's almost no money in making Android smartphones \nStarCraft II is closer to a real-world environment than any other game it has used for testing so far, DeepMind said, as it is played in real-time. \n\"The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks,\" it claimed. \nIn playing StarCraft, the AI system will have to come up with real-time strategies for choosing one of the three distinct races at the beginning of the game; choosing when and how to farm minerals and gas; deciding when and which buildings and units to construct; and scouting unseen areas of the map and remembering that navigational information over the course of the game. \nAn AI engine would therefore have to make use of the skills of memory, mapping, long-term planning, and adapting to changes in plans using information that is continually being gathered, which translates to hierarchical planning and reinforcement learning. \nLast month, researchers at DeepMind announced that they developed an AI that stores knowledge such as a map, allowing it to navigate such complicated systems as the London Underground. \nDeepMind's differential neural computer (DNC) trains its memory through a process comparing its own answers with the correct answers, each time moving closer to producing correct answers itself. \n\"We wanted to test DNCs on problems that involved constructing data structures and using those data structures to answer questions. Graph data structures are very important for representing data items that can be arbitrarily connected to form paths and cycles,\" DeepMind researchers Alexander Graves and Greg Wayne explained in October. \n\"When we described the stations and lines of the London Underground, we could ask a DNC to answer questions like, 'Starting at Bond street, and taking the Central line in a direction one stop, the Circle line in a direction for four stops, and the Jubilee line in a direction for two stops, at what stop do you wind up?'. Or, the DNC could plan routes given questions like 'How do you get from Moorgate to Piccadilly Circus?'.\" \nThe DNC had an average accuracy of 98.9 percent after adding external memory. \nDeepMind also recently announced developing a deep neural network that produces human-like text-to-speech systems. \nThe neural network closed the gap between machine-generated speech and human speech by approximately 50 percent, DeepMind said in September, for both US English and Mandarin Chinese speech. \nDeepMind is also partnering with the United Kingdom's National Health Service to experiment with using machine learning to plan the use of radiotherapy for individual head and neck cancer patients, which could improve waiting times for procedures and free up more time for doctors nationwide. \n\"For these cancers, segmentation [radiotherapy planning] can take around four hours. And even though UCLH's specialist team at its dedicated head and neck cancer centre is a national leader in this process, there is still potential for innovation. We think machine learning could make a difference,\" DeepMind said in September. Join Discussion",

      "title": "Google's War on Data and the Clickstream Revolution - Moz",
      "text": "Banks Near Me - 107 Landscaping Company - 260 \nAs you can see, a highly personalized keyword like \"banks near me\" or \"landscaping company\" — which are dependent upon location —receive a large number of unique URLs clicked. This is to be expected and validates the model to a degree. However, candidate names like \"Hillary Clinton\" and \"Donald Trump\" are personalized no more than major brands like Dropbox, Google, or Facebook and products like the Samsung Note 7. It appears that the hypothetical filter bubble has burst — most users see the exact same results as one another. Biased search behavior \nBut is that all we need to ask? Can we learn more about the political behavior of users online? It turns out we can. One of the truly interesting features of clickstream data is the ability to do \"also-searched\" analysis. We can look at clickstream data and determine whether or not a person or group of people are more likely to search for one phrase or another after first searching for a particular phrase. We dove into the clickstream data to see if there were any material differences between subsequent searches of individuals who looked for \"donald trump\" and \"hillary clinton,\" respectively. While the majority of the searches were quite the same, as you would expect, searching for things like \"youtube\" or \"facebook,\" there were some very interesting differences. \nFor example, individuals who searched for \"donald trump\" were 2x as likely to then go on to search for \"Omar Mateen\" than individuals who previously searched for \"hillary clinton.\" Omar Mateen was the Orlando shooter. Individuals who searched for \"Hillary Clinton\" were about 60% more likely to search for \"Philando Castile,\" the victim of a police shooting and, in particular, one of the more egregious examples. So it seems — at least from this early evidence —that people carry their biases to the search engines, rather than search engines pushing bias back upon them. Getting a real click-through rate model \nSearch marketers have been looking at click-through rate (CTR) models since the beginning of our craft, trying to predict traffic and earnings under a set of assumptions that have all but disappeared since the days of 10 blue links. With the advent of SERP features like answer boxes, the knowledge graph, and Twitter feeds in the search results, it has been hard to garner exactly what level of traffic we would derive from any given position. \nWith clickstream data, we have a path to uncovering those mysteries. For starters, the click-through rate curve is dead. Sorry folks, but it has been for quite some time and any allegiance to it should be categorized as willful neglect. \nWe have to begin building somewhere, so at Moz we start with opportunity metrics (like the one introduced by Dr. Pete , which can be found in Keyword Explorer) which depreciate the potential search traffic available from a keyword based on the presence of SERP features. We can use clickstream data to learn the non-linear relationship between SERP features and CTR, which is often counter-intuitive. \nLet's take a quick quiz. \nWhich SERP has the highest organic click-through rate? A SERP with just news A SERP with just top ads A SERP with sitelinks, knowledge panel, tweets, and ads at the top \nStrangely enough, it's the last that has the highest click-through rate to organic. Why? It turns out that the only queries that get that bizarre combination of SERP features are for important brands, like Louis Vuitton or BMW. Subsequently, nearly 100% of the click traffic goes to the #1 sitelink, which is the brand website. \nPerhaps even more strangely, pages with top ads deliver more organic clicks than those with just news. News tends to entice users more than advertisements. \nIt would be nearly impossible to come to these revelations without clickstream data, but now we can use the data to find the unique relationships between SERP features and click-through rates. In production: Better volume data \nPerhaps Moz's most well-known usage of clickstream data is our volume metric in Keyword Explorer . There has been a long history of search marketers using Google's keyword volume as a metric to predict traffic and prioritize keywords. While (not provided) hit SEOs the hardest, it seems like the recent Google Keyword Planner ranges are taking a toll as well. \nSo how do we address this with clickstream data? Unfortunately, it isn't as cut-and-dry as simply replacing Google's data with Jumpshot or a 3rd party provider. There are several steps involved — here are just a few. Data ingestion and clean-up Modeling against Google Volume Disambiguation corrections \nI can't stress how much attention to detail needs to go into these steps in order to make sure you're adding value with clickstream data rather than simply muddling things further. But I can say with confidence that our complex solutions have had a profoundly positive impact on the data we provide. Let me give you some disambiguation examples that were recently uncovered by our model. Keyword ",

      "text": "Google today is announcing a few updates to the services in its Firebase cloud service portfolio. \nInstead of being a premium feature, the Firebase Test Lab tool for testing apps on physical and virtual devices will now be available free of charge as part of the Spark service tier. Plus, Google is adding new physical devices to test on: the Nexus 6, the LG G4, Sony’s Xpedia Z3 and Z5, Galaxy S series devices, and Moto G series devices from Lenovo’s Motorola unit.\n“We’re further giving developers access to devices that otherwise they might not get,” Google product manager Francis Ma told VentureBeat in an interview.\nThis announcement comes a few days after Google said it would begin offering Android developer previews through the virtual devices in Firebase Test Lab.\nCompeting cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) also offers testing on physical devices.\nBut beyond Firebase Test Lab, Google is also adding the ability to export data from Firebase Analytics — something that was introduced earlier in the year — to Google’s BigQuery cloud-based data warehousing service. From there, companies can send data to third-party business intelligence tools like Qlik and Tableau. There’s currently no way to circumvent BigQuery, Ma said.\nTo enhance Firebase Analytics further, Google is introducing a preview of something called a StreamView, which “lets developers see in real time a stream of events from all of their end users out in the wild,” Ma said. There is also a new DebugView to make sure that their analytics setup is working properly and events are coming in as they should.\nAlso today Firebase is announcing the launch of a Unity plugin that enables developers building apps with the Unity game engine to easily start using Firebase’s analytics, authentication, dynamics links, notification, and real-time database features.\nAnd the Firebase Crash Reporting feature is out of beta now.\nSee Ma’s blog post for more detail.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Google’s Firebase developer platform gets better analytics, crash reporting and more Posted GoOpti, a ride-sharing app for European shuttle bus services, raises €3.4M funding \nGoogle today launched the first major update to its Firebase backend-as-a-service platform since it first announced its plans to turn the service into its unified platform for developers six months ago. While Facebook decided to shut down its competing Parse service earlier this year, Google decided to double down on Firebase (which it acquired in 2014 ) as its flagship development platform for app developers on iOS and Android, as well as web developers. \nToday’s update includes the 1.0 launch of Firebase’s crash reporting tool, improved real-time analytics that are now also integrated into Google’s BigQuery database service, better support for game developers who use Unity, and the launch of a new Firebase Udacity course for iOS and Android developers. \nAs Ben Galbraith, who leads product and developer relations in Google’s Developer Products Group, told me, building apps today is far more complex than it was two or three years ago. When “mobile-first” became a thing, you only had to consider a few screen sizes and platform. Today, your users may be on hundreds of different devices. In addition to this platform challenge, though, you also have to consider all of the infrastructure work that goes into running a modern app, be that authentication, real-time data syncing, A/B testing or crash analytics. \n“Whether you are on iOS or Android, there is this set of concerns that you have to think about — but they are all table stakes,” Galbraith said. “We want to take those off the table for you so you can focus on something new and innovative for your users.” \nAt the core of Firebase is its analytics service, which is available for free — just like Google Analytics is available for free, too (you can almost think of its as the loss leader in the Firebase feature set). For the most part, Firebase Analytics is not a real-time service and as Galbraith noted, for most use cases, that’s not a problem. Sometimes, however, you do want to get real-time feedback from your apps — especially when you are testing them and want to make sure that your analytics setup is working. For those use cases, Firebase Analytics now offers a new real-time debug view (in beta). \nIn addition, Firebase now lets its users export data to BigQuery, Google’s big data analytics warehouse, in real time, too. This allows developers to dig deeper into their data than the basic Firebase Analytics service currently allows. Using BigQuery can quickly become expensive, but the company now offers a free tier, too. By combining the data in BigQuery with Google’s Data Studio visualization service, developers can easily build their own real-time dashboards for Firebase Analytics. \nFirebase Analytics now also uploads any conversion events in real time, too, so developers will be able to set up systems to quickly react to these incoming events, too. \nAnother major feature of Firebase is its Crash Reporting service. This feature, too, is now becoming a bit more real time. Previously, it took about 20 minutes before all the data for a crash was available in the Firebase dashboard. Now, that time is down to one minute. More importantly, though, this crash data now includes more data about the context of each crash by combining the crash data with Firebase;s analytics data to show you how a user arrived at the point when the app crashed. Developers won’t already use Crash Reporting and Firebase Analytics won’t need to add any additional code to their apps to get access to this new feature. \nMostly, though, developers will want to avoid crashes. At its I/O developers conference six months ago, Google announced the launch of Firebase Test Lab , its remote testing service (previously also known as the Google Cloud Test Lab). With today’s update, the Firebase Test Lab gets a free tier that allows developers to run up to five tests on physical Android devices (and ten on virtual devices) per day — no credit card required. \nFor game developers, Google built a new Unity plugin that supports Firebase Analytics, its real-time database, authentication, dynamic links, remote config, notifications and other core Firebase features. \nAlso new is version 1.0 of the FirebaseUI, which offers developers common UI elements for building their apps (think authentication, etc.) and a new “Firebase in a Weekend” course the company developed with Udacity. \nThe company made these announcements at its Firebase Dev Summit in Berlin today. 0 ",

      "title": "How Google’s Mobile-Only Index Will Change SEO in 2017",
      "text": "Google's decision to split it's index will mean big changes in SEO next year Google has unsettled the SEO community throughout 2016 by releasing back-to-back updates to its SERPs and search algorithms. The latest, and hopefully the last change for the year, was announced by Google's Gary Illyes at PubCon last month. Google is going to launch a separate mobile search index, which will eventually become its primary index. The index will be effective \"within months,\" said Illyes. Google officially confirmed this announcement just days go, with a post on their webmaster central blog confirming their decision to make their index 'mobile first'. What was less clear was whether they'd be running two index's seperatly, or going straight to a single 'mobile first index'.\nNot quite a bombshell, I'd say, considering that Google has been experimenting with a mobile index since last year. Google's mobile-first strategy that it has aggressively pursued for at least the last couple of years is no secret, but the latest change represents a huge challenge for businesses and SEOs, particularly when viewed side-by-side with the other changes to mobile search and SERPs that have been introduced this year. Before we can find out how to deal with the new mobile index as well as the other updates, let's run through what those updates were.\nLatest Google Updates that Will Affect SEO in 2017 Right Column Ads Gone : Google blew away the right column ads from its SERPs, dedicating a wider panel to the search results. It was in Feb this year.\nLonger Titles and Descriptions : Then, in May, SEW observed something odd. It appeared Google had increased the displayable character limit of the page titles to 68-70 char for desktop, and a whopping 78 char for mobile SERPs. The SERPs were also displaying longer meta descriptions, which sometimes extended to 3 lines instead of the usual two.\nMobile-Friendly Label Gone : On August 23, Google announced that the Mobile Friendly label would no longer appear in the SERPs. Some 85% of the websites appearing in mobile search results had already become search friendly at that point in time, so Google just pulled the plug on the label to de-clutter its pages.\nPutting Pressure on Pop Ups : In the same announcement, Google slapped full-page interstitials (or pop-ups) with negative points for ranking mobile websites . The so-called \"lead magnet\" websites with boxes might have seen their traffic nosedive as a result of this change.\nAMP Update : AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) is a Google-backed technology that speeds up the loading time for mobile pages to a remarkable 0.7 seconds (median time). In September Google said it would be displaying the AMP icon with AMP-coded pages on its mobile SERPs. Google says AMP is not a ranking signal, but SEOs should see this as an opportunity to drive better CTRs because the results with the AMP symbol are more likely to be clicked. Moreover, the increased page speed will have a positive impact on SEO too.\nSeparate Indexes for Web and Mobile Search, but Why? This time, Google has not just announced a dedicated index for mobile SERP's but has also said it is going to be their primary index, which means that it will be updated more frequently.\nGoogle's obsession with mobile first shouldn’t be a surprise if you know that on average 56% of the traffic now comes from mobile devices. In fact, most digital growth is now coming from mobile usage, whereas desktop is becoming a secondary touch point for an increasing number of users. Google wants its users to be able to find the content they want as conveniently and as quickly as possible. Because most of Google's users are now mobile, it simply makes sense to put mobile first.\nBut why a mobile-only index? Probably, Google realises that users behave differently when searching on mobile. For instance, they want the content to be served more quickly or want to see directions or distance info during local searches . Additionally, because of the rapid mobile adoption rate, Google has seen a phenomenal increase in the number of voice searches. Voice queries have multiplied 35x since 2008 and now constitute up to 20% of all searches.\nMost of the voice searches are made with natural language queries, which are often different and longer than traditional, typed queries. Google may have increased the title length on its mobile SERPs to cater for the increasing number of natural language queries. Accommodating user needs and incorporating the changes we have discussed above may require radical changes to be made to Google's search algorithms. A mobile-only search index solves the problem.\nThis move could also help Google achieve in helping boost the digital performance of businesses who perform well with their offline marketing efforts. For a while now, Google has used various metrics in their ranking algorithm which can be helped with good offline marketing . For example, your brand being mentioned around the internet and more people searching for you will help your organic performance. Because mobile devices are always with you, if you see something useful on the move, you can search for it instantly.\nHow the Mobile-Only Index Changes SEO in 2017 As said earlier, the flurry of changes have rattled the SEO grounds and presented businesses, marketers and SEOs with new challenges and opportunities. Many websites may see their mobile rankings and traffic slipping, whereas others may be able to work their way up into the top rankings. Let's see how the mobile-only index and other changes impact us and how to deal with them.\nI reached out to Neil Patel for his thoughts on the announcement...\n“Google will eventually create a new set of search results for mobile. The reason being is that the user behaviour for mobile users is different. They don’t have the screen size and bandwidth to go through dozens of results… ideally, they should see one result and the ideal one for them”.\nThe separate mobile index will leave marketers in a bit of a dilemma about whether to optimise for desktop or mobile. Should they have 68-70-char page titles that display on both desktops and mobile, or should they embrace the 78-char mobile titles and take advantage of long-tail and natural language key phrases? The longer titles (and meta descriptions) can prove effective at optimising for long-tail and natural language queries as well as for using your brand name in the titles. Moreover, conversion-focused websites or lead magnets may need to strip their mobile pages of annoying full-page pop-up lead boxes in order to retain their mobile rankings.\nMany small and micro businesses may need to prioritise based on how much of their traffic comes from mobile vs. desktop. But we might see the return of dedicated mobile websites (m.example.com) if businesses want to retain their mobile traffic and SEO ranking.\nThe need to have a dedicated mobile website is also underlined by the AMP update. It is an open source technology that developers and SEOs can leverage to dramatically increase their page speeds, and consequently their mobile SEO ranking and CTR. Hence, separate mobile websites that had been pushed into the oblivion by responsive/adaptive design may become a necessity once again, thanks to Google's mobile-only index and AMP update.\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nIn most company acquisitions, there’s always fears of the new owners mercilessly axing the newly acquired company’s product. That might look like the case with LeapDroid, but it’s different in two significant ways. First, it is only the developers, not LeapDroid itself that has been “acquired” by Google. And second, it is the developers themselves that have decided to ditch LeapDroid. This has the effect of practically killing an Android emulator for PCs that, just a few months ago, boasted to be the fastest in the market. \nThere is no shortage of Android emulators out there, with Bluestacks probably the most popular, so the death of LeapDroid might not have even made a sound if not for the rather bold claim it made last July and why they’re suddenly shutting down. \nWhen LeapDroid landed on the scene, it claimed to be the “most powerful Android game player” on PCs. Its benchmarks showed how it outclassed its peers in games, admittedly the most taxing type of Android apps. Naturally, it didn’t spill the beans on how it accomplished that, only claiming some specialized LeapGL and Virt Fiber I/O techs, but there must have been some truth to it if Google took notice. \nThat said, co-founders Huan Ren and Huihong Luo only said they were joining Google, not exactly that Google tripped over to hire them. Even more curious, LeapDroid itself isn’t part of that newfound relationship with Google. Not only does it remain not part of Google, it has also been officially discontinued, less than four months after its announcement. \nWithout any confirmation, not even “insider information”, we can only read between the lines. Google might have interests in the technology LeapDroid uses, but would conflict with LeapDroid if the emulator were to continue existing separately from Google. As to what Google plans to do with that technology, one can only speculate as well. The emulation technology could be used in many places, including improving Android Studio’s own emulator. Or it could be used to improve how Android apps run on other platforms, like Windows or, better yet, Chrome OS.",

      "title": "Facebook Introduces New Features to Capitalize on Growth in Reviews",
      "text": "If you’re looking for the best sushi burrito in NYC, chances are you’ll head to Google or TripAdvisor for recommendations. Review sites like these are also where your inner food critic will likely speak out after a disappointing visit to the most expensive restaurant in town.\nMeanwhile, you’ll probably go on Facebook for cute baby pics, your friends’ thoughts on the latest Walking Dead episode, or photos of the recent birthday party you threw your BFF last weekend.\nBut times are a-changin’, especially now that Facebook has grown to become much more than just a social network. Apart from serving as a place for liking, sharing, and commenting on others’ updates and goings-on, the platform has also evolved into an option for discovering great brands, products, and services, and for connecting with relevant businesses along the same lines.\nFacebook has also been upping its reviews and recommendations game, finding unique ways to get its users to share customer feedback and introducing a range of new features designed, it seems, to challenge today’s most popular online review sites.\nAnd there's good reason behind that increased focus from the Social Network.\nFacebook posts the highest growth rate in reviews Ever since Facebook allowed users to post online reviews and ratings of local businesses, the volume of reviews on Facebook has steadily increased, with more and people looking to use the social media platform in the same way they use, say, TripAdvisor - as a tool for reading or sharing customer reviews.\nIn fact, according to the 2015 Social Recommendations Index by advocacy activation company Social Media Link, 2 in 3 consumers are more likely to share their thoughts, experiences, and opinions on Facebook after a purchase.\nAnother study found that 80% of consumers were more likely to purchase from local businesses when positive reviews were present on their Facebook Page.\nIt’s little surprise that Facebook has emerged as a top legitimate alternative in the online reviews space. After analyzing reviews of 250 restaurants over a 6-month period, the research team at customer feedback management company ReviewTrackers noticed an interesting trend in review velocity (the speed at which new reviews are generated): among major restaurant review sites - including Google, TripAdvisor, Zomato, and Foursquare - Facebook reflected the highest growth rate in reviews, with new reviews coming in at a pace that was 4X faster than on those other platforms.\nIt’s also worth noting that, unlike other sites and apps that may filter reviews written by less established users, Facebook makes it relatively easy to review and rate a business.\nThe interface is familiar, it’s simple enough from a log-in perspective to get started, and users need only to click the Review button on a business’ Facebook Page to start typing. The review filters, for better or for worse, are also less strict.\nFacebook rolls out new features In response to this rising trend, Facebook has rolled out a range of new options to better facilitate reviews and ratings.\nListings Facebook's Professional Services feature, launched late last year, lists businesses with the best reviews and ratings and helps guide users as they look for new products and services in their geographical area. For businesses, getting listed in Professional Services can be a game-changer, with better reviews (and therefore higher rankings) having the potential to create more meaningful opportunities than a status update or a dozen likes can.\nRecommendations Recently, Facebook also introduced friend-based recommendations , which enables users to turn to their friends and family for information, advice, and feedback on local businesses or services - then organizes all these recommendations in one place.\nAccording to Facebook :\n“When you write a Facebook post looking for advice on local places or services, you’ll have the option to turn on Recommendations for that post. If you turn on the feature, your friends can comment on your post with suggestions, and you’ll see all of them mapped out and saved in one place. You can also go to your Recommendations bookmark on Facebook to ask a new question or help your friends.”\nThe new feature makes a compelling case for choosing Facebook over other popular review sites: would you really rather trust the opinions of anonymous reviewers over that of your friends and family?\nDirect transactions Along with friend-based recommendations, Facebook also introduced a feature that enables direct transactions on its website and app. It enables users to do things like order food, book an appointment, get a Quote: , or buy tickets - all directly through Facebook.\nA result of partnerships with Delivery.com, Slice, Ticketmaster, and Eventbrite, Facebook’s new feature for direct transactions again seems to take aim at other online review sites, which likewise promote business discovery and transactions, but without necessarily factoring in the social component and influence that friends and family have on consumers’ purchase decisions.\nHarnessing the impressive shelf life of online reviews Given the growth in review activity, it makes sense that Facebook has increased focus on this area and is challenging established players in the market. Reviews and ratings play a major role in shaping consumer behavior, and they can make the kind of lasting impact that social media content alone isn't necessarily conducive to.\nIn fact, according to research by Wiselytics, 75% of engagement on a Facebook post occurs within the first 5 hours. Reach is even worse: 75% of the people who get to see a business’ Facebook post will have seen it in the first 2 hours after being posted.\nContrast this with the shelf life of online reviews. According to a report published by Search Engine Land , 69% of consumers believe that reviews older than 3 months are no longer relevant, and approximately 15% believe that the only relevant reviews are the ones written within the last two weeks.\nThese numbers help explain why Facebook is looking to strengthen its online review capacity and incorporating recommendation tools into users’ social media experience.\nThere's far more to the world's largest social media platform than cute baby pics and the Walking Dead memes. The next time you have a craving for the best sushi in NYC, or feel like rating a business, Facebook wants you to head to Facebook.",

      "text": "By Kimberly Powell \nGoogle News Archive offers a wealth of digitized historic newspapers online—many of them for free. The Google newspaper archive project was, unfortunately, discontinued by Google many years ago, but although they stopped digitizing and adding new papers and removed their useful timeline and other search tools, the historical newspapers that were previously digitized remain. \nThe downside is that a simple search of the Google newspaper archive rarely pulls up anything but major headlines due to poor digital scanning and OCR recognition (this was work done many years ago). In addition, Google News has continued to deprecate their newspaper archive service, making it extremely difficult to search for content prior to 1970, although they have hundreds of digitized newspaper titles prior to this date. \nYou can improve your chances of finding great info on your family in Google News Archive with a few simple search strategies... Use Google Web Search, Not Google News \nSearching within Google News (even the advanced search) no longer returns results older than 30 days, so be sure to use web search when searching for older articles. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Packable School Lunches All Kids Love However, Google Web Search doesn’t support custom date ranges earlier than 1970, or content behind a paywall, so researchers continue to lose functionality there as well. That doesn't mean you won't find content prior to 1970 by searching (you will!), you just can't restrict your searches to only that content. Check Out What's Available Before You Waste Your Time Searching \nA full list of the digitized historical newspaper content available on Google can be accessed at http://news.google.com/newspapers . It generally pays to start here to see if your area and time period has coverage, although if you're looking for something interesting or potentially newsworthy (a railroad accident, for example) you may find it also reported in papers from outside the area. Source Restrict \nWhile it is most common to search for individuals in a specific location, Google no longer offers the option to restrict your search to a particular newspaper title. Each newspaper does have a specific newspaper ID (found after \"nid\" in the URL when you select the title from the newspaper list), but the site search restriction to a particular paper (i.e. site:news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC ignores the \"nid\" and returns results from all newspapers). However, you can try using a newspaper title in quotes, or use just a single word from the title of the paper to restrict your search; thus a source restriction for \"Pittsburgh\" or \"Pittsburg\" will turn up results from both the Pittsburgh Press and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Date Restrict \nGoogle News only returns content from the past 30 days. If you want to search older content you can use the Google advanced web search page to restrict your search by date or date range, but what's not obvious is that it will no longer search for custom date ranges older than 1970. However, you can get around this by using Google's site search feature to search only the news archive, and include the year or date of interest as a search term. This isn't precise, as it will include any mention of that date or year and not just papers published on the date you've selected, but it is better than nothing. Example: site:news.google.com/newspapers pittsburg 1898 Use Generic or Period Search Terms Instead of Names \nBrowse through several issues of your newspaper of interest to become familiar with the general layout of the paper and the terms used most often in your sections of interest. For example, if you're looking for an obituary, did they commonly use the term \"obituaries,\" or \"deaths\" or \"death notices,\" etc. to head that section? Sometimes section headers were too fancy to be recognized by the OCR (optical character recognition) process, however, so also look for words frequently found in the general text. Did they most often use the term \"wedding,\"\"wed,\" or \"married,\" when writing about weddings, for example? Then use that search term to look for content. Consider whether your term is appropriate for the time period as well. If you're searching contemporary newspapers for information on World War One you will need to use search terms such as great war , because it wasn't called World War One until after the commencement of World War Two. Browse This Paper \nFor best results when searching digitized historical newspaper content in Google, there really is no way around using the browse feature rather than search. All things considered, it's still better than having to go down to the library to look at microfilm --- especially if the library which holds the newspaper is halfway across the country! Begin with the newspaper list to browse directly to a specific newspaper title in the Google News Archive. Once you select a title of interest, you can easily navigate to a specific date using the arrows or, even faster, by entering the date in the date box (this can be a year, month and year, or a specific date). When you're in the newspaper view, you can get back to the \"browse\" page by selecting the \"Browse this newspaper\" link above the digitized newspaper image. Missing Issue? Not Always.... \nIf Google appears to have newspapers from your month of interest, but is missing a few particular issues here or there, then take time to view all pages of the available issues both before and after your target date. There are many examples of Google running together several newspaper issues and then listing them only under the date of the first or last issue, so you can be browsing an issue for Monday, but end up in the middle of the Wednesday edition by the time you browse all of the available pages. Downloading, Saving & Printing from Google News Archive \nGoogle News Archive does not currently offer a direct way to download, save or print newspaper images. If you want to clip an obituary or other small notice for your personal files, the easiest way to do this is to take a screen shot. Enlarge your browser window with the relevant page/article from Google News Archive so that it fills your entire computer screen. Use the enlarge button in Google News Archive to enlarge the article you want to clip to an easy to read size that fits entirely within your browser window. Hit the \"Print Screen\" or \"Prnt Scrn\" button on your computer keyboard. For help with this, see these How to Capture a Screen Shot tutorials for Windows and Mac OS X . Open your favorite photo editing software and look for the option to open or paste a file from your computer's clipboard. This will open the screenshot taken of your computer browser window. Use the \"crop\" tool to crop the article in which you're interested and then save it as a new file (I usually include the newspaper title and date in the file name). If you're running Windows Vista, 7 or 8, make it easier on yourself and use the Snipping Tool instead! \n\nIf you can't find historical newspapers in Google Newspaper Archive for your area and time period of interest, then Chronicling America is another source for free, digitized historical newspapers from the United States. Several subscription websites and other resources also offer access to online historical newspapers .",

Google posts Election Day reminder doodle 2 days in a row The U.S. 2016 Election Day reminder doodle surfaces Google's voter registration tool that helps searchers find local polling locations. Amy Gesenhues on November 7, 2016 at 8:36 am More \nGoogle continues to do what it can to get the vote out, posting a doodle yesterday and today that serves as a reminder to vote in the U.S. 2016 Elections. \nThe doodle leads to a search for “where do I vote,” surfacing an interactive tool that helps searchers locate polling locations . \nGoogle’s “Where to Vote” tool was originally launched on October 13 when Google rolled out its state-by-state voting guide. In addition to “ where do I vote ” queries, the tool also shows up for similar searches like “ where to vote ” and “ where is my polling place .” \nAfter honoring Walter Cronkite last Friday , Google posted the following “U.S. Elections 2016 Reminder Day 1” doodle on Sunday, two days prior to Election Day on November 8. United States Elections 2016 Reminder Day 1 \nThis slightly modified version of the Elections Day reminder doodle was shared today: United States Elections 2016 Reminder Day 2 \nGoogle reports on its Google Doodle Blog that it plans to share election results in real-time tomorrow: “When the polls close on Election Day on November 8, you’ll also be able to find real-time U.S. election results integrated right into your Google searches in over 30 languages around the world.” About The Author Amy Gesenhues Amy Gesenhues is Third Door Media's General Assignment Reporter, covering the latest news and updates for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

There are three easy ways to find this information through Google. You can either visit Google.com and click a button on the bottom right corner, or click on the day's Google Doodle, which will also lead you to the same result. View photos More (Google) You can also type this question into a Google search bar: \"Where do I vote in the 2016 United States election #Everyonein2016.\" Doing any one of these three things will pull up a box that lets you enter your street address in order to find your polling location. View photos More (Google) Once you type it in, Google will pull up the polling place in your neighborhood, complete with a map to that address, the hours of operation, and a helpful reminder that Tuesday is Election Day.

      "text": "Joe Fedewa Nov 7th, 2016 \nA couple of weeks ago, Google showed off a new Play Store UI in a support video for the Pixel . Now, users are reporting that the new UI is slowly rolling out to devices. This update includes new colors and a revamped install page. \nThe first change you’ll notice is on the home page of the Play Store. A new shade of green has taken over for the Android-y shade we’re used to seeing. The big featured carousel across the top has been shrunk down and moved underneath the “Apps & Games” bar. However, some screenshots show the carousel has been removed completely. \nMoving on to the install page, the “Install” button is much bigger. The ratings and installs information looks completely different. They’ve removed the category icons, which makes it easier to read. The “More Information” section has been moved lower on the page, and developer info has been slightly reworded. \nAll in all, these are simple changes that make the Play Store a little easier to use. What do you think of the update? Have you seen it on your device yet?",

      "title": "Samsung’s Galaxy S8 to Reportedly Feature an AI Assistant",
      "text": "Similar to how Google Assistant is a selling point for the Pixel and Pixel XL right now, a new report suggests that Samsung will do the same with the Galaxy S8 and its own personal assistant technology. This report comes a month after it was revealed that Samsung would be acquiring Viv Labs , the same company that helped build Apple’s personal assistant feature, Siri. Now, The Wall Street Journal cites “people familiar with the matter” who tell them that Samsung wants in on the personal assistant market too.\nBecause of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle , Samsung will allocated more time and more resources to the development of the Galaxy S8 than normal. The company will need the Galaxy S8 to impress smartphone consumers as well since they need to win back some of the the trust they lost from the Galaxy Note 7 fires. Samsung says that the “majority” of those who returned the Galaxy Note 7 have chosen to stick with a Samsung device anyway, but some will be cautious until that trust is gained back.\nSources close to The Wall Street Journal are telling them that the company has created prototypes that have a dedicated AI assistant button. The button is said to be on the side of the phone, and it will launch the personal AI assistant when pressed. It’s unclear if this dedicated button will make it into the final product, though. These types of experimental designs happen all the time before the release of a product. So we’ll have to wait and see if the button makes it in the finished product or not.\nThe report also says Samsung could delay the announcement of the Galaxy S8 as late as April. The company has a history of announcing their new Galaxy S smartphone at Mobile World Congress, but they also need to make sure the product is safe and is impressive enough to grab people’s attention.\nSource: The Wall Street Journal \n",

      "text": "Reddit Google today released an updated Gmail app for iPhone and iPad that introduces a redesigned user interface alongside a few features from Gmail on the web that it says were highly requested. The new design is notably similar to the Gmail app available on Android devices. Among the new features, the updated Gmail app now brings over the “Undo Send” feature from Gmail on the web, which delays sending emails for a set number of seconds to allow users the option to “undo sending” after tapping send. The Undo Send feature on the web can be set to a 5, 10, 20 or 30 second delay, but it appears to be using a set 5 seconds for the mobile app. Also new for the refreshed app is improved search functionality that includes instant results and spelling suggestions, and Google notes the ability to easily Swipe to archive or delete depending on your preference. The design of the updated app makes the iPhone and iPad versions fit in with Google’s design for Gmail on Android devices, and overall feels much faster than the previous version. The new Gmail app for iOS , version 5.0.3, is available on the App Store now. What’s New in Version 5.0.3 The Gmail you know and love, now with a fresh new look, sleeker transitions and some highly-requested features. It’s a lot faster, too. – Undo Send: prevent embarrassing mistakes – Search: find things faster with instant results and spelling suggestions – Swipe to archive/delete: quickly clear out your inbox Guides",

      "text": "Google quietly shutters standalone Google Showtimes movie site Posted Tesla to charge new owners for Supercharger use after around 1K miles \nIt looks like the last picture show for one of Google’s efforts at expanding into more detailed vertical search pages. Without much notice, the search giant has closed down its standalone movie site where people were able to search for cinemas, films and show times on a particular date and near a specific location, rolling some of the functionality directly into its main search portal. “Google Showtimes”, as the service was called, now brings up a 404 error if you try to visit its main page. \nThe “about” description, however, linked above, provides the following message: \n“Google Showtimes was discontinued on 1 November 2016. You can now discover show times on the search results page by searching for the name of the movie that you want to see or try searching for the word ‘movies’ to discover what’s in cinemas.” \nA spokesperson declined to comment further about the closure and whether it was part of one of Google’s recurring spring cleaning (or autumn cleaning, as the case may be) service closures. \nIt’s not clear why Google decided to shut the separate portal but there are some signs that Google Showtimes what not much of a blockbuster for the company, and perhaps even ran counter to how Google sees some of its bigger developments in search and media. \nGoogle’s movie portal looks like it first went live in some form in the autumn of 2005 , and as you can see from a screenshot from October 2016 below, it never updated much beyond its interface based around Google’s original, very simple, pared-down aesthetics in its original search experience. \nThis was actually a good thing, it seems, as groups of (now former) users on Google’s product forums , Reddit , and elsewhere who are complaining about the closure note the contrast with competing services from the likes of Fandango and Movietickets — which, may look more snappy but are less useful for finding cinemas and films based on specific locations and times that might not be exactly where you are at that precise moment. \nThose users now appear ready to throw their popcorn at Google for retiring Google Showtimes and funnelling some of the features into Google.com, which presents basic results like this when I search for a theater or film here in the UK at Google.com: \nIt looks like Google didn’t do much in the way of selling ads against Showtimes, meaning that the traffic that was resulting from it, such as it was, didn’t necessarily convert to revenue for the company. \nGoogle Showtimes somewhat went against bigger trends in the film industry, which is bracing itself for another tough year where cinemas are concerned. Box office ticket sales for 2016 are on track to be the worst in a century, according to Vanity Fair . \nGoogle Showtimes also stood separate from the wider industry trend for streaming and Google’s own ambitions to become a platform for distributing and consuming video, coming as it did a full year before the acquisition of YouTube (and many years before services like Android TV ). \nInstead, Google Showtimes appeared to germinate more from the company’s strategy to expand into more vertical search categories, providing landing places for people who are going to the web to look for specific information and choosing specific portals to get there, rather than Google’s catch-all Google.com, a trend that has grown with the rise of smartphone use, where people want less steps between looking for something and arriving at an answer. \nThat effort has resulted in the building of an extensive mapping product, Google Maps , but also portals like Google Flights for plane ticket searches and Google Finance for financial news and data. It may be that while Google is still working on new search experiences beyond Google.com, they are more likely to be based around other vertical definitions (like mobile, location, and so on) than Google might have originally conceived. \nIndeed, Google Showtimes is not the first vertical portal that Google has shut down. Google’s hotel finder now lives within another maps rather than as a separate site. Featured Image: Kenneth Lu / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE 0 ",

      "text": "PetSmart takes on Amazon with launch of same-day delivery and subscriptions Posted Google quietly shutters standalone Google Showtimes movie site \nWith more online shoppers turning to sites like Amazon, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have had to step up their competition on the e-commerce front – including by offering faster deliveries – or risk losing customers. The latest to join the fight is PetSmart , which today is rolling out a redesigned, mobile-friendly website offering same-day, scheduled deliveries and subscriptions, among other new features. \nThe changes are designed to make it easier to order the sort of regular pet staples that shoppers need, like food, over-the-counter medicines, grooming supplies, litter and bedding, toys, treats, and more. \nLike Amazon, PetSmart shoppers can opt to subscribe to frequent orders through a new “auto-ship” option that lets you choose to have items delivered on a schedule you prefer – anywhere from between 2 to 8 weeks – in exchange for a 5 percent discount, along with free shipping. \nThe new shipping options are powered last-mile logistics provider, Deliv . With Deliv’s service integrated into PetSmart’s checkout flow, customers can choose same-day delivery in the 17 markets (2,500 zip codes) where Deliv operates. \nAt launch, same-day is available in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco, San Jose, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Miami, Seattle and Chicago. By mid-November, it will arrive Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, Yonkers, Northern New Jersey and Washington D.C. \nIn addition, Deliv’s integration means customers can choose to customize their delivery schedules. Delivery can be set within a few hours of purchase, up to two days later, through the new feature, says PetSmart. And all this takes place on a new, one-page checkout screen, meant to boost conversations and cut down on cart abandonment rates. \nAlong with the changes, the PetSmart.com website, powered by SalesForce Commerce Cloud, has been completely overhauled. The design has been optimized for mobile devices, like phones and tablets, and the shopping cart will be mirrored between desktop and mobile. \nA native mobile application is also expected to launch in a matter of weeks. \nThe ship-to-store option has been improved, too, as PetSmart’s site will show in-store product availability. Plus, when items aren’t available in-store, the company is offering the option to ship to customers’ homes for free. \nPet grooming and boarding services can also now be booked online, via the new site. And customers can opt to receive text message about deals, through an opt-in SMS service. \nOverall, the upgraded site is a major move from PetSmart, which today operates 1,477 pet stores across the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, along with its digital brands, PetSmart.com, PetFoodDirect.com, Pet360.com and petMD.com. \nAcquired in 2015 by a consortium led by BC Partners for $8.7 billion, PetSmart has since increased profits and sales, and expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint. But ignoring the online threat is not an option for the retailer. \n“Our omnichannel strategy is aimed at giving pet parents options tailored to their needs and desires,” said Eran Cohen, PetSmart’s “chief customer experience officer,” in a statement about the launch. “We look forward to seeing their response to the new site with its new user experience and commerce-meets-content approach, as well as to our expanded and convenient home delivery options, which capitalize on our extensive store network for same-day and scheduled delivery,” he added. \nThis isn’t the first time PetSmart has experimented with more modern delivery options. Before today, PetSmart has been participating in Google’s same-day delivery service, Google Express, which recently expanded across the U.S. \nFor Deliv, meanwhile, PetSmart is another big win for the delivery provider, who has previously done deals with Best Buy , Walgreens , Macy’s, and even Walmart, in select test markets , among others.",

      "text": "Reddit Google today released an updated Gmail app for iPhone and iPad that introduces a redesigned user interface alongside a few features from Gmail on the web that it says were highly requested. The new design is notably similar to the Gmail app available on Android devices. Among the new features, the updated Gmail app now brings over the “Undo Send” feature from Gmail on the web, which delays sending emails for a set number of seconds to allow users the option to “undo sending” after tapping send. The Undo Send feature on the web can be set to a 5, 10, 20 or 30 second delay, but it appears to be using a set 5 seconds for the mobile app. Also new for the refreshed app is improved search functionality that includes instant results and spelling suggestions, and Google notes the ability to easily Swipe to archive or delete depending on your preference (which is now a single action rather than a swipe revealing a button). The design of the updated app makes the iPhone and iPad versions fit in with Google’s design for Gmail on Android devices, and overall feels much faster than the previous version. Here’s a look at the iPad version: The new Gmail app for iOS , version 5.0.3, is available on the App Store now. What’s New in Version 5.0.3 The Gmail you know and love, now with a fresh new look, sleeker transitions and some highly-requested features. It’s a lot faster, too. – Undo Send: prevent embarrassing mistakes – Search: find things faster with instant results and spelling suggestions – Swipe to archive/delete: quickly clear out your inbox Guides",

      "text": "News \nGoogle announced it would be making Android Auto available directly on your phone's screen a while back, but it didn't offer any time frame. It was starting to look like it was never happening, but lo and behold, Android Auto on phones is now rolling out. It's part of the Android Auto v2.0 app, and we've got the APK ready for you. \nWhen you launch Android Auto 2.0 on your phone, it takes over the full display to show a more friendly driving mode. You get big cards and buttons, similar to the ones present on Android Auto-enabled cars. There are also navigation, media, and phone screens in Android Auto. This update also adds the ability to automatically launch Android Auto when a certain Bluetooth device connects. So, if you've got Bluetooth in your car but no Android Auto, AA can launch on your phone as soon as you get in the car. \nThe on-phone Android Auto functionality does still require that you're in a country that supports Android Auto. Here's the current list. Argentina",

Google is rolling out an update to the official Android Auto app that will allow its vehicle-based UI to run on any Android phone with Lollipop installed or higher. The company first announced its plans to offer this update back in May during its Google I/O developer conference .\nSee also: Android Auto: everything you need to know August 3, 2016 In a blog post, Google stated this update was made for anyone who either mounts their smartphone on their car’s dashboard, or connects the phone to a dashboard display. It will allow those car owners to access the driver-friendly interface of Android Auto. The three main features of the app are hands-free phone calls and messages with voice commands, access to turn-by-turn directions with Google Maps, and the ability to stream music with apps like Spotify, Pandora, and of course Google Play Music. While it’s not part of this new update, Google says they plan to offer improvements to the Android Auto app in the coming weeks that will allow users to access features like maps, music and messaging by saying, “Ok Google.”\nThe app itself will be able to start automatically when it is paired with a Bluetooth device. For people who mount their smartphone on their dashboard, Google recommends that they use a Bluetooth-enabled car mount such as Logitech’s SmartCar. The new app will be available in the 30 countries where Android Auto is currently supported.\nIf you own a car and a smartphone, would you consider using the new Android Auto app while you are driving?\nGet it at Google Play ",

      "text": "Google brings Android Auto to the phone Posted Signal app-maker rebuts criticism of dev direction by calling for more community help \nEarlier this year, Google announced its plans to bring Android Auto , its phone-centric in-car infotainment platform, “to every car” by launching it as a stand-alone Android app, too. It’s taken a while, but the company today launched an update to the Android Auto app for — well — Android that makes good on this promise. Even if your car isn’t Android Auto compatible, you can now get all the benefits of Android Auto without the cost of a new mid-size sedan. \nSo what’s the point of that? Android Auto on the phone provides you with a simplified interface that combines directions, music, and incoming messages into a relatively distraction free experience. That’s essentially the same interface you would see on an in-car display with Android Auto support. Android Auto works with popular apps like Spotify, Pandora, Google Maps and others. \nLike all things Google, the app will also soon let you use “Ok Google” commands to use directions, send messages and control your music. \nOne smart thing Google has done here is given users the ability to automatically start the app when the phone is paired with your car’s Bluetooth network. \nThe Android Auto app is compatible with any phone that runs Android 5.0 and newer. Google says the update will roll out to users in more than 30 countries over the course of the next few days, so if you don’t see it yet, don’t despair and buy an Audi A6 just so you don’t feel left out. 0",

      "text": "\n\"Sorry, I don't know how to help with that. But my team is helping me learn.\"\nI've heard that phrase, or some variant of it, 47 times since I took Google Home out of the box. Google's answer to everything Home can't do right now is a reminder that this system is designed to constantly improve, and for techy nerds like me that's a comfort. My greatest personal hypocrisy is telling people not to buy gadgets that promise to get better with age and then turning around and doing it myself, and Google Home is no different.\nI knew Home wasn't going to deliver the experience I wanted based on the experiences had with the demo Google gave at the Pixel launch event, but over the last 72 hours I've gained some much needed perspective on where Google Home is now and where it needs to be before I recommend it.\n\"Hey Google...\" \nLets get this out of the way early: \"OK Google\" is not fun to say 50 times a day. It just isn't. Google snuck in \"Hey Google\" as an alternative on Home, which didn't work out of the box for me. When I tried toward the end of Day Two, it started working for me. \"Hey Google\" is a little better, but not as convenient as Alexa or Cortana. Being able to set your own hot word would be amazing, and something I've been saying about Google's voice services for years now. I don't think it's happening anytime soon, but it's nice to think about.\nI would pay many additional dollars to Disney Marvel to license \"Jarvis\" as the wake word and audio response for Google Home.\n— Russell Holly (@russellholly) November 6, 2016 Lets get this out of the way early: \"OK Google\" is not fun to say 50 times a day.\nHaving been an Amazon Echo user from the day I was able to purchase one — after waiting ages on a list that gave me Google Glass flashbacks — I've known for a long time that all Google really needed to do for me to want their alternative product was make Google's services available to me. Google Home delivers a minimum form of that, with Play Music, Podcasts, and Google Keep all available with my voice. These are all things I use, and not having access to them on Echo has always been a pain point. But as nice as having access to these apps are, the functionality is incredibly limited. I can't ask Home what podcasts I have available to listen to, Google Keep integration is currently only for the shopping list Home created for me, and accessing my playlists on Play Music is spotty at best.\nSome of this matters less when you can use Google Home as a Cast target, or when you can use Home to control the other Google Cast targets in your house. When that works, which is most of the time, it's cool as hell. For video, it only really works with YouTube right now, which is less incredible. I rarely know the exact name of the video I'm going to watch on YouTube, and go hunting for random videos with even lower frequency. It's nice to ask for the latest from Minute Physics, but it's clear I'm going to appreciate the feature a lot more when Play Movies, Netflix, and more have adopted voice support.\nMeet the Family \nGoogle Home is exactly the same as Amazon Echo to my family, by which I mean they have no interest in using it because their stuff isn't available to them with the same ease my information is available to me. I'm the only one who can ask for a calendar recap. News briefs only come from my input. Traffic conditions are based on my drive routes. Multiple account support isn't easy, but it's the only way this speaker gets used by anyone other than me most of the time, and that's not great.\nI look forward to seeing Google's Home team sprint on support.\nMy kids are big fans of being able to cast APHMAU to the television with their voices, and love being able to add toilet paper to my grocery list 45 times, but that's about it. My oldest wanted to know why she couldn't just say \"OK Google, turn out my lights\" and have Home recognize her voice and associate that voice with her name on the Hue bulbs in her room. When I finished laughing at what a terribly perfect First World Problem that was, it became clear voice distinction was the thing that was going to draw people in. That may never happen with this version of the hardware, but it's the next step I think.\nThere's also a fun sensitivity \"issue\" with Google Home right now. Any commercial for Google's products right now activates the hot word on the Home in my living room, which immediately results in a laughter from the family. It's a great demonstration of not really thinking about your existing audience while selling to the next person, and something that happens way less on Amazon Echo when Alexa is called out in commercials on TV shows. If Amazon can figure out how to keep my Echo from responding to a sleep deprived FBI agent in Mr. Robot, surely Google can do the same in their ads.\nIt'll probably improve quickly \nGoogle needed massive human trials to figure out what to prioritize and how to implement new features, which is why Google Home was released in its current form. That's fine for early adopters, but Amazon's Echo in the early days that makes this something I'm unlikely to recommend to much of anyone for a while. It's not finished, and the gymnastics people are going through in order to shoehorn Home into their personal workflow already is kinda nuts. Some folks are buying one Google Home for each household member and setting up individual accounts on each, while others are considering a Google account for the household on a Family Plan so everyone has even access and no one can mess with personal accounts in the house. While kind of clever, it's also not something I'm even going to tell people to do just so they can kind of enjoy this speaker a little more.\nGoogle Home is a big beta, and I'm tired of it.\nI look forward to seeing Google's Home team sprint on support, because the things Home does right now it does fairly well. I can use more natural language when controlling my smart home tech, the speaker quality is nicer than Echo, and what Google services I have access to right now I mostly enjoy. The next step is the hard one, and I'm going to sit here and watch as this little speaker learns some new tricks before telling people to add one to their lives.\nGoogle Home Google Home review These services work with Google Home Google Home vs. Amazon Echo Join our Google Home forums!

      "text": "Tailor Brands raises $4M to have robots design logos for you Posted Google will   \nFor the most part, apps like Prisma depend on curated training sets to impersonate style and apply it to a new context. While this may signal that machine creativity is dead on arrival, we shouldn’t forget that even Picasso needed to attend a showing of African masks before he could push cubism into the popular lexicon. \nYali Saar, CEO of Tailor Brands , believes much the same about his quest to automate the full-service branding agency. With a new $4 million Series A from Mangrove Capital Partners and Disruptive Technologies , he believes machines can design logos, promotional products, and even social media campaigns. \nBack in 2014, when Saar launched his company on the stage of TechCrunch Disrupt , Tailor Brands was considerably more amateur. Today the system is more useable than ever, though not without its faults. \nAbove are two designs the system sent my way after I provided a name “Entwine” and a fictitious backstory about a tech startup connecting researchers with companies to facilitate tech transfer. I opted for that description because it felt like enough of an edge case to throw off a system that gets regular requests to create logos for coffee shops. Not every “human-made” logo works as intended. \nAfter answering some high-level questions about my design preferences, Tailor sent me a set of logos. Perhaps I’m hallucinating, but the former definitely looks influenced by the periodic table of elements (research), and the later is certainly “entwined” together. Unfortunately, that one is so bunched up that it’s difficult to read from afar. To be fair though, humans have charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to create far worse. \n“Every logo is a formula of type face, structure, color, etc,” explained Saar. \nThe branding industry is full of best practices. Companies in similar industries often use the same font to immediately connect with customers. However, sometimes the best design comes from mistakes. To get there, Saar is trying to speed up the process by building a highly interdisciplinary team of engineers and designers. Everyone at the company is required to learn about the intersections of design and machine learning, which is helpful when tinkering with the product at all levels. \nMoving forward, Saar sees great potential in the data collected by Tailor Brands. Because users create a new design every 1.5 seconds, it’s easy to quickly pick out macro trends in design and branding strategy that even big firms don’t have access to. \nFor the user, Tailor Brands charges between $24 and $99. The final amount depends on whether you want just a logo or a full package of marketing materials. The company also offers a subscription plan for $9.99 per month. 0",

The updated app also includes a few new features.\nFirst, an Undo Send button is now available, which gives users a chance to “undo” sending an email immediately after it has been sent.\n\nIn addition, Google said the app’s search feature has been improved to allow users to find content faster. Specifically, the search bar will now present users with instant results and spelling suggestions as they type.\nFinally, users can swipe on messages in their inboxes to quickly archive or delete them, depending on their preference.\nThe Gmail app is available to download for free on the iTunes App Store .",

      "text": "Google made a promise of providing monthly security updates, and so far, the company has kept its word. If you have a supported device, be it Nexus or Pixel, you will receive the latest in terms of security patches against exploits and vulnerabilities, and it remains in the best interest of the end user to be on the latest security patch.\nSo if you own a supported device and are itching to flash something new, the November 2016 Security Update is rolling out. The complete security update up to 5th November 2016 contains fixes/patches for 14 vulnerabilities marked critical, 23 marked as high severity and 10 marked as moderate severity in total as it also includes the partial patch up to 1st November 2016. Another supplemental patch dated 6th November 2016 is also included, which patches an additional critical vulnerability.\nTo get on this update, you can either make use of the factory images or the OTA update zips . If you are interested, the complete security bulletin for the month of November can be found here .\nInteresting things to note on the update: the Pixel and the Pixel XL have builds labelled NDE63U/V/X for November, which seems to be in linear progression from the previous builds labelled NDE63H/L/P for October. The Pixel C, Nexus 5X, the Nexus Player, the Nexus 9 WiFi and Nexus 9 LTE get (individual) builds labelled NRD91N, while the Nexus 6P gets build labelled NBD91K. Surprisingly, the Nexus 6 gets a total of three builds, with two of those builds (MMB31C & MOB31K) being on 6.0.1 Marshmallow as the base, and the other (NBD91P) being on 7.0 Nougat.\nHave you flashed the security update? Let us know in the comments below! \n",

      "text": "\nUsually, Google updates its Android Developers site with the latest distribution numbers of all versions of the OS every month. However, for some reason, the latest such update was posted nearly two months ago on Sept. 13. Today, the Android distribution stats were finally refreshed, and they gave us the first official numbers on the latest version, Android 7.0 Nougat .\nSee also: How Android updates will change with Nougat September 16, 2016 As you might expect, Google’s numbers show that Nougat is only on 0.3 percent of all Android smartphones. Only a few phones have it installed out of the box, but more will be coming soon and updates for many current smartphones to get the new version are already in the works.\nThe new Android distribution states show Marshmallow has 24 percent of the total install base, a big boost compared to 18.7 percent in September. Lollipop (Android 5.0/5.1) clocks in with a total of 34.1 percent, down from 35 percent compared to two months ago. KitKat (Android 4.4) is shown with a 25.2 percent install share, down from 27.7 percent in September. Jelly Bean (Android 4.1-4.3) claims 13.7 percent this month, down from 15.6 percent.\nThe Ice Cream Sandwich and Gingerbread versions of Android are still hanging on with 1.3 percent for each in the new numbers, down from 1.4 percent for Ice Cream Sandwich and 1.5 percent for Gingerbread from September’s numbers. Froyo is about to disappear with 0.1 percent, the same numbers as it had in September. You can get more more details, including the latest info on display screen size percentages, at the Android Developers site .",

Android Lollipop accounts for more than 34% of devices and Android KitKat is hanging in there at just above 25%. \nIt will be interesting to see how fast adoption rates are for Nougat, as KitKat was released more than two years ago and yet it still commands more than 25% of market share for devices.",

      "text": "Google and Mozilla Remove Extension That Was Caught Selling User Data Google and Mozilla Remove Extension That Was Caught Selling User Data By 0 \nAn investigation by German public broadcaster NDR revealed that MyWOT (WOT, or Web Of Trust) has been selling user data to third-parties without properly anonymizing user information, which in some cases exposed the user's real identity and details about his browsing habits. \nFollowing NDR's findings , both Google and Mozilla have removed the extension from their add-on portals. WOT selling poorly anonymized user data \nAccording to the German broadcaster, its reporters were able to get access to a sample that contained ten billion URLs WOT users had accessed. \nWhile WOT claimed it scrambled data to hide the user's identity, reporters said it was easy to identify clues in the URLs that connected the link with a username, email address, or name. \nReporters discovered information about police investigations, a judge's sexual preferences, and user searches for drugs, prostitutes, and medical issues. \nWOT claims on its websites that over 140 million users had downloaded and installed the app during its 10+ years history. Ironically, the extension's purpose is to provide information on the reputation of websites that users are trying to access, if they're safe for kids, contain spam, are trustworthy, or don't respect user privacy. \nWOT's Privacy Policy states that its extensions will capture data such as: Your Internet Protocol Address; Your geographic location (e.g., France, Canada, etc.); The type of device, operating system and browsers you use; Date and time stamp; Browsing usage, including visited web pages, clickstream data or web address accessed; Browser identifier and user ID; \nFurther down the Privacy Policy page, WOT states that \"we will capture anonymized click stream data, your browsing usage, domains you browse, all as detailed above.\" \nThe NDR report aired on November 1, 2016, and provided evidence that not only WOT failed to properly anonymize the data, but it was also selling it to interested third-parties. The WOT Privacy Policy stated that WOT may \"share\" user data with its parent company and partners, but did not mention anything about \"selling.\" \nOn November 2, WOT put out the following statement on its forum. \nDear users, We take our users’ privacy rights very seriously, and for that reason we go to great lengths to anonymize and aggregate the data we collect to run our service, and we of course never license or disclose user registration information. If there have been instances where any information was not adequately anonymized and protected, we will of course look into it and, where necessary, take measures to ensure adequate protection for our users. We appreciate the users who have contacted us and brought this to our attention. We will continue to proudly protect our users from countless online threats as we have for the past decade. \nAfter the story had started to gain attention in the international press, both Google and Mozilla removed the WOT Chrome and Firefox extensions from their stores on Saturday, November 5. \nThe reason why Google and Mozilla removed the extensions is because of lack of transparency between the extension's actions and its Privacy Policy. There are countless of extensions that collect and sell user data on the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-on Portal, so when WOT updates its policy, it's very likely that the extension will be allowed back in. It will then be up to users if they'll continue to use it, knowing of its true actions following NDR's exposé.",

      "text": " Google+\nDANIEL HERTZBERG FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs November 07, 2016\nPart of a weekly series on the economic choices facing the United States and its relations with the rest of the world. For previous entries, click here .\nPRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY inspired Americans to great undertakings by setting bold goals: to go the moon, to overcome racial discrimination, to make peace with the Soviet Union. “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth,” JFK told a joint session of Congress 55 years ago, and his words still stir us today. Similarly, he called on Americans to sign a Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union, declaring that “our attitude [toward peace] is as essential as theirs.”\nOur generation’s needs are different, but the spirit of setting great goals and devoting the resources to achieve them can move America and the world once again.\nAdvertisement\nOur generation’s greatest challenge is sustainable development, meaning a nation that is prosperous, fair, and environmentally sustainable. Our nation’s goals should be the Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030. The US government signed those goals with the other 192 United Nations member states on Sept. 25, 2015, but our government, as well as the presidential candidates, has so far neglected them. The United States should enthusiastically embrace the SDGs as if our future depends on them. It does.\nSustainable development is more than a checklist of policies. It is a coherent idea that holds firmly that economic growth can and should be fair, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. It calls for a society very different from the one we have today, where the elites run the show and the rest are compelled to scramble to make do the best they can.\nGet Todays Headlines The Sustainable Development Goals were negotiated by the world’s governments over a three-year period, starting in 2012, and were adopted unanimously in 2015. That already tells us something, given that the world’s nations usually agree on very little. They agreed on the SDGs out of the conviction that all parts of the world share the same grim reality of massive environmental threats and that most are also reeling from rising inequalities and political instability brought on by rapid technological changes, globalization, pervasive tax evasion, widespread corruption, and unethical activities in many multinational corporations. These countries also adopted the Paris Climate Agreement, out of the same sense of shared fate if the world fails to act to stop global warming.\nYet more than fear spurred both the SDGs and the Paris agreements. These global agreements were also underpinned by hope, specifically by the sense that the current technological revolution offers a way forward that can end extreme poverty, promote economic development, and protect the environment at the same time.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals follow a second precept of JFK: that goal-setting, and the practical work toward those goals, can be an inspiration and motivation to the public. As he was pursuing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, Kennedy laid out a sequence of steps that included the treaty and other supportive measures. Kennedy explained the logic of his approach this way: “By defining our goal [for peace] more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we help all people to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it.”\nAdvertisement\nKennedy also never shied away from the hard truths about his initiatives. Of the moon project he noted that: “none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.” Of the nuclear treaty he noted that: “This treaty is not the millennium. It will not resolve all conflicts . . . but it is an important first step — a step towards peace — a step towards reason — a step away from war.”\nFor many years, the United States has not set clear and compelling goals for fixing the economy, ending climate change, or addressing inequality. Of course, President Obama has launched various initiatives, but these have been incremental and, typically, without clear end points in mind. Many of us feel deflated by this dispiriting presidential campaign and the widespread belief that America’s greatest days are behind it. America needs and can achieve great goals in the years ahead.\nWHAT THEN DO the 17 Sustainable Development Goals mean for the United States? They are a unique opportunity to embrace the deep change our nation desperately needs. They are an opportunity to point to the mountain summit and decide how we are going to get there. As Kennedy said of the moon shot, “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.”\nEarly in 2017, with a new president and Congress, our nation should collectively adopt American Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. I illustrate 17 specific bold goals that we might embrace in the accompanying chart, and summarize several of them:\n■ The United States has the highest poverty rate of any advanced economy, standing at 17 percent, according to the International Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development definition of the poverty line (household income at less than half of the median income). By contrast, Denmark has the lowest, at 6 percent. America should pledge measures to reduce the poverty rate to 8.5 percent or below by 2030, cutting the poverty rate by at least half.\n■ The United States has the highest obesity rate of any advanced economy, standing at 36 percent, compared with the lowest rate, in Japan, of just 3 percent. America should pledge public health actions to aim to reduce the obesity rate to below 10 percent by 2030.\n■ The United States lags the life expectancy of the world’s leading nations by at least 4 years, 79.3 in the United States compared with 83.7 in Japan. The United States should pledge that life expectancy will reach at least 85 years by 2030 (compared with a projected 86 years in Japan).\nThe spirit of setting great goals and devoting the resources to achieve them can move America and the world once again.\n■ The United States has student debt of $1.2 trillion because of a flawed system of financing of higher education. Many other countries, with comparable university enrollment rates, have no student debt. America should pledge to cut student debt to below $200 billion by 2030 while raising college completion rates from 33 percent to at least 50 percent of 25-to-29-year-olds.\n■ As the most unequal of all of the high-income OECD countries, the United States should pledge to undertake a range of policies, including taxes and transfers, health care, education, and corporate reforms, to narrow income inequalities decisively. In line with SDG 10, the United States would aim for a decline in the Gini coefficient on disposable income from the current rate of 0.41 to 0.30 or below as of 2030.\n■ The United States is one the highest emitters of dangerous greenhouse gases, with annual CO2 emissions per American at 16 tons, roughly three times the world average. By shifting rapidly to low-carbon energy, the United States should pledge to cut 2030 per capita emissions to below 8 tons, based on a long-term pathway for reaching net zero emissions in the second half of the century, as called for in the Paris climate agreement.\n■ The United States has the highest rate of prison population of any advanced economy, with 716 inmates per 100,000 people, compared with a range of just 65 to 75 per 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries. America has cruelly locked up a generation of young African-Americans, turning petty crimes (and sometimes no crimes at all) into wrecked lives for a generation. The United States should urgently reform its penal code to cut the prison population decisively and help young minority men gain skills and jobs for productive lives. America should aim to reduce the prison population to no more than 100 per 100,000 by 2030 while continuing to reduce the rate of violent crime.\n■ Among the high-income countries, the US government offers the lowest share of development assistance to the world’s poor nations, just 0.17 percent of GDP compared with the global target of 0.70 percent of GDP. Our foreign policy is over-militarized, thereby undermining our long-term national security. The United States should raise its development aid to the global target by 2030, by shifting around 10 percent of current military-related outlays. The increased aid should be targeted at education, health, and infrastructure in today’s poor and unstable countries.\nTHE POINT IS is that the United States urgently needs to achieve such targets to remain among the world’s better performers. None of the goals outlined are utopian or out of reach. Indeed, in every case, there would still be countries outperforming the United States on the particular dimensions of sustainable development.\nThis kind of bold goal-setting is familiar from America’s own past, which once inspired the world. Yet in American politics today, we feel out of shape, a kind of policy “ill health” not unlike our widespread physical ill health. The United States lacks the kind of strategic agencies and planning ministries that in other high-income countries help to set national goals and chart pathways to success. In Sweden, for example, the coordinating responsibilities for the SDGs have been placed within the Ministry of Public Administration, which works with the Riksdag (parliament) and local governments to implement the nationwide SDG strategy.\nTo achieve the SDG targets for 2030, we need, most of all, long-term thinking and strategic plans of action that show how key stakeholders — including governments at all levels, civil society, academia, and business — can contribute to the goals. By “defining our goal more clearly,” in JFK’s terms, we can mobilize the long-term public support to put them into operation. But we must recognize that, with more than two decades of little public planning, we are rusty, to say the least. Here then are three tips for the new administration:\nFirst, the United States has more world-class expertise in its universities, businesses, think tanks, and foundations than just about any other country in the world. Call on them to contribute. Roadmaps to 2030 and beyond cannot be set by the White House, Congress, or lobbyists, and not in some artificial “first 100 days” of the next administration. Long-term strategies should be the result of a nationwide deliberation that engages top thinkers and doers throughout the country.\nSecond, the president has at the administration’s disposal the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, just down the block from the White House. These three world-leading institutions should be tasked with mobilizing the nation’s best minds to find practical pathways to the 2030 goals. They, together with the great foundations in this country — Gates, Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur, and others — can in turn tap the innovators, engineers, entrepreneurs, and social activists to mobilize for the 2030 SDGs.\nThird, to an extent unmatched anywhere else in the world, the United States has a depth of knowledge, competence, and eagerness to contribute among its roughly 4,000 colleges and universities. Every congressman’s district has one or more high-quality science departments to explain to the congressman that climate change is real, serious, and solvable. Every district has a university faculty that can help to identify local solutions to promote the 2030 goals.\nIn short, for a country with the wealth of knowledge, technology, and skills of the United States, we don’t need to settle for a rank of 22nd out of 34 OECD countries in sustainable development. By setting ambitious Sustainable Development Goals, and by engaging thought leaders across the country, the United States could once again set the standard for policy boldness and innovation, and inspire other nations, even today’s adversaries, to work together for a better world.\nJeffrey D.

      "text": " Google+\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\nFatal opioid overdoses continue to surge in Massachusetts.\nBy Felice J. Freyer Globe Staff November 07, 2016\nFatal opioid overdoses continue to surge in Massachusetts, as an influx of illegal fentanyl outpaces the decline in the use of heroin and prescription drugs, according to the state’s latest data.\nThe quarterly report on overdoses from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, released Monday, shows the same deadly trends that have alarmed policy makers for several years persisted during July through September.\nAdvertisement\nThe state has confirmed 1,005 opioid overdose deaths in the first nine months of this year, with an estimated 392 to 470 suspected cases that may be added later. Nearly 1,200 confirmed overdose deaths occurred in the first nine months of 2015.\nThe state also updated its count of confirmed opioid overdose fatalities for all of 2015 — 1,574, the most ever.\nGet Fast Forward Marylou Sudders, secretary of health and human services, described the findings as “a sobering reminder of why the opioid crisis is so complex and a top public health priority. This is a crisis that touches every corner of our state, and we will continue our urgent focus expanding treatment access.”\nView Story How did the epidemic get so bad? Doctors are partly to blame, but so is a culture that demands zero pain after medical treatment.\nTown-by-town death tolls Life and loss on Methadone Mile\nDuring the three months covered by the new data, 75 treatment beds were added in Taunton and western Massachusetts.\nAmong the overdose victims whose blood the state was able to screen, three-quarters had taken fentanyl. Meanwhile, fewer patients received opioid prescriptions than in the same period last year. And heroin deaths dropped at about the same rate as fentanyl deaths increased.\nAdvertisement\nFentanyl, described as 50 to 100 times more powerful than heroin, is manufactured in China and Mexico, and mixed with heroin or sold as pills that look like painkillers.\n“In the midst of another report showing the toll that opioids are taking, it’s understandable to ask: Where are we on the road to a solution?” Dr. Monica Bharel, public health commissioner, said in a statement. “That is not an easy question to answer in any epidemic, but I find hope in the work of communities across the state to bend the curve of these trends and bring us closer to a solution.”\nEmergency medical services reported that nearly 3 percent of transports in the second quarter of 2016 involved overdoses, triple the proportion in the first quarter of 2013. Rescue workers frequently had to administer the overdose-reversing drug naloxone more than once, a sign of the growing potency of the drugs taken. Emergency medical workers were recently given permission to administer a higher dose of naloxone, widely known by the trademark name Narcan.\nMark Kennard, executive director of Project COPE, a Lynn addiction treatment provider and an affiliate of Bridgewell, called the numbers “unsettling and terribly tragic.”\nBut he found signs of hope hidden in the data. The increase in emergency medical transports for overdoses suggests that people are more willing call for help than in the past, which Kennard attributes to a “Good Samaritan” law that protects people who report an overdose from arrest for drug possession. He predicted the wider of use of naloxone will lead to a leveling off of overdose deaths.\nAdditionally, the decline in opioid prescribing will reduce the drugs being diverted, he said\n“Within the darkness of these tragic deaths,” he said, “we’re seeing some changes that I think are really positive. I’m hopeful.”\nFelice J. Freyer can be reached at felice.freyer@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @felicejfreyer",

      "text": " Google+\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nIn Raleigh, N.C., Donald Trump told the crowd “You&apos;ve got a half a day to make every dream you&apos;ve ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true.”\nBy Associated Press November 07, 2016\nClick here for the latest updates.\nWASHINGTON — The latest on the US presidential campaign:\n5:12 p.m.\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump continues to say that he’s put $100 million of his own money into his presidential run. Fundraising records show that with just 24 hours to go, he’s about $34 million short of that amount.\nTrump’s latest major contribution to his own campaign was $10 million on Oct. 28, according to Federal Election Commission reports. That brings his total investment to about $66 million.\nGet Political Happy Hour He most recently made his $100 million assertion at a rally Monday afternoon in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nView Story How to watch the results on election night Donald Trump’s only viable path to victory involves places that report results relatively early, beginning around 7 p.m.\n10 positive things that came out of this campaign season This time, there really is a Hispanic voter surge\nTrump’s personal investment shrinks when accounting for about $9 million in campaign cash that has returned to his family and businesses.\n___\nAdvertisement\n5:10 p.m.\nA soaring turnout from Latino voters has driven a record number of Americans to vote ahead of Election Day.\nAssociated Press data show at least 43.2 million people have cast ballots by early voting. Record levels have been reported in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Millions more ballots are still coming in.\nThe AP estimates that early votes could top 50 million. That comes to nearly 40 percent of all ballots. In 2012, there were 46 million early votes, or 35 percent.\nThe latest numbers show declines in voting from blacks in North Carolina — a drop-off after historic levels for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But higher turnout by Latinos, who often lean Democratic, may be buoying Clinton in Florida. Both are must-win for Donald Trump.\nRELATED: This time, there really is a Hispanic voter surge\n___\nHillary Clinton’s campaign is serving a legal warning to television stations playing campaign ads that state the Democratic candidate is being investigated by the FBI.\nHer campaign sent out cease-and-desist letters to multiple television stations on Monday. The letters ask the stations to stop playing ads from Donald Trump campaign and a super PAC supporting his bid making that claim. That’s according to campaign aides.\nFBI Director James Comey said on Sunday the agency would not reopen its investigation of her use of a private server as Secretary of State. The announcement came as a relief to her campaign, which has seen polls tighten amid speculation that the agency would reexamine the issue.\nClinton is campaigning in three battleground states on Monday, making her final swing of the 2016 race.

The Republican vice presidential nominee noted a speech Clinton gave Brazil in 2013 as proof she’d have ‘‘open borders.’’\nRepublicans have seized on Clinton saying her ‘‘dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.’’ But she was talking specifically about the energy market, not immigration.\nClinton does support a more lenient immigration policy than Trump’s proposal for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. She would grant a path to citizenship to some people already in the U.S. illegally. She has not proposed open borders.\n___\n4:47 p.m.\nHillary Clinton’s final rally will be a star-studded affair in battleground North Carolina.\nThe campaign announced Monday that the midnight event in Raleigh will feature Lady Gaga, Jon Bon Jovi and DJ Samantha Ronson. Clinton’s family will also attend.\nThe rally will conclude a whirlwind tour of battleground states in the final days before the election. Clinton is also visiting Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday.\nClinton’s celebrity guests in recent days have included Jay Z and Beyonce, James Taylor and Katy Perry.\n___\nHillary Clinton says she’ll be a president for all Americans — including Republicans.\nThe Democrat is making the case that Donald Trump is unqualified as she is campaigns in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The area has a lot of GOP voters.\nShe says she’s gotten to know a lot of presidents from her days interning and then working on Capitol Hill, to becoming first lady, a senator and President Barack Obama’s secretary of state. She adds that regardless of party, ‘‘I never doubted they were fit to serve as our president.’’\n___\n4:46 p.m.\nDonald Trump continues to say that he’s put $100 million of his own money into his presidential run. Fundraising records show that with just 24 hours to go, he’s about $34 million short of that amount.\nTrump’s latest major contribution to his own campaign was $10 million on Oct. 28, according to Federal Election Commission reports. That brings his total investment to about $66 million.\nHe most recently made his $100 million assertion at a rally Monday afternoon in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nTrump’s personal investment shrinks when accounting for about $9 million in campaign cash that has returned to his family and businesses.\n___\n4:16 p.m.\nDonald Trump is hop-scotching the country, delivering his closing argument to voters with just hours left before Election Day polls open.\nTrump made his second stop of the day in battleground North Carolina. He’s painting a dismal picture of life in the country, describing an indebted, crime-ridden nation that only he can fix.\nTrump tells a Raleigh audience, ‘‘You've got a half a day to make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true.’’\nTrump has been predicting victory, but says if he doesn’t win, he'll consider it ‘‘the single greatest waste of time, energy and money.’’\n___\n3:52 p.m.\nLatinos aren’t the only ones seeing big jumps in turnout in early voting.\nAsian-American voters have increased across the board in key states being targeted by both presidential campaigns. That’s according to an analysis by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm.\nThe racial group in more recent presidential elections has tilted heavily Democratic.\nBallots from Asian-Americans have roughly doubled in Florida, Arizona, Virginia and North Carolina.\nIn Georgia, ballots from the group have almost tripled.\nSmaller in population, Asian-Americans typically make up about 1 percent to 2 percent of a state’s vote share. But they have become more pivotal in closely fought battleground states with larger numbers of their communities, such as Nevada and Virginia.\n___\n3:44 p.m.\nTim Kaine is wrapping his last tour in a key swing state with an aggressive speech criticizing Republican Donald Trump.\nThe Democratic vice presidential nominee said Trump’s ‘‘divisive, insult driven’’ campaign has shown he’s not fit to be president.\n‘‘As you campaign, so you will govern,’’ Kaine said.\nKaine reminded supporters that Trump had insulted numerous individuals, including a Muslim Gold Star family and Sen. John McCain.\nKaine made the remarks in Wilmington, North Carolina, his third stop in the battleground state Monday. He is scheduled to finish the day with two events in his home state of Virginia.\n___\n3:28 p.m.\nA federal judge says she sees no evidence that Republicans and presidential candidate Donald Trump want supporters to intimidate North Carolina minority voters on Election Day.\nU.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles said after an hour-long hearing Monday that she'll keep an eye on what happens Tuesday. She could consider sanctions if there’s a coordinated effort to turn away voters in minority neighborhoods.\nNorth Carolina’s Democratic Party alleged in a law suit filed last week that Trump’s presidential campaign and a political organization run by his informal adviser, Roger Stone, has intimidated voters.\nFederal courts have rejected similar complaints in Ohio and Arizona. Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania cases remain pending.\n3 p.m.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has turned down a request from Ohio Democrats to issue an order aimed at preventing Donald Trump’s supporters from harassing or intimidating voters on Election Day.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted on Monday that Ohio law already forbids voter intimidation.\nThe case is part of a flurry of courtroom efforts by the Democrats around the country to head off what they say is vigilantism by the Trump campaign and its backers.\nThe Republican presidential candidate has called on supporters to watch for fraud at the polls. That has stirred fears of minority voters being confronted and challenged by self-appointed poll watchers.\n___\n2:35 p.m.\nJoe Biden is stressing the importance of the African-American vote as he and his wife visit historically black Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Florida.\nThe vice president said that if African-Americans turn out in the same numbers as they did for President Barack Obama, then Hillary Clinton will win Florida. And he said that would make her the next president.\nHe also told the few hundred students in the crowd Monday that historically black colleges would be hurt under the Trump administration. He predicted cuts to Pell Grants.\nBiden also attacked Trump’s character, saying he couldn’t imagine any president, ‘‘not even the worst one,’’ tweeting vitriol about a woman’s body at 3:30 a.m.\nRELATED: Cheer up! Here are 10 positive things that came out of this campaign season\n___\n2:25 p.m.\nThe FBI’s announcement reaffirming that it won’t pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton came too late for nearly 24 million voters.\nThat’s how many people used early voting to cast ballots while the FBI reviewed the emails of a Clinton aide.\nFBI Director James Comey revealed the review of the new emails on Oct. 28, at the height of early voting. That upended the presidential race at a time when Clinton was building a lead.\nOn Sunday, Comey informed Congress that the review was completed and the FBI stood by its decision not to pursue charges.\nThe nearly 24 million voters who voted during those nine days represent about 18 percent of the expected total votes for president.\nAs of Monday, at least 42.5 million total ballots were cast early.\n___\n1:25 p.m.\nA month ago, Speaker Paul Ryan told House Republicans he would neither defend nor work for Donald Trump’s election. Now America’s top elected Republican is talking unity.\nRyan said in an interview Monday on WTMJ-AM that ‘‘I do not want to harm our team going into the election. I want to unify our team going into the election.’’\nThe Wisconsin congressman said in a statement Sunday that the way to end the Clinton era is to elect Trump. It was one of the first explicit calls for electing Trump since Ryan effectively abandoned the presidential candidate over crude, predatory remarks about groping women.\nRyan is seeking re-election as speaker. Some House Republicans have criticized him for his tepid support for Trump.\n___\n1:05 p.m.\nThe lone American off the planet has cast his vote from space. That’s in keeping with NASA’s motto of ‘‘Vote while you float.’’\nNASA said Monday that astronaut Shane Kimbrough (KIM-broe) filed his ballot from the International Space Station sometime over the past few days. He arrived at the orbiting lab in mid-October. Before launching, Kimbrough said it was going to be special, being able to say ‘‘I voted from space.’’\nNASA says the previous U.S. space station resident, Kate Rubins, also cast an absentee ballot from up there, before returning to Earth a week ago.\nA 1997 Texas law allows U.S. astronauts to vote from space. For NASA astronauts, home is Houston when they’re not circling the globe.\n___\n1:05 p.m.\nPresident Barack Obama is making an explicit pitch to Michigan’s auto workers. He says that Donald Trump doesn’t care about their future.\nObama is campaigning Monday for Hillary Clinton in Ann Arbor, outside Detroit. He said he and Democrats have ‘‘earned some credibility here’’ after saving the auto industry through federal bailouts early in Obama’s presidency.\nObama said in contrast, Trump said Washington could have let the auto companies go bankrupt. He said if even two of the major auto companies had gone bankrupt, it could have cost a million U.S. jobs and killed Michigan’s auto industry.\nObama says auto workers shouldn’t be ‘‘bamboozled’’ by the Republican business mogul.\n___\n1 p.m.\nPresident Barack Obama is making an explicit pitch to Michigan’s auto workers that Donald Trump doesn’t care about their future.\nObama is campaigning Monday for Hillary Clinton in Ann Arbor, outside Detroit.

She’s making a particular pitch to Michigan’s auto workers in nearby Detroit.\nChelsea Clinton says she’s so proud that her two children were born while Obama was president.\n___\n12:35 p.m.\nHillary Clinton is being introduced by Tom Colicchio, famous for his role as a judge on the television show ‘‘Top Chef.’’\nThe celebrity chef urged voters in Pittsburgh Monday to support Clinton.\nHe said he met Clinton when she was a senator from New York and she would urge him to use foods from upstate New York farmers.\nHe said Clinton ‘‘can tie this country together.’’\nThe two embraced when she took the stage.\nClinton is spending the final hours before Election Day on a four-state tour of battleground states.\n___\n12 p.m.\nDonald Trump’s running mate is urging Republican voters to ‘‘come home’’ and ensure that Democrat Hillary Clinton ‘‘is never elected president of the United States.’’\nMike Pence told a Duluth, Minnesota, crowd Monday that Clinton would bring ‘‘the politics of personal enrichment’’ and ‘‘outright corruption’’ to the Oval Office.\nHe dismissed the FBI’s Sunday announcement that the agency has found no new evidence of criminal wrongdoing in Clinton’s handling of national security information while secretary of state.\nPence noted that FBI Director James Comey had previously confirmed the presence of classified material in emails sent on a private server Clinton used.

In a follow-up letter Sunday, Comey said the FBI review was completed and it was standing by its recommendation that no charges be filed.\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest on Monday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the White House hasn’t been briefed on the investigation and didn’t receive advance notice about Comey’s latest letter.\nEarnest says Obama still has confidence in Comey.\n___\n10:50 a.m.\nPhiladelphia’s public transit system will be up and running in time for Election Day now that a weeklong strike has ended. That’s a relief to the state’s Democrats.\nDemocratic city officials were worried that the strike could affect turnout at the polls Tuesday.

Democrat Hillary Clinton is counting on strong support in the Philadelphia area. Both candidates are campaigning in the state Tuesday.\nThe Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the union representing roughly 4,700 transit workers announced a tentative agreement early Monday. Subways were soon operating on a reduced schedule and limited trolled serve was restored.\n___\n10:30 a.m.\nThe Justice Department says it will send more than 500 staffers to 28 states on Election Day to monitor the polls.

Monday’s announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities.\nThe number of personnel is less than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched in 2012.\nThe Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.\nIn a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the department is committed to ensuring that every eligible voter can participate in the election.\n___\n10:25 a.m.\nHillary Clinton is departing on a multi-stop swing of the presidential battleground states on the day before the election.

She was speaking to reporters at an airport outside New York City.\nClinton said she has ‘‘a big agenda ahead of us’’ and is vowing to ‘‘get a lot done’’ if she defeats Republican Donald Trump.\nThe Democratic presidential nominee was campaigning in Pittsburgh; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Philadelphia and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n___\n8:55 a.m.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he doesn’t know if the George Washington Bridge lane closure controversy cost him the vice presidential nomination.\nChristie said Monday on ‘‘CBS This Morning’’ that he was runner-up to be Republican Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick. He denied a report that Trump had offered him the job, then rescinded it. He said he thinks Trump thought Indian governor Mike Pence was the better choice.\nTwo of Christie’s former allies were convicted Friday for their role in re-aligning access lanes to the bridge in a political revenge plot against a Democratic mayor who didn’t endorse him.\nChristie says he thinks Trump will defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton Tuesday because the momentum is on his side and the country wants change.\n___\n8:35 a.m.\nOhio Democrats want the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in their voter intimidation lawsuit in the swing state.\nThe party has filed an emergency request for the nation’s high court to lift a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court order. That ruling Sunday granted the Donald Trump campaign’s request to block a federal judge’s restraining order Democrats said was needed to prevent voter intimidation.\nA 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel said Ohio Democrats didn’t show ‘‘a likelihood of success’’ on their case’s merits.\nThe party told the U.S. Supreme Court the appellate judges ruled without reviewing ‘‘critical evidence’’ a lower court judge relied on in ruling that anyone engaging in intimidation or harassment inside or near polling places would face contempt of court charges.\n___\n7:35 a.m.\nDonald Trump’s campaign manager says it’s not true that his staff has stopped him from tweeting.\nTrump has exhibited unusual restraint on social media in the final days of the campaign. The New York Times reported on Sunday that aides ‘‘have finally wrested away’’ his Twitter account.\nPresident Barack Obama seized on the report at a voter rally in Florida, telling the crowd that anyone who can’t be trusted with a Twitter account shouldn’t be trusted with control of the America’s nuclear weapons.\nWhen asked Monday about the Times report by NBC’s ‘‘Today Show,’’ campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said: ‘‘No, it’s not true.’’\n___\n3:15 a.m.\nWith the cloud of an FBI investigation lifted, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump struck strikingly different tones as they moved into the final hours of a volatile, nearly two-year-long presidential campaign.\nAfter days of attacks on Trump’s qualifications and temperament, Clinton cast herself as the candidate of ‘‘healing and reconciliation,’’ perhaps a surprising position for one of the most divisive figures in American politics. Trump, meanwhile, voiced new confidence as he brought his campaign — and his dark visions of a rigged American economic and political system— to longtime Democratic strongholds.\nOvershadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI Director James Comey’s latest letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.\nThe 2016 presidential race Election reading list Want to vote early?

      "title": "Earthquake breaks facades, windows in Oklahoma oil hub town",
      "text": " Google+\nKFOR-TV/AP\nA street in Cushing, Okla., was damaged in Sunday’s earthquake.\nBy Justin Juozapavicius Associated Press November 07, 2016\nCUSHING, Okla. (AP) — Dozens of buildings sustained ‘‘substantial damage’’ after a 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck an Oklahoma town that’s home to one of the world’s key oil hubs, but officials said Monday that no damage has been reported at the oil terminal.\nCushing City Manager Steve Spears said 40 to 50 buildings were damaged in Sunday’s earthquake, which was the third in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries have been reported, and Spears said the damage included cracks to buildings and fallen bricks and facades.\nAdvertisement\nOklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday’s quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week.\nFearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Spears said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled Monday classes.\nGet Breaking News The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake’s epicenter.\nThe quake struck at 7:44 p.m. Sunday and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said Sunday’s quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0.\n‘‘I thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,’’ said Cushing resident Cindy Roe, 50. ‘‘It was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘It was awful and I don’t want to have another one.’’\nIn recent years, Oklahoma regulators have asked oil and gas producers to either close wastewater injection wells or cut back on the volume of fluids injected. The reductions have generally led to a drop-off in quakes and their severity, though not always.\nOklahoma’s strongest quake on record, a magnitude 5.8 temblor on Sept. 3, occurred in Pawnee, on the fringe of an area that had already restricted wastewater disposal. Shortly afterward, geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault.\nCushing’s oil storage terminal is one of the world’s largest. As of Oct. 28, tank farms in the countryside around Cushing held 58.5 million barrels of crude oil, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The community bills itself as the ‘‘Pipeline Crossroads of the World.’’\nCushing Assistant City Manager Jeremy Frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late Sunday but that the community hadn’t heard from all companies. Gov. Mary Fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at Cushing’s oil storage terminal\nMegan Gustafson and Jonathan Gillespie were working at a Cushing McDonald’s when the quake hit.\n‘‘It felt like a train was going right through the building, actually,’’ Gustafson, 17, said Sunday night as she and her co-workers stood behind a police barricade downtown, looking for damage. ‘‘I kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit.’’\nGillespie said the building shook for about 10 seconds, but that he wasn’t as alarmed as Gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes, especially in recent years.\n‘‘I didn’t think it was anything new,’’ he said.\nAccording to USGS data, there have been about two dozen earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume.\n‘‘I was at home doing some work in my office and, basically, you could feel the whole house sway some,’’ Spears, the Cushing city manager, said Sunday night. ‘‘It’s beginning to become normal.’’",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Jan Ransom Globe Staff November 07, 2016\nThe badly beaten body of 19-year-old Dora Jean Brimage was discovered in a vacant Grove Hall building in 1987. A year later, Janet Phinney was strangled and her body dumped in the woods in West Roxbury. Lena Bruce, a recent Tufts University graduate was found dead and tied up with a telephone cord in her South End apartment in 1992.\nThese grisly murders were solved decades later by the Boston Police Department’s Unsolved Homicides squad.\nAdvertisement\n“If someone is killed, [the family] deserves a fair shot at knowing who did it,” said Boston Police Sergeant Detective William “Bill” Doogan, head of the squad since 2010. “You can’t give up.”\nAt least 15 cases are being investigated now, and 16 have been solved since 2010. In June, prosecutors charged James Paige, of Manchester, N.H., with killing Brimage, and last year James Witkowski was indicted on a first-degree murder charge in Bruce’s death. Phinney’s ex-boyfriend was convicted in 2013.\nGet Fast Forward The four-man squad -- Doogan, and detectives Charles Coleman, John Cronin, and Kevin Pumphret -- spend their days leafing through boxes of files on decades-old murders, traveling across the country to interview witnesses and potential suspects, or on the phone with families eager for a listening ear or even the slightest update on their loved one’s cases.\n“You hear their heartache, their frustration, and sometimes there’s nothing you can do but take the phone call and listen,” said Coleman.\nThere are 1,450 homicides that have remained unsolved for at least 10 years, Doogan said.\nAdvertisement\nUnsolved homicides are reopened when a family member, friend, colleagues in law enforcement, or the media inquires about a case, if a new witness emerges, or if the case includes DNA evidence that can be tested using new technology, police said.\n“If somebody cares enough to make a phone call, we’ve got to care enough to make an effort,” said Doogan.\nDoogan, a 30-year veteran of the department, comes from a family of police officers. His father was a Boston patrolman, and his grandfather was a detective.\nDoogan spoke recently about cases his team has solved, including the case of Katharine Lee Robinson, a 27-year-old woman found raped and strangled inside her Boston apartment in 1971. The woman’s fiancé, Stephen M. McCollom had been considered a suspect and lived under a cloud of suspicion for decades. McCollom was officially vindicated in 2011 when Doogan and his team solved the case. Anthony Francis McDonald, who had been convicted of raping two women and murdering one of them in 1972 and died in 1980, was the culprit, Doogan said. McCollom wept when he got the news.\nCraig F. Walker/Globe staff\n“If someone is killed, [the family] deserves a fair shot at knowing who did it,” said Boston Police Sergeant Detective William “Bill” Doogan, head of the squad since 2010. “You can’t give up.”\n“It’s things like that... That’s why we do it,” said Doogan.\nA majority of the 16 cases solved were boosted by federal grants that allowed the department to hire a criminalist to examine evidence from cold cases and paid for testing of evidence at private labs.\nBut even though the grant funding — about $700,000 over four years — ran out in 2014, department officials say they remain committed to solving cold cases because the victims and their families deserve justice.\n“We don’t put a price tag on it,” said Police Commissioner William B. Evans. “If we need to spend more resources we will.”\nDoogan agreed.\n“How much is it worth to solve a murder?” he said. “If you had a loved one [killed] what would it be worth to you?” he said.\nThe federal grants were meant to help solve homicides that happened before 1996 that had the potential to be resolved by DNA evidence. Doogan said the department had 240 cases that were eligible. The squad selected cases that included sexual assault, strangling, beating, bludgeoning, stabbing, or asphyxiation because of the likelihood that DNA evidence would be left behind.\nIn Phinney’s case, DNA evidence was retested using the grant funding and led to murder charges against her ex-boyfriend in 2011. He was convicted two years later.\nFederal funding also helped in the murders of Bruce and Brimage.\nJake Wark, spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, says each cold case prosecuted since 2010 has resulted in a conviction. In some cases the suspect was dead and could not be charged.\n“Time generally works against us because memories fade, witnesses die or move away from the area, and video evidence was much rarer even 10 years ago than today,” Wark said. “Advances in DNA technology have been hugely beneficial.”\nThe squad, formed in the early 1990s, also serves as the point of contact for appeals brought by the Innocence Project and the District Attorney’s Conviction Integrity Program. The unit assists with current homicide investigations and creates summary reports on those seeking parole for murder.\nBut when it comes to solving cold cases, Doogan says , they fail more times than they succeed.\nWhich was why Phinney’s mother, Catherine, begged detectives to drop the new investigation.\nShe had gotten her hopes up many times before and said her heart could not take more disappointment.\nAs part of that new investigation, Doogan, two assistant district attorneys and a criminalist traveled to New Jersey after contacting Dr. Gerald Feigin, the medical examiner who handled Phinney’s case. Feigin reexamined sperm samples recovered from Phinney’s body to see if it included intact sperm cells. Using modern technology not available at the time of the murder, Feigin discovered evidence that could now be used: intact sperm cells that belonged to ex-boyfriend Michael Coker.\nWhen Coker was convicted, Catherine stood in the courtroom, blew a kiss at the detectives, and mouthed the words “Thank you.”\n“That was the best,” Doogan said.\nBut for Pumphret some cases have proven to be far more challenging, despite advancements in technology.\nWhen Pumphret joined the squad a few years ago, he set out to look into the 1978 unsolved murder of an 8-year-old boy who was found hanging from an electrical cord attached to a wall post inside of an abandoned Dorchester building.\nClothing and other items found at the scene have been processed for DNA. Detectives are looking into several leads. Some people connected to the case have died including the child’s mother.\nPumphret, who has been with the department for 25 years, said the murder of a child was unconscionable.\n“Everyone is someone’s kid,” he said. “These people deserve closure.”\nJan Ransom can be reached at jan.ransom@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/ The Boston Globe\nHillary Clinton at a campaign event in Manchester on Nov. 6.\nBy Joan Vennochi Globe Columnist November 07, 2016\nF or Hillary Clinton, the road to the White House looks like the ultimate game of “Survivor.’’\nAt the end, she could become the country’s first woman president. To get there, she had to run an Iron Woman marathon over steep hurdles and tough obstacles of her own creation.\nAdvertisement\nThe starting gate goes back to 2008 when nearly everyone said she was inevitable. Barack Obama decided she wasn’t, and the country agreed. Clinton’s inevitability rationale blew up yet again in 2016. Bernie Sanders fired up a passionate movement on the left, with special appeal to young people. On the right, Donald Trump used his reality-TV star talents to stoke the flames of racism, sexism, and class warfare.\nClinton’s path to victory was further complicated by her decision to set up a private e-mail server during her tenure as secretary of state. That was a mistake, and she paid dearly for it in terms of credibility lost and integrity questioned.\nGet Todays Headlines But the biggest hurdle before her is the one that involves making history. No one should underestimate the significance or difficulty of becoming the first female president. Trump exposed the extent of the double standard she faces when it comes to measuring competence and readiness for the job. He’s a serious candidate for the Oval Office and she’s not? His campaign gleefully featured barbs about her looks, her laugh, her wardrobe, and her stamina. Trump did everything he could to belittle and humiliate her, from his “Crooked Hillary” tweets and catcalls to parading Bill Clinton’s sexual partners and accusers of sexual misconduct before her. Trump supporters used vulgarities to describe the Democratic presidential nominee and, just over the weekend, former New Hampshire governor John H. Sununu warmed up the crowd with a crude joke about Bill and Hillary Clinton’s relationship: “You think Bill was referring to Hillary when he said, ‘I did not have sex with that woman?’ ” Sununu asked.\nView Story This year it was the Democrats who fell in line Democrats maintained an uncharacteristic display of unity, even after the WikiLeaks e-mails proved that nearly every liberal suspicion about Clinton was true.\nGOP’s storyline against Clinton has collapsed\nAfter all the misogyny and other mud that was thrown her way, polls show her within striking distance. The only question now is whether Clinton will make it over that finish line and into the White House. If she wins, she owes a huge thank you to President Obama, Michelle Obama, and Vice President Joe Biden, who don’t want the legacy of the last eight years obliterated by a Trump victory. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren also helped with the party’s progressive wing.\nHowever, FBI Director James Comey’s outrageous letter , of Oct. 28, to Congress gave Independents, including Sanders’ supporters, an excuse to abandon Clinton during a critical period of early voting. Comey’s “never mind” letter of Nov. 6 cleared Clinton, but also ensured the e-mail controversy remains front and center in the final hours before the votes are counted.\nAdvertisement\nIf victory comes, Clinton will have earned it. She was disciplined; Trump was not. His staff had to take away his Twitter account, much like a parent taking matches away from a child. She was prepared; he wasn’t, and it showed especially during their debates. Clinton was cool and rational; Trump was whiny and emotional, giving his supporters license to vent their anger and frustration in the most personal and poisonous of ways. Clinton’s surrogates took the high road that Michelle Obama extolled in Philadelphia. Trump surrogates like Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani stuck to the ugly low road.\nIf Clinton does win, it will be a testament to the stamina Trump mocked — but ultimately acknowledged. As he said at the end of their second debate: “I will say this about Hillary. She doesn’t quit. She doesn’t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She’s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she’s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard and she doesn’t quit. She doesn’t give up. I consider that to be a very admirable trait.”\nYet it will take more than force of will to become president.\nThat’s up to the voters.\nJoan Vennochi can be reached at vennochi@globe.com .

Google told us about them during the unveiling at Google I/O 2016 , but we haven't seen them available until today.\n\nFor $20, you can get fabric bases in mango, marine or violet (orange, blue or purple if you're not up on the latest). For $40, you can get a metal base in carbon, copper or snow. Shipping is free on all orders.\nWhile this won't change the way Google Home works , it might make it fit in better with your living room decor.\nSee at Google \nGoogle Home Google Home review These services work with Google Home Google Home vs. Amazon Echo Join our Google Home forums!

      "title": "Google Takes Android Auto Out of the Car—and onto the Phone",
      "text": "\n-Google is nothing if not technically egalitarian. Having successfully launched Android Auto , software that syncs Android-running smartphones with automakers’ in-car displays so that certain apps can be used while driving via the familiar Android interface, Google has turned its automotive attention to phones themselves. As in, Android Auto is now available for phones used in all cars, not just the more than 200 car models globally that offer connectivity. \n-Confused? We understand. That’s because, in order to use Android Auto in a vehicle, one must download the attendant Android Auto app for the Android smartphone first; the system activates once the phone is plugged into a compatible car’s USB port, mirroring a simplified version of the phone’s app menu on the car’s display. Google’s latest Android Auto announcement doesn’t change that, although the company cleverly spun the news to say Android Auto is now available “in every car.”\n-What it really does is allow the app to run on the phone using the same simplified Android interface that appears on dashboard displays. Why? So that drivers of older or incompatible cars—those not capable of connecting with Android Auto, perhaps without an in-dash screen at all—will have the option of sticking the phone into a mount, firing up Android Auto, and pretending they have a newer car with a car-optimized, internet-connected touchscreen infotainment setup. Except that, instead of tapping away at a large-ish built-in touchscreen, these users will be tap-tapping at their phones. Ideally not too much, since, you know, they’re driving, but that’s where the app’s simplified menu structure comes in. Besides, the base-level screens in some cars offering Android Auto are smaller than some of the latest phones, anyway.\n- - - Apple CarPlay vs. Android Auto: We Test the Most Hyped Software of the Year - In Google’s Future, Drivers May Exchange Their Data for Infotainment and Other Features - Going My Waze? Navigation App Waze Testing Carpooling Service - - -The new, on-phone Android Auto feature is unlocked using a software update for the app (for those who already have it); it will be included with the app going forward. The only hitch is that users must be running phones with Android 5.0 or later. Google also promises that enhanced voice-control functionality for the app’s navigation, music, and messaging shortcuts is coming, and it will rely on the same “Okay, Google” command structure familiar to recent Android phone adoptees. Oh, and if you’re interested in this Android Auto iteration, keep in mind that it is free.\n- ",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google to Show Continuously Updated Election Night Results \nStay informed on election day. \nAs soon as the polls close on Tuesday, Nov. 8, Google goog will display continuously updated election results through its search engine the company said. The search giant plans to show up-to-the-minute information detailing the progress of multiple U.S. election day races and other referenda to anyone who queries for “election results.” \nGoogle said it would deliver the updates every 30 seconds in more than 30 different languages, according to a blog post by Shashi Thakur, vice president of engineering on the Google search team. Included in the briefings are the presidential, senatorial, congressional, and gubernatorial races, as well as other ballots throughout the U.S. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nHere’s a glimpse of what the search tool should look like, per the blog post: \nThe rundown includes real-time statistics on the matchup between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic contender for the White House, and Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. Alongside details of the tug-of-war for the executive office are key numbers concerning open legislative seats, battleground states, and the top two political parties (blue for Democrats, red for Republicans). \nAlthough this is not the first time that Google has offered informational tools during an election, this year marks a notable increase in the company’s efforts to meet consumer demand as more people turn to the web—and increasingly their smartphones—for news. Google said that it had seen traffic for the search term “how to vote” more than triple in the past four years, up 233% from 2012. \nIn addition to the political précis that will appear on election day (above), Google has already debuted tools detailing how to register , how and where to vote , and info on who is running—including an election-themed Google Doodle. 40 Under 40: Reactions to the 2016 Election Year \nGoogle said that YouTube, its video division, would stream live coverage from a number of news outlets as well, including NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo, and The Young Turks starting at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday. “From the ballot box to tomorrow’s late-night returns, we hope Google’s tools help guide you through Election Day in a simple, clear and informative way,” Thakur said. \nOf course, Fortune encourages you to visit Fortune.com for all your coverage needs as well.",

      "text": "Visitors to Google’s homepage Monday were greeted with a cartoon collection of American flags and posters displaying the word “vote” in a variety of languages. On the eve of Tuesday’s historic election, the patriot Google Doodle served not only as a friendly reminder to vote but also as a useful tool to help users locate their designated polling stations. Twitter feeds and email inboxes were similarly adorned with pre-election prompts that allowed unsure users to enter their address and confirm where exactly they must go to cast their ballots.\nAs the most tech-savvy presidential campaign cycle to date comes to a close, Monday’s mobilization efforts were part of a final online push to get out the vote.\nBack in September, Facebook launched its first-ever national voter registration drive, which placed a reminder to register atop the news feeds of all U.S.-based users ages 18 and up, provided a link to the federal government’s online guide to registering by state,and encouraged users to share their newly registered status with friends in hopes of inspiring others to do the same.\nView photos \nIn September, Facebook launched its first-ever voter registration drive. (Screenshot via Facebook) More Just last week, the social network rolled out a personalized ballot guide , which aims to help users to prepare for Election Day by providing basic information on all of the candidates running for federal, state and local office, depending on their location.\nAnd Yahoo Search also joined the fray:\nDo you know where your local #Election2016 polling place is? Know where to go with @Yahoo Search. https://t.co/rO2elVIcjV pic.twitter.com/kqR4u6y8jn \n— Yahoo Mail (@yahoomail) November 4, 2016 \n\n\nThe popular car-sharing service Zipcar is also getting into the election spirit with its #drivethevote promotion , offering members free car rentals during select hours on Tuesday in order to help them get to the polls.\nThough not necessarily exclusive to one particular demographic, some initiatives, like Spotify’s “Clarify” series  — a collection of audio and video clips in which popular musicians discuss issues like education, immigration and the economy — are more explicitly geared toward engaging young voters.\n“With millions of young people listening to Spotify, we wanted to use the power of our platform to inspire civic engagement,” Kerry Steib , Spotify’s director of social impact said about the series when it was first released in September.\nSteib continued: “Through Clarify, we hope to create a meaningful and entertaining way for music fans to explore the issues and provide information that inspires them to turn out for the polls in November.”",

Apart from the presidential race, detailed updates of the Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial races will also be available on Google Search. \nShashi Thakur, vice president, engineering at Google Search said in a blog post that the company, over the last several months, has helped people with basic election facts like ‘how to vote’ and ‘how to find nearest polling booth.’ He said the company registered an increase in traffic of 233% for the search on ‘how to vote’ when compared to the elections in 2012. \nGoogle’s chief product YouTube will also live-stream election results coverage of major news websites when voting formally closes at 7 pm ET Tuesday (5:30 am IST Wednesday), Thakur added. In September, YouTube had said that over 200,000 election videos were uploaded to the site every day since July conventions and that over 110 million hours were spent watching these videos. YouTube also got the #VoteIRL started which encouraged especially the young people to vote ‘in real life.’ © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

The option was initially available for Idea subscribers only, but is now extended to other networks such as Airtel and Vodafone. The carrier billing option works in much the same way as other payment options. In the add payments section, you need to select ‘bill my Idea Cellular Account’ (for Idea subscribers) to pay for Play Store purchases through your postpaid/prepaid account. \nA few days ago, Google also unveiled a new feature that would allow users to subscribe to app subscriptions at lower charges for a limited period of time period, before paying the full price. That means that for a app that costs Rs. 45 per month, the developers can offer subscription at an introductory price of Rs 15 for a short period and eventually levy the full charges. \nTo install the carrier billing option, user need to access their Google Play Store and click on the hamburger icon on the left of the screen, then go to Accounts, followed by Payment Methods. They then need to select the + button at the bottom right. Users will then get the option to add Netbanking, However, they will first need to see if their bank is listed. Google has partnered with 38 banks so far for the service. To set carrier billing as the default payment option, users should look for the current default option and tap on the downward arrow icon to see the available payment options. Users can then select their bank and add the net banking details. Deepak Bhadana",

      "text": "Android 7.0 Nougat Now Present on 0.3 Percent of All Active Android Devices, Says Google Android Marshmallow's share grows to 24 percent in November Android Nougat was absent in last distribution chart Android Lollipop still present on most active Android devices \nAlmost two months after last updating its Android distribution chart, Google has now revealed the number of devices that are currently running the various versions of its mobile OS. The search giant, in its latest distribution chart, on Monday revealed that only 0.3 percent of all active Android devices are currently running on Android 7.0 Nougat. Google did not reveal the reason it didn't publish its distribution chart in October, though it may be related to the launch of the Google Pixel smartphones. \nEven though the adoption rate for Nougat cannot be termed impressive, it should be noted that Android 6.0 Marshmallow also debuted at the distribution chart with same percentage share last November. Now, the number of active devices running Marshmallow has climbed up to 24 percent, a 5.3 percent jump from September , as per Google's latest distribution chart . \nThe data regarding the distribution of its Android versions is collected by the company on the basis of the devices that check into Google Play via the app, which supports Android 2.2 Froyo and higher devices. This is why the term \"active devices\" is used while describing the figures, and any version with less than 0.1 percent share is not shown in the chart. The data was collected in a 7-day period ending November 7. It should be noted that Android 7.1 Nougat, which the Google Pixel phones launched with, is still not mentioned in the distribution chart - implying a share of less than 0.1 percent. \nAndroid 5.0 Lollipop continues to be present on most Android smartphones with 34.1 percent of overall share, down from 35 percent in September. Android KitKat follows behind and is down from 27.7 percent in September, now present on 25.2 percent active Android smartphones, as per the data revealed by the company. \nAs per the latest distribution chart, Android versions Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and Jelly Bean are currently running on 1.3 percent, 1.3 percent, and 13.7 percent of overall active Android devices respectively, compared to 1.5 percent, 1.4 percent, and 15.6 percent in September. \nLooking at the OpenGL distribution numbers, we see saw OpenGL 2.0 at 43.1 percent (dropping from 44.9 percent in September), and OpenGL 3.0 at 42.2 percent (dropping from 42.3 percent), and OpenGL 3.1 at 14.7 percent. \nIn comparison, Apple revealed last month that the latest version of its operating system - iOS 10 - is now running on 60 percent of overall active iOS devices. Considering the recent reports about Android's earlier versions still being vulnerable to dated malwares, the platform does face a real task at hand to bring more users to its new platform.",

You have dealt with an unbelievable, slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully. You’ve proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter. Your leadership is amazing. I have always had tremendous respect for you, but the toughness and perseverance you have displayed over the past year is remarkable. Hopefully tomorrow’s election results will give the opportunity to make America great again.”\nThe 2016 presidential race Election reading list Even in college, Donald Trump was brash Hillary: The Wellesley years Clinton charity never provided foreign donor data The Atlantic City savior that came up snake eyes Series: America on Edge",

      "text": " Google+\nBy George J. Mitchell November 10, 2016\nSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\nW e’re fortunate to be Americans, citizens of a country that, despite its many serious imperfections, is still the most open, the most free, the most just in the world. The United States is the world’s dominant power and it will continue to be so, far into the future.\nBut many Americans are fearful and angry. It seems contradictory. But it is understandable and has occurred often in the past.\nAdvertisement\nThe Industrial Revolution was one of the turning points in human history. It began 250 years ago in England. As machines replaced men in the production of goods, the prospect of high levels of unemployment created widespread fear and anxiety. There was unrest, violence, some exploitation, and much misery. But there also was a massive increase in productivity that created new goods, new services, and new jobs, raising the overall standard of living of the whole society. Over the following century that revolution spread to most of the Western world, especially to a newly independent America, where freedom, innovation, new people, and new ideas propelled us to the forefront of nations.\nToday, we are passing through a revolution in technology that future historians will judge to be as significant as was the Industrial Revolution. Its effects have been accelerated and intensified by the dramatic growth since World War II of the international trade in goods and services, and in the movement of people across national borders.\nGet Todays Headlines The combined effects have been both positive and negative. There has been the creation of wealth without precedent. But that wealth is not being distributed throughout the whole society, and growth in our economy is uneven. As a result, many of our fellow citizens are victims, not beneficiaries, of the revolution in technology and trade. Their pain and loss are real and must be recognized. That can be done only if we also recognize the complexity of the problem and deal with it accordingly. It is undoubtedly true that many job losses have resulted from trade agreements. We must work hard to strengthen and improve any future agreements. But innovation and technology cause job losses as well.\nNeither we nor any other society has yet devised fully effective policies that will enable us to continue to receive the benefits while also mitigating the adverse effects of increased trade and technology. To do that, we need the unity of our people and of our purpose, and a national commitment to make good health, good education, and good jobs available to all Americans. And we must act on the reality that more knowledge and skill, more and better education, are the keys to dealing with this and most other problems.\nMost modern nation states began as homogenous groups in race, language, and religion. But the success of America has been rooted in the work of people from every part of the world, of different backgrounds, different religions, different languages, all coming together, committed not to a race or a religion, but to an ideal.\nAdvertisement\nWe have advanced imperfectly, slowly, sometimes making huge mistakes and tragic misjudgments. But always, in the end, overcoming each challenge and emerging better and stronger.\nAmerica initially welcomed immigrants to help fill a vast continent. The first restrictions came in 1882 when Congress enacted a law whose title was blunt: the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was a reaction to the entry of Chinese workers who helped build the transcontinental railroad .\nIn 1906, a major earthquake devastated San Francisco. Unable to accommodate all the children whose schools were destroyed, the city adopted an ordinance which prohibited any child of Japanese ancestry from attending public school, even those born in the United States.\nEven earlier, waves of Italians and Irish, Jews and Catholics, and many others, were met with hostility and discrimination. Irish-Americans were met with signs that appeared across New York and many other cities — “Irish need not apply” — and cartoons that were published in newspapers and magazines depicting the Irish as subhuman. Italian-Americans were stigmatized because of the few who were Mafia criminals.\nThe Ku Klux Klan is most remembered for its violence against African-Americans in the South. But it reached its peak in the North in the 1920s based on extreme hostility to Catholics and Jews; and, other than African-Americans, no group has suffered from discrimination more or longer than Jews.\nYet, tremendous contributions were made to and for our country by Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans, by Asian-Americans and African Americans, by Jews and Catholics.\nEvery rational American knows that we cannot accept all who want to live in our country. Common sense makes clear that in our national interest we need policies that place fair and realistic limits on how many can enter and who they are. But we should not limit the discussion to who we want to keep out or who we should throw out. We also must focus on who we want to enter, and how we can continue to replenish our society with new people, to their benefit and ours.\nDespite all the negative talk of this campaign, I hope the new president believes in the promise and the future of America.\nSurely the American people and their elected representatives have the capacity to engage in a serious national debate, based on fact and grounded in reason, to establish a sensible policy on immigration that meets the many national interests affected by this issue. It is the responsibility of the new president to initiate and lead the debate.\nAmerica continues to be enriched by new people, new ideas, new energy, new vision. Three of the most valuable and successful business enterprises in the world are Apple, Amazon, and Google. Apple was created by Steve Jobs, whose father was born in Syria. Amazon was created by Jeff Bezos, whose adoptive father was born in Cuba. And a cofounder of Google was Sergey Brin, who was born in Russia. Would the United States be a better country today if they had not been admitted?\nGenius knows no language, no race, no religion. It can be found wherever human beings exist. But it is more likely to flourish where there is freedom, education, and opportunity for all, where innovation is encouraged and success is celebrated and applauded. That place is America.\nTo cite just a few examples: Despite all of the negative talk about our decline, nine of the 10 most valuable business brands in the world are American, as are 15 of the world’s top 20 universities. Ninety-one percent of online searches are done through American companies and 99 percent of smartphones are on American-made operating systems. Six of the seven American recipients of this year’s Nobel Prizes were immigrants.\nDespite all the negative talk and the drumbeat of tragedy that dominate the news, I hope the new president believes, as I do, in the promise and the future of America. We have much to be concerned about, but much more to be thankful for. The new president has an awesome responsibility and a magnificent opportunity to extend education, opportunity, and hope to more and more people, in our country and around the world.\nGeorge J. Mitchell was the US Senate majority leader. He also served as the chairman of the Northern Ireland peace negotiations and as US special envoy to the Middle East.

      "text": " Google+\nAP/File\nMaine Governor Paul LePage in June.\nBy Marina Villeneuve Associated Press November 07, 2016\nAUGUSTA, Maine — Top Democratic officials are accusing Maine Republican Governor Paul LePage of intimidating college students by saying students who vote in the state Tuesday will be investigated to make sure they followed state law.\nThe governor’s comment comes after officials at a private liberal arts college in Lewiston said fliers distributed on campus with incorrect information about residency and fees are a ‘‘deliberate attempt at voter suppression.’’\nAdvertisement\nThe orange fliers were found at numerous dorms at Bates College and at the school’s dining hall during the weekend. It’s unknown who’s responsible for the fliers.\nThe leaflets say to register to vote in the city, students must pay to change their driver’s licenses to a Lewiston address ‘‘within 30 days.’’ They also say students must pay ‘‘hundreds of dollars’’ to re-register vehicles and do not give a timeframe.\nGet Political Happy Hour Democratic Secretary of State Matt Dunlap said the information is false and said enrolled students living in the community can vote. State law doesn’t require a Maine driver’s license to vote, and establishing residency for voting doesn’t mean you have to pay any fees or taxes.\n‘‘You don’t pay for a right,’’ said Dunlap. Any individual who declares Maine residency must follow rules like vehicle registration, but that process is completely separate from voter registration.\nDunlap said LePage’s comments ‘‘inflame an atmosphere of doubt and fear among the voters.’’\nAdvertisement\nJanet Mills, the state’s Democratic Attorney General, said there are no financial penalties for exercising the constitutional right to vote. College President Clayton Spencer called the fliers disturbing and said the school is working to ensure students have clear information about how to register and vote.\nLePage said that after the election, ‘‘we will do everything’’ allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted are following Maine law. LePage’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment and provided no further details about what that means.\nZachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, called on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent behind LePage’s statement. Heiden said LePage’s words appear ‘‘designed to make college students afraid to vote.’’\nLePage also claimed Maine Democrats have encouraged out-of-state college students to vote ‘‘even though there is no way to determine whether students also voted in their home states.’’\nIn 2011, a two-month investigation led by Charles Summers, Dunlap’s Republican predecessor, found no instances of voter fraud in Maine after the head of the Maine GOP alleged more than 200 cases of possible election fraud by non-resident state university students.\nThe investigation found no students who voted in two difference places in the same election. Maine’s voter registration application asks individuals where they were previously registered to vote.\nSummers also sent a letter to 201 students telling them they need to register their vehicles in Maine and get Maine driver’s licenses if they want to keep voting in the state.\nThree advocacy groups then accused Summers of violating student voters’ rights by intimidating them.\nThe 2016 presidential race Election reading list Even in college, Donald Trump was brash Hillary: The Wellesley years Clinton charity never provided foreign donor data The Atlantic City savior that came up snake eyes Series: America on Edge",

      "text": "Google has added a new zone to its Cloud Platform infrastructure business with the opening of the Asia-Northeast1 region in Tokyo.\nThis takes the total number of Google Cloud Platform regions to six around the world, adding to the three existing ones in the U.S., one in Belgium, and one in Taiwan.\nLocal infrastructure means Google can offer businesses in the area lower latency and overall better performance in terms of data-transfer speeds. According to Google, during the beta phase customers across Japan saw up to 85 percent lower latency compared to when they were linked to the Taiwan region.\nThe Tokyo Cloud Region supports Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Persistent Disk, Google App Engine Standard Environment, Google Container Engine, database and analytics services, and core networking and security services, including Cloud VPN and Google Cloud DNS.\nGoogle has been striving to tackle the mighty Amazon Web Services (AWS) since it launched the Google Compute Engine infrastructure as a service way back in 2012, and the internet giant has been ramping up its cloud presence in recent times. Back in March, Google announced two new Cloud Platform zones — one for Oregon, which opened in July , and one for Tokyo.\nThe company has also previously announced that it planned to open many more throughout 2017, with at least eight more to come, including London (U.K.), Sydney (Australia), Frankfurt (Germany), Mumbai (India), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Singapore, Hamina (Finland), and Northern Virginia (U.S.).\nGoogle has also been investing heavily in its global network infrastructure. A new Google-backed transpacific internet cable from Japan to Oregon opened for service on June 30, while Google and Facebook recently announced a partnership to connect Los Angeles and Hong Kong via a new undersea cable, which is expected to open for business in 2018.\nToday’s launch comes a couple of months after Google announced a reorganization of its various cloud services under the umbrella Google Cloud brand, and now includes the Google Cloud Platform itself, Google Apps for Work, the enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "\nMusic makes me better.\nI listen everywhere: the office, the car, the bedroom, the kitchen, the park, the store, the shower, you name it. And in my few short days with Google Home , I am coming to love the quality and more importantly the control I get while listening to music on it. There's just one real problem: I need a Google Home that isn't tethered to the wall.\nIt was wonderful, simply wonderful... until I was done toweling off.\nControlling music playback over Google Home while in the shower is nothing short of magic. Even with the fan and the shower on full blast, all but one of my commands was heard and acted on immediately. \"Ok Google. Next.\" \"Ok Google. Softer.\" \"Ok Google. Skip 60 seconds ahead.\" It was wonderful, simply wonderful… until I was done toweling off and needed to go to the bedroom to get dressed. Just as when I came in, I had to unplug my Google Home, plug it back in inside the bedroom, wait for it to boot up, then call up my playlist again and re-shuffle it.\nWe've already discussed the need for an answer to the Amazon Dot , but for my money, Google should be going after another Alexa product first: Amazon Tap . It's a Bluetooth Speaker with Amazon Alexa built-in. We need one of these with Google Assistant, Google Cast, and that nostalgic click-wheel-like touchpad on top. While battery life with always-on listening could be a tossup, being able to temporarily extend Google Home's functionality into another room without having to untether and retether to a power outlet could be a godsend.\nWell, just use a Pixel… \nGoogle Pixel is indeed a mobile option, but the voice commands available through Google Assistant on the Pixel are but a small fraction of those on Google Home, especially when it comes to media and home control. Even if Google Assistant was consistent on both devices, an $800 dollar phone is hardly a reasonable alternative to a $130 or $150 voice-activated speaker.\nLet's bring Google Home out onto the deck, or into the pillow fort with your kids, or into the bathroom for some shower show tunes. Home is more than where the power outlets are, and Google Home needs to be there, too.\nUnless then, we'll deal with having to plug it in. Those lights sure are pretty...\nSee at Best Buy \nGoogle Home Google Home review These services work with Google Home Google Home vs. Amazon Echo Join our Google Home forums!

      "text": "Comment \nThe Nexus brand has been around for nearly seven years now. As technology matured, the Nexus phones demonstrated consistent improvement from one generation to the next; however, the brand’s inconsistency resulted in a series of seemingly one-off devices rather than a cohesive family. Screen size steadily increased from the original Nexus One’s 3.7-inches to 5.96-inches on the Nexus 6, which was then followed by two smaller-screened models the next year—the 5.2-inch Nexus 5X and 5.7-inch Nexus 6P. Price too has fluctuated over the years: After the Nexus One launched at $529, subsequent models jumped back and forth between the midrange and flagship categories, with launch prices dropping as low as $299 and reaching up to $699. Even the naming convention has varied: one phone used letters (Nexus S), one used numbers in letter form (Nexus One), some used numbers that roughly correlated with screen size, some used numbers and letters (Nexus 5X and 6P), and there was even a Galaxy thrown in. \nThe one feature shared by all Nexus devices, the one that sets them apart from all other Android phones, is the software—a pure Google experience that’s free from OEM and carrier bloatware with access to timely software and security updates directly from Google. The fact that Google, predominantly a software and services company, needs to commission its own line of phones to showcase Android’s latest features speaks to the fractured nature of the Android ecosystem and the sorry state of software support among OEMs and carriers. Even a year after its release, only 19% of devices are running Android 6 and less than 1% are running Android 7, which was released nearly three months ago. This means that 80% of all Android devices are running an operating system that’s at least two major versions old, according to Google. \nGoogle’s latest phones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, still provide that pure Android experience along with at least two years of timely software and security updates, but the new branding is about more than clearing away the Nexus naming clutter. Google is now asserting more control over hardware development, ostensibly to deliver a more cohesive, premium experience centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and Google’s ever-expanding Knowledge Graph, a semantic-search system that catalogs objects and the many connections between them. The new Google Assistant, an integral part of the Pixel experience, serves as a gateway, allowing you to query this treasure trove of data using natural voice commands and contextual queues from the environment. \nGoogle is also pushing for a more unified VR experience with new features in Android 7 and its Daydream View VR headset and controller that works with Daydream-ready phones like the Pixel and Pixel XL. Because of its steep hardware requirements—accurate sensors for head tracking, high-resolution displays, powerful processors—VR will be limited to flagship phones initially. \nGoogle’s Pixel branding may also be seen as a shot across the bow by its Android partners, who rely on an impartial Google to provide them with an operating system and an equal opportunity to compete in the hardware market. The last time Google tried building and selling its own hardware running its own operating system, which occurred several years ago during its ill-fated acquisition of Motorola Mobility, Samsung almost jumped ship, threatening to use the Tizen mobile operating system instead. Google clamped down and persuaded Samsung to stay with Android, and after it sold its Motorola unit to Lenovo, the waves subsided. In the years since, Google has placed further restrictions on what its partners can do with Android, and now that it’s getting back into the hardware business in a roundabout manner, selling phones that directly compete with its partner’s products, competitive tempers could flare once again.

      "text": "News \nIf you're involved in the world of custom ROMs, there's little chance you haven't heard of the Open GApps Project . As of late, Open GApps has been the go-to site for downloading Google Apps packages. It's not hard to understand why; the site is pretty and easy to use, and the packages, which come in nine sizes and variations, are always up to date. Now, the guys behind Open GApps have taken the stuff that makes their site so great and infused it into a new Android app. A few noteworthy screens from the setup process. \nAs soon as you open the app for the first time, you can tell that it's well-designed. The setup process is intuitive and requests only one necessary permission - storage. If you're rooted, you can also choose to grant root access to the app so that it can seamlessly install any packages you download. In addition, the app automatically detects the CPU architecture and Android version of your device to ensure that you don't accidentally flash the wrong packages. \nThe 'Install' page is where you'll be spending the most time. Here, you can see all the details of the package you're set to download. Want to change any aspects of your download? Just hit 'Change Selection' and toggle away. It's all very straightforward. After you initiate the download, a full-screen video ad will pop up, but considering that the download has already begun, it's not too intrusive. The rest of the app is ad-free, and equally easy to use. Under 'Settings,' you can choose to only download over WiFi, where the downloads go, to automatically delete old packages when newer ones are downloaded, and more; these options are simple, yet useful. The 'Support' page contains everything you'll ever need or want to know about Open GApps and an option to donate to the team, and the 'About' page shows if you've found the hidden Easter egg; unfortunately, I haven't. If you're a flashaholic, the new Open GApps app is definitely worth checking out; it'll make your life so much easier for you. And even if you're not the type to constantly flash different ROMs on your device, download it to hunt for the Easter egg. I can't make any guarantees, but it might be worth it. You can download the Open GApps app from APKMirror , OpenGApps.org , or the Play Store.",

      "text": "Updated: November 8, 2016 7:08 pm US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. (Source: Reuters) \nDemocrat Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has picked up the lead in terms of most searched presidential candidate on the search engine Google barely hours before America votes. Hillary took over Republican candidate Donald Trump as the most keenly searched candidate on the Internet’s most widely used search engine. On November 8 midnight, the search density on Google stood equal with 48 per cent of candidate interest going for Hillary and the same for Trump. The rest was divided between other candidates Gary Johnson, Jill Stein and Evan McMullin. Hillary’s videos are also being watched around 8-10 per cent more than Trump’s on YouTube. \nWATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections 2016: Voting Underway In Many States \nAt 11:30 am IST, for every 66 searches for Hillary, Trump was clocking 53. Hillary led throughout the day, not dropping behind Trump at any time. Trump was leading Hillary two days ago but on Monday their popularity on Google came to equal footing and on Tuesday Hillary took off. \nOverall search density charts show that people in Oceania are searching for Trump more than any demographic region, even more than America. Similarly, Africa is searching most for Hillary, more than even the US. \nRead | US presidential elections 2016 LIVE: First ballots cast in towns of New Hampshire \nInterestingly, only 9 out of 50 states in the US are searching Trump more than Hillary. These states are are Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, West Virginia and Vermont. Only 12 states are searching for economy as top election issue. At least 29 are searching abortion as their top issue. \nThe top trending related searches for Trump in the US did not include election issues. Rather, they were regarding his alleged assassination attempt, rushing him off the stage at a rally, his Twitter handle, Reno and the secret service. \nSimilarly, the top trending related searches for Hillary in the US included NYPD over its stop and frisk rights, Hillary becoming the unsafe hand, Beyonce and Hillary spirit cooking. \nAccording to latest trends data available for November 6, electoral issues clubbed with candidates found interesting trends in searches outside the US more than in the US. According to Google trends data, when analysing Hillary’s searches clubbed with electoral issues, China and Japan are searching Trans-Pacific Partnership–a trade pact that Trump wants to scrap. Oceania is searching more than any region for ISIS and abortion. The region also tops charts for interest in abortion policy of Hillary followed by the US and Europe. Black Lives Matter polls highest in the US with Hillary while Europe is most interested in her foreign policy. Americans searched most for Hillary’s economic policy, healthcare, global warming and gun control plans. US searches topped global charts for her plans on same sex marriages as well as oil. \nWATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections 2016: Here Is The Full Process \n\nUS searched most for Trump’s policies on abortion, black lives matter, economy, healthcare, oil and refugees. Oceania led the searches for Trump’s policies on same sex marriages, Brexit, global warming, gun control, ISIS and racism. Europe was most interested in his foreign policies in line with his plans to make more alliances in Europe. \nTrump was popular in searches before the first presidential debate. After the first debate, his popularity dropped. The vice presidential debate helped revive some popularity on the Internet. But after another rise and fall in the other two following debates his position weakened. Hillary gained massive ground after she received the clean chit from the FBI. \nPreviously, Hillary Clinton’s related searches included mostly her emails, email server, indictment, FBI probe etc. Now the searches have changed to her presidency. On the web domain, Hillary seems to be moving ahead of Trump. We can only wait to see if that translates into votes as well. Tags:",

      "text": "Delivery drones will mean the end of ownership Astro Teller | Director of X, Google’s innovation lab By Lauren Goode | Nov. 8, 2016 The Verge 2021 \nIn celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month we’re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patel’s introduction here. \nF ew subsidiaries at Alphabet Inc. inspire as much curiosity as Google X, now called simply “X.” X is the company’s innovation lab, where ambitious but far-fetched tech ideas are pitched, tested, and either come to life or are ultimately killed. It’s where Google’s self-driving car concept was developed, where giant internet access balloons were conceived, where glucose-monitoring contact lenses were first experimented with, and where burrito-delivering drones are part of a beta test for bigger things. \nAnd while more than 250 employees are behind these far-fetched projects, for the past five years the face of X has been Astro Teller, the so-called “Captain of Moonshots.” \nTeller has the CV of a mad scientist: he has degrees in computer science, symbolic and heuristic computation, and a PhD in artificial intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University. After his time in academia, he founded health-tracking company Body Media (acquired by Jawbone) before joining Google X. With his goatee, ponytail, and the Rollerblades he wears everywhere, all day, Teller has become one of Google’s most recognizable characters: he is a published author of both fiction and nonfiction books; he gives TED Talks. \nBut for someone so heavily involved in futuristic projects, Teller stubbornly refuses to predict the future. For him, X is not a lab that churns out immediately useable technology or marketable products, but a place where innovation is “systemized” — imagine Henry Ford’s assembly line, but for ideas. He’s less inclined to prognosticate about solutions than he is to talk about the problems that will need to be addressed in the future — whether it’s the “meta problem” of climate change; the threats and promises of artificial intelligence; or just how, exactly, society’s acceptance of new technology will match the rapid pace of innovation. The Interview What does a day look like five to 10 years from now? \nThe real answer is I don’t know, and much more importantly, I don’t think anyone knows. Trying to prognosticate is a very dangerous business. It’s good for people who are on the speaking circuit, but there isn’t any evidence that anyone is any good at it. \nThe way I would like to function, the way I think most of us here at X function, is to focus instead on asking the questions for the kinds of futures that we imagine might be possible. How fast can we discover that we’re wrong, get rid of those ideas or evolve them from where they currently are, to correctly pointed ideas? You’ve been quoted as saying that your team doesn’t fall in love with solutions, you fall in love with problems. Five to 10 years from now, what are our biggest problems? \nI’m a big believer in falling in love with the problems, not falling in love with the technologies. But falling in love with the problem doesn’t always teach you exactly what to do. \nFor example, you could observe that starting around 10,000 years ago humanity stopped primarily hunting for meat. We started domesticating animals instead. Yet we still get more than half of the fish that we eat in the world by hunting it. That’s just weird. Surely that won’t stay the way it currently is. In the future we will surely be farming in the sea and not just the standard fish farming that happens on shore and very near to the shore. \nClimate change is a huge problem, almost a meta problem. It has a set of problems within it. Just because we’ve identified a problem, that means it’s on our radar screen. It doesn’t mean that we’ve found a solution to it yet or even working on the solution yet. \nSubscribe to get new Verge 2021 interviews as they publish throughout November. Terms apply . Subscribe Let’s talk a little bit about the fear of change — how do you prepare society at large for radically new technologies? \nHistorically, changes in our society, particularly those driven by technology, used to take a long time. One thousand years ago, when somebody came up with a new technology the time between when the technology was invented and when it was widespread in the world… was huge. \nThat gave us several generations during which people could come to terms with how society was being changed by that technology. One hundred years ago when the steam engine was introduced or the telegraph or the telephone, [and] somewhat later the television, those things spread through humanity much faster. They spread maybe on the order of 10 to 20 years. “The time between when a new technology is introduced and when it’s completely changed the world has continued to shrink.” \nFast-forward to today, the time between when a new technology is introduced and when it’s completely changed the world has continued to shrink at a fast rate. It’s now probably five to seven years between when a new technology is introduced and when it really has changed society in a fundamental way. If the world is now changing faster than we can accommodate, it causes a huge incremental level of anxiety for society at large. That is our challenge. \nWhat can be done about that? We can point to specific parts of society which we know we could make better. The patent system was built 130–140 years ago around the idea that you would be granted a temporary monopoly for your idea, it would last about 20 years and you would harvest a lot of value during that time. Then it would be free to everybody afterwards. \nToday that’s still true. It’s still a 20-year license that you’re getting. [But] now technology is changing so fast, by the time you get the patent it’s often not worth that much anymore because [it’s] old news… \nThe way we make laws and regulate technology is another good example where the pace at which we understand the technology and then build laws around that technology is now going sufficiently slower than the technology itself. \nWe need to fix that. We need to go faster on those fronts. Whose responsibility is it to mitigate some of that anxiety around technology? The technologists? The regulators? Or is society supposed to adapt more quickly? \nI think that the onus for how we help society to adjust to new technologies falls on all of us. Does it fall on technologists? Absolutely. Technologists should be making responsible technologies. They should be working hard to educate the world about the ramifications of the technologies such as they can foresee them. That doesn’t mean no one else has any responsibility. \nThe rate at which society copes with new technologies and their ramifications for society is partly rate limited by how we educate both the young people and adults in this country. If technology is continuing to change faster and faster and we don’t get better and better at educating our children to adapt to these changes, then we, the public sector and the education system, are failing our children. \nI don’t mean to suggest that technologists don’t have a role to play in how society adapts to new technologies, but certainly other aspects of society also have to pitch in so that society can really elegantly and smoothly keep pace with the technology changes that are happening. You’re part of a group called AI100 that’s doing a very long-term study on the impact of artificial intelligence. The researchers involved have said they don’t consider it likely that, in the near term, AI systems will autonomously choose to inflict harm on people. But they also noted that it is possible for people to use AI systems for harmful — as well as helpful — purposes. How do you see AI impacting society? \nArtificial intelligence is going to turn out, I predict — it’s a dangerous thing as I’ve said to try to predict the future — [to be] technology that profoundly changes the world. We will come to see [it] the way we see electricity. It will be in everything. It will power almost everything, but we will rarely stop to think about it in very much the way that electricity has changed so much of our lives and yet we now take so much for granted. “I’m sure there will be abuses of artificial intelligence in some ways.” \nI’m sure there will be abuses of artificial intelligence in some ways. I’m also confident that on balance, like electricity, artificial intelligence will be a lever for the human mind. It will make it so that the things around us make our lives better. There’s no strong evidence that I’ve seen that that won’t be the future that we end up in. \nCyber security is one of the world’s big problems. Surely the bad guys in the cyber security world will use smart interesting ways of counting, [or] artificial intelligence by another name, to enable them to do bad things. Society probably has two choices. We can just let them get the upper hand, or we can have artificial intelligence participate in protecting us. I think that microcosm is a useful way for us to think about what our choice is in society. The hackers are going to do it either way. Do we want to get our software system smarter and smarter about protecting us or not? I think a lot of people have a vision of the future in which they wake up in the morning and shout to their virtual assistant to perform tasks for them — we already do this. Then a robot will drive them to work and fold their laundry at home at night. But the tradeoff is that we have to give up an immense amount of personal data in order to enable this. That makes some people very wary. Do you think this will still be an issue in the future? \nI think that people will have a pretty wide spectrum of how much data they feel comfortable sharing, but I think it’s fair to say that even wealthy people who can afford a personal [human] assistant have a pretty wide spectrum on the kinds of stuff that they will share with their assistants. Some will tell their assistants everything, will give them the codes to their bank account and ask them to do a lot of things that other people are uncomfortable having a human assistant do. \nIf you don’t want to share your data, you shouldn’t have to share your data with a digital assistant. Simultaneously, I don’t think anyone should be made to feel bad if they want the benefits they can get from a digital assistant. Of course, the only way to get those benefits is for the digital assistant to have enough data to be able to help them. I would certainly hope that the future encompasses both of those perspectives and allows for both of those kinds of people to get what they want. What does the job market look like once AI has started to displace some of the tasks that humans currently handle? \nTechnology has been displacing and creating jobs since there was technology. The lever, one of the first technologies that was ever created, allows one person to lift up something that before would have taken many people to lift up. That caused some people, from a narrow perspective, to lose their jobs. “Artificial intelligence is likely to cause some jobs to go away.” \nIt turns out that that hasn’t actually caused people to lose their jobs because people spend their time making levers and because it turned out that instead of one person moving the boulder that used to cost you 10 people… you would use that one person to move that one boulder [and] you have nine other people moving their own boulders. You now move 10 times as many boulders. \nIn other words, artificial intelligence is likely to cause some jobs to go away and is going to create a ton of new opportunity. In order to believe that all jobs are going to go away, which is a rather extreme view, but certainly one that some people are saying, I think you would have to believe that there’s an end to the problems in the world. That the problems are going to get all used up, taken up. That artificial intelligence will be so good we will run out of problems. I don’t believe that that’s going to happen. \nIt is a failure of imagination on our collective parts that we can’t see how, when robots take [over] some of what we’re currently doing, it won’t just level us up to the next level. Project Wing, which is X’s drone project, recently tested food delivery by drone. Have you had a burrito delivered to you by drone? \nI have. How was it? \nIt was great. It was actually slightly magical. I think people over-focus on drones plus burritos. I guess I understand why they can over-fixate on that, but here’s how I would describe it. \nEvery time we have, as a society, as a species, removed another big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the physical world — boats, planes, trains, horses and the pony express, the mail system — [we have] profoundly changed society. It’s easy for us to see those things looking backwards because we’ve become used to not having the frictions that have been removed. We would never go back, but we’re very used to the remaining friction and how physical things are moved around in the physical world. “You probably have a power drill. You use it one-10,000th of the time, maybe one-100,000th of the time.” \n[Let’s say] you could just snap your fingers and have something magically appear in your hand whenever you wanted it [at] no cost, and it was instantaneous. You have a hammer in your home. You probably have a power drill. You use it one-10,000th of the time, maybe one-100,000th of the time. If that hammer was sitting in some central location, it could be shared by thousands of people, really safely, making everybody wealthier functionally because they would get the hammer when they need it without having to pay for the hammer and drain the world’s resources by making all of these hammers that go almost entirely unused. \nYou have a drawer full of batteries right now in your home, I guarantee you, that are discharging very slowly. Maybe you have a little ziplock bag full of them, because you never know for sure when you’re going to need one and what shape it’s going to need to be. \nBecause you don’t know and because it’s surprisingly inconvenient to go to CVS or Walgreens to get another battery, you just keep all of these batteries in your home that are slowly discharging, most of which will hit zero without you ever using them. You’re wasting the planet in a really dramatic way and the reason you’re doing it is because you can’t just snap your fingers and have that battery appear. \nIf we could move from an ownership society to an access society where having it now wasn’t important… [but] having it when you need it, it would really dramatically, magically, change the world. So in the future, drones will be flying through the air overhead. We won’t own as many things because we’ll be sharing them. Unmanned aerial vehicles will essentially power the sharing economy and reduce our carbon footprint — all of this great stuff. What is the biggest challenge to achieving that right now? \nI don’t want to minimize the challenges for the Wing project. We need to make things that can successful move long distances completely autonomously with very high levels of safety and reasonably inexpensively. That is not a solved problem. \nYou want to make sure that you don’t hit a power line, that if something goes wrong with one of your motors, that you can land elegantly instead of just crashing out of the sky. That when you get where you’re going, the system can cope thoughtfully with where to put the package down and possibly taking a package back or something else. \nThere are a lot of as yet unsolved problems. “I’ve actually already seen designs for skyscrapers that have little mini-heliports sticking outside the window.” Will residences in the future be designed with drone launch pads and landing pads? Will this actually factor into our design and the way we live? \nI’ve actually already seen designs for skyscrapers that have little mini-heliports sticking outside the window so that UAVs can drop packages on people’s windows in high-rises or just outside their windows or maybe land and then someone can take the package right there. I’ve seen those designs, that’s something that we’re working on. I think it’s maybe a little premature to be building buildings like that, but good for them for starting to imagine them. With Project Loon, X is trying to solve problems around internet access, both for the underserved and for people in the developed world who have internet access but want to fill in the gaps. Do you see any potential downside to constant connectivity? \nI sometimes wish my kids would get off their phones, but [I’m not] one of the people who believes that society is being damaged by constant connectivity. I happen, actually, not to be a heavy user of social media. Maybe I’m just missing the addiction, so it doesn’t seem that bad to me, but I believe that this is not the first time that people have panicked that technology or other kinds of innovations in society were going to ruin society. \nRock n roll was heavily billed as destroying the youth of America and somehow the youth of America have survived rock n roll. I rather suspect they will survive Facebook as well. What is the thing or the project that X is doing right now [that] you think will have the most impact on society in five to 10 years? \nI’m not going to pick the favorite of my children. That’s not a winning proposition. But I’m going to give you my honest answer. \nI hope that in the end, when we look back at X 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the process that I’ve described to you our attempt to systematize innovation, to get that balance of crazy optimism and really hard skepticism, married together and balanced [will be] just right. \nIf we can get that right enough and demonstrate enough times that we have at least somewhat systematized innovation, I’m hopeful that that will turn out to be the thing that has the biggest impact rather than any one of the projects that comes out of X. So it’s X’s process, rather than a specific product. \nWhat I’m saying is, what do you think had a bigger impact on the world? Henry Ford’s observation about how to make stuff, or the Model T? I believe that Henry Ford’s bigger impact on the world was the systematization of interchangeable parts in a factory setting. That was even bigger than some of the car-specific stuff that the factory built. \nIn the same way, while I’m very proud of some of the things that have already graduated from X — the self-driving cars, the life sciences project, the deep learning work called Google Brain that went back to Google. I’m very proud of a lot of the things that are currently being brewed here, I am hopeful that in the end the thing that… will have created the most value is the way we’re making them. Will X be around in five to 10 years? \nI don’t know, but you’re welcome to come back in five to 10 years and ask. Will X last as long as Ford has? Ford’s been around for a long time. \nX is certainly intended to go on into the future. Whether it does or not we’ll have to wait and see. \nThis interview has been edited and condensed Credits \nEditorial Lead: Michael Zelenko; Design: Frank Bi, Yuri Victor, James Bareham, William Joel, Georgia Cowley; Photography: James Bareham; Development: Frank Bi, Yuri Victor; Illustrations: Slanted Studios ; Director: Miriam Nielsen; Director of Photography: Ian McAlpin; Sound Recording: Paul Dorough; Gaffer: Keith Cheng; Design and Animation: Lunar North ; Executive Producer: Tre Shallowhorn; Creative Director: James Bareham; Motion Graphics Director: William Joel; Color: Max Jeffrey; Sound Design and Mixing: Andrew Marino.",

This was a significant milestone , thanks to the sheer number of positions that are possible within the game, and the difficulty of creating an AI that could efficiently evaluate them before the heat death of the universe. Now, Blizzard is teaming up with Google to create a next-generation AI capable of playing an actual computer game: Starcraft II. \nAt first glance, this might not seem to make much sense. After all, playing against an “AI” has been a feature of computer games for decades, in everything from first person shooters to RPGs, to chess simulators. The difference between game AI and the kind of AI Google is developing is simple: Most of what we call artificial intelligence in gaming is remarkably bereft of anything resembling intelligence. In many titles, increasing the difficulty level simply gives the computer player more resources, faster build times, inside information about player activities, or loosens constraints on how many actions the CPU can perform simultaneously. It turns the bots into overpowered thugs, but doesn’t really make them better at what they do. Game AI isn’t really what you’d call “intelligent,” and when it breaks, the results can be hilarious \nGame AI typically makes extensive use of scripts to determine how the computer should respond to player activities (we know Starcraft’s AI does this because it has actually been studied in a great deal of depth ). At the most basic level, this consists of a build order for units and buildings, and some rules for how the computer should respond to various scenarios. In order to seem even somewhat realistic, a game AI has to be capable of responding differently to an early rush versus an expansionistic player who builds a second base, versus a player who turtles up and plays defensively. In an RPG, a shopkeeper might move around his store unless he notices you stealing something, at which point a new script will govern his responses to the player. An example of AI scripting in Age of Kings \nGame AI, therefore, is largely an illusion, built on scripts and carefully programmed conditions. One critical difference between game AI and the type of AI that DeepMind and Blizzard want to build is that game AI doesn’t really learn. It may respond to your carrier rush by building void rays, or counter your siege tanks with a zergling rush. But the game isn’t actually learning anything at all; it’s just reacting to conditions. Once you quit the match the computer doesn’t remember anything about your play, and it won’t make adjustments to its own behavior based on who it’s facing. \nThe AI that Google and Blizzard want to build would be capable of learning, adapting, and even teaching new players the ropes of the game in ways far beyond anything contemplated by current titles. It’ll still be important to constrain the AI in ways that allow for humans to win, since games like Starcraft are (to a computer) basically just giant math problems, and an unconstrained CPU opponent can micro at speeds that would make the best Korean players on Earth weep. \nAccording to Oriol Vinyals, a research scientist with Google DeepMind, the company is looking forward to the challenge. “It’s a game I played a long time ago in quite a serious way,” Vinyals told Technology Review . “And as a player, I can attest that there are many interesting things about StarCraft. For instance, an agent will need to learn planning and utilize memory, which is a hot topic in machine learning.” \nIt’s still not clear how easily these initiatives could be translated back into shipping games; Google’s AlphaGo is based on its own custom tensor processing units ( TensorFlow ) and a varying number of CPU and GPU cores ranging from 48 CPUs and one GPU to 1,920 CPUs and 280 GPUs. Either way, you’re not going to be setting up a home system to handle your gaming unless you happen to live in a server room. This doesn’t mean that computer games couldn’t benefit from these kinds of projects, though. If Blizzard can teach an AI how to play Starcraft, it may well be able to teach the AI how to generate scripts and decision trees that accurately model its own play. \nThe idea of an AI that teaches a game how to play Starcraft 2 against humans might sound like science fiction, and neither Google nor Blizzard has proposed anything quite this advanced. But it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s the big-picture, long-term idea. After all, what’s the point of teaching a computer to play Starcraft 2 if humans never get to play against it? Tagged In",

      "text": "At Google I/O earlier this year , the company announced a new service that would be used in a number of its products and services: Google Assistant. Google Assistant is an enhanced version of Google Now, and is currently being featured in Allo, the Pixel, Pixel XL and Google Home. During the Pixel launch event last month , we learned that Google would be opening Google Assistant to developers with APIs they are calling Actions on Google.\nThe main reason why people are enjoying Amazon’s personal assistant, Alexa, so much is because of how many 3rd-party services that can connect to it. It seems like each month the company is rolling out another update with new skills for their customers to take advantage of. If Google Home, and ultimately Google Assistant, is going to be as popular and as useful then it will need a lot of 3rd-party developer support as well. And Google has realized this too.\nGoogle did announce the Actions on Google API during the October launch event, but they did not tell us when they would make it available to developers. While we still don’t have an exact date, we do know these APIs will be open to developers sometime in December. You can check out the landing page for Actions on Google right here , and this will let you sign up to be notified about any news and updates for the service.\nGoogle has a lot of catching up to do if they want Google Assistant to compete with Alexa. We’ll have to wait and see how many 3rd-party developers jump on board once the Actions on Google API has been made available. It’s being reported that Google is already working with a number of brands to get them familiar with the system. These partners include Spotify, CNN, Uber and OpenTable.\nSource: Google \n",

      "text": "Google just released the November security update and around that time we also see the platform’s official distribution numbers as well. This data was recorded during the 7-day period between November 1st and November 7th, and Google reminds us that any version of Android that doesn’t make up at least 0.1% of the platform is not represented here in this graph. Yet, we’re still seeing Android 2.2 Froyo being used by 0.1% of the people who are accessing the Play Store.\nThe big question here is how many people have been able to update to Android 7.0 Nougat since it was released, and now we have our answer. We’re seeing that 0.3% of the platform has received their update and are using the latest version of Android. This is big as Nougat did not make an appearance in any of the previous Android’s distribution reports. This is likely not as high of a percentage as many had hoped, but it’s a start and it will continue to grow over the next year.\nNext up, we have Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which has reached 24% of the overall user base for Android. This is up from 18.7% when compared to the September reports and was to be expected with it being shipped on new phones and more Lollipop devices being updated. Android 5.x Lollipop has actually dropped from 35% in September to 34.1% in November. But then we see that the Android 4.4 KitKat numbers have increased from 27.7% in September to 25.2% this month.\nThe numbers for Jelly Bean this month dropped again. They were sitting at 15.6% in September and are now at 13.7%. Both Ice Cream Sandwich and Gingerbread percentages dropped as well with both of them being on 1.3% of active devices in November when they were at 1.4% and 1.5% respectively in September. So most of the changes we have seen this month were expected, but it was a surprise to see the numbers for Lollipop dropping 0.9% compared to September.\nSource: Android Developers \n",

      "text": "Google launches its Cloud Platform region in Tokyo Posted Don’t take an illegal selfie with your ballot \nGoogle today announced the launch of the Tokyo region of its cloud computing platform. With this, the Google Cloud Platform now features two regions (Tokyo and Taiwan) and a total of six availability zones in Asia. In the Asia-Pacific region, the plan is to also open new regions in Mumbai, Singapore and Sydney over the course of the next year, in addition to new regions in the U.S., Finland, Germany, U.K. and Brazil. \nIn total, Google now offers its users a choice between six regions (most with three availability zones) spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia. Once all the new regions go online next year, Google will offer its Cloud Platform in 14 regions around the world. This still lags the number of data center locations some of its competitors like Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure already offer today, but it’s a far cry from the relatively uncompetitive position Google found itself in only a short while ago. \nOver the last few years, Google also heavily invested in its networking backbone to deliver data between its regions in Asia and the rest of the world. \nAs the company noted today, having a local data center means latency for users in Japan, for example, will likely decrease by 50 to 85 percent when compared to serving up the same content from the existing Taiwan region. \nThe Tokyo region, which uses Intel’s latest Broadwell processors, now offers most of the core Cloud Platform services like Compute Engine and Cloud Storage, as well as Google’s database and analytics services like Cloud Datastore, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud SQL and others. 0",

      "text": "Slingr turns slack into the ultimate task manager Posted Google launches its Cloud Platform region in Tokyo \nSlack is great for taking lunch orders and sharing GIFs with an international team (as us about “Whiplash Wednesday!”) but it breaks down when you try to get real work done. That’s why Slingr exists. \nCreated by experienced product manager Grace F. Schroeder, Slingr was designed first as a platform and then as a product. Shroeder wanted something that a disparate team could use to connect with each other and set up tasks and code maintenance. Her experience at multiple very early cloud startups told her that software as a service was the way to go. \n“In 2006, people were just starting to talk about cloud services. I encountered a few web development shops that were starting to configure tools like Sugar and VTiger for mid-sized companies,” she said. “They constantly complained that those early frameworks had rigid data models, and that ‘cracking’ the data model to get the application to work as the customer expected negated the time savings of having a platform in the first place. That stuck in my head as a problem that would never go away.” \nThe result is Slingr, an platform that connects multiple cloud services together in an enterprise environment. Her initial proof of concept, SlingrPRO, is focusing on Slack integration. \n“Given the rise in popularity of Slack, we decided that the best way to showcase the flexibility of SLINGRPro was to create a dynamic application designed from scratch to help Slack users achieve their business automation/SaaS integration dreams,” she said. “Since we launched the application on the Slack App store in late July to beta customers, we’ve been able to add integrations to the Google Calendar, Google Contacts and most recently, IBM Watson Tone Analyzer. Now Slack users can run their written words through IBM Watson to see what tones will likely resonate with their readers.” \nThe platform has 3,000 active daily user and they’ve raised $2.1M from a small group of angel investors to date. They’ve reinvested proceeds back into the product. \nThe entire platform can do a number of things including rapid application development, UI and REST API auto-generation, and full-stack Javascript application creation. \n“Our plan is to introduce a steady stream of integrations that work ‘out of the box’ with SLINGR/Slack,” she said. \nObviously this is some pretty heady stuff. The way to think about Slingr is it’s an integration platform that connects various services – Google Calendar with Mailchimp with notifications sent to a Slack channel, say – and does it seamlessly and quietly. The value proposition for a big company is pretty clear. \n“In the olden days, when pterodactyls circled the earth, you’d have but a few software vendors sniffing around your door. The angst of decision making was low as long as you stuck to the Big Blues of the world. The only software that took root in the small business in a big way was Microsoft Office,” said Schroeder. “We see the most success in incremental everything. Small, non-disruptive steps that steadily get company data where it does the most good versus the swinging change pendulum that sometimes clock companies senseless.” \nIf Slingr can automate Whiplash Wednesday then I’m all in. 0",

      "text": "Nougat 7.0/7.1 \nIn its latest revision of the Android Compatibility Definition Document , Google has laid down some rather interesting rules not related to Android itself, but rather common device hardware. In the CDD, a new section has appeared that specifically related to the USB Type C standard and charging - a subject that has become increasingly thorny with the proliferation of numerous proprietary fast charging standards. \nWhile the section for now is labeled as \"STRONGLY RECOMMENDED,\" Google is signaling clearly that it could become mandatory: \"in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers.\" \nThe section essentially boils down to this: if you're messing with Vbus voltages in a way that is out of spec, or alter sink / source roles of pins in order to use your proprietary charging method (see: Qualcomm Quick Charge), Google says, well: Don't do that. The language stating that this section could soon become mandatory is clearly meant to send a message to manufacturers and chipset vendors alike to get in line with USB Power Delivery or risk having your product roadmap disrupted by the CDD. \nType-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as \"STRONGLY RECOMMENDED\", in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers \nGoogle's CDD is no stranger to hardware requirements, but this one is clearly rather specifically meant to push the adoption of a standard in the device ecosystem rather than simply ensure the interoperability of Android features. Because, frankly, charging your phone really doesn't have anything to do with an operating system. \nOne final piece of the section specifically does make a requirement of Type C devices: Google has now declared they must detect 1.5A and 3.0A chargers that are part of the Type C resistor standard, and that the device must be able to detect changes in the advertisement (how much power the charger can send). It's not clear how much of a problem this is specifically. \nBut this whole section is interesting, and I would not be surprised if we see further requirements enumerated around USB and charging in future versions of the document.

      "text": "Visitors to Google’s homepage Monday were greeted with a cartoon collection of American flags and posters displaying the word “vote” in a variety of languages. On the eve of Tuesday’s historic election, the patriot Google Doodle served not only as a friendly reminder to vote but also as a useful tool to help users locate their designated polling stations. Twitter feeds and email inboxes were similarly adorned with pre-election prompts that allowed unsure users to enter their address and confirm where exactly they must go to cast their ballots.\nAs the most tech-savvy presidential campaign cycle to date comes to a close, Monday’s mobilization efforts were part of a final online push to get out the vote.\nBack in September, Facebook launched its first-ever national voter registration drive, which placed a reminder to register atop the news feeds of all U.S.-based users ages 18 and up, provided a link to the federal government’s online guide to registering by state,and encouraged users to share their newly registered status with friends in hopes of inspiring others to do the same.\nView photos\nIn September, Facebook launched its first-ever voter registration drive. (Screenshot via Facebook) More Just last week, the social network rolled out a personalized ballot guide , which aims to help users to prepare for Election Day by providing basic information on all of the candidates running for federal, state and local office, depending on their location.\nAnd Yahoo Search also joined the fray:\nDo you know where your local #Election2016 polling place is? Know where to go with @Yahoo Search. https://t.co/rO2elVIcjV pic.twitter.com/kqR4u6y8jn\n— Yahoo Mail (@yahoomail) November 4, 2016\nThe popular car-sharing service Zipcar is also getting into the election spirit with its #drivethevote promotion , offering members free car rentals during select hours on Tuesday in order to help them get to the polls.\nThough not necessarily exclusive to one particular demographic, some initiatives, like Spotify’s “Clarify” series — a collection of audio and video clips in which popular musicians discuss issues like education, immigration and the economy — are more explicitly geared toward engaging young voters.\n“With millions of young people listening to Spotify, we wanted to use the power of our platform to inspire civic engagement,” Kerry Steib , Spotify’s director of social impact said about the series when it was first released in September.\nSteib continued: “Through Clarify, we hope to create a meaningful and entertaining way for music fans to explore the issues and provide information that inspires them to turn out for the polls in November.”",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 8th, 2016 \nAndroid’s biggest problem has always been and always will be fragmentation, though it’s nothing you can really fault Google for. Their updates come in fast, furious, and regularly, but their business model of licensing Android (and their Google Play Services platform) out to any interested manufacturer creates a default bottleneck for getting all Android users on the latest and greatest software. That’s why it aways annoys us when Apple throws salt into that wound and pins all the blame on Google when Google has little say in how OEMs conduct their business. \nBut it seems the company may have a plan to make Apple shut it. In updated Compatibility Design Documents (the rules OEMs must adhere to if they want to ship their Android devices with Google’s love on top), Google seemingly talks about a new system that could “extend” Android’s functionality using shared libraries that OEMs would be forced to include in their Android installations. \nRon Amadeo’s working theory is that these libraries (which currently exist as little more than shells while Googe prepares to make whatever move they’re eyeing) are going to be used like Google Play Services is used now. Google provides new features and functionality for users and developers through updates to Google Play Services, meaning many of Android’s new features can be enjoyed by people as far back as KitKat and maybe even earlier. \nThat isn’t the case with some current OS-level functionality which can only be obtained through firmware updates, though. And that’s what this could change — new, open-source APIs that can be delivered to devices as easily as Google Play can update an app. \nOf course, with that only being speculation and there not being enough information, it’s not worth letting your excitement get the best of you. We don’t know Google’s exact plans nor the extent of whatever it is they’re looking to do. We don’t know if this is serving a more niche purpose or the beginning of a transformation that could solve Android’s biggest issue. Let’s just hope it won’t take long to see exactly where this is going.",

      "text": "Nougat 7.0/7.1 \nThe Android CDD is a tedious document to pick over, largely because very small changes in wording can have very big consequences. While I would hardly call this one \"very big,\" it's still significant: Google has changed the support of standard impedance-based inline headphones controls from a suggestion to a hard requirement. Now, devices with 4-conductor 3.5mm audio jacks must recognize the impedance range and corresponding action it must produce when used on an inline controller. \nMUST support the detection and mapping to the keycodes for the following 3 ranges of equivalent impedance between the microphone and ground conductors on the audio plug: 70 ohm or less : KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK 210-290 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_UP 360-680 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_DOWN \nInline headphone controls are a rather... analog method of device control, but they do have the benefit of generally being widely compatible with most phones these days. Still, some smartphone and tablet manufacturers out there may be utilizing different impedance levels to recognize different actions that conflict with the universal standards for things like volume, and Google is putting its foot down here. The required actions to be recognized are headset recognition (device needs to know a proper headset is connected), volume up, and volume down. Google has kept the voice assist shortcut as an optional feature, though it moved from \"should\" to \"strongly recommended.\" \nIt's a small attempt at reducing fragmentation in the ecosystem, and with USB-C ports replacing 3.5mm jacks on some phones (presumably unaffected by this rule), the impact may be limited. I'm also not sure why this wasn't required before - it's not exactly an onerous technical burden, nor is it at all controversial. Leaving it optional just left manufacturers free to screw up something that should be universal. At least they won't be able to [as easily] anymore. Tags",

      "title": "Google might torpedo Qualcomm Quick Charge in future Android versions",
      "text": "\nNew Android compatibility definitions warn manufacturers against using nonstandard USB charging methods.\nBetween Qualcomm Quick Charge, MediaTek Pump Express, Oppo VOOC, OnePlus Dash Charge, Huawei SuperCharge, Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging and Motorola Turbo Charge, fast charging methods on Android phones are kind of a mess. Some of them overlap, but not all are interoperable, and when you consider that some require not only a custom charger but a specific cable, it's a confusing situation for consumers.\nWhen you also consider the potential safety issues with dodgy USB-C chargers and cables, it's easy to see why Google, as a platform holder, might want to step in.\nIn the latest Android Compatibility Definition Document — which lays out the rules manufacturers must adhere to in order to ship Google-approved Android 7.0 devices — the company lays out some strong recommendations intended to nudge phone makers away from nonstandard USB-C charging methods like Qualcomm QuickCharge. The references, first spotted by Android Police , suggest such changes may come into force in future Android versions.\nFrom the Android 7.0 CCD :\nType-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as \"STRONGLY RECOMMENDED\", in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers.\nThe first part of that quote basically describes Qualcomm QuickCharge over USB-C, as used today on devices like the HTC 10 and LG G5. And the second part telegraphs that device makers should prepare for the hammer to be brought down in some future release.\nUSB Power Delivery, the standard used by Google's Pixel phones, is clearly the preferred way to bring interoperable fast charging to future Android devices. But needless to say, a hard requirement to ditch the likes of Quick Charge over USB-C is sure to ruffle a few feathers. (Qualcomm, for instance, makes money licensing the tech to manufacturers.)\nAP also notes that the new docs require Android 7.0 devices with USB-C to detect both 1.5A and 3.0A chargers, including changes in how much power the charger can send. In theory, this means that standard 3A Type-C chargers should be a relatively reliable way to rapid-charge a vast majority of USB-C Android devices in future.\nWho knows exactly when Google's \"strong recommendations\" against the likes of Qualcomm Quick Charge might turn into a hard requirement. It's possible this could come as soon as Android 7.1.1 (Nougat Maintenance Release 1) when that's finalized in December. More likely, we'll be looking at a longer trajectory, with such a change taking effect in Android O .\nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?

      "text": "Ashley King Nov 8th, 2016 \nGoogle currently offers a wide range of silicone cases for its Pixel and Pixel XL devices, but none of them feature a flip cover which makes the inclusion of magnets on the devices interesting. The phones are uniquely branded by Google, but their roots still lie in HTC’s current host of devices, which include the same magnetic switch that can be used to turn the phone’s screen on or off when placed near magnets. \nAccording to 9 to 5 Google, the magnets can be found around the G logo that’s emblazoned on the back of the device. Placing a magnet there or around that location but in front of the device will trigger the magnetic switch to turn off the display. \nWhile Google itself doesn’t have a flip case available on the Google Store, you can bet case manufacturers will be taking advantage of this newly discovered feature as the Pixel and Pixel XL have sold out quickly and Google is working to make more stock available .",

According to an unconfirmed report today, Lenovo may be about to put the branding it received as part of the deal to more use. The report claims the famous “Moto” brand will be placed on all future Lenovo headsets.\nSee also: Lenovo’s sold 1 million Moto Z handsets globally 1 day ago The report comes from Campaign Asia , citing unnamed sources. There are no other details on when exactly this change will happen. Keep in mind that this report is unconfirmed, so take it with some skepticism. However, the truth is that the Moto brand for smartphones is better known worldwide than Lenovo’s, so it would make sense that this kind of change is in the works.\nThe report comes just a few days after the company released its latest quarterly financial statement , saying that it had sold just over one million units of its recently launched Moto Z phones in its first three months. Lenovo just started selling the Moto M phone in its native China . However, it is still using its own branding for other phones, most notably on the new Phab 2 Pro , the first smartphone that uses Google’s Tango 3D camera mapping technology.\nDo you think Lenovo should go ahead and use the Moto branding for all of its upcoming smartphones, and use its own name for other devices like PCs?",

      "text": "Android's latest update doesn't patch major security flaw According to Google's standard update schedule, a fix for the 'Dirty COW' exploit should arrive next month. Share Save \nThe November Android security update is live and it fixes 15 critical vulnerabilities, but it doesn't patch a major Linux kernel exploit that can give hackers quick and complete access to devices running on Google's OS. Researcher Phil Oester discovered the flaw (CVE-2016-5195) in October, though he believes it's existed since 2007. The exploit is known as \" Dirty COW \" because of its basis in copy-on-write systems (and maybe because that name is adorable). \nWith this month's security update, Google did roll out a \"supplemental\" firmware fix for Dirty COW across Nexus and Pixel devices. Plus, Samsung released a patch for its devices this month, according to T hreatpost . An official Android patch for the Dirty COW issue is expected to land in December. \nOester, the researcher who discovered the flaw, told V3 that it's \"trivial to execute, never fails and has probably been around for years.\" Dirty COW is sophisticated, and Oester said he was only able to catch it because he had been \"capturing all inbound HTTP traffic and was able to extract the exploit and test it out in a sandbox.\" \n\"I would recommend this extra security measure to all admins,\" Oester said.",

      "title": "Google to shut down Map Maker, its crowdsourced map editing tool",
      "text": "Google to shut down Map Maker, its crowdsourced map editing tool Posted Alexa, who is winning the presidential election? \nSince 2008, Google has run an online tool called Map Maker that allows anyone worldwide to contribute data to Google Maps. Now, that tool is shutting down. The company announced today in its online forum for the project that the Google Map Maker service, as a standalone product, is retiring in March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending, the company noted – instead, those will be transitioned to Google’s Local Guides program . \nLocal Guides, to some extent, is a modernized version of the years-old Map Maker service. \nThe older service offered an online tool and editor that let anyone submit updates to Google Maps, which moderators could then approve. The larger goal was to fill out Google Maps with road and business information in less developed regions where detailed local maps were not as readily available. \nHowever, as you may recall, Map Maker’s crowdsourced functionality also got Google into trouble in years past. For example, in 2015, Map Maker was used to vandalize Google Maps with an image of Google’s Android character urinating on the Apple logo. The company had to shut down Map Maker temporarily , following this and other spam attacks and obscene edits. \nEven as Map Maker was struggling to police its community, Google was developing its Local Guides program. \nThe initiative, which began something like Google’s own version of Yelp Elites, today offers a way for volunteers to contribute to Google Maps and Google business listings, in exchange for points, rewards, as well as invites to special events and early access new features. \nGuides can earn points for a variety of tasks, like writing reviews, adding or editing places, posting photos, and more. \nMap Maker, however, offers an expanded feature set, including the ability to edit roads, for example. Its unique feature set will be merged with Local Guides in preparation for the March 2017 shutdown, as well as after Map Maker is closed. \nAs the features become available, they’ll be posted to both product websites: Map Maker Help Forum and on LocalGuidesConnect.com . \nIn addition, starting today, edits submitted to Google Maps will no longer be available Map Maker for moderation. This is so Google can streamline its efforts and speed up the time it takes to publish these edits, says the company. \nThe shutdown makes sense given the overlap between the two initiatives, Map Maker and Local Guides. The shift should also cut down on the spamming and vandalism problems, thanks to the newer systems for editing and approvals. \nHowever, whether or not Google will be able to shift its full set of Map Maker editing tools to the newer platform by the time Map Maker shuts its doors still remains to be seen. \nGoogle used to announce its product shutdowns in larger batches, dubbed ‘ spring cleanings .’ But this time around (and in the fall), the company has been more quietly closing up services without the fanfare. Yesterday, for instance, it shut down its move site, Google Showtimes . \nThe full announcement about Map Maker is below: 0",

Ellement Globe Staff November 08, 2016\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady appeared at the town clerk’s office in Brookline on Monday to fill out an absentee ballot, a vote that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said was cast for him.\nBrady completed his ballot around 8 a.m. at Town Hall, about two hours after he appeared on the Kirk & Callahan radio show and told the WEEI-FM audience that he planned to vote, but without saying who he is supporting in the presidential election.\nAdvertisement\nBrookline officials said Tuesday that Brady not only voted, but also posed for photographs with staff at Town Hall. Under state law, officials can confirm whether a person voted in an election, but cannot disclose how they voted.\nWhile Trump has repeatedly claimed to have the star athlete's backing during the campaign, Brady has kept silent about his choice, even walking away from reporters last month when asked for his views on the election.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here About 12 hours after Brady voted, Trump took the stage in New Hampshire and said he had received a telephone call from him.\nView Story Fans lash out at Brady on Facebook Many are not happy that Donald Trump said he received the Patriots quarterback’s endorsement.\nRead letter Trump says Belichick wrote him\n“Tom Brady,” Trump said Monday evening to a roaring crowd, “great guy, great friend of mine, great, great champion, unbelievable winner. He called today and he said, ‘Donald, I support you, you’re my friend, and I voted for you.’’’\n“This guy is a champ and a winner and he is a great person,” Trump continued. “So I said, Tom, you voted for me, you support me, am I allowed to say it tonight to this massive crowd in New Hampshire? He said, ‘If you want to say it, you can say it.’”\nAdvertisement\nBrady’s wife, model Gisele Bundchen, is not registered to vote in Brookline, according to town officials, On her Instagram account on Friday, Bundchen was asked whether it was true that she and her husband were supporting Trump, and she replied, “No.’’\nTrump also claimed the support of Bill Belichick, reading aloud what he said was a letter from the Patriots head coach praising him for handling “an unbelievable, slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully.”\nAccording to Hingham Town Clerk’s office, Belichick did not vote early and did not fill out an absentee ballot. Belichick’s lives in the town’s fifth precinct and the polling place is at the Hingham Middle School, according to town records.\nRelated Read the letter Donald Trump says Bill Belichick wrote him\nJohn R.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Thomas Farragher Globe Columnist November 08, 2016\nAl Bowers in 1958\nAs a young boy in tiny Royalston, Alan Bowers learned early the value of hard work.\nHe lived across the street from the town library and his great-grandfather – a stern and burly man who ran the local general store – led him there one day in the late 1940s.\nAdvertisement\n“Come with me,’’ the older man told him. Then he presented the kid with one of those old push mowers. Cut the grass, he was told.\nThat was his job, and that’s what he did, recruiting a handful of other neighborhood customers. “I’m making money,’’ Bowers recalled this week. “And I am smiling.’’\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here When he got out of Athol High School in 1955, he got an offer from General Electric to join an apprenticeship program for draftsmen and tool makers. His future seemed set. On a lark, he accompanied a pal who was taking an Air Force entrance test in Chicopee.\nA free day off, he figured. What the heck. He took the test, too.\nThe last thing on Bowers’s mind was a military career. Then, a letter arrived. The Air Force wanted him. And, in an instant, Bowers’s life diverted toward a path that would take him to Lackland Air Force Base and beyond. He climbed the military ladder quickly and found himself in the navigator’s seat of some of the fastest aircraft on earth.\nAdvertisement\n“The mission was to put the bomb on the target,’’ Bowers told me this week at the VA Medical Center in West Roxbury.\nAnd that’s what Major Bowers was doing on Sept. 17, 1972, when he was part of a two-man crew in an OV-10 aircraft over Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh Trail, guiding bombers to their targets. One of the plane’s engines lost power. Bowers and his pilot ejected into the jungle’s triple canopy.\n“I come down through the first layer of the canopy of the jungle and my parachute hits that and starts to come apart,’’ he recalled. “By the time I get to the third one, there’s no parachute left. I hit the ground.’’\nThe impact crushed two vertebrae. Bone fragments ricocheted through his spinal cord. Instant paralysis.\nA few months later, Bowers, who had scaled many of life’s mountains, lay in the Chelsea Naval Hospital. “I’m reaching down and there’s no muscle there. There’s just skin,’’ he said. “And that’s when I realized I’m not going to climb this mountain. We’re going to have a totally different life now.’’\nWhat Bowers has done with that life is nearly as remarkable as the combat mission that shaped it. When the local chapter of the Disabled American Veterans helped him negotiate the thicket of bureaucracy that lay between him and his benefits, he made another life decision.\n“I said, ‘OK. That’s the DAV.’ They can’t get you something that you haven’t earned, but they can get you what you have earned,’’ he said. “I want to be part of that.’’\nSo Bowers went back to work. He climbed through the state organization and, in 2003, began a one-year term as the DAV’s national commander, testifying before Congress about America’s solemn duty to wounded warriors who preserve our freedom.\n“Cut in stone and shaped in bronze are words of wisdom and statues that define our creed and remind us of those who gave us this great gift,’’ he said then. “Certainly, we must include among those who have allowed us to become who we are the many that personally paid the high price of freedom with their arms, legs, eyesight, or mental well-being.’’\nIf his treatment at the VA hospital goes well this week, Al Bowers, now 79, will be at Castle Island on Saturday morning for a 5K race in honor of disabled veterans.\nHe’ll be there to give — not get — a salute, a grateful nod, a pat on the back.\n“It’s a rare opportunity to say thank you to all the other guys and gals who went into the service and did the same thing I did,’’ he told me. “And more.’’\nMore? Hard to believe. But that’s Al Bowers.\nThomas Farragher is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at thomas.farragher@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nJustin Sellers/The Clarion-Ledger via AP\nPoll worker Paris King passed out \"I Voted\" stickers on Election Day in Crystal Springs, Miss.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 08, 2016\nIt’s a favored tradition for people who practice their civic duty and participate in a presidential election: Pick up a coveted “I Voted” sticker when leaving a polling station, and then share a picture of it on social media for all to see.\nBut for many Tuesday, the excitement of getting one of the small oval stickers bearing an American flag never came. Some polling stations, it turns out, just didn’t have them on hand, leaving many feeling left out.\nAdvertisement\n“I didn’t get one,” said a dejected Elisabeth Sweeney, of Woburn. “I was kind of just excited, obviously, because for social media it’s fun. And to wear it today, it shows people it’s important to vote and that you are taking on that responsibility. So I was definitely disappointed.”\nThere’s a reason Woburn was without stickers this year — lack of funding.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here A woman who answered the phone at the city clerk’s office said that due to budget cuts, they decided against the stickers.\nView Story Where to get free stuff with your ‘I voted’ sticker Show the sticker at these restaurants, bars, and shops, and you’ll be rewarded with discounted cocktails, free appetizers, cookies, and more.\n“It’s not supplied by the state, so it’s something we have to do ourselves,” said Diane Stiffler. “It’s one of those things. When the budget goes down, something’s got to go.”\nBrian McNiff, spokesman for the state Elections Division, said it falls on the shoulders of individual cities and towns to stock up on stickers for Election Day. It’s not a requirement, he said, to give away the symbolic adhesive labels to anyone who walks through the doors.\nAdvertisement\n“Some have them, some don’t,” he said, adding that the tradition seemed relatively new. “I think, with the level of voting today, maybe some places just ran out.”\nA North Carolina election-supply company , Intab LLC, is credited with making the stickers a popular Election Day item.\nBeyond being a signifying mark that voters this year could breath a sigh of relief, and put this election behind them, the stickers also allow voters access to certain perks. Places such as Red Apple Farm, in Boston Public Market, give away goodies like doughnuts if a voter stops by their business and flashes the sticker. Other establishments are offering discounts on cocktails, and free appetizers, sandwiches, or cookies.\nA quick scroll through Instagram and Twitter Tuesday revealed handfuls of people sharing pictures of their stickers, proudly exclaiming through images that they had taken part in the democratic process. Some people planted the stickers on their lapels or front of their shirts. Others placed the stickers on their fingers, and tried for a more artistic Instagram shot to share with their followers.\nChristian Ordonez, 19, a first-time voter, didn’t get to do either.\nOrdonez said his polling station in Revere didn’t have the stickers when he arrived. He said he felt as though he was left out of a tradition many have enjoyed before him.\n“I feel as though voting is contributing to the country, and it’s a part of history as well, and a lot of us are first-time voters,” he said. “So [getting a sticker] is all part of the experience.”\nBut he let it be, he said. Ordonez did what counted: He voted.\n“I just forgot about it,” he said.\nUpside: I voted!

Ryan/Globe staff\nVoters cast their ballots in Cambridge Tuesday.\nBy Dylan McGuinness Globe Correspondent November 08, 2016\nAfter casting his ballot at First Church in Swampscott Tuesday morning, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said this year marked the first time he didn’t vote in the presidential election.\n“I’m obviously disappointed about that,” Baker, a Republican, told reporters.\nAdvertisement\n“I said many months ago that I wasn’t going to be able to support Donald Trump for a number of reasons, and I thought Hillary Clinton had believability problems, and nothing has happened in the last nine months to change my mind on that,” the governor said.\nBaker said he has friends voting for Donald Trump and friends voting for Hillary Clinton, and he “respects their decision.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The governor also encouraged Massachusetts voters to turn out and vote in local races.\n“The most important thing is the people need to come out and exercise their right and make sure they vote all the way up and down the ballot, because those state rep and state senate races matter a lot here in the Commonwealth,” he said.\nBaker said he voted no on Question 1 , which would allow the state to license a second slots parlor, yes on Question 2 , which would lift the cap on charter schools, yes on Question 3 , which would limit the sale and production of food from animals kept in tight enclosures, and no on Question 4, which would legalize recreational marijuana.\nDylan McGuinness can be reached at dylan.mcguinness@globe.com .

      "text": "Google has shut down an operation that combined malicious AdSense advertisements with a zero-day attack exploiting Chrome for Android to force devices to download banking fraud malware.\nOver a two-month span, the campaign downloaded the Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng banking trojan on about 318,000 devices monitored by Kaspersky Lab, researchers from the Moscow-based anti-malware provider reported in a blog post published Monday . While the malicious installation files weren't automatically executed, they carried names such as last-browser-update.apk and WhatsApp.apk that were designed to trick targets into manually installing them. Kaspersky privately reported the scam to Google, and engineers from the search company put an end to the campaign, although the timing of those two events wasn't immediately clear.\n\"So far, those behind Svpeng have limited their attacks to smartphone users in Russia,\" Kaspersky Lab researchers Nikita Buchka and Anton Kivva wrote in Monday's post. \"However, next time they push their 'adverts' on AdSense they may well choose to attack users in other countries; we have seen similar cases in the past . After all, what could be more convenient than exploiting the most popular advertising platform to download their malicious creations to hundreds of thousands of mobile devices?\"\nA Google spokesman said a fix for the auto-download vulnerability was being tested in Chrome version 54 and was expected to be \"live 100%\" in version 55. (He didn't respond to a request asking him to elaborate.) He also said an Android security feature known as Verify Apps provided warnings when people tried to install one of the malicious apps. He didn't explain how the malicious advertisements snuck by Google security checks or what company engineers are doing to prevent AdSense from running similar ones in the future. Last week, researchers from a separate security firm named Cylance disclosed a separate malvertising campaign on Google AdWords that targeted Mac users.\nKaspersky Lab researchers said it was clear from lulls in the campaign that someone or something inside Google detected and removed many of the malicious ads distributing the Svpeng installation files. But even after old ones were expelled, new ones managed to take their place.\n\"The high rates and abrupt changes in the number of detections are easy to explain: Google has been quick to block the ads that the trojan uses for propagation,\" the researchers wrote. \"However, this is a reactive rather than proactive approach—the malicious ads were blocked after the trojan was already on thousands of Android devices. It is also worth noting that there were multiple occasions in the past two months when these ads found their way on to AdSense; similar attacks have been occurring up to the present time, with the most recent attack registered on 19 October 2016.\"\nMonday's report is yet another reminder why it's generally a good idea not to change default Android settings preventing the installation of apps not carried in the official Google Play app bazaar. It also reaffirms the importance of remaining highly skeptical of webpages encouraging users to install files. Google deserves credit for quickly removing malicious ads and creating safety nets such as Verify Apps and a default prohibition on installing third-party apps, but as the Kaspersky Lab researchers point out, these approaches reactively treat the symptoms rather than curing the underlying disease.",

      "title": "Microsoft just patched the critical Windows vulnerability revealed by Google last week - The Verge",
      "text": "share As promised, Microsoft today patched Windows to resolve a critical system vulnerability that Google’s security team publicized last Monday. The search giant controversially chose to acknowledge the bug before Microsoft had fixed it, claiming that hackers were already actively targeting it. As noted by ZDNet , the fix is contained in today’s release of monthly security patches. According to Microsoft’s security bulletin , any attacker who tricked a user into running a “specially-crafted application” could successfully exploit the vulnerability and gain the ability to “install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.” Microsoft believes that Strontium, a Russia-linked group, is responsible for launching “low-volume spear phishing attacks” that took advantage of the flaw, which leveraged vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the Windows kernel. Even before today’s monthly patch release, Microsoft said the attack could be detected by enabling Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. (And people using Microsoft Edge as of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update were apparently protected.) Still, Windows VP Terry Myerson voiced displeasure with Google’s quick public callout of the problem. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” he wrote in a blog post last week. To be certain you’re in the clear, ensure that your Windows PC is updated with all of Microsoft’s latest security patches as of today. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Google has added a new classification to its Safe Browsing initiative to better protect users from malicious websites trying to game the system.\nGoogle's Safe Browsing warns users when they are about to visit a website known to violate the web giant's policies on malware, unwanted software, phishing or social engineering. The warning appears until Google verifies that the site in question no longer poses a threat to users. But some sites are only cleaning up their act just long enough to shake the warning, and then returning to their harmful behavior. \nThat gap in user protection led Google to create a new label to warn users of sites that engage in this pattern.\n\"Starting today, Safe Browsing will begin to classify these types of sites as \" Repeat Offenders ,\" Google explained in a company blog post Tuesday. \"Please note that websites that are hacked will not be classified as Repeat Offenders; only sites that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the policy.\" \nOnce classified as a \"repeat offender,\" sites will not be allowed to request a review for 30 days. During that time, users will continue to see messages warning them of the risk involved in visiting the site.",

      "text": "share Today, Google announced that its Map Maker tool , which let users edit information and suggest changes in Google Maps, will be shut down in March of 2017 . In its place, the same editing and suggestion features will be migrated to the main Google Maps app as part of the company’s Local Guides program , which rewards people for policing and improving local mapping data for their community by granting access to beta features and gifting Google Drive storage. Map Maker initially started in 2008 as a way to crowdsource information from rural areas that Google’s own toolset was ill-equipped at obtaining on its own. Over time, the community of Map Maker editors and moderators, who were tasked with overseeing and approving changes made to public data on Google Maps, grew into a group of millions of users. Some of the user behaviors that originated on Map Maker eventually informed new features found in the public version of Google Maps, including the ability to add new places and describe existing locations with more detail . However, the Map Maker community was not without its fair share of bad press. The most high-profile incident occurred last year, when a Map Maker user snuck in an elaborate drawing of the Android robot urinating on an Apple logo . This led to the Map Maker tool being temporarily shut down while Google revamped its moderation practices. Now, by relying on Local Guides’ rewards program instead of allowing anyone and everyone to submit edits, the Maps team may see an uptick in helpful reviews, location edits, and user-generated info.",
