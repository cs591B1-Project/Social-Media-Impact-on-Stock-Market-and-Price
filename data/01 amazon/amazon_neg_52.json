You have a few options, but today, one of them is on sale. \nYou can get an unlocked, certified refurbished iPhone 6s for over 20 percent off in one of today's Cyber Week Gold Box Deals on Amazon. Some are as much as $150 off. \nIf you know Apple, you know that they never put their merchandise on sale so this is pretty big. Amazon’s certified refurbished program takes previously used devices and restores them to near-mint condition. So they look and work like new, and even come with a warranty.",

      "text": "29.99 Acer Chromebook R 13 Convertible ($349.99, SAVE $50) \nThe Acer Chromebook R 13 is arguably the hottest Chromebook of this year. It almost seems like Acer has taken a hint from Asus and its ZenBook line of premium, aluminum laptops that put heavy emphasis on good looks. This 13-incher is light, slim, sleek, and convertible: everything a casual user or a busy student might want from a laptop. \nActually, the Chromebook R 13 goes beyond everything. Its Full HD display uses IPS technology for wide viewing angles and accurate color representation. If your eyesight is exceptionally great, you could use the native resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, or you can increase the scaling to make everything larger and more legible. \nThe screen sits on a hinge that supports 360-degree rotation, allowing you to choose from 4 different modes: notebook, display, tent, and tablet. This way, you can write an essay or create a PowerPoint presentation just like you would on a laptop with a traditional hinge, then switch to the tent mode to show it off to your classmates or colleagues, and, finally, turn the laptop into a tablet to watch your favorite YouTube show as a reward. \nUntil recently, Chromebooks were confined mostly to Chrome, the popular web browser, but that’s no longer the case. Google has been rolling out updates for popular Chromebooks, including the Acer Chromebook R 13. “I received the Chromebook on the 5th. I have had 2 updates since that time, and have been able to install and use Google Play Store in Stable mode,” said K. Jennings on November 13, 2016, in an Amazon review. In other words, after you turn on your new R 13 and install all updates, you will be able to access all Play Store apps just like you can on your Android smartphone or tablet. Asus ZenFone Zoom Unlocked Phone, 64GB (U.S. Warranty) ($199, SAVE $200) \nAsus makes attractive smartphones with premium specifications that rarely ever fail to receive raving reviews from tech reviewers. Unfortunately, as all high-end products do, they often cost more than you might be willing to pay. Well, that won’t be true at all on Cyber Monday. Amazon has cut $200 from the original price of the 64 GB version Asus ZenFone Zoom smartphone , making it one of the best current smartphone deals. \nThings look fairly regular on the front side: a sharp 5.5-inch IPS full HD display protected by the Gorilla Glass 4 technology, 5 MP camera, and very narrow bezels that give the device a decisively premium look. But look at the back and you’ll discover the world’s thinnest camera with 3X optical zoom and an innovative 10-element lens from HOYA. Indeed, a dream-come-true for all avid mobile photographers. \nInternals of the Asus ZenFone Zoom are equally impressive: an Intel 2.3GHz Quad Core processor with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. Zoom’s PowerVR 6430 graphics-processing unit is perfect for playing the latest Android games, and the phone’s large battery helps you stay in the game for several hours. Overall, a great smartphone with virtually no flaws—at a ridiculously attractive price. Amazon Fire TV ($74.99, SAVE $15) \nIf you still haven’t turned your HDTV into a smart entertainment hub, now is a great chance for you to do so. Amazon is offering their Fire TV for just $74.99 , a small price for a huge bag of fun. The Fire TV is a 4K-ready gateway to over 7,000 apps and games, 300,000 TV episodes, and countless songs from your favorite artists. \nThe small, black box hides a powerful quad-core processor, dedicated graphics engine, and 2 GB of memory, resulting in over 75% more processing power over the previous generation. With Fire TV’s highly efficient HEVC video encoding, you can enjoy high-definition content without clogging up your internet connection. \nBuilt directly into the Fire TV is Alexa Voice Remote, the brain behind Amazon Echo. You can simply tell her the name of the show you would like to watch, and she will instantly put it on. Want to skip a cringeworthy scene? Just say, “Alexa, fast forward a minute.” \nLast but not least, you can cast video from your Android smartphone with the Fire TV, and you can also enhance your Fire TV experience by installing the Fire TV Remote App on your smartphone to use it instead of the regular remote that’s included with the Fire TV. Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd Generation) – Works with Amazon Alexa ($199, SAVE $50) \nLearning thermostats from Nest have been a popular way how to enter the world of connected smart-home gadgets. This sleek device quietly monitors your temperature preferences, learning what temperature you prefer at any given time of the day. It can display the current temperature on its bright screen, which automatically lights up as you walk across the room. \nBecause Nest knows how to make you comfortable in the most energy-efficient manner, it can save you an average of 10-12 percent on heating bills and 15 percent on cooling bills. You can control it remotely via Nest’s Android app . The app lets you adjust the temperature, see your energy usage, view and edit your thermostat schedule, get extreme temperature alerts, and much more. You can also connect it with other Nest smart gadgets, such as Nest Protect or Nest Cam. SanDisk 128 GB Class 10 micro SD Memory Card ($29.99, SAVE $50) \nAmazon has partnered with SanDisk, an American manufacturer of flash memory products, to produce a microSD card that’s guaranteed to be compatible with all Amazon devices, such as the Fire Tablet and Fire TV. Of course, it will also work with just about any other tablets, smartphones, cameras or computers that uses a 128 GB microSD card . \nIt usually retails for $79.99, but you can get it for just $29.99 on Cyber Monday. As a Class 10 card, its performance is more than sufficient for full HD video playback and recording. 128 GB of storage space lets you store approximately 45,600 photos or 260 SD or 130 HD movies or 32,000 songs, depending on their quality.",

It’s not uncommon for them to cost as much as $100, so why not gamble on this deal today? Safe to say it’s a great bet.\nBUY IT NOW: $32.99 \n\nThe BroBible team writes about gear that we think you want.

As long as `kindlegen` is callable globally (e.g. you've put it in `/usr/bin` or somesuch), there's no difference in how you call booksnake:```shell```### Preventing Sends, or Keeping FilesIf you want to prevent booksnake from deleting the files after downloading and sending, you can pass the `--keep` flag:```shellbooksnake --keep --query \"Great Expectations\"```You can combine this with `--no-send` if you want to _only_ download and convert the file, and not send it:```shellbooksnake --keep --no-send --query \"Great Expectations\"```",

Am hoping that this may help anyone that might have bought the Xbox One S FIFA 17 bundle from Amazon over the last few days as a Christmas present for their kids, or even just for themselves. I bought my X Box One S FIFA 17 Bundle on Black Friday for £259.99 as a present for my two boys and today when I logged onto Amazon it has now gone down to £234.99. I have emailed Amazon customer service asking if they will refund the difference, as I don't want to cancel the order if I can help it (am waiting for their reply at the moment). Deal Tags: ",

Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.\" The idea of \"a move... toward a future\" resonates with what Fidel's brother Raul Castro said about the death: \"Ever onward, to victory.\" The tendency, for everyone, is to think that whichever way they're headed is forward. But there are some people who speak of \"taking our country back,\" which sounds like a journey into the past. Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again\" seems to express the same sentiment, but it's reframed — carefully, I think — to give the feeling of looking into the future.

In my parents’ generation, there is also still a lot of loyalty.\" \"In my generation, you’ll see more differences. In a large portion of the young people, what you will see is apathy.\" From a NYT piece about how young people in Cuba are reacting to the death of Fidel Castro. There's another post linking to the Castro obituary. Please limit comments here to the subject of generational differences in reacting to a big political event. You don't have to limit yourself to reactions to the death of Castro. In fact, let me get the expansion going in a good direction by adding something from the November 13th episode of \"This American Life,\" which was about reactions to Trump's victory in the American election. We hear from Janelle, a young black comedienne, who says that \"all the older black people\" she's talked to are not surprised that Trump won. The mother does not speak on the radio show. We're not told the specific age of the mother or daughter, and we only hear the daughter's presentation: I called her thinking she would be even worse than me, and she was so chill that it was surprising. I called her, and I was like, can you believe this? And she was like, you know where we live.... It's kind of resigned. I feel like that's how black people are. We're just like, this is how it's gonna be. And you get little moments of reprieve. Like, I guess Obama here and there. But it always comes back. Like, we're just always waiting for the shoe to drop. And it's an ever-present thing that we have to deal with, this feeling of being just always, this [BLEEP] is dangerous is how I feel, you know. [BLEEP] surrounded Whereas maybe before, I had forgotten. That's what happens. You forget. And then this [BLEEP] happens. And you're like, oh yeah. We know where we live, like my mother says. Like, that's basically what she was saying, like, oh, you forgot.... It just calmed me down. I'm not, like, oh, now everything's going to be fine. I'm still like, people are just on alert.

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 26, 2016 \"But beyond anything else, it was Mr. Castro’s obsession with the United States, and America’s obsession with him, that shaped his rule.\" \"After he embraced Communism, Washington portrayed him as a devil and a tyrant and repeatedly tried to remove him from power through an ill-fated invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, an economic embargo that has lasted decades, assassination plots and even bizarre plans to undercut his prestige by making his beard fall out. Mr. Castro’s defiance of American power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion.... In a 1985 interview in Playboy magazine, he was asked how he would respond to President Ronald Reagan’s description of him as a ruthless military dictator. “Let’s think about your question,” Mr. Castro said, toying with his interviewer. 'If being a dictator means governing by decree, then you might use that argument to accuse the pope of being a dictator.' He turned the question back on Reagan: 'If his power includes something as monstrously undemocratic as the ability to order a thermonuclear war, I ask you, who then is more of a dictator, the president of the United States or I?'\" From the very long obituary in the NYT for Fidel Castro , who has died at the age of 90.

      "title": "Amazon Mum as Sellers Plea for Missing Funds",
      "text": "  Sellers failed to receive satisfactory answers from Amazon when their regular disbursements failed to show up in their bank accounts on Monday as promised in email notifications they had received on Saturday. Sellers who inquired about their missing funds received canned responses or were told there was no problem on Amazon's end and to simply wait. This discussion board thread shows the frustrations some sellers had in dealing with overseas customer support representatives. When sellers notified EcommerceBytes of the problem on Wednesday, we immediately reached out to Amazon for answers and reported the problem in yesterday's 411 newsletter. While a spokesperson would not provide an on-the-record statement or specific information about when sellers should expect to receive their funds, some sellers began receiving emails from Amazon Wednesday evening in which it acknowledged a technical issue. Hello from Amazon, Due to a technical issue, the disbursement we initiated to your bank account on 11/19/16 failed. This disbursement was resent to your bank account on file on 11/22/16. Please allow 3 to 5 business days for the funds to arrive in your bank account. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank you for selling on Amazon. Regards, Amazon Services Especially concerning are reports that Amazon sent instructions with this week's already delayed disbursements requesting that the funds not be released to recipients until Friday: \"Just got off the phone with my bank, payment was sent but they stated with the payment not to release the funds until Friday or their account would be overcharged.\" \"This happened to us as well, my bank says that Amazon made the funds only available for Friday and that they could not disperse until Friday...that is just great.\" eBay recently had its own problems that impacted seller funds, and these kinds of incidents raise questions about marketplace cash-flow issues. Amazon is notoriously close-lipped, which is its prerogative. But that's not the case when it comes to money it owes sellers, who are small businesses and individuals with their own cash-flow issues. Finally this morning, one seller reported having received their disbursement: \"I received payment this morning/overnight. So hopefully everyone else is not far behind.\"",

      "text": "Deal: Amazon selling Huawei's iPad Mini competitor at 20% off Deal: Amazon selling Huawei's iPad Mini competitor at 20% off Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Deals - Deals + Huawei - Huawei + The Huawei MediaPad M3 has been around for long. In fact, the slab only launched in the US last week as what many consider to be a decent Android-based competitor to Apple's stagnating Apple iPad Mini series. When a product gets launched, it usually maintains its original retail price for a few good weeks at least. As it turns out, however, that's not the case for the Huawei MediaPad M3 , which Amazon is already selling at a discounted price.You can get your hands on a Huawei MediaPad M3 from Amazon at $239. That's a $60 (20%) discount compared to the previous price and a great price give the M3's hardware specs. Although the tablet is available in both silver and gold, only the latter is available at this discounted price. At $239, it's hard to find a better compact Android tablet than the Huawei MediaPad M3. The highlights of the slab include an aluminum body that only measures 7.3mm across the waist, an 8.4-inch display running at 2560 by 1600 pixels, a 2.3GHz octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable integrated storage. Other specs include a 5100mAh battery, as well as 8MP camera sensors on both the front and the back. Although the M3 is available in LTE-capable flavors in other regions, only the Wi-Fi model is available in the US. On the software side, the Huawei MediaPad M3 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the manufacturer's own Emotion UI on top.",

      "text": "By K. Thor Jensen 11.04.2015 :: 12:01PM EST kthorjensen \nYou have to hand it to Jeff Bezos. He took an idea that nobody thought would work — selling books on the Internet — and transformed it into the retail story of the 21st century. Amazon.com has grown from those humble beginnings to the provider of just about everything. They partner with vendors around the world who specialize in some truly bizarre products and sell them without judgement. \nWe went on a deep dive into the bowels of Amazon’s recommendation engine, seeking out items that were so far from the top sellers that they might as well be invisible. What we found was frightening – some of the most insane items ever made for retail. From celebrity pillows to marijuana for dogs, here are the eleven funkiest things you can buy on Amazon right now. Goosh Pants \nOne of the cardinal rules of Internet shopping is this: never buy pants online. Usually it’s because judging their fit is impossible without access to a changing room, but in the case of the “ Goosh Pants ” that sell for $14.99 on Amazon, it’s because they’re printed with disgustingly photorealistic pee and poop stains. If your idea of a solid Halloween costume is “incontinent person,” the Goosh Pants are going to be a dream come true. We’re just waiting for them to make “Sexy Goosh Pants” for women. Five Pounds Of Replica Fat \nAs Amazon has grown as a retailer, it’s started colonizing specialist niches where it could make a profit. One of those niches is medical supplies. Plenty of companies that used to sell their wares through grainy mail-order catalogs have come to the global marketplace with disturbing results. The Anatomical Chart Company is a leading manufacturer of supplies for medical instruction, including human skeletons and other fun stuff. This immense lump of faux human fat is designed to illustrate the toll that obesity takes on your body, but we can’t see that much of a market for it. Old Asian Man Wall Decal \nWall decals, for some reason, have become big business on Amazon. It’s probably because they’re cheap to produce to order, meaning that retailers don’t have to warehouse slow sellers. Obviously, giant stickers of NFL logos or pro wrestlers sell at a pretty brisk pace, but once you start diving into the bowels of the wall decal industry things get a little bizarre. Meet the Old Asian Man Wall Decal , a two foot high replica of a middle-aged Sino-American in a button down shirt just waiting to be placed over your desk to guilt you into studying harder. Runny Nose Shower Gel Dispenser \nWe tried to stay away from products that were obviously sold for comedic value in this list – there are plenty of jokesters out there with wacky ideas looking to make a buck. But there’s something so utterly nauseating about the Runny Nose Shower Gel Dispenser that earned it a spot. Load this thing up with your favorite liquid soap and then press the schnozz to make it drip listlessly from the right nostril. I’m sure that’s a fetish for somebody, but please don’t explain it to me in the comments. Face Slimmer \nAmazon is chock full of ludicrous beauty supplies. Nobody ever went broke overestimating the vanity of the American populace, so the site runneth over with creams, soaps, and other devices designed to improve the way you look. Probably the most ridiculous of the lot is this “ Face Slimmer ,” which will run you $11.50 plus free shipping. Allegedly, if you keep this plastic mouthpiece in your gob for three minutes a day, it will exercise your facial muscles and prevent wrinkles. In reality, it probably just gives you incredible jaw cramps. Nicolas Cage Pillowcase \nAmazon has, in some ways, turned into a massive version of the “grey market” retailers that travel from street fair to street fair selling potentially bootleg DVDs and other less than salubrious products. How else to explain this pillowcase emblazoned with the likeness of actor Nicolas Cage , which you can have delivered to your door for the low price of $10.14 plus shipping. Pot For Pets \nMarijuana is legal in Amazon’s home state of Washington, but scientists generally agree that cannabis is pretty dangerous for household animals. That hasn’t stopped someone from selling Pot for Pets, a cannabis extract that you can administer to your cat or dog to deal with “certain health issues in pets.” Of course, they don’t come out and say what it really does, but Amazon will charge you $49.95 for it and ship it right to your door. What’s next – Heroin for Hounds? Cocaine for Cats? PCP for Parakeets? Kaylen’s Hand Butt Plug \nSex toys are a booming industry, and it’s only natural that Amazon would want a piece of that action. Pretty much every fetish is represented in the site’s virtual aisles, but possibly the weirdest thing in our opinion is the “ Kaylen’s Hand ” butt plug. Described as a “life-size replica hand” that will enable you to “master the next level of insertions,” it’s a creepy plastic mitt that holds its fingers in a tapered style for effective butt stuffing. Creepily enough, Amazon’s “Frequently Bought Together” box shows Kaylen’s Hand with two other silicone hands for anal action. 55 Gallons Of Lube \nIt’s a retail truism that if you want to save money, it’s good to buy in bulk. So if you’re a person who has a lot of sex – like, a whole lot of sex – why not invest in a 55 gallon drum of personal lubricant ? We’re talking a staggering 522 pounds of water-based lubricant, suitable for use with just about any device. That’s easily enough slime to get Godzilla ready for action. You’ll have to spend $1,275 to take this home to your apocalypse bunker or sex dungeon, but that’s still a massive savings over buying this much lube in more portable containers. Infant Circumcision Trainer \nWe could spend all day sharing weird medical devices that you can buy on Amazon, but we’ll cap it off with the Infant Circumcision Trailer . Cutting a little bit of your newborn son’s penis off is a religious and cultural tradition that’s coming under some scrutiny in recent years, but this product does answer a very real question: how do you practice trimming baby dicks? Obviously, with a disturbingly realistic newborn pelvis that comes with a number of foreskins to choose from. Badonkadonk Land Cruiser \nOne of the most bizarre items up for sale on Amazon is the “ JL421 Badonkadonk ,” a vehicle that wouldn’t look out of place in Mad Max: Fury Road . At a bargain price of just a hair under $20,000, the Badonkadonk is a customized vehicle designed to traverse your wasteland of choice at a bracing top speed of 40 miles per hour. Boasting a fully carpeted interior, a 400 watt sound system and a rubberized skirt to protect the wheels, this whip will get you some serious looks – and a ticket, because it’s not street legal.

      "text": "Reply I just happened to be looking at this yesterday. Good deal, but Amazon have had it at £120 for last few weeks. I think it's one of those 'aspirational RRPs' that Creative apply. A bit like Dyson charging £1 for a vacuum cleaner :) Its follow up - the Roar Pro is currently around £150. From what I've read, it's not that much of an improvement over the roar 2 (this model), which is already considered pretty decent so still a good find OP. :)",

It's like saying fanatics debate whether a Ferrari is actually faster than a Skoda... no, it actually is!! Why do I have an HDR setting in my menu then? For the same reason a Skoda has 160MPH on the speedometer. Makes you THINK you can go really fast. You can't. My Skoda has 170 on the speedo and does 144. It does go really fast. Make a more valid point.",

      "text": "Amazon has cast Anil Kapoor in its pilot The Book of Strange New Things.\nThe Indian actor and producer, whose credits include Slumdog Millionaire and 24, will play the role of Vikram Danesh, the authoritative head of the base on Oasis. Based on the cult-hit novel from Michael Faber, the hourlong drama pilot follows a priest who is sent into space to help found a new colony, but what he ends up discovering not only puts his faith to the test but life as we know it.\nMatt Charman (Bridge of Spies) will pen the pilot and executive produce alongside Andy Harries (Strike Back) and Lila Rawlings of Left Bank Pictures. Kevin MacDonald (The Last King of Scotland) will direct. The pilot is a co-production of Amazon Studios and Left Bank Productions.\nIn addition to being recognized with a SAG award for his role on Slumdog Millionaire and serving as president of the fictional Republic of Kamistan on Fox series 24, Kapoor also starred opposite Tom Cruise in 2012's Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.\nThe actor also acquired the remake rights to 24 and made a series that changed the face of Indian television. The drama went on to become the most awarded Indian television show of 2014 with 32 nominations and 16 wins, including the Indian Television Academy Award for best actor for Kapoor's portrayal of the lead role of Jai Singh.\nKapoor is repped by David Unger at Three Six Zero Entertainment.",
