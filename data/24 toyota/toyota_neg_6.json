      "text": "The Boston Globe MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images Toyota has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit and pay approximately $3.4 billion to owners of trucks and SUVs in the United States who complained that their vehicles lacked proper rust protection. \nAuto industry Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle truck lawsuit \nToyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by US pickup and sport utility vehicle owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. Court filings show that the settlement reached Oct. 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008, and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. The settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. — ASSOCIATED PRESS \nPharmaceuticals to be safe for the heart \nA new study may reassure millions of arthritis sufferers seeking pain relief without bad side effects. It finds that Celebrex, a drug similar to ones withdrawn 12 years ago for safety reasons, is no riskier for the heart than some other painkillers that are tough on the stomach. The government required Pfizer, Celebrex’s maker, to do the safety study after the popular arthritis drug Vioxx was withdrawn. The study tested Celebrex against prescription-strength ibuprofen or naproxen in 24,000 people with heart disease or a high risk for it. The drugs proved similar on heart risks and Celebrex caused fewer stomach problems. Results were discussed Sunday at an American Heart Association conference and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. — ASSOCIATED PRESS",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection.\nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008.\nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit \nPosted 2:15 p.m. today   You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By JOSH BOAK, AP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \n ",

      "text": "View Comments Print By JOSH BOAK -   \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \n ",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. Related content",

      "title": "Toyota Agrees to $3.4 Billion Rust Dispute Settlement",
      "text": "Toyota has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit and pay approximately $3.4 billion to owners of trucks and SUVs in the United States who complained that their vehicles lacked proper rust protection.\nThe agreement relates to some 1.5 million Toyota Tacomas, Sequoias and Tundras sold in the United States by the Japanese manufacturer between 2005 and 2010.\nPlaintiffs allege that the frames in the vehicles did not undergo proper rust prevention during manufacturing, causing them to corrode prematurely.\nUnder the agreement, which was filed Wednesday and is still subject to court approval, Toyota admitted no wrongdoing.\nHowever it has offered to inspect the affected vehicles and replace their frames free of charge. It will also reimburse owners who have already made the replacement at their own expense.\nAnother motion filed by the manufacturer stated that Toyota disputes the accusations but found the agreement a reasonable and fair way to end the controversy.",

      "text": "BBC ^ | 11/13/16 \n 16:51 PM PST by LibWhacker \nThe world's biggest carmaker, Toyota, has agreed to settle a US Federal class action for up to $3.4bn (£2.7bn). \n[...] \nThat was based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and inspection costs of about $90m, at $60 per vehicle. \nThe Japanese carmaker Toyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement. \n[...] \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased in order to ascertain if frames need to be replaced at company expense. \nThey will also reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years.

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Toyota to Pay $3.4 Billion to Settle U.S. Truck Rust Claims November 14, 2016 Comments Toyota Motor Corp. has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n“We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,” Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys’ fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement. \n(Reporting by David Bailey in Minneapolis; Editing by Bernard Orr) Copyright 2016 Reuters.

The dealership hopes that the promotional offer will bring in additional traffic during the notoriously competitive weekend in the automotive market place beginning Friday, November 25.\nTampa Bay, FL (PRWEB) November 14, 2016\nMorgan Automotive Group recently announced plans to offer 3-day/ 4-night luxury cruises for 2 at Toyota of Tampa Bay on Black Friday. The dealership located at 1101 E Fletcher Ave in Tampa, FL will officially open at 8:30 am to kick-off the holiday shopping weekend.\nThe dealership will have up to 35 promotional cruise certificates on hand and will be distributing them on a first-come, first-serve basis. In order to qualify for the 4-day/3-night luxury cruise for 2, customers are required to be among the first 35 to take a test-drive and receive a personalized Quote: from a designated sales professional. They are not, however, required to purchase or lease in order to receive the promotional gift.\n\"Customers have so many choices on where to go during Black Friday, with this promotion we want to give them an incentive to come here first. The main thing that we didn't want to do was to trick people and build the price of the cruise into the lease or purchase price, that's not what we're about,\" said Dan Sills, General Sales Manager on the decision to make the cruise a no purchase necessary promotion.\n\"We just wanted them to stop by and see just how great our staff is. We really do believe in a 'Fast, Friendly, Fair & Fun' experience, and why not, you might just take home a cruise!\" he added.\nAlthough Toyota of Tampa Bay is limiting the luxury cruise prize packages to November 25th, they will be including $500 gift cards with new Toyota leases and purchases throughout the entire weekend. The dealership is also planning to aggressively price three 2017 models from $99 per month to increase foot traffic.\nAbout Morgan Automotive Group\nThe story of Morgan Auto Group starts out with Larry Morgan acquiring a Clearwater-based retail tire business in 1991. Over the years, the vision has gotten bigger, and today Larry Morgan and his son, Brett Morgan, own and operate the entire auto group.

      "title": "2018 Toyota C-HR Hybrid Euro-Spec First Drive: Toyota’s New Sub-RAV4 Crossover",
      "text": "  \nOnly late in the day did Toyota decide to bring the C-HR to the U.S. It was conceived just for Europe. But it’s just as well the plan changed because this feels like a new chapter from Toyota. Its design and dynamics show a fresh intent, focus, and commitment. \nThe compact crossover segment is on fire in Europe; it amounts to almost one in six cars sold across the continent. The C-HR’s dimensions are similar to the previous-generation RAV4’s, but the crossovers that really shift the units in Europe are more carlike, less SUVish than that. Yes, even less SUVish than a RAV4. The first-generation Nissan Rogue (called Qashqai there) really opened the floodgates. Er, but has Toyota’s forgotten its own original RAV4? \nC-HR project director Hiro Koba has an engaging candor not often seen in Japanese engineers. “There are now so many compact crossovers; Toyota is late,” he said. “So we need to be distinctive. Customers for these vehicles want a crossover for style. They mostly travel alone or with one passenger. So I traded rear room and visibility and luggage space for style.” \nThe main burglar of practicality is the heavily tapered rear cabin and sloping tailgate. In that quaint Japlish that gives many cars their nameplates, C-HR stands for Coupe-High Rider. The design execution is honest to that name. Sure, you can’t see out of the rear seats on account of the thick pillars. But in that respect if in few others, a Rolls-Royce is no different. \nIn side view the sheetmetal is bashed with an inclined X formation, and black rockers lift the body sides. At front and rear, angular light clusters stand proud. The tail has aero devices at three heights, although any anti-lift properties they may or may not bestow will be lost on a city car. \nIt’s too common to open the door of a radically designed car and find a drab, workaday cabin. Not here. Unusual colors and textures lift it, and a diamond motif catches the eye in all sorts of unexpected places. Plus the material quality reaches a new level for Toyota. The designers even won a battle for climate-control buttons that pick up the theme rather than cheaping out on off-the-shelf items. \nThe C-HR’s dimensions were going to be smaller still, which probably explains why U.S. sales didn’t initially enter the project team’s thoughts. It was meant to be on a smaller existing platform. But Koba is a keen driver and didn’t rate its dynamics. More evidence of Toyota’s new commitment. \nSo Koba hung in for the Toyota New Global Architecture to be ready. That meant going up in size, probably no bad thing given the package-inefficient styling. And it gave a much lower center of gravity, a more rigid body, and A-arm rear suspension. And a size of car that was suddenly more suitable for U.S. taste. \nBroadly, this is a Prius platform, although the C-HR is shorter and wider has slightly different suspension geometry and even race-type ball joints in the rear suspension in search of cornering precision. \nThe Prius connection also runs to the powertrain, with the same fourth-generation front-drive 1.8-liter hybrid system available. As of this writing, Toyota hasn’t specified what will go under the hood of the U.S. version. Toyota will give clues in time for its L.A. show debut later this month. Europe also gets the option of a new 1.2-liter turbo gas engine with either a front-drive manual or AWD and CVT. \nOn the road, the chassis is well-honed. You can sense the body’s stiffness and the low center of gravity with every mile. Although the seating point is higher than a regular hatchback, the C-HR feels planted and true. It sways little in corners, yet in the straights you can tell it does without stiff anti-roll bars. It lopes along with surprising suppleness. Yet there’s plenty of agility in the steering and accurate, consistent reactions as you load it up. \nBut the consistency falls out of bed with the hybrid system onboard. In town it moves ahead with delightful, quiet smoothness. But demand more, and suddenly the droning engine hollers its way through the firewall. Back off, and it dies. Ask for a little more to trim the car in a bend, and the answer will be hard to predict. Slowing up, you’ll have to negotiate the capricious hybrid brake pedal. \nPerformance from the 1.2-liter turbo and its clean-shifting manual box is much the same as the hybrid, and it runs into its redline at just 5,500 rpm, but the delivery is far easier to modulate, and it’s all the more satisfying because of it. Trimming lines in corners is a game worth playing, and the brakes do exactly what your foot expects. \nIt might be slightly noisier in urban driving than the hybrid, but absent that strange speed-rpm dissonance, you notice it less. And urban efficiency shouldn’t be too bad given it can run in the Atkinson cycle when off boost. \nIn Europe the C-HR comes with a suite of active systems for highway driving: radar cruise control, an effective lane keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring. And at city speed it has autonomous brake collision mitigation that detects pedestrians. There’s also a JBL hi-fi with some 576 watts of amplification (how very specific) and new horn tweeters. I didn’t test the collision mitigation, but that hi-fi sure does the business. How much of this kit comes to the U.S. is another thing the L.A. show will likely reveal. \nBut we now know that in its fundamentals, the C-HR doesn’t just have the style to make a splash among its peers. Even if it might not be a style you actually like, many will. And the dynamics back it up. Share this article",

      "text": "  20:06 PM EST Toyota GAZOO Racing Ready for Bahrain Battle \nToyota City, Japan,   Toyota GAZOO Racing will bring the curtain down on an emotional and exciting 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) season in this weekend's 6 Hours of Bahrain. \nThe team travels to the Bahrain International Circuit for the ninth race of the season with plenty to fight for in both the drivers' and manufacturers' World Championships, whilst also aiming for a second win of the season. \nStephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi, in the #6 TS050 Hybrid have an outside chance of winning the drivers' title; they trail their Porsche #2 rivals by 17 points with 26 available in Bahrain. \nThe #5 crew of Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima have plenty to fight for as well. They can strengthen Toyota's position in the manufacturers' standings; second-placed Audi are just 15 points ahead with 44 available. \nIn the last four races, Toyota has achieved five podiums and one victory, steadily closing the gap on its rivals in both championships prior to the visit to Bahrain, where it has positive memories. \nThe team won there in 2013 and 2014, when Anthony and Sebastien were also crowned drivers' World Champions, while it has finished on the podium in three out of four seasons in Bahrain. \nA strong result on the 5.412km, 15-turn Bahrain International Circuit would cap a remarkable debut season for the 1,000hp TS050 Hybrid, a new car for 2016 which incorporated a 2.4litre turbo engine and 8MJ battery-based hybrid system. \nDespite intense competition from Audi and Porsche, the TS050 Hybrid has been a serious contender for victory in the majority of races in a 2016 season which saw the team recover from heartbreak at Le Mans to achieve an emotional home victory in Fuji. \nThe conclusion to the 2016 season takes place on Saturday, although the team remains in Bahrain for the WEC rookie test the following day when LMP2 driver Pipo Derani, a 23-year-old from Sao Paulo in Brazil, will drive the TS050 Hybrid. \nToshio Sato, Team President:\"We are very much looking forward to the Bahrain race. There is a lot to fight for in both championships so I am sure it will again be a very close race between all three LMP1 manufacturers. It will be difficult to challenge for the drivers' championship; we are realistic and we know we need a bit of luck. But our target is to achieve a strong result and take runners-up position in the manufacturers' championship, which would be a deserved reward for the team's hard work this year. As always, we will be giving our all to perform strongly.\" \nAnthony Davidson (TS050 Hybrid #5):\"I can't believe that we're already at the end of the 2016 season. It's been a long hard year but Bahrain is a track I always enjoy because I like the facilities and the flow of the circuit. I have usually been strong there as well. In car #5 we are really motivated to end the season on a high; we want a win from this season and I feel we deserve one after being denied at Spa and Le Mans. We will be doing everything we can.\" \nSebastien Buemi (TS050 Hybrid #5):\"It was so good to finish on the podium in Shanghai, so hopefully in Bahrain we can continue like that. I hope it is a turning point for us and that we can end the season with another positive result. Bahrain is a nice track where we had good results in the past and the characteristics of the circuit should suit our car as there are long straights with heavy braking and acceleration. So I'm really looking forward to go there to fight for the win.\" \nKazuki Nakajima (TS050 Hybrid #5):\"Bahrain should be a good race track for us so I'm really looking forward to drive our TS050 Hybrid on this track. Last year we had probably our strongest race in Bahrain and this time I think we will be much stronger as the TS050 Hybrid is a big step compared to last year. So I'm sure we can show great performance in Bahrain and fight at the front. We will be pushing really hard for another positive result.\" \nStephane Sarrazin (TS050 Hybrid #6):\"We are really excited to go to Bahrain; it's the last race of the season, which is always a nice event with a special atmosphere. We're still in the game for the drivers' title; 17 points is quite a big gap but everything is possible, so we will fight to the end. We've shown strong performances in the last few races and I've really enjoyed fighting alongside my team-mates, who are doing an outstanding job. We are ready and we will keep pushing.\" \nMike Conway (TS050 Hybrid #6):\"Bahrain is a circuit I really like as I already had some good results there in the past; I won my first WEC race there and it was the only podium for our car last year. I'm looking forward to the last race of the season as we are still in the fight for the World Championship. We've been increasingly competitive, also in qualifying, in the last few events so I hope it will be the same in Bahrain and we can get the result for everyone in the team.\" \nKamui Kobayashi (TS050 Hybrid #6):\"The most important point for us is that we go to Bahrain still with a chance of the World Championship; that's going to be our target even if it will not be easy. For me the season has already been fantastic, considering it was my first in LMP1. I know the Bahrain track very well from the past and I enjoy driving there, so I'm feeling pretty confident. I think our car will suit the track so let's go and fight for the win.\" \nToyota GAZOO Racing in 6 Hours of Bahrain:2012 #7: Qualifying 3rd; Race DNF. 2013 #7: Qualifying 1st; Race DNF. #8: Qualifying 2nd; Race 1st. 2014 #7: Qualifying 4th; Race 1st. #8: Qualifying 2nd; Race 11th. 2015 #1: Qualifying 5th; Race 4th. #2: Qualifying 6th; Race 3rd. \nAbout Toyota \nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM ), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "text": "By JOSH BOAK\nAP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection.\nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008.\nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.\n ",

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit Josh Boak, Ap Economics Writer Updated 4:12 am, Monday, November 14, 2016 WASHINGTON (AP) — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. Court filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. The settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. Most Read ",

      "text": "Toyota Roomy And Tank Receive Bold TRD Upgrades | By Share Hot on the heels of the 2016 Toyota Tank and Roomy models debuting in Japan , the two minivans have been unveiled in TRD-guise. The brand's performance division has worked its styling magic on the two models helping to make both look that extra bit sporty and giving them such much-needed road presence. As standard, the styling of the Roomy and Tank are hard to distingiush and even with the TRD add-ons, the exterior differences between the two are minor to say the least. At the front, the Roomy can be equipped with a thoroughly revised fascia that includes a large chrome grille, fog lights, horizontal LED daytime running lights and a prominent chin spoiler. Additionally, there are five different wheel options, a set of new side skirts and a subtle lip on the rear bumper. As for the Tank, its rear end looks identical to the TRD-equipped Roomy. The front is where the most obvious changes are found, including a split black front grille, angled daytime running lights and a slightly different chin spoiler. Optional extras include TRD fuel caps, clear indicators and a start-stop button. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "Tweet \nFor the sixth year in a row, Tim’s Toyota is sponsoring the high school car fundraiser supporting Prescott, Bradshaw Mountain, Chino Valley, and Mayer high schools. Sports booster clubs, service clubs and site committees from each school are all selling $10 raffle tickets for a new 2017 Toyota Corolla LE, valued at $21,000. Each of the schools selling tickets keeps 100 percent of their ticket sales. \nHigh school service groups are raising money for academic competitions, to help families in need in their communities and to support local community projects. Sports booster clubs are selling tickets to pay for field improvements, new equipment and scholarships. Site committees are raising money for facilities improvements. \nThe raffle allows each school to assist not only its students and families but their communities as well. \n“We greatly appreciate Tim’s providing this opportunity for our student organizations again this year. The fundraiser has been a huge money maker for them, and we look forward to working with Tim’s again this year,” PUSD Superintendent Joe Howard said. \nTim’s Family Auto Group is a huge supporter of the community and is pleased that what began as a small fundraiser six years ago has grown into a campaign that supports so many students and community members, according to a news release. Over the past six years over $150,000 has been raised for the various area high school projects and scholarships. This year’s fundraiser promises to be one of the largest to date. \nTim’s Family Auto Group General Manager Robby Hinshaw expressed excitement in regard to partnering with the four area high schools. \n“As a locally owned business, we take great pride in our community and our local high schools,” he said. “Many members of our staff graduated from these schools and have children now attending them. \n“Tim’s Family Auto Group is proud to be associated with our local high schools as each has worthy goals they are striving to accomplish with their fundraising efforts.” \nTickets are on sale now through April 22. They are $10 and available for purchase through several Prescott High School booster clubs, as well as Bradshaw Mountain High School, Chino Valley High School and Mayer High School. Visit your favorite school’s website or the Tim’s Auto Group website for more information. \nThe winner will be determined at a drawing to be held at Tim’s Toyota showroom on Saturday, April 22. The winner need not be present to win but must claim the prize within 30 days of the announcement.",

It is the biggest-ever overseas acquisition for a South Korean company. \nMentor Graphics — Mentor is being bought by Germany's Siemens for $4.5 billion in cash, or $37.25 per share. Mentor is a maker of computer software used in designing computer chips. \nPfizer — The drugmaker's Celebrex arthritis drug is at least as safe as prescription-strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen, according to the results of a 10-year study.\nNovartis — Novartis is considering the sale of its Alcon eye care products division, according to the drugmaker's chairman Joerg Reinhardt. He told a Swiss weekly newspaper that the division has not done as well as the company had expected. \nToyota — The automaker agreed to settle a case involving truck rust for up to $3.4 billion. The settlement involves various Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia models that were alleged to have poor rust protection. \nJohnson & Johnson — J&J saw mixed results for an experimental drug designed to treat rheumatoid arthritis when compared to Abbvie's best-selling Humira treatment. \nHewlett-Packard Enterprise — The former chief financial officer of Autonomy was indicted for allegedly making fraudulent claims ahead of Hewlett-Packard's 2011 purchase of the software company for $11 billion. HP eventually took an $8.8 billion writedown on the deal, and successor company HPE sold off parts of that business earlier this year. \nDuke Energy — Duke will pay $27 million to settle a lawsuit over its firing of William Johnson in 2012. Johnson had been head of Progress Energy when it was acquired by Duke, and was set to be CEO of the combined company. However, he was fired within hours of the deal's closing. \nCoca-Cola — Coca-Cola may become a takeover target of beer brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev , according to a story in the Sunday Telegraph . People close to Ab InBev CEO Carlos Brito told the paper that following consolidation in the beer industry, Brito is looking at different beverage targets. \nChico's FAS , L Brands , Kohl's — The retailers were upgraded by Citi to \"buy\" from \"neutral,\" on the thesis that likely tax reform under a Donald Trump administration will provide a bump for retail in general and these companies in particular. \nSciClone Pharmaceuticals — Shareholder GL Management has offered to acquire the drugmaker for $11.18 per share in cash, compared to Friday's close of $9.85. GL holds a 9.3 percent stake in SciClone. \nAmazon.com — Amazon announced the expansion of its Home Services business into 20 new markets, including Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, and Cleveland. \nCitigroup — Morgan Stanley upgraded Citi to \"overweight from \"equal weight\" based on the idea that tax cuts coupled with stronger economic growth under the Trump administration will benefit banks in general, while pointing to Citi as particularly undervalued. \nViacom — Viacom was downgraded to \"hold\" from \"buy\" at Brean Capital, which questions the value of a possible combination between Viacom and CBS , as well as the probability that this will occur. \nLockheed Martin — Stifel upgraded the defense contractor to \"buy\" from \"hold,\" based on expectations for defense spending under a Trump administration. \nSquare — The mobile payments company was upgraded to \"overweight\" from \"sector weight\" at Pacific Crest, based on the firm's bullish stance on mobile payments in general and Square's ability to increase profit margins and generate substantial cash flow.",

(MANDEL NGAN / AFP/Getty Images) Tribune news services will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection.\nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \nAssociated Press",

      "text": " count=\"245\" data-total-count=\"245\"> Toyota Motors has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class-action lawsuit brought by American owners of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs’ lawyers said in court papers. The proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickup trucks, Tundra full-size pickup trucks and Sequoia S.U.V.s suspected of receiving inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to the court papers.\nIn court papers supporting the settlement, lawyers for the plaintiffs estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle. They estimated the cost of inspections at about $90 million, or $60 per vehicle.\nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed last Wednesday before Judge Fernando M. Olguin of Federal District Court in Los Angeles.\n “We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,” Toyota said in a statement.\nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether the frames need to be replaced at company expense. It will also reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement.\nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years.\nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in lawyers’ fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.",

      "text": "17th July 2013   \nMy visit to the Toyota Automobile Museum in Japan was an amazing experience, and amazingly I think the most memorable part of my visit did not involve ‘real’ cars at all. Now I’ve already spent two posts sharing with you guys some of the highlights of the Toyota 75 Exhibit , but for me that stuff was just half of the fun. \nIn addition to the array of full-size vehicles seen in my previous posts, the Toyota 75 exhibit also included an unprecedented display of 50 models – all 1:5 scale – sourced directly from the Toyota Design Center. \nFor a long time these hand-made models have been built for the purpose of design study and archival purposes. Normally, a selection of these models can be seen at the Design Dome at Toyota’s headquarters, but access to them is extremely limited. First of all, the public is not allowed inside the Design Dome at all and even most Toyota employees are restricted. Needless to say, photography is also strictly forbidden in this top secret area. \nSo when it came time to organize the Toyota 75 exhibit at the museum, it was decided that these models would be put on public display for a limited time. \nSome of the organizers of the Toyota 75 exhibit were actually former vehicle designers themselves and they thought it was a shame that this incredible collection of hand-built models was hidden from the public eye. It would be the perfect addition to what was already a once-in-a-lifetime exhibit. \nAs the exhibit was set up, the models were meticulously transported from the Design Center to the museum, joining the impressive collection of real vehicles that had already been gathered for Toyota 75. \nIn addition to the models that were on display inside the Design Center, they also brought out a large number that had long been put away in storage. \nThe result was perhaps the most incredible display of scale automobiles I’ve ever seen with my own eyes. I’d been planning to visit the museum regardless, but getting the chance to see this wonderful temporary display was just perfect timing and I’m so glad I was able to record this to share. \nThe simple sight of the models set up in special display cases was absolutely amazing. As cool as these things look in photos, it was even better in person. \nIn fact, I’m actually a little worried that simple photographs won’t be enough to these models proper justice. \nFirst of all, there’s the sheer size of these things. I know 1:5 scale is not a common scale among consumer model cars and diecasts, so you might be wondering just how big these cars are. Let’s just say they are huge. \nHere I’ve inserted my approving ‘thumbs up’ sign to give an idea of the scale we are talking here. \nBecause of their large size, the level of detail on these models is simply incredible. \nI have little doubt that if you took these models out and photographed them in a more natural setting they could easily be mistaken for real cars. \nFrom 100 percent accurate wheels and tires… \n… to fully modeled interiors with all of the correct knobs and buttons in place. You can almost smell the authenticity. \nWhile I’m not entirely sure what methods were used when building these things, it’s clear that the professional modelers at the Toyota Design Center are very good at what they do. \nAs for the actual assortment of scale historic Toyotas presented at the exhibit, the range is quite impressive. \nOn the classic end of the spectrum you have examples like this fully detailed replica of a second generation Toyopet Corona from the early 1960s. \nThe assortment then moves on to include cars from ’70s, ’80’s and ’90s right through to the beginning of the 2000s. \nIt’s also a fine way to see the 1:5 scale history of some of Toyota’s most important models. Cars like the Celica, seen here in first generation liftback form… \n… and on to the second generation car of the late ’70s… \n… and right up to the late ’90s and the introduction of the seventh and final iteration of the Celica. \nAnd while the models are massive in terms of scale replicas, they still take up a lot less space then full size cars. The means there was room for many scale models of cars that couldn’t be squeezed into the main exhibit. I’m sure many of you will be happy to see that the Supra was represented nicely in the display. \nAs was the lovable Toyota MR2… \n… in both first generation AW11 form… \n… and in the form of the newer MR-S roadster. \nJust look at the detail on that interior! \nBut in addition to some of the Toyota’s most famous models like the Celica and Mark II, it was also nice to some of the brand’s more obscure models represented. \nI’m talking about cars like the sixth generation Corona liftback for example. I can’t remember the last time I saw one of these things in real life. \nOf course, that was just one part of a huge line of scale Coronas on display. Here’s the handsome looking third generation hardtop coated in perfect shade of 1960s metallic blue. \nThe equally attractive Corona Mark II has also been perfectly recreated in scale form by the modelers at the Design Center. \nAs strange as it might sound, I think I may have spent more time looking at these models than at the real cars that were part of the Toyota 75 exhibit. It was just that good. \nThat also means I have plenty more to share from this 1:5 sized selection of top secret Toyota history. Look for that story coming soon. \nMike Garrett",

      "text": "Nov 14 Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers.\nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle.\nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles.\n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement.\nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement.\nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years.\nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.",

      "text": "By John Goreham G+ 2016-11-14 08:44 Toyota Agrees to $3 Billion Tacoma Frame Rot Settlement Toyota has agreed to settle with owners of the Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia. Guess what owners will get? \nNews this week of a Toyota settlement with owners of Tacomas, Tundras, and Sequoias with frame corrosion issues, will be good news to anyone nervous about the issue that has not yet been helped by Toyota. However, in an unusual type of legal settlement, Toyota has agreed to do exactly what it had already been doing prior to the litigation. Replace the frames of affected vehicles at no cost to owners. - Details and owner reports on the Tacoma Frame Issue Here \nThe problem has been most widespread on the Tacoma. This settlement will mean that owners of 2005-2010 model year Tacomas who discover the frame rot will have their vehicle’s frame replaced at no charge – something Toyota has already been doing for years. Also, if the frame had been replaced, and the owner paid out of pocket for some reason, Toyota will reimburse owners that cost. The settlement includes up to 12 years of inspections and coverage for affected vehicles. In addition to the Tacoma’s, 2005-2008 Sequoias and 2007 and 2008 Tundras are included in the settlement. \nReuters reports that Toyota issued a statement saying “\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.” \nToyota will also pay legal fees and $2,500 to each of the eight named class action suit representatives that brought the case. \nImage by John Goreham.

Related Tweets \nThe settlement covers three types of Toyota trucks, the report said: Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoia trucks made from 2005 to 2008 and Tundra trucks made from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. Share this: ",

      "text": "Toyota Agrees To $3.4 Billion Settlement Over Rusted Trucks And SUVs | By Share Toyota has agreed to a settlement worth up to $3.4 billion over a class action lawsuit from U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicle's frames can severely rust . It is asserted that inadequate rust protection had been applied to around 1.5 million Tacomas , Tundra and Sequoia models. Due to the poor protection, the frames of the vehicles could rust to the point of impacting their structural integrity. Although the automaker hasn't admitted liability or wrongdoing, it has agreed to inspect all affected vehicles for 12 years from when they were first sold or leased. Toyota will then determine if the frames need to be replaced and do so at company expense. If owners have already been forced to have their frames replaced, Toyota will reimburse them. The settlement asserts that it will cost about $3.375 billion to replace the frames, costing about $15,000 per vehicles. An additional $90 million will then be spent on inspections at $60 per vehicle, reports Automotive News . In a statement, Toyota said “We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.” PHOTO GALLERY",

According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

      "title": "Toyota will settle truck frame rust suit for up to $3.4 billion",
      "text": "Pinterest Email \nToyota has reached an agreement in a class action suit brought by U.S. owners of several truck models over the issue of frame rust protection, Reuters reports. The automaker is expected to reach a formal settlement worth up to $3.4 billion with owners of Toyota Tacoma , Tundra , and Sequoia trucks that are claimed to have received inadequate rust protection, which in turn could lead to corrosion significant enough to affect the trucks' structural integrity, according to the class action suit. \nThe settlement program will affect 2007-08 Toyota Tundra and 2005-10 Tacoma pickup trucks along with 2005-08 Sequoia SUVs, with the total figure derived from the estimated cost of frame inspections and replacements for over 1.5 million total trucks. \nThe frame replacements are estimated to cost $15,000 each, which adds up to $3.375 billion, while the cost of inspections for the affected trucks is expected to add another $90 million, at $60 per truck, according to lawyers representing the class of plaintiffs. Toyota Tundra: Toyota recalls 110,000 pickups on rusted-frame concern \nToyota Motor Corp. is recalling 110,000 Toyota Tundra pickups for the 2000 to 2003 model years after reports that rusted frames in cold weather may cause spare tires under the truck bed to break loose ... \nUnder the proposed settlement Toyota plans to inspect the frames of affected trucks for 12 years from the day they were initially sold or leased, and perform frame replacements if needed. Toyota is also expected to reimburse owners who have already paid for frame replacements out of pocket. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement following the announcement of an agreement last week. \nJay Ramey - Jay Ramey is an Associate Editor with Autoweek, and has been with the magazine since 2013.

      "text": "Go Toyota will spend up to $3.4 billion for rusty trucks The automaker agreed to the settlement for a federal class-action lawsuit after owners reported poor rust protection. Toyota will spend up to $3.4 billion for rusty trucks 0 Share: \nI'm pretty sure there's a \"hard Taco versus soft Taco\" joke in here somewhere. Photo by Toyota \nOnce rust starts eating certain parts of the car, it can greatly affect performance and safety. Some of Toyota's trucks have a serious rust problem, and the automaker is settling with owners to the tune of billions of dollars. \nToyota agreed to settle a federal class-action lawsuit regarding truck frame rust, Reuters reports . The automaker admitted no liability or wrongdoing in its settlement proposal, but it will pay for frame replacements for some 1.5 million trucks. The replacements could cost about $15,000 each, and inspections were valued at around $60. All in, Toyota could spend up to $3.4 billion. \nOwners of the 2005-2010 Tacoma midsize pickup, 2007-2008 Tundra full-size pickup and 2005-2008 Sequoia SUVs claimed that these vehicles' frames could corrode enough to mess with the car's structural integrity. This could affect both performance (towing, hauling) and safety in the event of a collision. The owners allege that inadequate rust protection is to blame. \nTo determine whether or not frame replacement is necessary, Toyota will inspect the affected vehicles up to 12 years after the day of initial purchase or lease. It will also reimburse owners who already paid for frame replacements out of pocket.",

Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. PTI ",

Post to Facebook Toyota rust settlement could be worth billions Toyota will replace frames on Tacoma and Sequoia vehicles showing premature rust erosion.  //usat.ly/2fSPpoL   1   Toyota rust settlement could be worth billions Nathan Bomey , USA TODAY 1:32 p.m. EST November 14, 2016 Toyota Motor Company will spend $50 million over the next five years to increase the pace of its autonomous car tech program, leveraging the know-how of researchers at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) \nJapanese automaker Toyota agreed to repairs worth up to $3.4 billion for U.S. owners of certain Tacoma pickup trucks and Sequoia sport-utility vehicles that plaintiffs said could be subject to premature rust erosion. \nThe automaker reached the class-action settlement involving the 2005 through 2010 model-year Tacoma and 2005 through 2008 model-year Sequoia, totaling about 1.5 million potentially eligible vehicles. \nPlaintiffs accused the company of not treating the vehicles with adequate rust protection. \nToyota agreed to inspect vehicle frames for rust erosion and replace them for free if necessary. according to settlement documents. The company also agreed to refund past maintenance or replacement costs. \nThe deal comes after seven months of negotiations in which Toyota attorneys produced 2.5 million documents of evidence on the matter. \nThe company maintained in a court filing that it \"disputes and contests the allegations\" in the class-action lawsuits that were consolidated in a California court. \nPlantiffs attorneys estimated the cost of replacement frames at about $15,000 per vehicle. The actual cost of the settlement could be substantially smaller than $3.4 billion depending on how many frames actually need to be replaced. \nToyota declined to address the estimated cost of the settlement. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \"The ultimate size of the settlement depends on a number of factors, including the valuation of the benefits offered under the settlement.\" \nContributing: AP \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .

      "text": "'The FJ Company' Restores Vintage Toyota FJ Land Cruisers   fj.co & wired Toyota FJ Land Cruisers are iconic vehicles thanks to their rugged appearance and utilitarianism, and 'The FJ Company' is dedicated to restoring the vintage vehicles. Though many vintage vehicle restoration enthusiasts and companies often devote their attention to discontinued luxury vehicles, The FJ Company focuses solely on the decidedly blue collar Toyota Land Cruisers. Toyota first released its FJ Land Cruiser in 1959, and the Japanese auto manufacturer designed the vehicle with a militaristic style. The look endured for decades, with the classic FJ Land Cruiser style extending well into the 80s. The FJ Company restores any of these models, with three different stock options that allow for moderate customization as well as a complete customization option for drivers who want a particular look or model.",

      "text": "Reddit \nPending court approval of the deal, Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a lawsuit over Tundra, Tacoma, and Sequoia vehicles allegedly afflicted with faulty rust protection. The settlement doesn’t involve Toyota admitting that it failed to adequately protect the affected vehicles from rusting, but does represent what will likely end up being a huge financial blow to the company. As part of the settlement, affected vehicles found to have improper rust protection will be eligible to have their frame replaced. \nThe lawsuit was filed in two states, and relates to the 2005 to 2008 Sequoia, 2005 to 2010 Tacoma trucks, and the 2007 to 2008 Tundra vehicles. Overall, according to the Wall Street Journal , this proposed settlement will cover 1.5 million vehicles located in the United States. A judge must OK the settlement proposal for it to go through, however. \nAccording to the lawsuit, the aforementioned vehicles were not adequately protected against rust, causing some of the vehicles’ frames to rust. Depending on where an affected vehicle is located in the US, this could be a substantial problem for owners. Assuming the court approves the settlement, Toyota will inspect the vehicles and replace frames found affected. \nAssuming an affected owner has already paid to have their frame replaced, the settlement specifies they will be reimbursed. Each faulty frame will cost the auto maker substantially, with the per-vehicle replacement cost coming in at $15,000. Potentially affected owners will be informed about the matter by mail, and there will also be Internet campaigns and notices. Story Timeline",
