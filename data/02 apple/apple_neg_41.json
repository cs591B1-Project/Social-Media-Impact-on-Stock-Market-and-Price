      "text": "Translate Google can now tell you how busy a store is before you enter, but not everyone is shopping in malls this time of the year. In fact, online sales are projected to surge by almost 20 percent in the next month, so what about those pesky customer service hotlines? According to the website onholdwith.com , unsurprisingly telecom companies Verizon, Sprint, Comcast, Virgin, Telus and AT&T are among the most tweeted at companies from customers on hold. But in the last month, Apple has remained firmly at the top of the list. With the holiday rush still ahead, Fonolo ‘s marketing director, Daniela Puzzo suggests, “Before you pick up the phone and call a company’s support line, double check with onholdwith.com – it could save you a lot of wasted time and frustration.” Fonolo , who recognized a serious problem with hold times, launched the website as a public service so that people could air out their frustrations, while organizations could see how much goodwill they were losing from customers. Check out the worst companies to call this holiday season: Related Posts",

Read Article \nSOUTH PORTLAND — The Big Apple convenience store and gas station at 334 Cottage Road will soon be demolished and replaced with a slightly larger building. \nThe city issued demolition and building permits Monday for the project, which the Planning Board approved in September. \nC.N. Brown Co. of South Paris plans to replace the existing 2,100-square-foot store with a 2,400-square-foot store. The company replaced the underground fuel storage tanks last year. \nThe improvements follow the opening of a new Cumberland Farms convenience store in Cape Elizabeth and coincide with the ongoing redevelopment of the former South Portland Armory into an Irving gas station and a Rusty Lantern convenience store. \nThe Big Apple was closed and the property was fenced in on Monday.

      "text": "| News \nApple’s 2017 iPhone refresh may sport dual-camera 3D photo support based on LG Innotek camera technology. That sounds pretty cool and could be a sign Apple is ready to add adjustable depth of field and 3D image support to the iPhone lineup. Report says 3D photos coming in next iPhone refresh \nThe Korea Economic Daily reports Apple and LG have been working together on 3D camera technology for smartphones. Insider sources speaking with with KED said, \nApple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera. Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year. \nThe logic path for iPhone 3D photos goes something like this: Apple bought LinX in 2015 , and LG is providing the dual camera system for the iPhone 7 Plus. LG’s dual cameras can be tied to LinX’s photography technology, therefore Apple and LG are developing 3D cameras for the iPhone. \nThat’s possible but not a sure thing, and we need to take a look at LinX to understand why. LinX developed technology that determines the depth of objects when a photograph is taken which lets users set the target focus area after an image is taken. The image map it creates can also be the foundation for snapping photos that appear to have actual depth—in other words, 3D images. Diving into 3D iPhones \n3D images aren’t, however, the same as holograms. The photos Apple can make with its LinX technology will create a sense of depth going into the photo, and tilting the image will likely create a parallax effect where closer elements appear to move across image points that are farther away. This won’t be like an image you can spin around and see all of its sides as if you were on a Holodeck from Star Trek. \nThe 3D aspect for photos will have a definite “wow” factor because it’s easy to see and a compelling draw for potential iPhone buyers and upgraders. The more useful feature, however, will be the ability to adjust focus on a specific area after snapping a photo. It’ll be a great way to salvage out of focus shots, and make good shots even better by letting users set exactly what’s in focus. \nSince the technology requires dual camera lenses, don’t expect to see this show up on the 4.7-inch iPhone. Instead, this will be another “Plus” feature that’s available only on the 5.5-inch model. \nThat’s bad news for everyone who prefers the smaller screen size, but in line with the company’s iPhone routine: the bigger model always gets the cool new camera features. The iPhone 7 Plus, for example, sports dual cameras and optical image stabilization. In comparison, the iPhone 7 finally got optical image stabilization two years after the Plus models but still sports a single camera lens. \nApple isn’t talking about its plans for the 2017 iPhone models, but analysts are expecting some big changes because this will be the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. Curved glass displays and wireless charging are already rumored for the new models, and 3D photo support would be a nice addition to that feature set. \nApple typically releases new iPhones in September, so we’re still almost a year out from an official announcement. Until then, we’ll just have to make due with our waterproof Lightning port headphone models. Share this: ",

      "text": "\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider \nIt's too late for Apple's AirPods. \nAfter missing the crucial Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping holidays in the US, there's little chance the company's new wireless headphones will be able to ship in significant quantities in time for Christmas. \nThe window has closed, and Apple will likely have to consider a backup plan. \nThe answer? \nApple might as well suck it up and hold off the AirPods release until spring of 2017, the same time it's expected to release some radically redesigned iPads . \nIndependent tech analyst Neil Cybart of Above Avalon summed up Apple's wireless headphone predicament pretty well on Twitter Monday morning: \nReceived an email from Apple titled \"Gifts that are music to their ears.\" All about wireless headphones and speakers.No AirPods. — Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) November 28, 2016 \n\nWith December only three days away, I'm not sure it makes much sense to release AirPods in 2016 (even if they are ready). — Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) November 28, 2016 \n— Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) November 28, 2016 \n\nWould this push AirPods to Spring 2017? A few months wouldn't change much in the grand scheme of things. — Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) November 28, 2016 \nIt'd be an embarrassing delay, of course. Apple originally said the AirPods would launch in October of this year, but announced at the end of that month that they would be delayed to work out some bugs . The company hasn't given a firm release window for the AirPods since that statement. \nEven more embarrassing, Apple made the controversial decision to remove the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, touting wireless as the future of audio, with the best experience coming from a gadget you can't even buy. \nAs I wrote in my initial review , the pre-production version of the headphones had a bunch of bugs and awkward use cases, and Apple must realize it needs to hammer these out before it can start shipping. \nAt this point, it's reasonable to expect we won't see the AirPods at all until 2017, unless Apple decides to release them in extremely limited quantities. (And if Apple chooses that latter option, it'd just annoy more people than if the company had decided to wait a few extra months.) \nFor now, it's better to end the speculation and push the AirPods launch until next year.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 2 seconds ago \nSince before Apple even announced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , rumors have been floating around that the company might kill off the home button on next year's iPhone . According to a new report from Makotakara (via 9to5Mac ), the next iPad might actually be the first Apple device to ditch the iconic button. \nThe move would be somewhat unprecedented by the company, as iPhones tend to receive new features first, at least when Apple plans to offer them through both lines of devices. Examples of this would be Touch ID, newer colors such as gold and Rose Gold, and Siri. Of course, the new iPad Pro devices support the Apple Pencil, which hasn't seen any love from the iPhone. \nSo what will Apple do with all of that extra bezel space that it will be freeing up? According to the report, the next iPad will also feature a larger display at 10.9-inches, rather than the current 9.7-inches, but the body won't be any larger. \nThe thickness of the device is rumored to be 7.5mm, which is a whopping 1.4mm thicker than the current 6.1mm thin 9.7-inch model. The 12.9-inch variant should be about 3mm thicker as well, which would make it come in at 9.9mm. Tags",

      "text": "App Store Games \n“It was inevitable that Apple would have to address the problem of broken and otherwise outdated apps on its store.” \nApp publishers have learned over time to avoid running afoul of the guidelines for the App Store and Google Play. If you want to enter those ecosystems, you play by the rules. \nHistorically this has been especially true for the App Store . Apple has always employed an iron fist over the App Store with its fairly opaque yet draconian App Store Guidelines . Over the years, Apple has left many developers puzzling over why their apps or updates were rejected by an App Store review team accountable to no one. \nA new wrinkle to App Store rule set has cropped up in the last several months: Apple has begun to purge a variety of apps from its long tail in the App Store. \nIn a letter to developers in September , Apple announced that it would begin to remove apps that no longer function as intended, problematic or abandoned apps, apps that do not support current App Store guidelines or have not been updated to keep up with iPhone and iOS capabilities for a long time. \nSee also: 5 Tips To Get Your App Featured In The Apple App Store \nEssentially, Apple said it is cleaning up the detritus of the App Store . If you want to keep your app in its listings, it needs to be updated to 2016 standards. Also caught in the filter are apps similar to clickbait: apps that say they do one thing but really do another thing entirely. The App Quality Imperative Creating Apps that Win - 5 Challenges and 5 Solutions Get It Now What Apple Is Removing From The App Store \nAccording to mobile analytics firm SensorTower , Apple removed 47,300 apps from the App Store in October, a 238% increase over the monthly average for previous months of 2016. \n“It was inevitable that Apple would have to address the problem of broken and otherwise outdated apps on its store, and this first round of cleaning was a step in the right direction for users and app makers alike,” said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at SensorTower, in an email to ARC. \nOf the apps removed from the App Store in October, 28% were games (which are, by far, the biggest category of apps in the store). Entertainment (8.99%) and Books (8.96%) were the next largest categories with apps removed. Education (7%) and books (6%) rounded out the top five. \nCurious to dig further into the types of apps Apple removed from the App Store, ARC asked SensorTower to run the numbers a little further. Nelson said that the purge wasn’t centralized at any one particular location and that each country represented in the App Store had a hundred or more apps delisted. \n“Perhaps maybe a hundred or so apps in each country were removed that only ever released there, but no country/countries seem to have been singled out, so to say,” said Nelson. \nFurthermore, SensorTower broke down the games category to see if there were any common themes among the apps removed from the App Store. \nIt is difficult to ascertain the issues with these games without any further context from Apple. For instance, were they perfectly fine games that just didn’t need any updates or were they broken and abandoned by their creators? Are puzzle, action and arcade games, by nature very simple creations, more prone to being removed by Apple? \nNelson gave ARC some context: \nWith 51% of apps having not been touched by their developers in more than a year as of September, however, it’s clear that there’s still a lot of work to be done, either through Apple encouraging the makers of the most problematic apps to bring them current in terms of compatibility or by removing them entirely. \nEven with the ongoing purge of old, outdated, misleading or poor quality apps , the App Store is still projected to at least double in size within the next several years. The ongoing problem for Apple will be to manage the long tail so that apps are current with its review guidelines so that people will have the best experience of apps they discover in the App Store. \n“A few months ago, we forecasted that the App Store will exceed five million active apps by 2020, something that will undoubtedly make separating the wheat from the chaff an even trickier prospect for users—and certainly ratchet up the challenge for developers getting their apps discovered,” said Nelson.",

      "text": "Apple Why Apple open sourcing Mac OS X isn't terribly exciting Apple released the kernel to Mac OS X--but even if it released the whole thing, not much would change. By Matt Asay | November 28, 2016, 9:44 AM PST Google Plus \nImage: CNET \nApple just open sourced the innards of its popular Mac OS X operating system, but relax. This isn't about Apple getting open source religion. (Though that is, in fact, happening .) As for OS X, Apple has been doing the same thing for the past 16 years, fulfilling its obligations to open source the Darwin kernel at the heart of OS X. \nNo, this doesn't mean you can take OS X and make it run on Windows. And no, it doesn't mean you can start selling an OS X fork. Even if Apple were releasing Mac OS X Sierra 10.12 in its entirety, the odds of developers doing much with it are negligible. That's simply not how open source works. Open source the engine, not the car \nWhat, exactly, is Apple open sourcing? Despite Apple admittedly \"doubling down on open source,\" this particular release of Darwin source code is much more modest. OS X has always been based on a Unix variant, which is one thing that makes it so powerful for developers. But this doesn't mean Apple is releasing OS X Sierra 10.12 itself. SEE Apple is doubling down on open source (TechRepublic) \nAs one commentator noted , \"This is only the kernel and other core-level technologies. Lots (and lots and lots and lots) of the cool stuff that makes a Mac a Mac (GUI and lots more) are proprietary, not based on open code, and thus not shared.\" To be clear, it's significant code, but not the sort of thing that comprises an entire operating system. As Lance James pointed out , \"Analogous to a car, the engine and wheels are open source and free but the car frame and all other features are not.\" \nNot that it would matter even if Apple were to release Mac OS X Sierra in its entirety. Open... now what? \nAfter all, who would use it? Microsoft? The odds of Microsoft taking Mac OS X to replace Windows are less than zero. Ditto any other large PC manufacturer. Would we potentially see Chinese knock-offs? Sure. Those already exist and arguably would become more functional if blessed with an official fork of OS X rather than poor attempts at reverse engineering. \nBut even these would suffer from falling outside the official Apple ecosystem. No US or European company of any credibility would attempt to reverse engineer the Apple hardware that powers Mac OS X, and no company anywhere would attempt to replicate Mac OS X itself, even if they had an official fork, because of this ecosystem. A software business is rarely just a matter of some 1s and 0s, but rather about a complex mesh of hardware, software, and third-party integrations. SEE Open source vs. Apple: The holy war that wasn't (TechRepublic) \nThis is why Red Hat can sell a free, easily copied Linux operating system and make billions of dollars doing so. Competitors can take its code (even if cleverly compiled to make this difficult), but they can't thereby take its ecosystem of thousands of ISVs and IHVs that build on the official Red Hat Enterprise Linux product. \nThe same is true of Mac OS X. \nSo why doesn't Apple release it? The better question is why should it? To make any open source project successful requires fantastic documentation, not to mention a heck of a lot of code clean up and ongoing maintenance and marketing. Given that Apple doesn't apparently want an army of dilettantes working on its code, why bother with a largely fruitless exercise in marketing? \nApple, in short, doesn't need a Mac OS X vanity open source project. And ironically, neither do we. If you subscribed to the Apple Weekly newsletter, you'd already know all this. Subscribe",

Apple Campus 2 was originally proposed by Steve Jobs, who invited Norman Foster, the acclaimed British architect, to design the campus on a 176-acre site that is supposed to accommodate 13,000 people. The central building is a four-story ring with a giant park proposed in the center filled with hundreds of fruit trees. The new campus will also include a 100,000 square-foot workout facility, a 1,000 seat underground auditorium and a huge underground car park, leaving space for miles of cycling and walking trails. Apple aims to make the campus completely sustainable on renewable energy. The drone footage reveals some the 700,000 square feet of rooftop solar panels being installed on main building, which also features the largest piece of curved glass in the world.

The first developer beta for watchOS 3.1.1 was seeded in late October. \n  developer beta for watchOS 3.1.1, which is a marginal update meant to fix bugs and otherwise improve performance in the wearable. To install it, developers must use the dedicated Watch app on their iPhone, then head into General –> Software Update. For the install process to begin, the Apple Watch must be connected to the charger, have 50% battery, and be within range of the iPhone. \nWhile this update is more than likely focused on behind-the-sceses improvements, if any new forward-facing new additions are discovered, we’ll update this post accordingly.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple iOS Is Losing to a Homegrown Competitor in China \nApple iOS sales will be topped by Alibaba’s YunOS in what was once the U.S. tech behemoth’s growth engine. \nYunOS is set to take 14% of the smartphone shipments in mainland China (which doesn’t include areas such as Macau and Hong Kong) by the end of 2016—surpassing Apple’s iOS as China’s second-biggest smartphone operating system, according to analysts as cited by the South China Morning Post . \nResearch firm Strategy Analytics estimates that YunOS will be installed on over 100 million iPhones shipped in mainland China this year. \nWhile Apple aapl sales grew explosively in China last year, iPhone sales to the region have recently turned negative, contributing to the U.S. company’s third straight quarter of sales declines on a year-over-year basis. \n\nStill, Apple expects iPhone sales in China to pick up in the December quarter, according to The Verge . \nAlibaba baba , which hopes to make YunOS the software of choice for Chinese consumers, still has another, far larger hurdle to climb. The vast majority of smartphone users in China use the Google Android, according to data gathered by the South China Morning Post . ",

      "text": "Reddit Apple will add certain MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini models to its list of vintage and obsolete products starting next month, which means the products will lose official Apple repair support through the company’s retail stores and authorized resellers. Kicking in on December 31, 2016, the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) and MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) will become vintage and obsolete in all markets where applicable, while the Mac mini (Early 2009) and MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2009) will become obsolete worldwide on the same date. Apple maintains a list of vintage and obsolete products on its website, but it doesn’t typically notify customers otherwise. Apple usually begins the process for models 5-7 years after manufacturing has been discontinued, at which time parts are no longer available to repair staff. That means that if you need a repair done on your machine, you won’t be able to go through Apple’s official channels to do so. Vintage status applies to California and or Turkey where limited support for certain products is available for two years after products become obsolete elsewhere. So other than Turkey and California for the MacBook Pro models noted above, the other products will be obsolete in Asia-Pacific, Canada, Europe (except for Turkey), Latin America, Japan, and Apple Retail Stores (except in California). Apple last added products to the list back in October when the iPhone 4, Late 2010 13-inch MacBook Air, 3rd-generation AirPort Extreme and 2nd-generation Time Capsule became obsolete. Macintosh Vintage in the U.S. and Turkey / Obsolete in AP/CN/EU (except Turkey)/JP/LA and Apple Retail Stores: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) Macintosh Obsolete in AP/CN/EU/JP/LA/U.S. and Apple Retail Stores: Mac mini (Early 2009)",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nMobile payments have come a long way since Apple made a huge push into the space with Apple Pay in 2014. Google introduced Android Pay last year, and Samsung has joined the fray with its own mobile payment system called Samsung Pay. Here’s what you need to know about Samsung Pay.\nWhich devices support Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay Phones More Samsung Pay is limited to the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 5, and Gear S2. It also now works with Samsung’s new smartwatch, the Gear S3 — and you don’t need to connect a Samsung phone for it to work.\nMore: Samsung to debut 4-terabyte 850 Pro solid state drive at CES 2017\nGear S3 owners with an Android phone can use Samsung Pay\nA recent update to the Gear manager app allows for Gear S3 users to use Samsung Pay, even if they don’t own a Samsung smartphone. Most Android devices running 4.4 KitKat and above should work, but Samsung says there are a few exceptions at the moment — notably, the Google Pixel .\nTo get started on paying with your Gear S3, you’ll need to add your cards via the Gear manager app. You can launch Samsung Pay by holding down on the back button.\n@cyberslash69 Hi there, #SamsungPay on the Gear S3 is not available with Pixel devices. (1/2)\n— Samsung Pay (@SamsungPay) November 25, 2016\nWhat’s unique about the update is that unlike the Gear S2, the Gear S3 supports MST, not just NFC. That means it will work at most payment terminals — just hold your watch near the checkout terminal when you’re ready to pay.\nSupport for the Gear S2\nSamsung announced late last year that the company’s flagship smartwatch, the Gear S2, would gain support for contactless payments. After a lengthy delay, it finally arrived in the beta program for the S2 during the summer for the Bluetooth-only model. In October, users with the cellular model of the Gear S2 reported that they are able to use Samsung Pay as well.\nWhat can you do with Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay isn’t just for typical transactions at your local grocery store or pharmacy. The Korean company is now implementing a “ Pay It Forward ” program for users that refer the service to family and friends. Samsung also continues to add new forms of payment, including everything from online payments and gift cards to taking cash out at ATMs. Of course, some of these features are only available in select countries.\nPay It Forward\nSamsung wants to reward its customers that use its payment service over rivals such as Android Pay, and it’s doing so with the High Five Referral Rewards program . Every time someone you referred makes their first “qualifying purchase,” you’ll earn $5 in Samsung Rewards, which is automatically deposited in the Samsung Pay app, the same way rewards cards are added.\nIt only applies for 30 people that you refer, meaning you’ll only be able to make $150. Still, you’ll be able to use this money at any merchant that accepts Visa debit and Samsung Pay.\n“We believe that anyone who tries Samsung Pay will see the benefits for themselves. That’s why we’re encouraging our users to join us, and help pay it forward,” the company said.\nThe company says 85 percent of Samsung Pay users say they would recommend it to friends and family, according to its own customer survey.\nRead More Membership and loyalty cards\nAs of mid-May 2016, you can now add all your membership and loyalty card accounts to Samsung Pay. Adding a card is as easy as scanning the bar code on the physical card itself or manually entering the account number.\nAll cards added will show up in a separate tab. Unfortunately, there is no search function, and cards appear in the order they were entered, not in alphabetical order. However, you can reorder the list by long pressing and dragging accounts.\nSamsung_Pay_Loyalty_Cards_Screenshots More ATMs\nSadly, American ATMs aren’t high-tech enough yet to work with Samsung Pay, but in South Korea, you can use the service at select ATMs to take out cash. At the moment, only Samsung users who have accounts at the following banks can use the service, according to the Korea IT Times : Woori Bank, KB Kookmin Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, NH Nonghyup Bank, and Shinhan Bank.\nRelated: Samsung Galaxy S7 review | Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review\nThe Times stated that Samsung pay works at 40,000 ATMs in the country, and Samsung has plans to bring its service to more ATMs in the future. You can even watch a transaction occur in the CNet video above.\nOnline payments\nSamsung’s Thomas Ko, co-general manager for Samsung Pay, has said the mobile payment service will be updated to cover online payments in the U.S. in 2016. In an interview with Reuters in December 2015, Ko said online Samsung Pay payments were coming to the U.S. soon, but didn’t provide an exact date outside of 2016, or mention any other countries expected to receive the new feature. Apple Pay operates online through supporting apps, while PayPal and Visa provide a more widespread online payment system already.\nGift cards\nIn October 2015, through a partnership with Blackhawk Network , a pioneer of prepaid gift cards, Samsung announced gift card support for Samsung Pay from 50 retailers including Babies R Us, Toys R Us, Domino’s, and Nike. The app also features a gift card store that allows users to buy gift cards from merchants either for themselves (which seems odd) or to be gifted to friends and family directly from the app. It’s a neat addition that certainly removes the need to carry multiple cards. In a nutshell, Samsung Pay allows you to purchase, store, pay with, and share gift cards.\nRelated: Tap to buy: A complete guide to Android Pay\nPaying with a gift card doesn’t utilize the MST technology that paying with credit or debit cards uses. Instead, as with Apple Pay or Android Pay, it provides a code that retailers can scan or type in. The company indicated that more gift card options will be added in the coming months.\nPromotions\nA new Featured area was added to Samsung Pay in mid-May 2016. It’s basically a rolling banner at the top of the app. Samsung will use this area for promotions or information on how to get more out of Samsung Pay.\nSamsung_Pay_Featured_Banner_Screenshots More Which countries support Samsung Pay? Galaxy S7 Edge More Galaxy S7 Edge\nJeffrey Van Camp/Digital Trends\nSamsung Pay is currently available in the U.S. on all major carriers’ networks, Spain, South Korea, and China. Samsung Pay is currently available in the U.S. on all major carriers’ networks, Spain, South Korea, and China. However, the service will expand to the U.K. and Canada sometime this year.\nSamsung Pay is heading to Brazil on July 19, Samsung has confirmed. It’ll be supported by the county’s largest institutions, among them Banco do Brasil, Brasil Pré-Pagos, Caixa, Porto Seguro, Satander, Banrisul, Bradesco, Nubank, and Itaú-Unibanco. And it will support both Visa and MasterCard accounts.\nThe payment service is now available in Puerto Rico as well — cards from U.S. territory’s largest bank, Banco Popular, are now supported and Samsung Pay is available on AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Claro networks.\nIn mid-June, through a partnership with Citibank and American Express, Samsung Pay formally launched on Galaxy devices in Australia. Availability varies by “local operator,” Samsung warned, but Samsung Pay users in the Land Down Under should be able to pay at any sales terminal that accepts conventional debit and credit cards.\nOn June 2, Samsung Pay went live in Spain . Unfortunately, Samsung Pay users in Spain will miss out on one major feature of the payment service: support for magnetic point of sales. In other words, Spanish residents can only use Samsung Pay at NFC terminals, with Samsung giving no indication as to whether that will change.\nAlso in June, Samsung formally brought its payment service to Singapore. The announcement came quickly after Apple Pay launched in Singapore, but only for American Express card holders. Samsung will support MasterCard and Visa, and Samsung Pay is available to customers of the DBS Bank, Standard Chartered, and Oversea-China Banking Corporation.\nOn March 29, Samsung Pay went live in China through Samsung’s previously announced partnership with China UnionPay. The deal, announced in December 2015 , is crucial, as UnionPay is China’s main credit provider. In addition, Samsung partnered up with Ant Financial Services Group, Alipay’s parent company, which will further expand Samsung Pay’s presence in China. The partnership will allow users of Alipay, China’s largest third-party payment processing service, with over 450 million users, to use Samsung handsets to pay for products and services.\nDriving these international launches forward is Samsung’s extended partnership with MasterCard overseas, helping Samsung Pay break into Europe, and for people to activate debit, credit, and reloadable prepaid cards. It will also support Visa and American Express, along with other major payment networks. The full list can be found here . Samsung has also signed a partnership with point of sale equipment company Verifone, helping adoption in the U.S. and internationally.\nMore: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Which 5-inch flagship is right for you?\nWhich banks and stores support Samsung Pay?

Here’s a breakdown of the banks and card issuers that are on board for each country.\nSamsung Pay in the U.S.\nSamsung Pay works on most major U.S. credit cards, and the company is always adding more to the mix. A total of 38 banks and credit unions in the U.S. were added in mid-May 2016, including 1st United Credit Union, 1st Financial Federal Credit Union, AmegyBank of Texas, Arlington Community Federal Credit Union, Arsenal Credit Union, Bank & Trust Company, and many more.\nAn additional 39 banks and credit unions in the U.S. were added in early May 2016. They included Achieva, Alcoa Tenn Federal Credit Union, American Heritage Federal Credit Union, Bangor Savings Bank, and more.\nSamsung also added 19 new issuers of U.S. credit and debit cards in December 2015. They were Visa issuers PNC, TCF Bank, CFE Federal Credit Union, Financial Center FCU, Greater Kinston Credit Union, Keypoint Credit Union, Numerica Credit Union, Utah Community Credit Union, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, PenFed; and MasterCard issuers KeyBank, AchievaCU, Associated Bank, Bayport Credit Union, Bethpage Credit Union, Cambridge Savings, USCCU, and Navy Federal Credit Union.\nMore: Which Android heavyweight should you bet on? HTC 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge\nThat was two months after Samsung added 14 banks in October 2015, including Citizens Equity First Credit Union, Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union, Security Service Federal Credit Union, State Employees’ Credit Union, SunTrust, Virginia Credit Union, and Navy Federal Credit Union Visa. The company also announced that Discover Cards will be supported early next year.\nsamsung-pay More Samsung announced that you can now use “eligible” Wells Fargo credit and debit cards with Samsung Pay — bringing its number of supported banks and credit unions up to 70. Recently, the Korean giant said its mobile payment service hit 5 million registered users and processed around $500 million in its first six months of existence.\nThe MST technology ensures that Samsung Pay supports private-label credit cards (PLCC), thanks to partnerships with Synchrony Financial, Blackhawk Network, and First Data Corporation. The company also joined forces with the two biggest credit card providers, the aforementioned MasterCard and Visa, in making Samsung Pay a reality. In the United States, Samsung Pay is supported by American Express, Bank of America, Citi, U.S. Bank, and JPMorgan Chase credit cards.\nThe company estimates that some 30 million merchant locations worldwide will accept Samsung Pay at launch. In other words, Samsung believes that it has come up with the only mobile payment system that is universally accepted. In contrast, both Apple Pay and Google Wallet only work at select locations where NFC is accepted. Samsung Pay won’t work everywhere — credit card readers that require a physical trigger, like U.S. ATMs and gas pumps, aren’t compatible. But Samsung says the Samsung Pay will work at 80 percent of point-of-sale systems when it debuts.\nSamsung Pay will be secured with Samsung’s own Knox security software, which is widely regarded as one of the best security systems for mobile devices, as well as ARM TrustZone. Just like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay doesn’t store personal account numbers on the user’s device, and uses tokenization to protect your credit card information whenever you make a purchase. If you should lose your phone, you can lock and disable the device remotely to turn off access to Samsung Pay, thanks to Samsung’s Find My Mobile feature.\nSamsung Pay in China\nSamsung Pay launched in China with a healthy list of supporting banks and credit card providers. These include, China CITIC Bank, China Construction Bank, China Everbright Bank, China Guangfa Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corp., China Merchants Bank, Hua Xia Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Ping An Bank. The complete list can be found on Samsung’s website here . Future compatibility with Bank of China, Bank of Beijing, and others is promised to come soon.\nSamsung Pay in Spain\nSamsung Pay launched in Spain with only CaixaBank and ImaginBank as bank partners. However, the payment service will expand to Abanca and Banco Sabadell customers in the near future. Furthermore, El Corte Inglés is the first private card issuer in the country to support Samsung Pay. Finally, at launch, Samsung Pay is compatible with business like Cepsa, Cervecería La Sureña, Domino’s Pizza, Fridays, Ginos, Grupo DIA, MediaMarkt, Mercadona, Phone House, Repsol, Rodilla, Saba, Starbucks, The Good Burger, The Wok, VIPS, VIPSmart, and 100 Montaditos, with more following in the near future.\nIt won’t work on rooted devices Now that the service is live, there is evidence that rooting your Galaxy phone will disable Samsung Pay. This isn’t surprising since a rooted device is less secure. If a user tries to use Samsung Pay on a rooted phone, they will will be prompted with a message saying, “Samsung Pay has been locked due to unauthorized modification.”\nRelated: How to root your Android phone or tablet in 2015 (and unroot it)\nRooting a device is the process of obtaining complete administrative control of the operating system, which can make it more susceptible to hacking, and less secure. There are some advantages to rooting, but the security concerns more than outweigh them for the average person.\nIf you’re wondering if your Galaxy phone is rooted, it most likely isn’t. Samsung (and most other) phones aren’t rooted out of the box, and you would have needed to go through many complicated steps in order to achieve root, of which you would probably remember.\nWill it work on Smart TVs? Samsung’s positioning Samsung Pay as a platform , not purely contactless forms of payment. To that end, the company announced Samsung Pay on TV in August 2015, a feature coming to select Samsung smart TVs that’ll expedite the process of paying for content.\nSamsung Pay on Samsung TV More Samsung\nThe service, which Samsung said was developed in partnership with PayPal, ties your credit cards, debit cards, PayPal account and other billing options to a personal identification number. After you complete an “initial registration setup,” Samsung says buying a TV show, movie, or app on your TV is as easy as entering your PIN and hitting the “Pay Now” button that subsequently appears.\nThat first-time setup could be a headache. (You’ll have to add each funding source individually to Samsung Pay on TV.) If you’ve got a Samsung mobile account with saved billing details, though, they’ll transfer automatically. Owners of the electronics giant’s 2014 and 2015 smart TVs will begin to see games that integrate Pay on TV. The list of supported titles will be quite small initially — about seven — but Samsung says it’ll add content “within new and world-renowned games” in the near future.\nHow do you set it up? Samsung Pay first became available on the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, and Note 5 devices, and required an over-the-air update to work. In 2016, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge were added to the list. Once you’ve added credit, debit, and loyalty cards, you open the Samsung Pay app with a swipe, choose the card you want to use, and authenticate the purchase with your fingerprint.\nJust like most forms of mobile payments, Samsung Pay will use Near Field Communications (NFC) to make payments at point-of-sale systems that accept tap-to-pay. However, unlike Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Samsung Pay will leverage the same technology standard credit cards use, called Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which will let the system work at most cash registers, regardless of whether or not they accept NFC payments. So long as the register accepts mag-stripe credit cards, which is something that nearly every single cash register can do, Samsung Pay should work.\nArticle originally published in June 2015. Julian Chokkattu, Kyle Wiggers, Williams Pelegrin, Christian de Looper, Robert Nazarian, and Andy Boxall have contributed to this report. Updated on 11-28-16 by Julian Chokkattu: Added news that Samsung Pay will work on most Android phones as long as it’s paired with a Gear S3.\nEverything you need to know about Android Pay Samsung Pay gains new loyalty features, Masterpass integration, and more Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, now in Japan and 10 other countries",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nMobile payments have come a long way since Apple made a huge push into the space with Apple Pay in 2014. Google introduced Android Pay last year, and Samsung has joined the fray with its own mobile payment system called Samsung Pay. Here’s what you need to know about Samsung Pay.\nWhich devices support Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay Phones More Samsung Pay is limited to the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 5, and Gear S2. It also now works with Samsung’s new smartwatch, the Gear S3 — and you don’t need to connect a Samsung phone for it to work.\nMore: Samsung to debut 4-terabyte 850 Pro solid state drive at CES 2017\nGear S3 owners with an Android phone can use Samsung Pay\nA recent update to the Gear manager app allows for Gear S3 users to use Samsung Pay, even if they don’t own a Samsung smartphone. Most Android devices running 4.4 KitKat and above should work, but Samsung says there are a few exceptions at the moment — notably, the Google Pixel .\nTo get started on paying with your Gear S3, you’ll need to add your cards via the Gear manager app. You can launch Samsung Pay by holding down on the back button.\n@cyberslash69 Hi there, #SamsungPay on the Gear S3 is not available with Pixel devices. (1/2)\n— Samsung Pay (@SamsungPay) November 25, 2016\nWhat’s unique about the update is that unlike the Gear S2, the Gear S3 supports MST, not just NFC. That means it will work at most payment terminals — just hold your watch near the checkout terminal when you’re ready to pay.\nSupport for the Gear S2\nSamsung announced late last year that the company’s flagship smartwatch, the Gear S2, would gain support for contactless payments. After a lengthy delay, it finally arrived in the beta program for the S2 during the summer for the Bluetooth-only model. In October, users with the cellular model of the Gear S2 reported that they are able to use Samsung Pay as well.\nWhat can you do with Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay isn’t just for typical transactions at your local grocery store or pharmacy. The Korean company is now implementing a “ Pay It Forward ” program for users that refer the service to family and friends. Samsung also continues to add new forms of payment, including everything from online payments and gift cards to taking cash out at ATMs. Of course, some of these features are only available in select countries.\nPay It Forward\nSamsung wants to reward its customers that use its payment service over rivals such as Android Pay, and it’s doing so with the High Five Referral Rewards program . Every time someone you referred makes their first “qualifying purchase,” you’ll earn $5 in Samsung Rewards, which is automatically deposited in the Samsung Pay app, the same way rewards cards are added.\nIt only applies for 30 people that you refer, meaning you’ll only be able to make $150. Still, you’ll be able to use this money at any merchant that accepts Visa debit and Samsung Pay.\n“We believe that anyone who tries Samsung Pay will see the benefits for themselves. That’s why we’re encouraging our users to join us, and help pay it forward,” the company said.\nThe company says 85 percent of Samsung Pay users say they would recommend it to friends and family, according to its own customer survey.\nRead More Membership and loyalty cards\nAs of mid-May 2016, you can now add all your membership and loyalty card accounts to Samsung Pay. Adding a card is as easy as scanning the bar code on the physical card itself or manually entering the account number.\nAll cards added will show up in a separate tab. Unfortunately, there is no search function, and cards appear in the order they were entered, not in alphabetical order. However, you can reorder the list by long pressing and dragging accounts.\nView photos\nSamsung_Pay_Loyalty_Cards_Screenshots More ATMs\nSadly, American ATMs aren’t high-tech enough yet to work with Samsung Pay, but in South Korea, you can use the service at select ATMs to take out cash. At the moment, only Samsung users who have accounts at the following banks can use the service, according to the Korea IT Times : Woori Bank, KB Kookmin Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, NH Nonghyup Bank, and Shinhan Bank.\nRelated: Samsung Galaxy S7 review | Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review\nThe Times stated that Samsung pay works at 40,000 ATMs in the country, and Samsung has plans to bring its service to more ATMs in the future. You can even watch a transaction occur in the CNet video above.\nOnline payments\nSamsung’s Thomas Ko, co-general manager for Samsung Pay, has said the mobile payment service will be updated to cover online payments in the U.S. in 2016. In an interview with Reuters in December 2015, Ko said online Samsung Pay payments were coming to the U.S. soon, but didn’t provide an exact date outside of 2016, or mention any other countries expected to receive the new feature. Apple Pay operates online through supporting apps, while PayPal and Visa provide a more widespread online payment system already.\nGift cards\nIn October 2015, through a partnership with Blackhawk Network , a pioneer of prepaid gift cards, Samsung announced gift card support for Samsung Pay from 50 retailers including Babies R Us, Toys R Us, Domino’s, and Nike. The app also features a gift card store that allows users to buy gift cards from merchants either for themselves (which seems odd) or to be gifted to friends and family directly from the app. It’s a neat addition that certainly removes the need to carry multiple cards. In a nutshell, Samsung Pay allows you to purchase, store, pay with, and share gift cards.\nRelated: Tap to buy: A complete guide to Android Pay\nPaying with a gift card doesn’t utilize the MST technology that paying with credit or debit cards uses. Instead, as with Apple Pay or Android Pay, it provides a code that retailers can scan or type in. The company indicated that more gift card options will be added in the coming months.\nPromotions\nA new Featured area was added to Samsung Pay in mid-May 2016. It’s basically a rolling banner at the top of the app. Samsung will use this area for promotions or information on how to get more out of Samsung Pay.\nView photos\nSamsung_Pay_Featured_Banner_Screenshots More Which countries support Samsung Pay? View photos\nGalaxy S7 Edge More Galaxy S7 Edge\nJeffrey Van Camp/Digital Trends\nSamsung Pay is currently available in the U.S. on all major carriers’ networks, Spain, South Korea, and China. Samsung Pay is currently available in the U.S. on all major carriers’ networks, Spain, South Korea, and China. However, the service will expand to the U.K. and Canada sometime this year.\nSamsung Pay is heading to Brazil on July 19, Samsung has confirmed. It’ll be supported by the county’s largest institutions, among them Banco do Brasil, Brasil Pré-Pagos, Caixa, Porto Seguro, Satander, Banrisul, Bradesco, Nubank, and Itaú-Unibanco. And it will support both Visa and MasterCard accounts.\nThe payment service is now available in Puerto Rico as well — cards from U.S. territory’s largest bank, Banco Popular, are now supported and Samsung Pay is available on AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Claro networks.\nIn mid-June, through a partnership with Citibank and American Express, Samsung Pay formally launched on Galaxy devices in Australia. Availability varies by “local operator,” Samsung warned, but Samsung Pay users in the Land Down Under should be able to pay at any sales terminal that accepts conventional debit and credit cards.\nOn June 2, Samsung Pay went live in Spain . Unfortunately, Samsung Pay users in Spain will miss out on one major feature of the payment service: support for magnetic point of sales. In other words, Spanish residents can only use Samsung Pay at NFC terminals, with Samsung giving no indication as to whether that will change.\nAlso in June, Samsung formally brought its payment service to Singapore. The announcement came quickly after Apple Pay launched in Singapore, but only for American Express card holders. Samsung will support MasterCard and Visa, and Samsung Pay is available to customers of the DBS Bank, Standard Chartered, and Oversea-China Banking Corporation.\nOn March 29, Samsung Pay went live in China through Samsung’s previously announced partnership with China UnionPay. The deal, announced in December 2015 , is crucial, as UnionPay is China’s main credit provider. In addition, Samsung partnered up with Ant Financial Services Group, Alipay’s parent company, which will further expand Samsung Pay’s presence in China. The partnership will allow users of Alipay, China’s largest third-party payment processing service, with over 450 million users, to use Samsung handsets to pay for products and services.\nDriving these international launches forward is Samsung’s extended partnership with MasterCard overseas, helping Samsung Pay break into Europe, and for people to activate debit, credit, and reloadable prepaid cards. It will also support Visa and American Express, along with other major payment networks. The full list can be found here . Samsung has also signed a partnership with point of sale equipment company Verifone, helping adoption in the U.S. and internationally.\nMore: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Which 5-inch flagship is right for you?\nWhich banks and stores support Samsung Pay? Since Samsung Pay works in different countries, the company has had to work with banks and credit card providers to ensure that the service is accessible to its users. Here’s a breakdown of the banks and card issuers that are on board for each country.\nSamsung Pay in the U.S.\nSamsung Pay works on most major U.S. credit cards, and the company is always adding more to the mix. A total of 38 banks and credit unions in the U.S. were added in mid-May 2016, including 1st United Credit Union, 1st Financial Federal Credit Union, AmegyBank of Texas, Arlington Community Federal Credit Union, Arsenal Credit Union, Bank & Trust Company, and many more.\nAn additional 39 banks and credit unions in the U.S. were added in early May 2016. They included Achieva, Alcoa Tenn Federal Credit Union, American Heritage Federal Credit Union, Bangor Savings Bank, and more.\nSamsung also added 19 new issuers of U.S. credit and debit cards in December 2015. They were Visa issuers PNC, TCF Bank, CFE Federal Credit Union, Financial Center FCU, Greater Kinston Credit Union, Keypoint Credit Union, Numerica Credit Union, Utah Community Credit Union, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, PenFed; and MasterCard issuers KeyBank, AchievaCU, Associated Bank, Bayport Credit Union, Bethpage Credit Union, Cambridge Savings, USCCU, and Navy Federal Credit Union.\nMore: Which Android heavyweight should you bet on? HTC 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge\nThat was two months after Samsung added 14 banks in October 2015, including Citizens Equity First Credit Union, Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union, Security Service Federal Credit Union, State Employees’ Credit Union, SunTrust, Virginia Credit Union, and Navy Federal Credit Union Visa. The company also announced that Discover Cards will be supported early next year.\nsamsung-pay More Samsung announced that you can now use “eligible” Wells Fargo credit and debit cards with Samsung Pay — bringing its number of supported banks and credit unions up to 70. Recently, the Korean giant said its mobile payment service hit 5 million registered users and processed around $500 million in its first six months of existence.\nThe MST technology ensures that Samsung Pay supports private-label credit cards (PLCC), thanks to partnerships with Synchrony Financial, Blackhawk Network, and First Data Corporation. The company also joined forces with the two biggest credit card providers, the aforementioned MasterCard and Visa, in making Samsung Pay a reality. In the United States, Samsung Pay is supported by American Express, Bank of America, Citi, U.S. Bank, and JPMorgan Chase credit cards.\nThe company estimates that some 30 million merchant locations worldwide will accept Samsung Pay at launch. In other words, Samsung believes that it has come up with the only mobile payment system that is universally accepted. In contrast, both Apple Pay and Google Wallet only work at select locations where NFC is accepted. Samsung Pay won’t work everywhere — credit card readers that require a physical trigger, like U.S. ATMs and gas pumps, aren’t compatible. But Samsung says the Samsung Pay will work at 80 percent of point-of-sale systems when it debuts.\nSamsung Pay will be secured with Samsung’s own Knox security software, which is widely regarded as one of the best security systems for mobile devices, as well as ARM TrustZone. Just like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay doesn’t store personal account numbers on the user’s device, and uses tokenization to protect your credit card information whenever you make a purchase. If you should lose your phone, you can lock and disable the device remotely to turn off access to Samsung Pay, thanks to Samsung’s Find My Mobile feature.\nSamsung Pay in China\nSamsung Pay launched in China with a healthy list of supporting banks and credit card providers. These include, China CITIC Bank, China Construction Bank, China Everbright Bank, China Guangfa Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corp., China Merchants Bank, Hua Xia Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Ping An Bank. The complete list can be found on Samsung’s website here . Future compatibility with Bank of China, Bank of Beijing, and others is promised to come soon.\nSamsung Pay in Spain\nSamsung Pay launched in Spain with only CaixaBank and ImaginBank as bank partners. However, the payment service will expand to Abanca and Banco Sabadell customers in the near future. Furthermore, El Corte Inglés is the first private card issuer in the country to support Samsung Pay. Finally, at launch, Samsung Pay is compatible with business like Cepsa, Cervecería La Sureña, Domino’s Pizza, Fridays, Ginos, Grupo DIA, MediaMarkt, Mercadona, Phone House, Repsol, Rodilla, Saba, Starbucks, The Good Burger, The Wok, VIPS, VIPSmart, and 100 Montaditos, with more following in the near future.\nIt won’t work on rooted devices Now that the service is live, there is evidence that rooting your Galaxy phone will disable Samsung Pay. This isn’t surprising since a rooted device is less secure. If a user tries to use Samsung Pay on a rooted phone, they will will be prompted with a message saying, “Samsung Pay has been locked due to unauthorized modification.”\nRelated: How to root your Android phone or tablet in 2015 (and unroot it)\nRooting a device is the process of obtaining complete administrative control of the operating system, which can make it more susceptible to hacking, and less secure. There are some advantages to rooting, but the security concerns more than outweigh them for the average person.\nIf you’re wondering if your Galaxy phone is rooted, it most likely isn’t. Samsung (and most other) phones aren’t rooted out of the box, and you would have needed to go through many complicated steps in order to achieve root, of which you would probably remember.\nWill it work on Smart TVs? Samsung’s positioning Samsung Pay as a platform , not purely contactless forms of payment. To that end, the company announced Samsung Pay on TV in August 2015, a feature coming to select Samsung smart TVs that’ll expedite the process of paying for content.\nSamsung Pay on Samsung TV More Samsung\nThe service, which Samsung said was developed in partnership with PayPal, ties your credit cards, debit cards, PayPal account and other billing options to a personal identification number. After you complete an “initial registration setup,” Samsung says buying a TV show, movie, or app on your TV is as easy as entering your PIN and hitting the “Pay Now” button that subsequently appears.\nThat first-time setup could be a headache. (You’ll have to add each funding source individually to Samsung Pay on TV.) If you’ve got a Samsung mobile account with saved billing details, though, they’ll transfer automatically. Owners of the electronics giant’s 2014 and 2015 smart TVs will begin to see games that integrate Pay on TV. The list of supported titles will be quite small initially — about seven — but Samsung says it’ll add content “within new and world-renowned games” in the near future.\nHow do you set it up? Samsung Pay first became available on the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, and Note 5 devices, and required an over-the-air update to work. In 2016, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge were added to the list. Once you’ve added credit, debit, and loyalty cards, you open the Samsung Pay app with a swipe, choose the card you want to use, and authenticate the purchase with your fingerprint.\nJust like most forms of mobile payments, Samsung Pay will use Near Field Communications (NFC) to make payments at point-of-sale systems that accept tap-to-pay. However, unlike Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Samsung Pay will leverage the same technology standard credit cards use, called Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which will let the system work at most cash registers, regardless of whether or not they accept NFC payments. So long as the register accepts mag-stripe credit cards, which is something that nearly every single cash register can do, Samsung Pay should work.\nArticle originally published in June 2015. Julian Chokkattu, Kyle Wiggers, Williams Pelegrin, Christian de Looper, Robert Nazarian, and Andy Boxall have contributed to this report. Updated on 11-28-16 by Julian Chokkattu: Added news that Samsung Pay will work on most Android phones as long as it’s paired with a Gear S3.\nEverything you need to know about Android Pay Samsung Pay gains new loyalty features, Masterpass integration, and more Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, now in Japan and 10 other countries",

      "title": "Trump and Apple Manufacturing: Let's Try a Carrot Instead",
      "text": "Mac Pro is one of the few Apple products manufactured in the U.S. Image source: Apple.\nA big part of Donald Trump's election victory was predicated on the idea that Trump could reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing and the related jobs. While that's far easier said than done, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is no stranger to being targeted over its long-standing use of contract manufacturers in Asia. The president-elect has broadly mentioned the possibility of implementing import tariffs as a way to discourage domestic companies from making products abroad and shipping them home to sell, even though that risks a potentially disastrous trade war .\nHowever, instead of using punitive measures, Trump is now considering offering incentives to encourage domestic production. Can a carrot work better than a stick?\nIt better be a huge carrot Last week, Trump sat down with The New York Times for a wide-ranging interview covering many topics. Trump noted that Apple CEO Tim Cook gave him a call:\nI was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking.\nTrump has a tendency to view everything as a financial transaction that can be negotiated, so it's perfectly expected that his go-to tool would be a tax incentive. But money is not Apple's primary motivation in setting up its supply chain in this way (more on this later), nor would money likely appeal all that much to the world's richest company. Apple has long argued for comprehensive corporate tax reform , even if it meant a notable increase in the Mac maker's tax bill, and Trump is already planning on widespread tax cuts for corporations as well as potentially pursuing deemed repatriation , which would incentivize Apple to repatriate more rather than less (after paying a massive one-time tax bill). It's not clear what specific incentives Trump could offer Apple beyond what's already on the table.\nTrump is characteristically confident that he'll be able to succeed, despite very real operational challenges associated with Apple actually bringing any meaningful number of manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Beyond labor costs, it would be extremely difficult for Apple to build up a large work force of manufacturing employees with the right skill sets (in Tim Cook's words, \" vocational kind of skills \"). Additionally, most of Apple's component suppliers are located in Asia as well, so U.S. manufacturing would also result in substantially higher logistics costs. Short of the world's biggest carrot, Trump will likely fail at convincing Cook and Co. to expand Apple's domestic manufacturing operations in any significant way.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "title": "Apple’s $1 Billion Plan Hits a Three-Person Roadblock in Ireland",
      "text": "BLOOMBERG – “An Apple a day keeps the bank man away — stop objecting!”\nSo read the handwritten sign in Athenry, the tiny village close to Ireland’s Atlantic coast chosen by Apple Inc. for a vast $1 billion data facility. The message was for three people contesting the potential environmental impact and economic benefits from locals worried the company might scrap the project because of more than a year of delays. Meanwhile, the forestry site remains untouched before a judge hears another round of arguments in March.\n“This doesn’t just affect Athenry, but it affects Ireland as well,” said Paul Keane, 39, whose family has lived in the area for generations. “If Apple is turned away, what does it say about Ireland? It’s right that we have a fair and open system, but it can’t be dragged out.”\nWhat would be one of the most high-profile European investments for Apple is an even bigger deal for Ireland Inc. in what’s turned out to be a torrid year.\nBritain’s vote to leave the European Union has threatened to upend arrangements with one of its largest trading partners, while Donald Trump’s election victory might undermine Ireland’s status as a haven for U.S. companies in Europe. That was already in question after the EU ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.8 billion) relating to its Irish tax arrangements. Both the company and government are appealing.\nFor some, Athenry illustrates a deeper issue: the difficulty executing large infrastructure developments in Ireland compared with other countries regardless of how attractive the tax regime might be. Apple has already broken ground on a similar project in Denmark that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook announced simultaneously more than 18 months ago.\nAt that point, Cook expected the Irish data center to start operations in 2017. Now, it’s unlikely the project will be completed before March 2019 at the earliest based on the timeline company laid out at planning hearings. When asked about the delays, Apple pointed to Cook’s comment in September following the EU tax decision that the company remains “committed to Ireland.”\nThe data center in the Derrydonnell forest is due to cover 166,000 square meters, the equivalent to about 23 soccer fields on completion. When Cook announced his plan, it was welcomed in a region that had become a byword for economic gloom, immortalized in a folk ballad in the mid-19th century.\nQuickly, the project became bogged down in planning objections. Last week, a Dublin court agreed to fast-track a second legal challenge to the planning approval, though that still means the case won’t be heard for another four months. While the court probably won’t block the center altogether, it could send the project back into the planning process if it finds flaws in the earlier procedure.\nLocal Objections Two of the objectors making the court challenges, Allan Daly and Brian McDonagh, declined to comment, while a third, Sinead Fitzpatrick, didn’t respond to calls to her office seeking comment.\nA flavor of their objections can be found in the submission by the Concerned Residents of Lisheenkyle made during the planning process. That includes concerns that the development may hurt the biodiversity of the wood, the lack of services linked to it and the limited employment associated with data centers.\nLocal supporters fear that Apple may grow impatient, prompting community leaders to organize a rally in favor of the project earlier this month. Organizers say a couple of thousand people showed up, including children carrying signs emblazoned with “‘Athenry for Apple” and “Athenry says Yes.”\n“It was a gesture of solidarity with Apple, to show that the vast majority of people in the area support the project, ” said Peter Feeney, a local councilor with Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael party. “There are only a few opponents. People are beginning to get fed up. This project means an awful lot to the area.”\n",

      "text": "best apple watch bands ullu band gall More Apple made it very easy to change the strap on your Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2, but it made the official straps it sells very, very expensive. Beautiful though they are, there’s no need to be limited to Apple’s range of replacement bands, regardless of how much you have to spend.\nRelated: Ten annoying Apple Watch problems, and how to fix them\nLike putting your phone inside a case, changing the strap on your watch is the quickest way to give it an entirely new look, and it’s easy to build up a collection that goes with different outfits, or for when you’re doing certain activities. The choice is huge, so we’ve gathered together a list of our favorite straps and bands for the Apple Watch here.\nSouthern Straps Nato Strap ($25) A more textured nylon strap than the Nyloon example below, the Southern Straps band also has stitching running down each section, giving it a different look. It feels very hard-wearing, and has been double bonded and heat sealed to make sure it doesn’t just fall apart under tough conditions. We love the khaki and red version seen here, which comes with a choice of colors for the Apple Watch connectors, and in either 38mm or 42mm sizes. Let down slightly by the strap loop, which sometimes pinched wrist hairs.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Southern Straps\nNyloon Watch Band ($39) Nyloon’s nylon watch band feels like it’ll last a while and withstand some rough treatment, which is just what you need from this popular style. We’ve been wearing the Napier design, which comes in navy blue and red, and found it comfortable and stylish. The shiny hardware is attractive, and the Apple Watch adapter pieces have spring-loaded bars, so you can swap out the strap for another 20mm or 22m version of your own choice.\nBuy one now from:\nNyloon\nNomad Leather Strap ($60) Nomad’s classic leather strap, found elsewhere on our list, is available at a lower cost at the moment, but its new version has a more modern style. It loses the stitching for a sleeker, flatter look. We particularly love Nomad’s straps due to the custom designed Watch adapters, which change the look of the Watch’s face considerably. Both the adapters and the buckle have a matt finish and also come in black, ready to match your Watch model. It’s still quite a masculine design, but less so than the previous strap. The Horween leather is wonderfully supple out of the box and needs only a few hours to bed in.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nNomad Vulcanized LSR Silicone Strap ($40) If you like the stylish custom Nomad Watch adaptors, but don’t want a leather strap, then its new silicone strap may appeal. Incredibly soft, completely waterproof, and friendly to the skin, it’s the ideal accompaniment to the new swim-proof Apple Watch Series 2. The hardware comes in sliver or black, and the latter attached to a black watch gives a very cool stealth look. Unlike some silicone straps, the Nomad doesn’t get sweaty thanks to a special channel on the underside of the strap, but it did catch the hair on my arm occasionally.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nPad & Quill Field Strap ($100) Pad & Quill’s Field Strap is an interesting take on the fabric Watch strap, combining very hard wearing Cordura fabric with classy and comfortable leather, along with nickel hardware. The leather is stitched to the fabric on the underside, making the strap very easy to wear. Leather is also incorporated into other areas to give the band some visual excitement. The black and gray color combo is our pick, as it’s versatile enough to match most outfits and situations. Next to Nomad’s silicone strap, this is one of the most comfortable Apple Watch straps we’ve worn recently.\nBuy one now from:\nPad & Quill\nUllu Watch Band ($100+) Ullu Apple Watch Strap More Read More Using sustainable leather sourced from Italy, Thailand, Africa, and the U.S., these handcrafted leather bands are beautiful, and come in a wide range of rich colors. Available for both Apple Watch sizes, there’s a choice between premium or hand-colored leather, or moving up to the more expensive options of ostrich, stingray, or alligator leather. You can pick a case for your iPhone or iPad in the same color, for a complete matching look.\nBuy one now from:\nUllu Shop\nLunatik Epik Apple Watch Kit ($46+) Lunatik Epic Bike Lifestyle More If just changing the strap isn’t enough to transform the look of your Apple Watch, how about wrapping the body up in a chunky case at the same time? That’s the solution provided by Lunatik and its crazy Epik watch straps. The body is made from aluminum and protects the Apple Watch, while still allowing the sensors room to work, and the strap is made from silicone. It all works and fits together as one, giving your Watch a look like no other.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nIncipio Premium Leather Band ($30+) Incipio Premium Leather Band More Made from leather with stainless steel metalwork, Incipio’s Watch strap is more subtle than many other leather options, with a slimmer, sleeker profile. Made for the 38mm and 42mm watches, the strap comes in a choice of two shades of brown, or a darker black color. Incipio’s smartphones cases are great, and this strap has a classic design that’s sure to appeal to anyone who doesn’t want too much flash on their wrist.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nBurkley Soft Leather Band ($60) Burkley Soft Leather Band More You’ll love the look and feel of these soft, genuine leather straps for the Apple Watch. Burkley is expert at fashioning leather accessories, and these straps come in a choice of different finishes and with different buckle styles. The antique coffee finish with the classic buckle gets our vote, but you can pick whatever suits you. The clasp is included, for your chosen size. You’ll find the natural leather ages, so it looks even better when it’s worn in.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Burkley\nPad & Quill Lowry Leather Cuff ($130) Pad and Quill Lowry Cuff Apple Watch Strap More Renowned for its high quality, great looking leather Apple accessories, Pad & Quill makes three different straps for the Apple Watch, but we’ve singled out the Lowry Leather Cuff. Made from full grain leather in black, chestnut, or tan colors, with hand finished stitching and nickel buckles, the look is rugged yet classy. Suede on the underside of the strap makes it comfortable to wear. The one problem? It’s only for the 42mm Apple Watch.\nBuy one now from:\nPad & Quill\nMonowear Design Nylon Strap ($48) Monowear Design Nylon Strap More Monowear Design has a wide range of straps for the Apple Watch, but its Nylon range stands out as good value, plus there are several customization options to ensure it perfectly matches your own watch. The strap comes in various colors, while the buckle and adaptors come in stainless steel, silver, space black, rose gold, or gold. Straps are sold for the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nForm Function Form Button Stud Band ($48+) Form Function Form Button Stud Band More If you want something a little different, then take a look at Form Function Form’s funky Button Stud strap, which does away with any type of buckle or clasp. Instead, it has a stainless steel stud that holds a long, leather band in place. The stud and adaptor can be ordered in the color to suit your Apple Watch, just make sure you check the length to ensure the overall fit is correct. The company even provides lifetime, free size adjustments if you buy one.\nBuy one now from:\nBirchBox Form Function\nHyperLink Bracelet ($30) HyperLink Bracelet More A design classic, this stainless steel bracelet costs a fraction of Apple’s version, yet is made from the same material. It looks fantastic, has a cool clasp, and promises not to catch hair or skin even when worn all day. We tried an early version, and had no issues with it at all. Available in silver or a specially produced space black to match your Watch, you can buy the HyperLink bracelet for either the 38mm or 42mm watch.\nBuy one now from:\nHyperLink\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo ($115) Clessant Nubuck Buffalo More Hardwearing leather straps are everywhere, but nubuck straps are far less common. Clessant sells three in different colors, with the same glorious textured nubuck finish that’s soft on the skin and very easy on the eye. Buffalo leather is apparently more resistant than other types of nubuck leather, so it should stay looking good for longer. We’re partial to the purple version, which comes in 38mm or 42mm sizes, and a choice of adaptor colors.\nBuy one now from:\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo\nArrow & Board Triple Tour Strap ($120) Arrow & Board Double Tour Split Strap More Apple’s partnership with fashion house Hermes popularized the double tour style strap amongst Watch owners, but picking up a genuine version is very expensive. Arrow & Board’s option is far more reasonable, and comes with a split strap so it can be worn in three different ways. Made to order, it’s finished in tanned leather with hand stitched features and a series of brass loops and a buckle to keep the strap in place.\nBuy one now from:\nArrow & Board\nNomad Strap ($150) Nomad is well-known for its attractive Apple accessories, and its own Apple Watch strap is no exception. The Italian leather is chunky, and the oversize stainless steel buckle and wide loops give the strap a strong, rugged look. The draw here is the untreated leather, which means it’ll age in a way other straps may not, gaining its own character over time. It’s sold for the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch, comes in three colors, and a choice of black or silver metalwork.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nThe best deals on accessories for the iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch How to order the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Nike+ Apple Watch Twenty-five cases to keep your iPhone SE looking like new",

      "text": "Shutterstock\nThe iPhone is no stranger to battery problems , but it looks like Apple has hit an especially large battery-killing bump with the latest update to iOS 10 (10.1.1) which is quickly collecting reports of wrecking battery life and making its users miserable.\nA thread on YCombinator is rapidly collecting stories of the iPhone, especially the iPhone 6 and 6S, experiencing severe battery issues when the new update is installed. While the details vary, the broad strokes are fairly clear: The battery drains fast, the phone runs hot, and battery life is as short as three to four hours, with phones shutting down while showing 30% to 50% power left. The iPhone’s battery management app is offering nothing in the way of guidance as to what’s happening, and users are reporting it’s way off, possibly simply tracking how long apps are being used instead of their power drain.\nRelated Links:\nThe Facebook App May Be Killing Your Phone’s Battery Life This Five-Second Video Will Completely Crash Your iPhone\nShort battery life has been an issue before, but the new update is apparently aggravating the problem. And it’s not clear exactly what’s causing the battery to run out so quickly. Some are reporting a hardware switch fixed the issue, others claim that it eventually resolved itself, and still others have no relief in sight just yet. Anybody experiencing the problem should contact Apple about the issue, and keep a charger handy.\nThe same thread reports that 10.2 solves the issue. We’ll likely see whether that’s true sooner rather than later, as Apple is reportedly working on a fix .\n(Via PC Mag )",

      "text": "best iphone plus cases mujjo More No one likes a bruised apple, and if you drop your new iPhone 7 Plus it could end up scraped, scarred, or worse. The smart play is to invest in some protection. There are lots of different cases out there; some safeguard against drops, some are all about the style, and some add extra functionality. We’ve been checking out your options and these are some of the best iPhone 7 Plus cases you can buy right now.\nRelated : The best iPhone 7 screen protectors to shield your phone’s big, beautiful display\nSnakehive Vintage Leather Wallet ($24) Made from European cowhide nubuck leather, the Snakehive Leather Wallet is one you’ll just want to hold in your hand, it feels so good. It’s all thanks to a wonderfully soft texture on the outside, which has been smoothed out for extra protection on the inside. The iPhone is held in a slim, clear plastic case, with wide cutouts for the volume and power buttons, along with the speakers and charging port too. Opposite are three card slots and a pocket for cash, plus a magnetic clasp that keeps the case closed. The folio case can fold out into a stand for your iPhone 7 Plus, for watching video. Don’t miss this super stylish, real leather folio available in the burgundy seen here, or in chestnut brown and navy colors, at an excellent price.\nBuy one now from:\nSnakehive\nSena Lugano Wallet ($54+) Sena’s Lugano Wallet case covers all the key bases for your iPhone. It protects the body with hard wearing leather and reinforced plastic, along with softer silicone surrounds for the buttons and speakers, plus there’s a herringbone design lining to keep the phone free from scratches when it’s inside the case. The edge is raised to keep the screen away from the surface if placed face down, and the case provides rugged shock absorption. There are also three credit card slots built into the case. Available in cognac, black, and denim colors for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $60.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Sena Cases\nSena Wallet Book ($80) This case gives you all the protection offered by Sena’s Lugano Wallet case, but with a folio design that doubles as a hands-free stand for your phone. The folio cover keeps the screen safe from harm and contains space for two credit cards, cash, and an identification card. The herringbone design lining and Heritage leather ensures your iPhone is protected from all angles and sides. It’s also pleasingly easy to fit and remove the phone, however, the case does add considerable size and bulk. It comes in cognac, black, denim, and praline colors for $80.\nBuy one now from:\nEtsy Sena Cases\nVRS Design Duo Guard ($30) It’s called Duo Guard because the case is made from both polycarbonate and TPU plastic, providing MIL-810G standard protection against drops. It looks classier than the usual military-standard protective case, due to a brushed metal effect rear cover, and a metal kickstand built into the case itself. It’s spring-loaded and held closed by a magnetic catch. We like the raised edge to protect the screen, and the grippy sides, which make this a comfortable and secure case to hold. It comes in a range of colors, including the cool silver seen here, for $30.\nBuy one now from:\nVRS Design\nPad & Quill Bella Fino Case ($80) Made from a single piece of leather and embossed with the Pad & Quill name and logo, this is a folio case for the iPhone 7 Plus, that instead of clipping your phone into a built-in case, has a sticky pad to keep it in place. The pad is made by 3M, and leaves no residue if you decide to remove it in the future. The folio case has four credit card holders, an ID window, and space for some cash. The leather feels superb, and the stitching adds character, while the whole case stays relatively slim and lightweight. It’s quite stiff to start with, and needs a few days in a pocket before it softens up and closes properly. There are three colors available and the case costs $80.\nBuy one now from:\nEtsy Pad & Quill\nVRS Design Crystal Mixx ($25) Transparent cases are going to be huge this year, thanks to the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus and the need for people to show off the flashy new finish. VRS Design’s Crystal Mixx case is made from see-through polycarbonate and has a raised lip to keep the screen away from any surface contact, plus a kickstand on the rear to prop the phone up for watching video. The flexible sides make fitting the case really easy too. We prefer the clear version, but there is a rose gold colored version too.\nRead More Buy one now from:\nVRS Design\nTech21 Impact Clear Case ($40) A lightweight case that still provides some drop protection, which we love because it’s see-through enough to show off our cool new iPhone 7 Plus. The sides are soft enough to make fitting the case easy, but the special protective design and strong material keeps the phone safe. The rear panel is opaque, and has subtle Tech21 branding at the bottom, while the camera cutout is raised enough to protect the iPhone’s lens bump. There’s no screen-protecting lip though, and the button covers require quite a prod to get them working.\nBuy one now from:\nTech21\nTech21 Evo Tactical Extreme Edition ($50) This is a two-piece protective case that also comes with a second section complete with a belt clip, into which the encased phone can be placed either way around, to make sure the screen is fully protected. It’s easy to fit, consisting of a clip-on front cover and an impact-absorbing wrap around case, which then slides safely into the belt clip. Once inside, your phone’s protected even in a 4-meter fall. It’s not subtle, and does add considerable size to the phone, but because it’s easy to fit, you can use it only when needed.\nBuy one now from:\nTech21\nBurkley Ultimate Snap-on Stand Case ($66) The Burkley Ultimate Snap-on Stand Case has a beautiful suede lining, that we almost wish it was on the outside too. Instead, the case is made from far more hard-wearing leather, and has a design that offers an unusual twist on traditional folio style cases. A flap with three credit card slots is hinged, then folds back to prop up your phone for watching videos. When not in use, it’s magnetically held in place. The case is very secure, and once the phone’s in place, it’s not coming out very quickly. There are various leather styles to choose from, and it costs $66.\nBuy one now from:\nBurkley Case\nSkech Matrix ($28+) and Matrix Sparkle ($40) Skech’s unusual combination of soft silicone-style case and impact resistance makes the Matrix case feel like soft, slightly sticky rubber. We like the honeycomb effect on the standard Matrix version, but others will really love the glittery sparkles inside the Matrix Sparkle. There’s also plenty of screen protection from the raised lip on the front, and a very large camera lens cutout on the rear. However, the buttons are quite hard to push.\nBuy one now from:\nMatrix Matrix Sparkle\nSkech Polo Book ($40) A combination of classy folio case, protective hard case, and a handy stand, the Polo Book is suitable for all occasions. The hard case has a leather-look rear panel and a soft lining, but be aware, it’s made of very stiff plastic and once it’s on your phone, it’s a struggle to get it off. It magnetically clips to the folio section, which has two credit card slots and an ID window, plus the whole things folds back to make a stand for the phone. The versatility of only using the folio section when needed, but still protecting your phone with a hard shell case, makes the Polo Book standout.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nGrovemade Walnut & Leather Wallet Case ($140) Grovemade Walnut & Leather Wallet Case More Crafted in Portland from gorgeous natural materials, Grovemade’s cases are a bit special. This one combines a walnut wood frame with a full grain leather cover that wraps around the screen. There are tactile button covers and openings for the switch, port, and camera. Open it up, and you’ll find space for a couple of cards and bills. Because it’s wood and leather, this case is going to age and it’s not really designed for drop protection, though it will deflect scrapes and bumps. It does also add some bulk, but it looks fantastic.\nBuy one now from:\nGroveMade\nMujjo Leather Wallet Case ($50) Mujjo Leather Wallet Case More If you don’t want a folio-style case, but you’re still keen to leave the wallet at home, then this offering from Mujjo could be the one for you. There’s a tough shell to hold your iPhone 7 Plus in place and it’s covered in full grain, vegetable-tanned leather. On the back, you’ll find an angled pocket that’s just right for a card and a bill. The openings are large and offer easy access to all buttons, the port, and the camera. It’s comfortable to hold, but it won’t provide much drop protection. You can get it in black, gray, or tan.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nMoshi Overture Wallet Case ($50) Moshi Overture Wallet Case More The cases from Moshi are always beautifully turned out. The Overture combines a solid protective shell with a vegan (fake) leather exterior. The shell provides good drop protection and when you open the cover, you’ll find four slots for cards and IDs and a larger money pocket, as well as a handy Neato microfiber pad to help keep the screen clean. There are button covers for volume and power, and generous openings for the camera, port, and switch, so your iPhone 7 Plus can be used easily while it’s wearing this case. It comes finished in cream, pink, or black with neat stitching and a small metallic Moshi logo.\nBuy one now from:\nMoshi\nDistil Union Wally Wallet Case ($50) Distil Union Wally Wallet Case More Here’s a smart design to keep your cash and cards hidden away, but easily accessible when you need them. The shock-absorbent, TPU bumper safeguards your iPhone 7 Plus from impact damage and it’s covered in high-quality leather. On the back, there’s an unobtrusive pocket that can hold up to four credit cards and two folded bills. When you want to get at them, simply pull the red tab and they’ll slide out. The buttons are covered, but there are cut-outs for the camera, port, and switch. You can get this case in black, brown, gray, or red.\nBuy one now from:\nDistil Union\nOtterBox Strada Series Folio Case ($60) OtterBox Strada Series Folio Case More You can count on the drop protection you get from OtterBox cases, and it’s rare to find rugged drop protection in a folio or wallet style case like this. The Strada comprises a tough polycarbonate shell with a real, premium leather skin on the top. There’s a cover that closes with a metal latch and when you open it up, you’ll find a single slot for an ID or credit card. This case is tough, stylish, and practical. It comes in two-tone brown or green, or plain black.\nBuy one now from:\nOtterbox\nTech21 Evo Elite Case ($50) Tech21 Evo Elite Case More The Evo Elite is one of Tech21’s most protective iPhone 7 Plus case and it offers drop protection from up to 6.6 feet. By developing a special shock absorbing material and designing impact absorption into the frame, Tech21 has managed to deliver a really rugged case that isn’t massively bulky, like its Evo Tactical Extreme Edition. If you want a crystal clear option to show the iPhone off, then you’ll need to go for the Impact Clear case instead, but the gold and rose gold versions of the Evo Elite do have clear back panels. Your final option is the Evo Elite in brushed black, which is tinted with a black surround and button covers. The fit is perfect and the openings are generous, offering uninterrupted access to all iPhone features.\nBuy one now from:\nTech21\nNodus Shell Case ($74) Nodus Shell Case More Leather is a great material for cases because it’s comfortable to hold, it looks great, and it’s pretty durable, but you may not necessarily want to have a wallet case. Nodus offers vegetable-tanned Italian leather in a traditional shell style with this case. The core is polycarbonate, but it’s covered in brown, black, teal, gray, or yellow leather with a soft microfiber lining inside. The case hugs the corners, but there are large cut-outs top and bottom and openings for the switch and camera. Subtly defined button covers mark the volume and power keys. This case is also compatible with the magnetic mounting system for easy docking.\nBuy one now from:\nNodus\nFlexishield Gel Case ($8) Flexishield Gel Case More Sometimes you just want a simple, slim covering to add some grip and basic protection. The translucent Flexishield is a good choice in that case and it certainly won’t break the bank. It’s made from a soft gel material, so it’s very easy to fit and it adds grip. There are thin button covers for volume and power and accurate cut-outs for the camera, port, and switch. There’s a slightly raised lip around the screen, but don’t expect rugged protection. It comes in gold, black, blue, and pink.\nBuy one now from:\nMobile Fun\nVRS Design High Pro Shield Case ($30) VRS Design High Pro Shield Case More This stylish case has a brushed metal design on the back and a handy kickstand for propping your iPhone 7 Plus in landscape view. The main shell is flexible and shock absorbent and there’s a harder plastic frame that goes on top and sports the kickstand, held in place magnetically. The openings for camera, ports, and switch are generous and the button covers work just fine. There’s also a cut-out on the back for the Apple logo. The inner layer is always black, but you can combine it a frame in black, gold, blue, silver, or rose gold.\nBuy one now from:\nVRS Design\nTerrapin Slim Hard Case ($8) Terrapin Slim Hard Case More If you’re looking for a slim, cheap case, but you’d prefer something hard, then check this one out. Terrapin’s cases are devoid of detail, you just get a soft-touch matte finish that’s comfortable to hold and in a plain block color. There are openings for the ports, camera, and controls and the polycarbonate case snaps onto your iPhone 7 Plus for a snug fit. It’s only going to provide very limited protection, but it does add some grip. This case comes in red, purple, or black.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nHere are the 5 best deals HP is serving up for Cyber Monday Check out 20 of the best iPhone 7 cases and covers for your shiny new phone Best iPhone 7 Plus screen protectors to shield your big, beautiful display",

      "text": "Cedric Ribeiro | Getty Images Customers await the Apple iPhone 7 launch. Apple is considering more than 10 designs for its 10th anniversary iPhone next year, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nA curved screen, long-rumored to be in the cards for Apple, is among the prototypes, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. Apple suppliers have been asked to create thinner screens with better resolution to one-up Samsung's Galaxy Edge, the Journal reported. \nIn addition to competing with Apple's smartphones, Samsung is one of the only companies in the world that can make large enough quantities of flexible screens for Apple. Experts had previously told CNBC that it was unlikely any other supplier could match Samsung's expertise at a large scale within the next year. \nBut Apple might have to cooperate with the enemy, as flexible screens pave the way for innovations like foldable smartphones. A new form factor like a foldable phone could silence critics who have decried Apple's recent lack of innovation . \nFor more on the story, see the article at WSJ.com.",

      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Monday, November 28, 2016, 12:38 pm PT (03:38 pm ET) Apple crushed Samsung in the emerging market for premium smartphones in India during October, taking a leading 66 percent share of sales. Samsung's second place accounted for 23 percent of sales from Galaxy S7 and similar phones, while Google--which has made the subcontinent a focus--took 10 percent of sales. Only 1 percent was attributed to other makers. Mumbai, India While Apple's sales in India are often portrayed as a struggling, slow effort--due to the fact that far fewer Indians can afford premium phones compared to leading markets such as China and the United States--the figures from Counterpoint Research show that Apple is actually performing very well in India. As it does worldwide, Samsung still sells more basic smartphones in India than Apple, but those devices are not generating sustainable profits. Samsung's earnings from phone sales come almost entirely from its premium models, and those sales were knocked down by the failure of its latest flagship model, the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. Counterpoint Research data was published by India Times in an informercial by Gulveen Aulakh seeking to promote Google's third place standing. The piece stated that \"Google shipped 33,000 units of Pixel to India as of October end,\" indicating that Apple sold nearly a quarter million handsets during the month. Google boosted sales with a variety of discounts, cash back offers, and a \"heavy spend on marketing\" which was used to \"showcase Pixel and Pixel XL in key stores of large-format retail chains including Croma, Reliance Digital, Spice Mobility and Jumbo.\" \"Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50 percent in fiscal 2016\" - Tim Cook Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has focused increasing attention on India as an important emerging market for the company. \"Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity,\" Cook told analysts in October during Apple's quarterly earnings call. Responding to an analyst question, Cook noted almost half of all Indians are under the age of 25, and the already populous country is expected to swell beyond China in the next decade. India's GDP is on the way up, as well, though might not be a factor in iPhone's success. \"That's not critical for us to have a great success there,\" Cook said. \"The truth is there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And Given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there's a lot of headroom there in our mind. So, we're working very hard to realize that opportunity.\" In May, after Strategy Analytics reported very limited overall market share for iPhones across the entire market including low end models, Cook told the Indian media, \"We are in India for the next thousand years. Our horizon is very long. We are focused on best, not most. So it doesn't bother me that we don't have top market share.\" After a failed bid to prove that it was selling state-of-the-art or cutting edge technologies, Apple has been fighting India's local sourcing rules that demand that a multinational company source 30 percent of its components in India before retail establishments can operate. However, single-brand retailers like Apple now have a three-year grace period to operate stores before mandatory compliance of the 30 percent rule. Apple's main assembly partner, Foxconn, is believed to be planning an Apple-focused factory for India , which would fulfill the 30 percent mandate. No deal has yet been signed, and even after negotiations complete, operations would take more than a year to commence. Earlier this year, Apple launched a technology center in Hyderabad, focused on Apple Maps development. In July, the company leased 40,000 square feet in Bengaluru for a planned design and development accelerator . Neither software development center will have any effect on sourcing percentages Topics: ",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Monday, November 28, 2016 Apple Allegedly Taking Another Page From Android Playbook With Curved OLED iPhone 8 Display If you’re tired of the same old, same old when it comes to iPhone display technology, there might be much to look forward to in 2017. According to a new report, Apple is planning to make a big splash with the iPhone 8 , which will arrive in fall 2017, coinciding with the 10 th anniversary of the original iPhone.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is working on at least ten different iPhone 8 prototypes, one of which features a curved OLED display. This move would finally bring Apple in line with display technology that Android flagships adopted years ago. Samsung has been a leader in OLED displays, first incorporating the technology into its Galaxy S smartphone in 2010. Today’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge flagships both feature a 1440p QHD Super AMOLED display. \nAs for curved displays, Android phones have also embraced this design trend, with most enthusiasts being introduced to the tech with the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge in 2014. OLED panels are traditionally thinner than their LCD counterparts, which allows for more daring curved displays like the Galaxy S7 Edge and now defunct Galaxy Note 7 . \nApple’s current LCD suppliers include LG, Japan Display, and Sharp — each has reportedly been tasked by Apple to invest in OLED production for future iPhones. At least one, Sharp, has said in recent months that it would indeed be producing OLED panels for a next generation iPhone. \n\"The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels,” said Sharp CEO Tai Jeng-wu in late October. Interestingly, he continued, criticizing Apple, stating, \"We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity.” \nWhoever Apple chooses to supply displays for an OLED-equipped iPhone, none will likely have the capacity or expertise as industry heavyweight Samsung. It’s estimated that LCD-based smartphone displays generated $20.8 billion in revenue during 2015 compared to $10.6 billion for OLED displays. However, OLED revenue is expected to jump to at least $18.6 billion by 2018. \nIt should be noted that while the iPhone has to this date shunned OLED technology, Apple does use the technology in other products. Both generations of the Apple Watch feature OLED displays and the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros are available with OLED Touch Bars.",

      "text": "Apple may remove the home button in next year's iPad Pros to make way for larger displays And they'll be thicker than their predecessors on Nov 28, 2016, 1:00 PM TechSpot \nBack in October, it was reported that Apple would be launching three new iPad Pros next year. In addition to a refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a low-cost 7.9-inch version, there will also be a 10.1-inch model. According to Japanese site Makotakara (via 9to5 Mac), which was responsible for the original report, this middle iPad will actually be 10.9 inches yet have the same footprint as the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, despite the larger screen size. \nThe information comes from an “informed” supply-chain source in Taiwan. It seems Apple is able to achieve this feat by changing parts of the tablet’s design, the biggest alteration being the removal of the physical home button. \nTo make more room for the screen, Apple is expected to replace its iconic physical home button on the iPhone 8 with a virtual button - complete with Touch ID functionality - that’s built underneath the display glass, similar to Xiaomi 's Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus. If the report is to be believed, the upcoming iPad will receive this new design feature before the smartphone. \nAdditionally, the size of the tablet’s bezels will be reduced to make way for a larger display, though the FaceTime camera will remain. The tradeoff for this, however, is said to be an increase in the device’s thickness; to make room for the battery and Apple Pencil display tech, the new iPad will be 7.5mm thick, the same as the original 2013 iPad Air. \nThe new 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s thickness is also said to be increasing by 3mm, suggesting that it will also have its bezels size reduced and physical home button removed. \nThe actual screen size of the upcoming iPad is still unclear. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes it will be 10.5 inches, rather than Makotakara's updated claim of 10.9 inches. \nIf you’re in the market for a new tablet, check out our updated “ best of ” feature to see the top device in every category.

      "text": "\n\nIf you search for “Microsoft Excel” in Apple's App Store, the top result is a $30 “Office Bundle,\" advertised as a way to \"create Word, Excel and PowerPoint Documents.\" In reality, it's just a bunch of templates for Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, but that's not made clear in the description. The $30 purchase price is split between the publisher (2/3) and Apple (1/3). ' \nIt turns out that the App Store is filled with scam apps like this. \nFrom How-To Geek : \nLet’s be blunt: these customers were ripped off, and Apple pocketed $10 each. And you’ll only see these comments if you scroll past the two five star reviews that mention the word “app” numerous times. Both of those reviews, by the way, were left by accounts that haven’t reviewed any other apps in the Store. \nSearch for other Office applications and you’ll find more template bundles, disguised as official applications to varying degrees. \nThere are also several $20+ applications that put Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser. Then there are the actual “apps” capable of opening and editing Office files, many of which use terms like “Microsoft Word” in their names. They appear to be slightly modified versions of open source applications, but we’re not about to buy them to find out. ",

      "title": "Apple Rumor: The 2017 iPad Could Be Redesigned",
      "text": "According to Japanese Apple blog, Mac Otakara , the 2017 iPad could see a complete redesign. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] \nIn the report, Mac Otakara claims that the next iPad won’t have a home button, which, incidentally, coincides with rumors of Apple killing off the home button on their 2017 iPhone . (Another incident of Apple forcefully propelling us into the future, it seems.) Furthermore, it’s insinuated the 2017 iPad will be borderless. “New iPads in March — Bezel-less [like the upcoming iPhone] — We expect the 9.7″ to move to a low-cost model, a refresh of the 12.9″ pro and a new 10.9″, which is likely the same physical size as the 9.7″ but with a borderless screen,” an analyst wrote, as stated in Business Insider . Curiously, Mac Otakara ‘s statement seems to contradict that of the analyst in the Business Insider post, writing, “[the] whole model is not necessarily bezel-less, but the bezel is left in the top portion where the FaceTime camera is equipped, and the Home button would be also removed.” As confusing as the language is — it is translated from Japanese to English, so some comprehension may have been lost during the translation process — this suggests that the only bezel on the 2017 iPad will be at the top of the device for the FaceTime camera; the rest of the device will be bezel-less. \nThese rumors began surfacing earlier this year courtesy of Business Insider , who stated that “Apple is preparing new iPads for a launch in March.” Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities analyst and fervent Apple predictor, originally came forth with a report that Apple would be introducing new iPads as soon as 2018, but a new 10.5-inch iPad would be announced sometime next year. This would mean there would be four iPad sizes: the iPad Mini at 7.9-inches, the classic iPad at 9.7-inches, the new 2017 iPad at 10.5-inches, and the larger iPad Pro at 12.9-inches. \nAs previously reported here on The Inquisitr , Apple is rumored to ship three new iPad Pros in the spring of 2017. Along with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, there are, purportedly, two new “Pro” size options: a 7.9-inch model (the same size as the iPad Mini), and a 10.1-inch model (which is dangerously close to the rumored 10.5-inch iPad). With this information, this would mean there are to be three new sized iPads launching in 2017: a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, a 10.1-inch iPad Pro, and a 10.5-inch iPad. (It’s unclear whether this new iPad is a “Pro,” a “Mini,” or just an iPad.) Along with the redesigns, it seems Apple is preparing for a hefty iPad launch next year. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Apple Redesigns \nThe iPad isn’t the only device to see the classic redesign treatment from Apple. \nThe iPhone 4 introduced us to a device that was exorbitantly different — and smaller — than its iPhone 3GS counterpart. The iPhone 5 introduced us to a phone that was vastly different — and thinner and slightly larger — than its iPhone 4 counterpart. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus introduced us to a newly designed iPhone, a device that is starkly different — and curvier and much taller — than its blocky iPhone 5 counterpart. \nSimilarly, Apple’s desktops and laptops have seen quite a few redesigns over the years as well. \nThe MacBook Pro introduced us to an aluminum design that was different from the polycarbonate design of the original MacBook. The MacBook Air took the aluminum design of the MacBook Pro and shrunk it to make the notebook more portable. The MacBook took the aluminum design of the MacBook Pro and the thinness of the MacBook Air to make the notebook even more portable. After more than 10 years, the Mac Pro finally saw a redesign that made the workstation sleeker, leaner, and more compact, even if it resembled a trashcan. And the iMacs finally shrunk in size and weight, making them easier to setup on a desk without taking up a ton of space. \nWith 2017 in our midsts, March is right around the corner and with it comes a supposed Apple keynote event that should answer all of these lingering questions and rumors. \n[Featured Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images]",

      "text": "Yasser Farahi/Oval Picture \nApple is testing more than 10 prototypes for new iPhones that could go on sale next year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. \nCiting sources, some of those prototypes may have a new design centered around a curved screen.\nThe technology that would enable that curved screen is called OLED, which is a newer kind of display that has deeper blacks and lower power consumption.\nThe fact that Apple will need tens of millions of these OLED screens for next year is setting off a race among screen makers, including Samsung, LG Display, Foxconn-owned Sharp, and Japan Display.\nThe WSJ says that Samsung will supply \"most\" of Apple's initial OLED needs, confirming what Bloomberg reported earlier .\nBut Apple is pushing the other three to gear up to supply OLED iPhone screens as soon as 2018. That would require significant investment — the Journal says that Sharp would need to spend more than $5 billion to develop the technology and capacity to supply OLED screens to Apple. \n\"We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity,\" Sharp chief executive Tai Jeng-wu said last month. \nA clear picture The information in Monday's Journal story lines up with other reports from Nikkei , as well as analyst reports from Barclays and KGI Securities . \nAs iPhone sales decline, pressure is mounting on Apple to deliver a very desirable new iPhone model in 2017 to return the line to growth. \nThis model is widely expected to feature glass casing, wireless charging, and a new edge-to-edge screen design, in addition to the latest chips and technologies.  \n\"iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope,\" Barclays analysts wrote in November. \nKGI Securities pointed to three iPhone models in 2017, with only one sporting the new kind of OLED screen. \"We predict three new iPhone models will be launched in 2017: 5.1-5.2” OLED, 4.7” TFT-LCD, and 5.5” TFT-LCD,\" the KGI Securities analyst wrote.\nThe Journal warns that the OLED iPhone could be scrapped before its expected launch next fall. After all, Apple is testing 10 prototypes and reportedly killed an iPhone model months before launch in 2016. It sounds like what Apple ends up launching will depend on whether Apple's Asian suppliers can provide enough next-generation screens. \nNOW WATCH: These crucial tips will make your iPhone battery last longer \n",

      "text": "BII Hear more from AT&T 's CEO, Randall Stephenson,  at Business Insider's  IGNITION: Future Of Digital   this December in New York City .    Tickets On Sale Now »  \nThomson Reuters \nAT&T will give away free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire TV Sticks with its new streaming TV service, DirecTV Now, the company announced on Monday.\nUsers who pay ahead of time for three months of DirecTV Now can receive the latest Apple TV for free, which retails for $149. \nAT&T will also give away an Amazon Fire TV Stick for free if customers pay for 1 month of DirecTV Now, AT&T said in a press release. \nDirecTV's new service comes in several packages, starting at 60 channels for $35 per month, and going up to a $70 per month package with 120 channels.\nCurrently, DirecTV is offering a 100 channel tier for $35 per month, although it said that offer is available for a limited time.\nMaking waves  Thomson Reuters AT&T made waves in the industry last month when it announced that DirecTV Now would provide more than 100 channels for a mere $35 a month, undercutting many rivals on price. (Wall Street was expecting it to cost about $50 a month, according to analysts at Macquarie.)\nAT&T says it will be able to make the economics work at that price in part by cutting out legacy equipment like satellite dishes. DirecTV Now will be delivered over the internet, eliminating the need for cable or satellite but, to watch it on a TV, requiring a streaming box (like an Apple TV) or a smart TV.\nNot everyone, however, has a streaming box ready to go. With this promotion, it seems as if AT&T is trying to bridge the \"streaming gap\" for customers by simply giving them a free streaming box.\nMake no mistake: This is a monster giveaway.\nDirecTV Now's least expensive package is only $35 a month, which means AT&T is asking for just a $105 commitment. An Apple TV alone costs $150 at retail. And if you don't want to commit to three months of DirecTV Now, you can sign up for one month ($35) and get a free Amazon Fire TV Stick. That would cost you about $40 at retail.\nThe best channels  DirecTV now will have a lot of commonly-requested channels. AT&T has already signed deals with HBO, Discovery, NBCUniversal, Turner, Viacom, Disney, AMC, Scripps, Starz, and more. So it seems as if all the big guns will be signed up for launch. \nDirecTV Now will have a \"72-hour catch-up window,\" according to Variety, which will let you watch shows on-demand for three days after they air. But there may be limitations on this feature — ESPN isn't on that catch-up list, for instance. DirecTV Now will also have an on-demand library of \"up to 14,000 titles,\" according to Variety.\nFor those who don't want to start paying before testing it out, DirecTV Now will let you have a seven-day free trial, AT&T said on Monday. \nThe future is streaming AT&T has big plans for DirecTV Now and thinks it will be the company's primary TV platform by 2020 , according to Bloomberg.\nIn the immediate time period, a recent report from MoffettNathanson estimated that DirecTV Now could snag 11 million subscribers.\nHere's the potential breakdown: 2 million cannibalized from DirecTV, 6 million from other pay TV, and 3 million \"cord-cutters.\"\nThe 2 million subscribers transferred from DirecTV's traditional packages would be of concern to AT&T. Eleven million is a huge number, however, especially considering Sling TV is the market leader after only recently reaching 1 million subscribers, according to Bloomberg .\nNOW WATCH: France will trial a flying water taxi which surfs two feet above water \n",

      "title": "AT&T will give away free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire Sticks with its new $35 streaming TV service (T)",
      "text": "Hear more from AT&T 's CEO, Randall Stephenson, at Business Insider's IGNITION: Future Of Digital this December in New York City . Tickets On Sale Now » \n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California. Thomson Reuters \nAT&T will give away free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire TV Sticks with its new streaming TV service, DirecTV Now, the company announced on Monday . \nUsers who pay ahead of time for three months of DirecTV Now can receive the latest Apple TV for free, which retails for $149. \nAT&T will also give away an Amazon Fire TV Stick for free if customers pay for 1 month of DirectTV Now, AT&T said in a press release. \nDirectTV's new service comes in several packages, starting at 60 channels for $35 per month, and going up to a $70 per month package with 120 channels. \nCurrently, DirectTV is offering a 100 channel tier for $35 per month, although it said that offer is available for a limited time. Making waves \nAT&T \nAT&T made waves in the industry last month when it announced that DirecTV Now would provide more than 100 channels for a mere $35 a month, undercutting many rivals on price. (Wall Street was expecting it to cost about $50 a month, according to analysts at Macquarie.) \nAT&T says it will be able to make the economics work at that price in part by cutting out legacy equipment like satellite dishes. DirecTV Now will be delivered over the internet, eliminating the need for cable or satellite but, to watch it on a TV, requiring a streaming box (like an Apple TV) or a smart TV. \nNot everyone, however, has a streaming box ready to go. With this promotion, it seems as if AT&T is trying to bridge the \"streaming gap\" for customers by simply giving them a free streaming box. \nMake no mistake: This is a monster giveaway. \nDirecTV Now's least expensive package is only $35 a month, which means AT&T is asking for just a $105 commitment. An Apple TV alone costs $150 at retail. And if you don't want to commit to three months of DirecTV Now, you can sign up for one month ($35) and get a free Amazon Fire TV Stick. That would cost you about $40 at retail. The best channels \nDirectTV now will have a lot of commonly-requested channels. AT&T has already signed deals with HBO, Discovery, NBCUniversal, Turner, Viacom, Disney, AMC, Scripps, Starz, and more. So it seems as if all the big guns will be signed up for launch. \nDirecTV Now will have a \"72-hour catch-up window,\" according to Variety, which will let you watch shows on-demand for three days after they air. But there may be limitations on this feature — ESPN isn't on that catch-up list, for instance. DirecTV Now will also have an on-demand library of \"up to 14,000 titles,\" according to Variety. \nFor those who don't want to start paying before testing it out, DirecTV Now will let you have a seven-day free trial, AT&T said on Monday. The future is streaming \nAT&T has big plans for DirecTV Now and thinks it will be the company's primary TV platform by 2020 , according to Bloomberg. \nIn the immediate time period, a recent report from MoffettNathanson estimated that DirecTV Now could snag 11 million subscribers. \nHere's the potential breakdown: 2 million cannibalized from DirecTV, 6 million from other pay TV, and 3 million \"cord-cutters.\" \nThe 2 million subscribers transferred from DirecTV's traditional packages would be of concern to AT&T. Eleven million is a huge number, however, especially considering Sling TV is the market leader after only recently reaching 1 million subscribers, according to Bloomberg .",

      "text": "People are Getting New iPhone 6s Batteries from Apple If your 6s is randomly dying, read on. iPhones November 28, 2016 A pple made a mistake in manufacturing the iPhone 6s, and now it’s set up a battery replacement program to help those affected by the issue. This will make it much easier for people whose iPhones die without warning to get a new battery installed that (one would hope) won’t have the same problem. Samsung’s well-documented struggle to respond to exploding batteries in the Galaxy Note 7 might have you worried — don’t be. Apple said that the iPhone 6s battery problem merely leads to devices that unexpectedly turn off. If that sounds like your phone, and the winter cold isn’t to blame , you’ll want to at least look into this program. Here’s how. Back up your phone’s data. Your first response to any problem with your phone should be to back up the data stored on it. This has become easier thanks to the rise in popularity of cloud services, but for anyone who doesn’t use those tools or wants extra peace of mind, it’s good to get into the habit of backing up critical information. And if there is a problem with your phone’s battery, this will also save you the trouble of having to create a backup when you hand over your phone to Apple. Check your device’s serial number. Only iPhone 6s models made between September and October 2015 have been affected by this problem. If you head to an Apple store or visit one of the company’s approved technicians, the first thing they’ll do is check your serial number. You can do the same by going to Settings > General > About and scrolling to the Serial Number section. Then compare the result to this list from 9to5Mac : Q3",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Share \nSince its well-publicized meeting with the FDA in 2013, Apple has continued to meet with the agency regularly as well as to correspond by phone and email, according to emails obtained by MobiHealthNews via a Freedom of Information Act request to the FDA. These emails show that Apple and the FDA have discussed the App Store review process, the 510(k) process, ResearchKit apps, diagnostic apps, working with the FDA in an “unregulated” way and more. The FDA even invited Apple to participate in regular briefings designed to help guide an international effort to harmonize medical software regulation. Though much of the sensitive information is redacted, the emails also point to three regulated medical devices that Apple is seriously pursuing: an app for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease and two separate but related cardiac devices. Finally, the emails also suggest that, after Apple received a good deal of press for its 2013 FDA meeting, the agency worked with Apple to keep future meetings under the radar. The record shows meeting names and locations were changed, and great consideration was given to when to include top officials, like FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director for the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, whose calendars are public and might have exposed the company to more media scrutiny. The emails obtained by MobiHealthNews start in December 2013, shortly after Apple’s well-known FDA meeting. We guessed, as did many others, that the content of that meeting was about keeping Apple in unregulated territory for at-the-time upcoming projects like ResearchKit and CareKit. A memo obtained in 2014 by Apple Toolbox , via its own FOIA request, confirmed that hunch. But now we know that meeting -- and a few scattered meetings that preceded it -- were just the beginning of a long relationship. Almost all of the emails involve Bakul Patel, the FDA’s Associate Center Director for Digital Health. In an email sent shortly after the 2013 meeting, Patel reached out to Apple, asking for further discussion on “a) Expanding our initial discussion on - commercial platforms with sensors; and (b) an overview of the process Apple is currently using to review apps made by developers.” “With the goal to enhance our approach to promote innovative medical technologies and protect public health, I believe FDA can benefit tremendously from industry leaders like Apple,” Patel writes. Meetings about Apple’s review process and FDA’s regulatory guidelines At a January 29, 2014 meeting, Apple gave FDA an overview of how it reviews the third party apps it sells in its App Store. After the meeting, Apple emailed Patel a copy of their app store guidelines as requested. A follow-up meeting occurred on February 20, 2014 at FDA headquarters in Maryland, to discuss “an update on mobile medical apps” (per an email from Apple Director of Federal Government Affairs Tim Powderly to Patel). Notably, the emails show that Shuren was confirmed to attend the meeting, and that the meeting was scheduled specifically to accommodate his schedule. However, it doesn’t appear on his public calendar for that day. Also notably, the emails show a last minute room change before the meeting. Another meeting apparently attended by Dr. Shuren occurred on September 15, 2014, again in Maryland, again absent from his public calendar. “Yes - we are confirmed for Monday. It will just be Dr. Shuren and Bakul Patel from our end,” an executive assistant at the FDA wrote in an email about the meeting. It’s not clear from the emails what was discussed at this meeting, but they do contain a complete attendee list. From the FDA, Patel and Shuren were the only attendees. From Apple, the list included Powderly; Bud Tribble, a medical doctor and VP of Software Technology at Apple who was involved with Apple Health and ResearchKit; Afshad Mistri, a healthcare marketing manager for Apple whom Wired Magazine called “Apple’s secret weapon in a stealth campaign to get the iPad into the hands of doctors” in 2011; Vice President of Medical Technology Mike O’Reilly; and Amber Cottle, who at the time was VP of government affairs and public policy for the United States and the Americas at Apple. Marcy Wilder, a partner at Hogan Lovells who specializes in healthcare privacy and digital health, also attended. The outcome of all these meetings can only be guessed at: A major overhaul of Apple’s App Store guidelines, cracking down more on health apps that the FDA might find objectionable, didn’t take place until September 2016, nearly two years after the last known meeting focused specifically on that topic. “Adapting regulatory paradigms to enable the kind of solutions we all want to see” In October 2014, however, Patel reached out to Apple to get an Apple representative onto a working group under the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a group of regulators, scientists, legal experts, and physicians from the US, Canada, the European Union, Australia, China, Russia and Brazil that originally convened in 2013 to pursue harmonization of the regulatory approach to standalone medical software. Read more about that here. In general, discussions between Apple and the FDA held in 2016 focused on IMDRF and about working with the FDA on the regulation of new Apple products -- the Parkinson’s diagnosis app and the cardiac devices. This includes the one meeting we know of between Apple and current FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf (the 2013 meeting happened under Margaret Hamburg’s tenure). Discussion of this meeting starts in October 2015, with Patel emailing O’Reilly and Powderly. “We can have this visit in two phases,” he writes. “(1) We all meet with Dr. Califf, get our principles and intent grounded (2) follow up to work on strategizing/determining concrete next steps and how we best engage with each other.” The meeting — which doesn’t appear on the public calendars for either Califf or Shuren — took place February 22, 2016. An email from Powderly to Patel on that day reads \"took us to Rob's office.\" In a later email to Goldstein, O’Reilly described the proceedings. “Bakul, Jeff [Williams] and I met recently with Jeff Shuren and Rob Califf,” he wrote. “[T]hey are keen to work with us as they develop a new framework for regulating SaMD (software as a medical device).” During the preamble to the meeting, Powderly asked Patel about the “scope of disclosure” regarding Califf’s schedule, noting that “when we met Dr. Hamburg a few years ago it was just the attendees and general topics.\" It’s only after the February 2016 meeting that Williams and O’Reilly hand off some of the regulatory work to Robin Goldstein, an attorney at Apple whose current title is Special Projects -- Health. An email from Goldstein to Patel gives the most insight on the contents of these meetings. “As Mike [O’Reilly] mentioned, Jeff [Williams] has asked me to lead the thinking (or at least the conversation) on the intersection of the regulatory landscape (as it currently exists and where we hope we might be able to influence its movement) and our products and platforms,” she wrote in an email to Patel in March 2016. “I think we all see an opportunity for innovation, building new models of engagement, and adapting regulatory paradigms to enable the kind of solutions we all want to see. I know you have been leading the charge within FDA on this front and would love to get your thinking and begin what I hope is an extended conversation.” Later, in describing a June meeting, she writes to a colleague in an email CC’d to Patel “the purpose is to talk with Bakul about their (and our) thinking about the process and how it can be re-engineered going forward.\" “I have a question about FDA approval for apps that provide a diagnosis” In between the 2014 meetings and a series of meetings in 2015 dealing with Apple’s efforts around Parkinson’s disease, Powderly sent a handful of emails to Patel asking for his opinion on various things. In April 2015 he checked in about ResearchKit just prior to its launch. In May, he sought Patel’s opinion on the 21st Century Cures bill. But if Patel responded to these queries, he did so by phone or his responses weren't included in the emails the FDA provided MobiHealthNews. Then, in August 2015, Mike O’Reilly sent the following email to Patel: “I have a question about FDA approval for apps that provide a diagnosis. Do you have time for a brief call today or tomorrow?” That’s when the discussions begin of the Parkinson’s diagnostic app and the two cardiac devices. The Parkinson’s device is described multiple times as a diagnostic app and heavily implied to be separate from Apple’s current ResearchKit and CareKit Parkinson’s apps. It was a key topic at a large meeting in Cupertino with top neurologists, FDA officials, and Apple personnel in September 2015. You can read more about that effort here. The cardiac devices were to be the focus of a meeting between Apple and the FDA in July 2016, but that meeting was cancelled (after being renamed from “Intro - Cardiac devices” to “Mobile Medical Apps”). You can read more about the cardiac devices here. So far Apple has slowly but methodically moved into healthcare, first getting the iPhone and iPad into doctors’ hands, then introducing HealthKit and Apple Health, then leveraging those technologies in ResearchKit, and finally leveraging ResearchKit technology in CareKit. Apple's plans for two cardiac devices and a Parkinson’s diagnostic app are a glimpse at what's next for the company's steady move into the medical world. In an interview with Fast Company in August 2016 , around the time many of these emails were being sent, Apple CEO Tim Cook said as much. “We’ve gotten into the health arena and we started looking at wellness, that took us to pulling a string to thinking about research, pulling that string a little further took us to some patient-care stuff, and that pulled a string that’s taking us into some other stuff,\" he said at the time. \"When you look at most of the solutions, whether it’s devices, or things coming up out of Big Pharma, first and foremost, they are done to get the reimbursement [from an insurance provider]. Not thinking about what helps the patient. So if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small.” The difference now is these incremental moves deeper into healthcare will soon take Apple over the FDA’s regulatory line. The emails tell us that Apple won’t be crossing that line unprepared — that in fact, the company has been steadily laying the groundwork for three years. \nMore on this story:",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Share \nAs the world’s medical device regulators work to harmonize how best to regulate software as a medical device (SaMD), MobiHealthNews has learned via a Freedom of Information Act request that the FDA invited Apple to join an international task force focused on shaping this future regulatory framework. Apple executives quietly joined a working group within the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a group of regulators, scientists, legal experts and physicians from the US, Canada, the European Union, Australia, China, Russia, and Brazil to pursue harmonization of the regulatory approach to standalone medical software. \nThe agency shed light on its current position on establishing clinical guidelines pertaining to SaMD last month when it entered into the federal register draft guidance it devised with the IMDRF working group. While the proposed guidance is officially written by the IMDRF, it is considered to closely represent the FDA’s thinking on how it will regulate medical software in the future. \nThe proposed guidance seeks to articulate what's new and different about SaMD (a category that includes mobile medical apps) and provide a stratified guidance on how to regulate different kinds of software and what kind of evidence is needed for each regulatory category. The guidance stratifies devices on two axes: whether the device informs care, drives care, or treats/diagnoses and whether the condition in question is non-serious, serious, or critical. So software that treats or diagnoses a critical condition is in the highest risk category, while software that informs care about a non-serious condition is in the lowest. \nThe proposed guidelines also call out and address the fact that software development tends to move faster than traditional medical device development and can more easily be influenced by post-market data. \nWhile it was widely reported that the FDA met with Apple to discuss “Mobile Medical Apps” in 2013, emails obtained by MobiHealthNews via a Freedom of Information Act request show the agency was also eager to solicit Apple’s input on regulation of SaMD, and Apple was in turn eager to join. The company took part in the global working group, but the Apple representative asked to be left off of the group’s official list, a request the FDA obliged. \nAccording to the emails, the agency first approached Apple about joining the IMDRF working group in October 2014. Bakul Patel, the FDA’s associate director for digital health at the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, sent an email to Tim Powderly, Apple’s Director of Federal Government Affairs: \n“Can we talk briefly in the next day or so – I am looking to see if there is a senior person at Apple who would be interested in participating in an international effort that is driving towards clarifying how current good software development practices can be used and continue to comply with medical device quality management systems,” he wrote. \nThat email came shortly after the IMDRF published a consensus document entitled Software as a Medical Device: Possible Framework for Risk Categorization and Corresponding Considerations . Bradley Merrill Thompson, a partner at Epstein Becker Green who specializes in the FDA and digital health, wrote a post for MobiHealthNews in February 2015 in which he wrote, “The document is instructive for our purposes because FDA was heavily involved in drafting it. To be sure, it is also the product of compromise among international regulators. But I also can’t see FDA ignoring the document when the agency’s fingerprints are all over it.” We don’t know whether Powderly and Patel discussed the IMDRF working group following that email as our FOIA request yielded no additional 2014 or 2015 emails relevant to the IMDRF discussion. The IMDRF discussion picks up again in January of this year, and between February and August of 2016, Apple representatives had in-person and teleconference meetings with the FDA and other members of the IMDRF SaMD group. \nOn January 30, 2016, Patel thanked Mike O’Reilly, Apple’s VP of Medical Technology, for agreeing to join the working group and help on clinical evaluation for software that is a medical device. \n“I think that with all the work that Apple is doing – there will be a great advantage on having your perspective as we are building this,” Patel wrote. \nPatel then went on to describe the background of the SaMD working group of the IMDRF and gave an estimated publish date of early 2017 to look at a few key aspects: what clinical methods and processes SaMD manufacturers should have regardless of type; when and which clinical methods and processes are important and should be independently verified; and how much and what type of clinical evidence is adequate for that independent verification. \nA few days later on February 2, 2016, O’Reilly wrote back, “Will have an official response later today. Thanks. What an honor!” \nLater that day, O’Reilly wrote he “got the ok!” but was checking with Bud Tribble, Apple’s VP of Software, who is also an MD, to make sure there wasn’t someone better suited for the task. Patel wrote they needed someone who “can bring the clinical research/evaluation perspective,” and said he thought O’Reilly would be “perfect.” \nOn February 4, O’Reilly then requested to not be listed on the meeting schedule, writing, “It would greatly simplify my life to just not list me there. Really appreciate your flexibility there.” \nWithin 20 minutes, Patel wrote back, “Done. I will not include you.” \nOver the next few weeks, O’Reilly’s assistant accepted invitations to meet at the FDA headquarters on February 16th through 19th, and a couple of teleconferences in March. While O’Reilly is listed on a March 2 email with every other member of the SaMD working group, his name does not appear in the list on the group’s official page . \nOn March 9, 2016, O’Reilly looped in Robin Goldstein, an attorney with Apple whose roles have included “principal counsel” and “special projects -- health” according to her LinkedIn account. In his email O’Reilly introduced Goldstein to Patel and explained for Goldstein’s benefit that Jeff Shuren, the FDA’s Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and Rob Califf, who had just been confirmed as the new FDA Commissioner, were “keen to work with us as they develop a new framework for regulating SaMD (Software as a Medical Device).” \n“Bakul, we are very grateful for your collaboration as we work through the issues,” O’Reilly wrote in the email. \nFurther emails in March indicate the close ties the company was forming with the FDA as they worked together, with Goldstein writing to say how much she “enjoyed (seems like an unusual word) our discussion yesterday…” and also indicating an open availability to speak further “…in the interim, please feel free to reach out if there’s any way I can be of help (I answer my [texts] pretty much 24/7).” \nApple continued to attend meetings and have conversations with the FDA in March and April. In May, O’Reilly wrote to Patel about the company’s work on a Parkinson’s diagnostic app , before handing off the SaMD project to a new Apple hire: Stephen Friend, the co-founder and chairman of Sage Bionetworks. Sage worked with Apple on one of the first ResearchKit apps at launch that later became one of the first CareKit-enabled apps. In June, Sage announced that Friend would be stepping away from day-to-day responsibilities as he had taken a position at Apple to work on “health related projects.” \nFriend’s name also does not appear on the SaMD working group’s page, but is included on the March 2, 2016 email to the rest of the working group, along with O’Reilly’s. On June 21, 2016, Friend wrote to Patel: “I am so eager to join in on these projects!!” and was welcomed to the team in response. \nAs the National Law Review notes , the draft IMDRF guidelines document is important because it’s the first time the FDA has proposed issuing an IMDRF document as an official FDA guidance document. While the agency has worked to clarify its position on software products with other documents (like the 2015 Mobile Medical Applications guidelines) there is no clear overarching policy on when software used for any health or medical purpose would be considered a medical device and thus under the purview of the FDA. \n“In this context, issuing guidance on FDA’s expectations for the clinical evaluation of SaMD seems premature,” Michele L. Buenafe and M. Elizabeth Bierman wrote in the National Law Review article . “Software developers need to first understand where that proverbial line is before investing in clinical evaluation activities.” \nApple representatives continued to join in meetings on SaMD throughout the summer, with the latest known discussion taking place on August 2. It isn't clear from the emails what input, if any, Apple contributed toward the draft document. What we know is that Apple has been part of the discussions of the SaMD guidelines since January, that they joined the task force at the FDA’s invitation, and that, for whatever reason, they asked that their involvement -- in shaping a guidance that could have a major effect on how their products are regulated and sold -- not be disclosed. \nMore on this story:",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Share \nApple is working closely with the FDA to develop an FDA-regulated app for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease, MobiHealthNews has learned. The insight comes from a batch of emails MobiHealthNews obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request to the FDA . \nThe tech giant held a meeting about Parkinson's at its headquarters in Cupertino in September 2015 attended by a number of neurologists and Parkinson’s experts, as well as Bakul Patel, Associate Director of Digital Health at the FDA and another unnamed FDA representative. Divya Nag, a special projects lead at Apple , organized the meeting, telling Patel in an email that the plan was to “discuss early results from the ResearchKit PD app and ideate on steps moving forward for the app.” \n“We’re thinking of breaking the meeting up into two sections, one to discuss the telehealth/remote monitoring use case for Parkinson’s and the second to discuss the diagnostic app,” Nag wrote in an email to Patel on September 2, 2015. “On the telehealth side (where physicians get data updates from their patient between visits) we’d love for you to lead a discussion around whether you think there are any FDA considerations to understand before implementing. We don’t believe there will be, but always good to double check!” \nGiven the timing of the meeting, references to the telehealth application could refer to the launch, in March of this year , of the Parkinson’s CareKit app, which used learnings from the mPower ResearchKit app to help patients at The University of Rochester Medical Center, UCSF, Parkinson's Disease Care New York, Stanford Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and Emory Healthcare. But at the time the diagnostic app was (and remains) an unannounced work in progress. \n“For the diagnostic side (where an app would diagnose PD) we’d love for you to lead a discussion on what would be required for such an app to be FDA approved,” Nag continued in the email to Patel. “Metrics that need to be accomplished, data requirements, testing protocols, etc. We’d like to use that as a starting point to kickoff our discussions on what needs to be built for such an app and how the folks in the room can work together to make sure we set up the right trials.” \nJust a few weeks prior to the meeting invitation, Apple VP of Medical Technology Mike O’Reilly reached out to Patel with a question about “FDA approval for apps that provide a diagnosis”. In a follow-up to the phone conversation that followed, Patel wrote that “I talked to Jeff and he is fully on board with trying to figure this out.. but he also said that we should get a good understanding on what data the researcher has and we can get a sense of the test and applicability of the diagnosis.” \nThat “Jeff” likely refers to Jeffrey Shuren, Director of the Center for Radiological Devices at the FDA. \nFast Company reported earlier this month that three unidentified Apple sources told the publication that the company is working on using Apple devices to passively monitor Parkinson’s. But monitoring is a far cry from diagnosis, especially from a regulatory perspective. \nMaureen Phillips, global clinical trials manager at Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies, which makes wearable devices for Parkinson’s management, told MobiHealthNews that she doesn’t know of any companies using mobile devices for Parkinson’s diagnosis, though the Parkinson’s monitoring space is quickly growing. \n“I think it’s because there’s a lot of facets to Parkinson’s disease and Parkinson’s disease is truly a different disease for every patient that it affects,” she said. “So the diagnosis for one patient might be relevant to a motor symptom he or she is experiencing, whereas the diagnosis for another patient could be for a completely different reason. I think the diagnosis of Parkinson’s is relatively complex because it can come down to several factors where just wearable sensors would not be able to capture all of that information.” \nRoche Pharmaceuticals, which is working on its own app for Parkinson’s similar in many ways to the emPower ResearchKit app, didn’t rule out the possibility of diagnostic applications for similar apps. \n“The technology is currently being developed at Roche as a clinical research tool,” Dr. Ulrike Engels-Lange, the spokesperson for the project, told MobiHealthNews in an email. “In general, technology such as this could have multiple potential applications beyond this.” \nRight now, Apple’s Parkinson’s CareKit app monitors the patient’s movement with the gyroscope and accelerometer in the phone and can also measure manual dexterity with a tap test and fluctuations in the patient’s voice using the phone’s microphone. \nThe emails don’t give much information on the nuts and bolts of the diagnostic app, but an October email from O’Reilly to Patel suggests that Apple’s core motion team is involved either in the diagnostic app or a related technology. \n“We are moving full speed ahead,” O’Reilly wrote in an email following the Parkinson’s meeting. “We are working with our core motion team to develop the other [redacted] discussed at the meeting. We’ll get back to you the week after next with an anticipated timeline. We’ve got several projects that will be of interest and we are very grateful for your enthusiastic help! So stay tuned.” \nThe emails show that getting the Parkinson’s diagnostic app through FDA approval was handed off to Stephen Friend when Apple hired him at the end of June . Friend was the president and cofounder of Sage Bionetworks, which powered a number of ResearchKit apps including emPower, the Parkinson’s study. Robin Goldstein, an attorney at Apple whose roles have included “principal counsel” and “special projects -- health” according to her LinkedIn account, was assigned to help Friend out with legal and regulatory aspects. \nAn email from Goldstein, dated September 8, 2016, suggests that Apple how data collected by ResearchKit and CareKit apps might speed up the clearance process for regulated products based on them. In it, she asks Patel what the “bare minimum” for a quality system might look like, as well as “how ‘real world evidence’ would apply or impact the kinds of efforts we might get into (back load the process so we can get to market faster) etc.” \nThis aligns with comments Bud Tribble, Vice President of Software Technology at Apple, made to MobiHealthNews in an interview last fall. \n“One way to think about ResearchKit is as the beginning of a pipeline that will lead to more apps that are screening, diagnostic, management and treatment apps,” Tribble said at the time. \"In fact, it is a necessary, essential first step to figure out what is needed to develop these apps -- what works and what doesn’t -- before you move into, ultimately, clinical study apps and clearance to use them for diagnosis and treatment.” \nAsked about the hypothetical of Apple entering the market with an FDA-regulated device, Phillips from GLNT said she wouldn’t be shocked, because there is a growing awareness that Parkinson’s treatment and diagnosis is ripe for innovation. \n“We started in the wearables field eight years ago and we’ve had products in the market for that period of time,” she said. “It seems like the market is finally starting to grow a lot and people are starting to realize that wearables and [mobile health] apps really to have a place in clinical care. We’re going to continue to see more and more companies pop up with potential resources or apps that can be used in that application. So it’s just a part of this technology being on the market and people realizing the importance of it.” \nMore on this story:",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Share \nSince July 2016, Apple has been in discussions with the FDA about two FDA-regulated products in the cardiac monitoring space, MobiHealthNews has learned. The revelation comes from a collection of emails MobiHealthNews obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request to the FDA . On July 14, 2016, Robin Goldstein, at the time Principal Counsel for Apple, sent an email to FDA Associate Center Director for Digital Health Bakul Patel. According to her LinkedIn, Goldstein’s title changed shortly thereafter to “Special Projects -- Health.” “As we discussed, I think this will be an introductory meeting where we will want to talk about two possible (and related) products in the cardiac space, as well as the associated regulatory and quality systems and requirements,” Goldstein wrote. Patel invited three other FDA officials to the introductory meeting: William Maisel, deputy director of science and chief scientist; Linda J Ricci, branch chief for cardiac diagnostic devices at the FDA; and Carlos Peña, director of the division of neurological and physical medicine devices. Goldstein also wanted Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, to attend but Goldstein left him out of the email citing a “concern”, the exact nature of which was redacted by the FDA. Patel sent another invitation a few days later, changed the meeting title from “Apple introductory meeting - cardiac space” to “Mobile medical apps”. This time he included Shuren in the invitation, as well as Bram Zuckerman, director of the FDA’s Division of Cardiovascular Devices. The change seems to have been related to a need for discretion in light of Shuren’s calendar being public. “Hi Bakul. Got approval from Jeff Williams to have Jeff Shuren join us next week if we’re able to title the meeting Mobile Medical Applications (which I think you said would be okay),” Goldstein wrote to Patel. “Just wanted to confirm.” Patel replied: “So the meeting I sent yesterday has the title Mobile medical app discussion -- that should work.” Although the attendee roster of that proposed meeting is interesting, in fact it never seems to have taken place. Even after the reschedule, Goldstein sent Patel another email saying, “we agree it makes sense to cancel the planned Monday meeting and reschedule a smaller meeting to discuss how Apple may engage with the FDA in a way that’s ‘non-regulatory’ so we can learn about your processes and thinking, and vice versa.” The emails don’t contain many details about the two devices Goldstein alluded to, but a wearable ECG device of some kind is one possibility. The form factor could be a combination of the Apple Watch and a modular strap for the Watch. Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted that a regulated medical device from Apple would be something along those lines in an interview with the Telegraph last fall. “We don’t want to put the Watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process,” he said at the time. “I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it -- maybe an app, maybe something else.” According to the Telegraph, Cook was bullish on health prospects for the Apple Watch after hearing the story of a teenager whose life was saved by his Apple Watch data. We also know that Apple is thinking about ECG technology at least on some level. In August, Patently Apple spotted an Apple patent for a wearable ECG device . The device could read ECG from the wrist and fingertip once the user calibrated it by taking readings on various parts of their body. Obviously many Apple patents never see the light of day, but it does suggest some level of investment in the space. It’s worth noting also that at least one startup believes the Apple Watch’s off-the-shelf hardware is already capable of delivering actionable clinical information, and has put that theory to the test in partnership. Cardiogram has been working with UCSF since March to collect user data in a study called mRhythm and use it to develop an app for detecting atrial fibrillation based on on Apple Watch data. \"If you own an Apple Watch, its native software already measures your heart rate once every five minutes, or continuously if you're working out,\" Cardiogram CEO Brandon Ballinger said in a recent statement. \"That data does get stored in your Health app, but it's just raw data, and not easily understandable. What Cardiogram does is organize this info in graphs both real-time short-term graphs, like your heart rate over the course of a stressful meeting, and long-term trend graphs, like resting heart rate over time. Plus, we give you full access to the underlying metrics.\" Of course, there are a few iPhone connected third party ECG devices already in existence, the best known is made by AliveCor (which is also working on Kardia Band , an ECG built into a strap for the Apple Watch). Asked about a hypothetical device from Apple, AliveCor inventor Dr. Dave Albert told MobiHealthNews he was skeptical, but that it would actually be great for the incumbent players. “Nothing would be better for AliveCor than Apple introducing an ECG device but I am very skeptical,” he told MobiHealthNews in an email. “The market is small in Apple terms. Most iPhone customers don't need an ECG. However, were they to introduce something, I suspect AliveCor would be acquired in a nanosecond. Alphabet, Microsoft, Fitbit, Medtronic, GE, Philips, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, etc. would need a solution fast and getting into the highly regulated medical field would not be fast for any of the nonmedical companies and the medical companies take years to develop products.” On the other hand, Vital Connect CEO Nersi Nazari has a different opinion. His company makes a smartphone-connected, peel-and-stick sensor for home and hospital monitoring that can read ECG as well as other vital signs. In an interview with MobiHealthNews, he noted that if Apple were to get into patient monitoring on the medical side, it wouldn’t just be competing with small startups but with large players like Philips and GE. “If any major company gets into it, it probably would have some effect,” he said. “But as you know there are already major medical companies that are in the market such as GE [and] Philips. There’s no shortage of large companies with very good technology in the medical side. It’s not like Apple is getting into a small market that didn’t have big players to begin with.” \nMore on this story:",

Add that to an array of other smart and efficient features, and you have an incredible amount of power in your hands. While carrying next to nothing.\nThis ultra-efficient architecture was designed to use less power and still deliver high performance. Which means not only can you do whatever you want — you can keep doing it for longer than before. In addition, the Intel HD Graphics 6000 processor offers advanced performance you’ll especially notice with games and other graphics-intensive tasks. With a Thunderbolt 2 port that’s twice as fast as the previous generation, you can connect your MacBook Air to the latest devices and displays, like the Apple Thunderbolt Display. But that’s not the whole story. MacBook Air also comes equipped with two USB 3 ports, so you can connect the latest USB 3 devices and all your USB 2 devices as well. With just a few connections, MacBook Air transforms from an ultraportable notebook to a complete workstation. Dual mics. They’ll hear you loud and clear. The dual microphones in MacBook Air are great for when you want to be heard. If you’re making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use Dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice — instead of the noise around you.

      "text": "You may not want to pay much attention to insiders and tipsters claiming they know all about Apple’s big 2017 iPhone upgrade already, as extremely credible sources today tell us there are over 10 prototypes being considered for the two or three models that will ultimately make their commercial debut next fall.\nKeep that in mind for when early designs, blueprints, dummy units, accessories and so on eventually start “leaking” out, and take everything you hear over the coming months with more than the proverbial pinch of salt.\nOdds are Cupertino is indeed testing the all-glass waters , as well as curved OLED screen technology , including with minimal bezels , not to mention various new dual camera tricks , 3D functionality of sorts , wireless charging , and perhaps even mulling over a headphone jack comeback.\nUnfortunately, no one can predict which of the oft-rumored changes and advancements will make it to stores next year. Tim Cook himself probably doesn’t know a lot for sure just yet. There’s a strong possibility at least one iPhone 8 configuration switches from LCD to OLED, but Apple might need to rely entirely on Samsung for panel supply .\nLG , JDI and Sharp will likely be ready to join the party in 2018, at the earliest, making yields and a backup plan for the prospective curved OLED iPhone 8 very tricky business. So, yeah, even this trend-following transition is far from etched in stone for 2017.\nThe post ‘More than 10’ iPhone 8 prototypes are reportedly in consideration, including curved OLED model appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Apple to add some 2009 & 2011 Macs to vintage and obsolete list on Dec. 31 By Monday, November 28, 2016, 01:57 pm PT (04:57 pm ET) Starting Dec. 31 of this year, several 2009 and 2011 Mac models will reportedly join Apple's list of \"vintage\" and \"obsolete\" products, making them ineligible for most or typically any official repairs. The \"obsolete\" additions include 2009's Mac mini and 13-inch MacBook models, while the \"vintage\" items are the early 2011 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros, 9to5Mac noted . In general, both categories are cut off from first-party support, but the vintage devices have some limited options in California and Turkey. Vintage products are identified as having been discontinued between 5 and 7 years ago, while obsolete ones have been out of manufacturing for over 7. In mid-October Apple added a variety of products to its list, most notably 2010's iPhone 4 —a huge hit that stayed in use for many years. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple's LG UltraFine 5K Display Now Available for Purchase for $974 Monday November 28, 2016 2:19 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple today started accepting orders for the LG UltraFine 5K Display , making it available for the temporary sale price of $974 in the United States. Orders will ship out to customers in six to eight weeks, and there is no in-store availability at this time. The LG UltraFine 5K Display was first introduced at Apple's October 27 Mac event alongside a matching 4K Display, but until today, the 5K Display has been available for purchase, with Apple listing a vague availability date of \"December.\" At the beginning of November, Apple dropped the prices on all USB-C adapters and accessories, including the LG UltraFine displays , by 25 percent through the end of the year. Because the 5K UltraFine Display was not yet available for purchase, some worried that it would not be able to be bought for the sale price, but customers who make a purchase before the end of 2016 will be able to get the display for $974 instead of $1,299. The LG 5K UltraFine Displays was created in partnership with Apple for the new MacBook Pro . The display connects to the MacBook Pro over Thunderbolt 3 and include features like built-in USB-C ports for charging, stereo speakers, P3 wide color gamut support, a camera, and a microphone.",

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nThe new Touch Bar MacBook Pro doesn’t include an Ethernet port—just like Apple’s other laptops—and despite the company’s long list of adapters, it doesn’t make a USB-C to Ethernet dongle. Apple offers Belkin’s USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet adapter but it’s back ordered 7 to 10 weeks , which isn’t much help if you need one now. Anker, however, is selling one on Amazon that’s shipping now, and it’s less expensive than Belkin’s at US$22.99 instead of $26. Anker has a solid reputation, which is why I already ordered mine. Bonus: Amazon Prime members get two-day free shipping.",

Apple suppliers have been asked to create thinner screens with better resolution to one-up Samsung's Galaxy Edge, the Journal reported. \nIn addition to competing with Apple's smartphones, Samsung is one of the only companies in the world that can make large enough quantities of flexible screens for Apple. Experts had previously told CNBC that it was unlikely any other supplier could match Samsung's expertise at a large scale within the next year. \nBut Apple might have to cooperate with the enemy, as flexible screens pave the way for innovations like foldable smartphones. A new form factor like a foldable phone could silence critics who have decried Apple's recent lack of innovation .

      "text": "Tipp: Mehrere Kurse mit einem Komma (,) voneinander trennen. Weitere Informationen... \nMo., 28. Nov 2016, 23:29 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte geschlossen Like the next iPhone, Apple's next iPad is apparently getting a total redesign Von Antonio Villas-Boas | Business Insider – vor 5 Stunden -0,22 \n(Apple) A new report from the Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara adds two new claims about Apple's next iPad, which is said to be getting a total redesign in 2017. \nOne of those suggests the next iPad won't have a home button, which lines up nicely with rumors that the next iPhone won't have a home button either. \nIt's unclear how Apple would implement the home button's features, like Touch ID or returning to the home screen from within apps, without a button. It's pure speculation at this point, but Apple could place the home button on the back of the next iPhone, like we've seen on several recent Android devices, or simply embed it (or hide it) in the display. \nPrevious rumors also claim the next iPad will have a borderless design , in which the front surface would consist mostly of the display. Yet MacOtakara's report claims it'll have at least one relatively large bezel at the top of the device where the camera is usually found, suggesting it won't be fully borderless. \nIf accurate, the latest claims help paint a picture of the next iPad and iPhone that's awfully similar to the new Mi Mix smartphone from China-based Xiaomi. \n(MKBHD/YouTube) \nThe Mi Mix has a near-borderless design — there's a single border at the bottom of the phone where the front-facing camera is found. Its home button is on the back of the phone, making for a perfectly flat, smooth front surface. \nEither way, nothing is certain until Apple reveals it on stage. Barclays analysts say we can expect the next iPad in March . As for the iPhone, we expect Apple will do what it's done in past years and reveal it in September.",

      "text": "New aerial video captured by a drone reveals a giant spaceship nearing completion at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.\nUnlike the space ambitions of other private companies , Apple's design won't actually fly. Instead, it's a massive office complex dreamed up by the company's former CEO Steve Jobs, and it has been under construction since 2013.\nThe new drone footage, uploaded to YouTube by Sexton Photography on Nov. 25, reveals details of the nearly finished buildings, including several open atriums as well as an underground garage and auditorium. As you'd expect for a Silicon Valley headquarters, there's also a massive employee fitness center separate from the main building.\n\nThe shape and exterior finishes of the main building — a perfect circle — are reminiscent of both the Death Star from Star Wars and the Pentagon. Apple has previously shared details of its spaceship campus, which will accommodate up to 14,000 employees. So other than offering a clear view of the nearly finished construction, the Sexton footage doesn't reveal any big surprises.",

      "text": "Apple developers get to have another field day post- Thanksgiving weekend .\n\nOn Monday, Apple released new developer betas for most of its software platforms. Developers registered with the Apple Developer Program got to install the fourth developer beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and macOS Sierra 10.12.2. Registered developers can install these releases over-the-air now, and they will be made available as public betas to the people in the Apple Beta Software Program soon. You can enroll in the Apple Developer Program here.\n\nIn addition to addressing performance issues and issuing bug fixes, the cornerstone of these developer betas seem to be the integration of a bunch of new emoji in conjunction with the Unicode 9.0 update. These new emoji—which are being released with iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, and watchOS 3.1.1—include a selfie emoji, a clown-face emoji, and emoji depicting new male and female professions. In watchOS 3.1.1 developer beta, you can also now change the emoji skin tone.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Apple today started accepting orders for the LG UltraFine 5K Display, making it available for the temporary sale price of $974 in the United States. Orders will ship out to customers in six to eight weeks, and there is no in-store availability at this time.\n\nThe LG UltraFine 5K Display was first introduced at Apple's October 27 Mac event alongside a matching 4K Display, but until today, the 5K Display has been available for purchase, with Apple listing a vague availability date of \"December.\"\nAt the beginning of November, Apple dropped the prices on all USB-C adapters and accessories, including the LG UltraFine displays, by 25 percent through the end of the year.\n\nBecause the 5K UltraFine Display was not yet available for purchase, some worried that it would not be able to be bought for the sale price, but customers who make a purchase before the end of 2016 will be able to get the display for $974 instead of $1,299.\n\nThe LG 5K UltraFine Displays was created in partnership with Apple for the new MacBook Pro. The display connects to the MacBook Pro over Thunderbolt 3 and include features like built-in USB-C ports for charging, stereo speakers, P3 wide color gamut support, a camera, and a microphone.\n\nAt the current time, the LG 5K UltraFine Display is only available for purchase in the United States and Canada. It remains unavailable for purchase in other countries, with a \"December\" availability date listed.\n\n(Thanks, Steven!)\nRelated Roundup: Displays\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "title": "LG UltraFine 5K Display now available to order from Apple’s website for $974",
      "text": "Reddit \nAfter announcing that it was discontinuing its first-party display over the summer , Apple revealed at its Mac-centric event last month that it had partnered with LG for a pair of standalone displays. Now, Apple has made the LG UltraFine 5K Display available for purchase via its website. \nIf you head to Apple’s Online Store, you’ll be able to purchase the 27-inch LG UltraFine 5K Display for $974. That price may sound a bit out of left field, and that’s because the LG display was one of the USB-C products that Apple discounted earlier this month following the release of the new MacBook Pros that feature exclusively USB-C ports. Prior to being available to order, Apple and LG’s UltraFine 5K Display was listed as unavailable. \nThe LG UltraFine 5K Display is made specifically for Apple’s new MacBook Pros and features a 5120 x 2880 resolution with a P3 wide color gamut. Included with the purchase is a Thunderbolt 3 cable, which can both transmit data and power/charge the new MacBook Pros. You’ll also find three USB- C ports for additional connectivity, as well. \nAt this point, the UltraFine 5K Display is available online only with no in-store availability. Currently, Apple says that orders will ship in 6-8 weeks, for a delivery window of January 12th through January 26th. \nIt’s worth noting, however, that the discount will disappear come January. Without the discount, the display will go for $1,299, so despite the long shipping times, it’s likely better to get your order in now as opposed to waiting for in-store availability or for shipping times to go down. \nIf you’re looking to spend a little less, Apple and LG also worked together on a 21.5-inch 4K UltraFine display that’s available for $524 and shipping in 5-6 weeks. Once the USB-C discount goes away, this display will go for $699. \nLast week, one of the first hands-on unboxing videos of the new LG UltraFine 5K Display hit the web and as more reviewers and customers get their hands on the display we should expect impressions to continue to roll in. \nDo you plan on purchasing one of the new LG UltraFine displays? Let us know down in the comments. Guides",

      "text": "Samsung Galaxy S7 \nMobile payments have come a long way since Apple made a huge push into the space with Apple Pay in 2014. Google introduced Android Pay last year, and Samsung has joined the fray with its own mobile payment system called Samsung Pay. Here’s what you need to know about Samsung Pay. Which devices support Samsung Pay? \nSamsung Pay is limited to the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 5, and Gear S2. It also now works with Samsung’s new smartwatch, the Gear S3 — and you don’t need to connect a Samsung phone for it to work. \nMore: Samsung to debut 4-terabyte 850 Pro solid state drive at CES 2017 \nGear S3 owners with an Android phone can use Samsung Pay \nA recent update to the Gear manager app allows for Gear S3 users to use Samsung Pay, even if they don’t own a Samsung smartphone. Most Android devices running 4.4 KitKat and above should work, but Samsung says there are a few exceptions at the moment — notably, the Google Pixel . \nTo get started on paying with your Gear S3, you’ll need to add your cards via the Gear manager app. You can launch Samsung Pay by holding down on the back button. @cyberslash69 Hi there, #SamsungPay on the Gear S3 is not available with Pixel devices. (1/2) \n&mdash; Samsung Pay (@SamsungPay) November 25, 2016 \nWhat’s unique about the update is that unlike the Gear S2, the Gear S3 supports MST, not just NFC. That means it will work at most payment terminals — just hold your watch near the checkout terminal when you’re ready to pay. \nSupport for the Gear S2 \nSamsung announced late last year that the company’s flagship smartwatch, the Gear S2, would gain support for contactless payments. After a lengthy delay, it finally arrived in the beta program for the S2 during the summer for the Bluetooth-only model. In October, users with the cellular model of the Gear S2 reported that they are able to use Samsung Pay as well.",

The main point of the 10.1.1 update was to fix some of the camera issues that users were experiencing with the new iPhone 7 Plus dual camera. \nThe iPhone users who installed 10.1.1 update are reporting that the battery life of their devices lasts much shorter and even that their phones are shutting down with at least 30-50% charge left. Anyone else notice their iPhone 6 battery only lasts like 20 minutes with the latest iOS update? — Tom Fulp (@TomFulp) November 26, 2016 \nSome users have tried going back to 10.1 version, but according to the reports, that doesn't fix the problem. Thanks to this iOS update, I can now watch my battery literally drain as I read a text",

We are planning on upgrading and are debating between the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the iPhone 7 Plus. However, after doing a bunch of research online I'm still unsure of which one to buy. Here is how it breaks down for us: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Water resistant to 5 meters Slightly better camera Not as fast as iPhone More reliable upgrades Only comes in 32 GB iPhone 7 Plus Seems to be more durable Telephoto lens Most other family members already have iPhone Can buy 128 GB No headphone jack Not as easy to customize Basically, my main concerns with the Galaxy S7 Edge is durability (I've dropped my Spigen cased S5 a number of times and it was never a problem) and lack of storage (our 16 GB are almost full and we can't download any new apps. Some apps can't be downloaded to external card). My main concerns with iPhone are no headphone jack (the adapter seems like a pain and easily lost) and battery life (not sure how it would compare to our S5s). Signal strength/reception are also very important but I don't see much info on this. We have Verizon if that matters. Any advice/opinions? Feedback Score 0 Trust me as a person who has started out with iPhone and then had some Samsung's and other Androids and then try going back to iPhone twice trust me you will not be as happy with an Apple product and one in my opinion it's just so much more awesome. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are amazing devices and now is the time to purchase with Cyber Monday probably good deals. I don't know if you guys want to consider switching carriers or not but I know Sprint for example have the buy one get one free on these phones. I used to have Verizon and don't really miss them way too expensive two lines $100 now get me unlimited everything. Not trying to sell you just wanted you to know I'm sure her eyes and has good for motions as well but definitely get the Android device. Also by the way I do not recommend the LG G4 it's had lots of problems definitely stay with the Samsung or if you don't want Samsung also look at the Motorola Z that is also a brilliant device.",

I've got more phones than fingers Join Date Feedback Score 0 They are both really good and top of the line. I prefer the S7 Edge over the 7+ due the size of the bezels on the 7+, but I generally prefer iOS over Android. Quality wise, they are both excellent phones. As far as I know the 7+ has the better battery life, but if you are finding that to not be the case you might want to go with the S7 Edge. Everything else is a matter of personal preference. Feedback Score 0 Thanks 2400zr. How concerned should I be about cracking the glass on the S7 Edge? I would definitely be putting it in a good case similar to the Spigen but I've read horror stories about drops and glass shattering. Why yes, that is a bag phone Join Date Feedback Score 0 I have a clear plastic screen protector on my S7 Edge with a Spigen case and have dropped my phone several times on a combination of concrete, tile & wood and have had no hiccups yet. The screen is quite durable & the battery life is much better than my S6 Edge+ and the RF performance is very good. The iPhone 7+ RF is good, as well. I put in an SD card so the storage issue was resolved quickly. Either way, you'll be satisfied with your choice! Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-G935A using Tapatalk Feedback Score 0 Thanks Malibu. I have a 32GB in my S5. However, it seems that more and more apps won't allow you to download them to the SD card. So I'm usually around 14 GB full on my 16 GB internal storage on my S5. This makes adding any new apps pretty difficult and definitely slows down the phone. I know the S7 Edge has 32 GB but I'm still a little worried I might run into the same issue.

I would definitely be putting it in a good case similar to the Spigen but I've read horror stories about drops and glass shattering. Only thing I can tell you is don't break the glass. I think the phone needs to be replaced when the glass cracks. We had a forum poster that cracked his, but that was several months ago, so I am not sure if he was able to get it repaired or if he needed to buy a new one. Samsung offers something similar to AppleCare+ though. Similar pricing as well. Originally Posted by pmsmith2032 Thanks Malibu. I have a 32GB in my S5.

This makes adding any new apps pretty difficult and definitely slows down the phone. I know the S7 Edge has 32 GB but I'm still a little worried I might run into the same issue. I had those same concerns originally, but I think Samsung engineered something that was supposed to allow you to install to the SD card. Don't quote me on that, but I was definitely concerned about the storage space. The VZW demo model only had around 20GB of available storage.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple iPhone Is 2016’s Most Coveted Holiday Buy \nApple’s aapl latest iPhone didn’t exactly “wow” the technorati with its upgraded camera, boosted processor, jettisoned headphone jack, but that hasn’t quelled the mass market’s desire for the phone. \nAs the holiday season approaches, the iPhone has topped consumer wish lists, according to a recent survey by investment bank Piper Jaffray pjc . More people are yearning for the device than they are any other hot ticket item, the findings showed. \n“Our retail team has done a survey of a thousand people in the U.S. last month and the percentage of people that wanted an iPhone—that was the number one requested gift,” said Gene Munster, a prominent tech analyst at Piper Jaffray, during an appearance on CNBC’s morning news show “Squawk Box.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nMunster surfaced for an interview as the online retail bonanza known as Cyber Monday got underway. The survey, which he referenced, found that 7.2% of respondents reported the iPhone as their most wanted item compared to 5.2% last year, as CNBC noted . \nThe next closest competitor in this year’s survey remained within the Apple family: the MacBook. 2.1% of respondents said they sought Apple’s recently refreshed laptop line . \nFollowing the Apple goods were Microsoft’s msft Xbox (1.4%), smartwatches (0.9%), and Sony sne PlayStation (0.8%). \nA list of results from the past few years of Piper Jaffray’s survey can be found below. \n“Even though there’s a story about ‘Is the iPhone 7 incrementally enough’ [for consumers to clamor for it]”, Munster said, “I think the reality is consumers want it.” \nFor more roundups of Cyber Monday deals, see Fortune’s lists of Apple , Amazon amzn , and other tech deals.",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nSYDNEY Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it was planning to deny some banks authorisation to collectively bargain with Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) in relation to its mobile digital payment system. \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's \"Apple Pay\" system, would reduce each individual bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. technology giant. \n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. \n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin) Next In Technology News U.S. letter reveals details of GM self-driving vehicle system \nWASHINGTON General Motors Co's semi-autonomous \"Super Cruise\" system will allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel for extended periods, but will stop the vehicle automatically if drivers are not attentive, according to a government letter made public on Monday.",

The Apple Watch is an impressive display of advanced technology, with everything from connectivity and synchronization options, all the way up to pressure sensitivity sensors that literally revolutionize the way you use such an electronic device. Interacting with the Apple Watch is made possible by the Apple Watch OS, a very advanced OS with a compact yet highly functional interface, different to almost everything you are used to within Apple’s current product lineup. Apple’s most compact OS, designed to bring the power of iPhone apps onto your wrist As it stands, the Apple watchOS will basically extend and replicate most of the functions from your iPhone. Yes, it offers basic time keeping features and yes it can make you keep your iPhone tucked away for some extend by enabling you to make calls, send texts, read and answer emails, view your latest tweets, and more. But, the Apple watchOS coupled with the advanced hardware technology within the device can also make it possible for you to pay while shopping by simply waving the watch over the payment terminal and to see how heathy your lifestyle is by keeping track of your steps and calories, or every cardio-related activity. The Apple watchOS also makes it possible for you to view how the weather is, what are your next appointments, as well as to send drawings and heart-beats to other Apple Watch users. User-friendly and straightforward installation process that requires an iPhone, a charging cable, and a Wi-Fi connection As with all Apple’s OSs, updates are expected and will make the overall experience even better, we are sure about that. Unlike Apple’s other iOS based devices which can update themselves with the Software Update feature, the Apple Watch is dependent on your iPhone to actually upgrade its firmware. Your Apple Watch will update its OS with the help of iPhone’s Apple Watch app. Go to My Watch, tap General and then the Software Update entry where you will be greeted by a large Apple Watch icon with a big sprocket inside, plus the size and version of the update. This said, you should also know that in order to complete the installation, you must first download the update package onto your iPhone, you will then need to connect both devices to your local Wi-Fi network, connect the watch to its charge and make sure that its battery level is over 50%. A solid platform on which Apple can now build and innovate even further As an ending note, the Apple watchOS is a real statement for Apple’s prowess and innovation capability when combining hardware and software towards making our lives better. Beginnings will always be exciting, but, we must admit, we are looking forward to seeing how new native and third-party apps will extend Apple watchOS’s capabilities even more, therefore, making it better. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS iPhone to download the update from Apple's servers Wi-Fi internet connection Apple Watch charging cable and at least 50% battery level on your Apple Watch New in watchOS 3.1 Build 14S471: Improvements and bug fixes: New option to replay bubble and full screen effects in Messages Messages effects can play with Reduce Motion enabled Fixes an issue that could cause the notification for Timer complete to be delivered twice",

      "text": "iPhone 7 uses an LCD display. Image source: Apple.\nThe increasing likelihood that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) will finally switch to OLED displays in the 2017 iPhone have helped boost Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED) shares higher in recent weeks, following a series of reports to that effect . The small-cap stock is accustomed to volatility, and it doesn't help that the Apple rumor mill often changes its mind.\nThe latest report comes from The Wall Street Journal , which says that Apple is already asking OLED suppliers to increase their output and deliver prototype displays for evaluation. Naturally, Apple wants the iPhone display to outperform Samsung , which is a tall order to fill given Samsung's expansive experience with OLED technology. OLED displays are costlier to manufacture, so if Apple does follow through with an OLED transition, you can expect it to charge more for an OLED iPhone.\nHere's the kicker for Universal Display investors who have started to price in an OLED switch: Apple is prototyping over 10 different iPhone models, and only one includes an OLED display.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick Playing the odds Lacking any other company-specific news today, this report is almost certainly why Universal Display shares fell 3% today. The OLED iPhone storyline has persisted for many years, and created plenty of volatility in its own right due to the huge financial implications such a device would have on Universal Display's business.\n ",

      "text": "0 A woman touches an iPhone 6 Plus as it sits next to an iPhone 6 after they went on sale at the Apple store in Sydney September 19, 2014. Reuters/David Gray \nApple iPhone users are outraged by the battery-draining phenomenon that has plagued the tech giant’s flagship smartphones after they have been updated to the latest iOS 10.1.1. Many users have voiced their frustrations online and a number of them have already reported their battery problems to Apple. The Cupertino-based company’s new predicament comes just over a week after it announced a battery replacement program for problematic iPhone 6 and 6s units. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 6s battery issues: How Australians can have their units replaced \nA number of iPhone users have claimed on Apple’s support firm that the latest iOS 10.1.1 update has messed up their batteries’ charging and usability. The update supposedly drains iPhone batteries and completely shuts the handsets down once they hit a battery level of 30 percent. Also, the battery life indicator jumps up to 30 percent once the phone is connected to a charger and reboots. \n“When I unplug it right away, it still shows 30 percent and runs like nothing happened for a good few hours,” wrote one user per The Sun . “So it goes from zero charge to 30 percent in the time it takes to reboot? Strange.” \nThe user further added that he experienced problems starting up his handset the following morning. \n“Shutting the phone down at night with a good 80 percent charge, it won't reboot in the morning due to no battery charge. I plug it in and its back to 30 percent in a few seconds.” \nThere’s no official count yet on how many users are currently going through the same battery issues. Apple has yet to comment on the situation as well. In the meantime, irritated Apple fans have hopped onto Twitter to vent out their frustrations. One user from Melbourne complained that the latest iOS 10.1 update has caused her iPhone to overheat and drain its battery in less than an hour. \n\n&mdash; Cookie (@butfirsttea) November 21, 2016 \nI made the mistake of updating my iPhone to the new @Apple iOS. It&#39;s made my phone obnoxiously slow and is killing my battery. @AppleSupport \n&mdash; John R. Knicely (@KnicelyKIRO7) November 24, 2016 \nWhen you update to iOS 10.1.1 and your phone gets really hot and your batter keeps draining in less than 1 hour... #iphone #apple #battery \n&mdash; Tanya Magit (@tanya_magit) November 23, 2016 \nThanks to this iOS update, I can now watch my battery literally drain as I read a text \n&mdash; varun (@VarunBottle) November 25, 2016 \n\n&mdash; Nate Anderson (@Clarityspring) November 26, 2016 \nAnyone else notice their iPhone 6 battery only lasts like 20 minutes with the latest iOS update? \n&mdash; Tom Fulp (@TomFulp) November 26, 2016",

      "text": "LG UltraFine 5K Display now for sale through Apple, first orders ship in January By Monday, November 28, 2016, 02:32 pm PT (05:32 pm ET) One month after it debuted onstage at Apple's MacBook Pro event, LG's UltraFine 5K Display went up for sale on Monday exclusively through Apple's online storefront for $974. As of this writing, orders placed through Apple's website will ship within 6 to 8 weeks, meaning the first units are unlikely to arrive in 2016. Apple previously said the LG UltraFine 5K Display would be available to purchase in December. Measuring 27 inches on the diagonal, the 5K UltraFine Display was developed in partnership with Apple and supports resolutions up to 5,120-by-2,880 with DCI-P3 color, matching the latest MacBook Pro hardware unveiled in October . With built-in speakers, three USB 3.1 ports and 85 watts of charging power, the display acts as a hub for Apple's I/O constrained notebooks and serves as a suitable replacement for the erstwhile Thunderbolt Display. While the display does not ship until January, customers thinking about buying a unit should do so before the end of the year. Earlier this month, Apple slashed 25 percent off retail pricing for both the 5K model and its smaller 21.5-inch 4K sibling. Available until Dec. 30, the limited time offer drops the 5K model down to $974 from $1,299.95, while the 4K version moves to $524 from $699.95. LG's UltraFine 4K Display went up for sale alongside Apple's new MacBook Pro notebooks in October. Early preorder customers began receiving shipments some two weeks ago . Topics:",

      "text": "Apple is reportedly testing more than 10 different iPhone prototypes OLED display, all-glass enclosure, wireless charging and more on Nov 28, 2016, 2:41 PM TechSpot \nApple is reportedly testing nearly a dozen prototype iPhones as it continues to narrow down the field of potential devices ahead of next year’s pivotal launch. \nSources reportedly familiar with the matter tell The Wall Street Journal that Apple is testing more than 10 different iPhone variations. At least one of the devices features an OLED display although it may not make the cut. \nIn addition to being thinner and lighter than traditional LCD technology, OLED screens don’t require a backlight component. They also allow for flexible designs like the rolled edges on Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge. One shortcoming of OLED technology at this point in time is the fact that they are much more expensive to produce compared to LCDs. \nPeople familiar with Apple’s plans believe the company will likely rely on Samsung as their primary supplier of OLED components but want LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp to boost their OLED production to have displays ready for 2018. \nWith iPhone sales cooling and innovation across the smartphone industry reduced to a crawl, there’s a lot of pressure on Apple to deliver a device worthy of being the 10 th anniversary iPhone. Early rumors suggest that in addition to an edge-to-edge, high-resolution OLED display with Touch ID built into the screen, the next-gen iPhone will feature a glass enclosure and wireless charging, among other changes.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe app stores provided by Microsoft, Google, and Apple are meant to be safe havens for consumers seeking out software for their devices. All three companies have safeguards in place to keep the malicious junk off their online markets, but the systems aren’t 100 percent foolproof, and sneaky developers find a way to slip inside and cause a little ruckus. Even more, apps may not be malicious in nature, but listed in such a way as to scam unsuspecting customers out of their hard-earned cash. \nApple’s “walled” storefronts for iOS and MacOS are seemingly impervious to malicious hackers, but How-To Geek took a look at what scammers are doing on the latter Mac App Store platform. The site discovered that scammers are not only making money from misleading listings, but Apple is getting its portion, too. Microsoft Excel is a perfect example, as there are a number of listed products that are seemingly the real deal, but instead are add-ons that require Microsoft Excel already installed. \nMore: Apple is looking at many options for the upcoming iPhone 8 \nAs an example, one listing the report highlights is the Office Bundle for $30, which pulls up when searching for “Microsoft Excel” and described as “the easiest way to create high-quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.” Following that description is a bullet list of general Microsoft Office features and a small message at the bottom stating that iOffice has nothing to do with Microsoft. The software is actually a template bundle, but its listing says nothing of the sort. \nAdding to the problem is that Microsoft Office Suite isn’t offered on the Mac App Store, and many consumers are likely not aware of this. Armed with this knowledge, scammers are throwing up similar template bundles disguised as Microsoft applications. There are even listed apps that charge $20 or more for providing Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser, and paid Office editors with “Microsoft” in their names based on open-source software. \nThe problem doesn’t reside with just Office-related clones. This method is used across a wide variety of well-known brands. Perform a search for Adobe’s popular InDesign publishing software and Mac users won’t find the actual tool, but bundles of tutorial videos with icons that closely resemble the official InDesign logo. Search for “Firefox” or “Chrome” and users will find suspicious software called “Fast Browser” for $1. The How-To Geek report even points to an uncanny amount of listed disk cleaners and memory cleaners Mac users simply don’t need. \nOverall, the point of the report is that scammers are mimicking official branding and literature to lure in unknowing customers to make some cash. Many are not listing the true nature of their apps, and are locking down search terms and figuring out a way to come out on top in search results to get the unsuspecting end-user’s attention first. Thus, based on the report, the Mac App Store should be Apple’s next project once it has completed the huge task of purging the outdated and broken apps from its App Store for iOS devices. Also watch: Apple is looking at many options for the upcoming iPhone 8",

      "text": "SYDNEY: Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it was planning to deny some banks authorisation to collectively bargain with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payment system.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's \"Apple Pay\" system, would reduce each individual bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. technology giant.\n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin)\n- Reuters\nEmail More",
