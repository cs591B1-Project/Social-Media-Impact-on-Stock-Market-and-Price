      "text": "The “ short attention span ” president-elect, Donald Trump, continues his attempt to govern in 140 characters or less. This morning, Trump came out against the Boeing contract to build the Air Force One replacements. \nFirst, a bit of background before we get into the twit’s tweet. \nThere are two “Air Force One” planes. However, only the one the president is actually using is called Air Force One. Technically, the planes are Boeing 747-200Bs and are designated VC-25A . \nThe two planes currently used by President Obama, were put into service when Bush, the elder, was president. Presidential planes are supposed to have an active duty life of 30 years, and the 30 years is up in 2017. However, the replacements won’t be ready until sometime in 2020. \nThe planes slated to replace the current Air Force Ones, are Boeing 747-8 s. In January of last year, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James stated that this was the only plane made in the United States that, “consistent with the national public interest,” could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft. \nAccording to Boeing’s press release this afternoon, “ We are currently working under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States .” \nThe Air Force has budgeted $2.87 billion for the two Air Force One replacements, for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021. \nDefense consultant, Dr. Loren B. Thompson of the Lexington Institute, explained the expense , \nAir Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances — like nuclear war. The price tag is driven by the demands of the mission. \nEnter: Donald Trump! \nAt 5:52, this morning, he sent out a tweet: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nWhere he got the “more than $4 billion,” other than out of thin air, is anybody’s guess. He seems to have a chronic problem with facts. \nThe Washington Post reported that Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group , a company that specializes in “A erospace and Defense Market Intelligence ,” said Trump’s tweet was, “ Completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it’s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium .” \nThe predawn tweet calls into question the government’s contractual commitments. As Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English , described it , “ The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor .” \nThe tweet caused Boeing stock to take a hit, although it recovered later in the day. \nOh, and not to worry about Trump’s bottom line. He dumped his Boeing stock in June. \nWatch the Faux News crowd dig into Trump’s message to Boeing: \nFeatured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube Video .

      "text": "Sydney: Airlines in China need to hire 5,550 pilots a year for the next two decades as new plane orders and demand for air travel surges, according to Boeing Co.\nWith the nation on course to eclipse North America as the world’s largest travel market, China will need 111,000 new aviators through 2035, Boeing said in a forecast released on Wednesday. That’s more than anywhere else in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 40 per cent of the global pilot requirement, the Chicago-based plane maker said.\nAviation is booming in China, where the number of airlines has increased 28 per cent to 55 in the past five years. Air traffic over China is set to almost quadruple in the next two decades, making it the world’s busiest market, according to rival Airbus Group SE.\n“We are continuing to see a significant need for new pilots and maintenance technicians in the Asia-Pacific region and across the globe,” Sherry Carbary, vice president of Boeing Flight Services, said in a statement.\nForeign aviators\nAs China endures a pilot shortage, local airlines are dangling lucrative pay packages at foreigners with cockpit experience, according to recruiters. Foreign aviators can earn as much as $26,000 a month in net pay in China.\nThe Asian country also needs 119,000 flight technicians over the next two decades, while Southeast Asia requires 62,000 pilots and 67,000 technicians, Boeing said.\nIn a global forecast in July, the aircraft maker said airlines worldwide will need to recruit and train about 617,000 pilots to fly 39,620 planes, valued at $5.9 trillion, that are expected to be added through 2035.\nThe Asia-Pacific region will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at $2.35 trillion in the next two decades, according to Boeing.",

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nWASHINGTON Donald Trump said companies should welcome his actions because they will prosper under his administration, the U.S. President-elect told NBC on Wednesday, one day after Boeing Co's shares took a hit when he used Twitter to criticize one of its high-profile projects. \nTrump said he spoke with the head of Boeing on Tuesday about the cost of its work regarding new presidential planes, and \"we're going to work it out.\" He added: \"That's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices.\" \nTrump added that markets should welcome his actions. \"I don't know...how people are unnerved. It's just the opposite. Frankly, I think we're going to go up.\" \n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu) Next In Politics China calls Iowa's Branstad 'old friend' after report he picked as ambassador \nBEIJING/SHANGHAI China said on Wednesday the governor of the U.S. state of Iowa, Terry Branstad, was an \"old friend\" after a report that he had accepted an offer from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to become the next U.S. ambassador to China.",

      "text": "\n\nDonald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.” \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official. \n“The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nThe company was caught completely off guard by Trump’s comments and contacted the president-elect’s team soon after his tweet, a Boeing official told CNN. \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They’ll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nTrump’s comment emphasizes that he’s looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said. \nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \n“This Air Force One that we’re currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,” Earnest said. “It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.” The two Air Force One jets currently in use were ordered by President Reagan — the interiors were selected by Nancy Reagan — and were delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. The list price for a basic 747-8 is about $378.5 million. \nA team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do and adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing’s first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a “great company!” \n— CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this story \n",

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nDecember 7, 2016 \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – Donald Trump said companies should welcome his actions because they will prosper under his administration, the U.S. President-elect told NBC on Wednesday, one day after Boeing Co’s shares took a hit when he used Twitter to criticize one of its high-profile projects. \nTrump said he spoke with the head of Boeing on Tuesday about the cost of its work regarding new presidential planes, and “we’re going to work it out.” He added: “That’s what I’m here for. I’m going to negotiate prices.” \nTrump added that markets should welcome his actions. “I don’t know…how people are unnerved. It’s just the opposite. Frankly, I think we’re going to go up.” \n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu)",

      "text": "Trump touts deal for 50K new jobs Trump also pushed the airline manufacturer Boeing to give the country a better deal Sunlen Serfaty, CNN Published: December 6, 2016, 9:15 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) (Credit: CNN) \n(CNN) – Donald Trump is bringing his “Art of the Deal” approach to the White House. The president-elect touted a new investment in the U.S. from Japan’s Softbank. \nTrump said, “So ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa of Softbank from Japan and he has just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs. He’s one of the great men of industry, so I just want to thank you very much.” \nJust hours before that announcement, Trump pushed the airline manufacturer Boeing to give the country a better deal on the building of two new Air Force One planes. He tweeted, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents. Costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nTrump did not provide proof for his $4 billion claim. A Boeing official says they are not sure where the president-elect got the number and that the cost for the planes is not final. \nThis is all happening as Trump faces a brewing fight with some in his own party over his proposal for a 35% tariff on U.S. companies that move their businesses overseas. \nCongressional republicans are warning it could spark a trade war, and House speaker Paul Ryan signaled a broader rewrite of the tax code should be the focus. \nRyan said, “We think the real solution here is comprehensive, across-the-board tax reform, which we’re going to be hitting the ground running on.” \nTrump hits the road Tuesday night for the second stop on his “thank you tour.” He is holding a campaign-style rally in North Carolina near Fort Bragg to formally roll out on stage his pick for Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis. \nIn the meantime, the revolving door at Trump tower continues. \nTrump noted, “We are going to talk about a lot of things to a lot of people. We have a lot of people coming up. A great group of people.” \nThe decision on Secretary of State, the most high profile job, still hangs in the balance. Trump is expanding, rather than narrowing, his search. \nGov. Mike Pence explained, “He’s taking his time. We have more names that may well be added to the list.” \nOne of those new candidates includes Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson, who interviewed with Trump Tuesday. \nAs Trump adds to his team, he’s cutting one member of the transition, the son of retired General Michael Flynn, his pick for National Security Adviser. \nGov. Mike Pence noted, “Mike Flynn Junior is no longer associated with General Flynn’s efforts, or with the transition team, and we’re focused eyes forward.” \nTrump gave the direct order to remove the younger Flynn after he tweeted about a conspiracy theory involving a local Washington pizzeria that was the site of an armed attack over the weekend.

Photo: AFP Tweet Published: 7:35 PM, December 7, 2016 \nSYDNEY — Airlines in China need to hire 5,550 pilots a year for the next two decades as new plane orders and demand for air travel surges, according to Boeing. \nWith the nation on course to eclipse North America as the world’s largest travel market, China will need 111,000 new aviators through 2035, Boeing said in a forecast released on Wednesday (Dec 7).That’s more than anywhere else in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 40 per cent of the global pilot requirement, the Chicago-based plane maker said. \nAviation is booming in China, where the number of airlines has increased 28 per cent to 55 in the past five years. Air traffic over China is set to almost quadruple in the next two decades, making it the world’s busiest market, according to rival Airbus Group SE. \n“We are continuing to see a significant need for new pilots and maintenance technicians in the Asia-Pacific region and across the globe,” Ms Sherry Carbary, vice president of Boeing Flight Services, said in a statement. \nAs China endures a pilot shortage, local airlines are dangling lucrative pay packages at foreigners with cockpit experience, according to recruiters. Foreign aviators can earn as much as US$26,000 (S$36,877) a month in net pay in China. \nThe Asian country also needs 119,000 flight technicians over the next two decades, while South-east Asia requires 62,000 pilots and 67,000 technicians, Boeing said. \nIn a global forecast in July, the aircraft maker said airlines worldwide will need to recruit and train about 617,000 pilots to fly 39,620 planes, valued at US$5.9 trillion, that are expected to be added through 2035. \nThe Asia-Pacific region will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at US$2.35 trillion in the next two decades, according to Boeing.

ADVERTISEMENT Asked on NBC's \"Today\" show whether his comments came with retribution in mind, Trump replied: “Well only the planes because I didn’t see an article where he was critical of trade policies and my trade policies are going to be terrific.\"\nA Tuesday op-ed in the Chicago-Tribune included comments from Muilenburg about the election and “apprehension about free and fair trade.” \n\"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,\" Muilenburg is quoted as saying. \nShortly after the op-ed was published, Trump tweeted about the high cost of the new Air Force One, which is contracted out to Boeing. \nTrump said Wednesday that “Boeing is going to be a tremendous beneficiary of” lower taxes. \n“I believe in free trade, but I don’t believe in stupid trade,” Trump added. “And stupid trade is when our companies all move out of our country, fire their workers, and then come back in, Matt, and sell their product back in with no retribution.” 1 day 1 Denzel Washington blasts media for...

      "text": "print \nSara D. Davis/Getty Images \nThe day after President-elect Donald Trump said he would \"cancel\" an order with Boeing for new Air Force One jets, he went on the Today Show to explain his criticism of the company. \n\"Well I think the planes are too expensive,\" Trump told the Today Show's Matt Lauer. \"I spoke to a terrific guy yesterday, the head of Boeing, and I think we're going to work it out, but you know, that's what I'm here for, I'm going to negotiate prices.\" \nTrump claimed on Tuesday that the cost of the new Boeing 747-8s that are slated to become the new Air Force One is upwards of $4 billion. A statement from Boeing clarified that it was under contract for $170 million to explore the development of a new plane. The Air Force also said they had budgeted $3.2 billion for two planes that would both act as Air Force One to be spent over 10 years . \n\"The planes are too expensive and we're going to get the prices down,\" said Trump. \"If we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them and we're going to stay with what he have.\" \nAs noted by Business Insider's Benjamin Zhang , the development process would put the new planes in service in 2024, meaning the current planes would be 34 years old by that time. \nTrump also explained that criticism from Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was not the reason for his tweet. Multiple media outlets pointed out that Trump's tweet came shortly after a Chicago Tribune article highlighted comments from Muilenberg criticizing some of the president-elect's trade policies. \n\"Only the planes, because I didn't see any article where he was critical of trade policies, and my trade policies are going to be terrific,\" said Trump. \nBoeing is one of the US's largest exporters. \nLauer also asked Trump if he thought that his tweet had made business leaders and CEOs nervous that they would be the next to be targeted by the president-elect on social media, noting a Washington Post story that said CEOs are \"unnerved\" by Trump's \"unpredictable\" tweeting. \n\"What happens is [business leaders] are so unnerved that the stock market is at an all-time record since I won the nomination — number one, we did well — and after I won the election you see what happened,\" said Trump. \"In the history of our country, there's never been an up this big after an election. So I don't know how somebody said that people are unnerved, it's just the opposite.\" \nTrump also defended his trade policies, which economists and business leaders have worried would cause a damaging trade war in the US. In fact, Trump himself compared trade to war at a victory rally in Fayetteville, NC on Tuesday night. \n\"I believe in free trade, but I don't believe in stupid trade,\" said Trump. \"Stupid trade is when companies all move out of country, fire their workers, and then come back in Matt and sell their product back in with no retribution.\" \nTrump also reiterated his proposal that if a company off-shores jobs, their products will be subject to a tax .

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, he responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says currently has an Air Force Once contract worth $170 million. \nBoeing issued a statement saying that the current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones, which will replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. And airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige and revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build two new Air Force Ones. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 can travel an additional 1,000 miles without refueling, fly faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and get better fuel economy than the 747-200 that’s used for the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nIt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment.

      "title": "In phone call with Trump, Boeing chief pledges to work with new administration after Air Force One tweet - Chicago Tribune",
      "text": "Hours after Donald Trump promised to kill the Air Force One procurement program, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis A. Muilenburg spoke with the president-elect on Tuesday, promising to work with the new administration and to keep the costs of the program down, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\nEarly on Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the costs of the program \"are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Later he told reporters that he thought the cost was \"ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nThe comments sent a shiver through the defense and aerospace industries, which had seen their stock prices soar after Trump's election. Trump had pledged that he would rebuild the nation's military and better equip troops with more ships, jets and weapons. But the tweet and the comments were signals that the companies that might benefit from that spending could just as easily be targets under the new administration.\nAs President-elect Donald Trump's tweet puts Air Force One in the headlines, here's a look at the presidential plane through the years.\nThe Washington Post had also just reported that the Pentagon buried an internal study that found $125 billion in bureaucratic waste for fear that Congress would slash its budget. And on Tuesday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump plans to carefully scrutinize the way the Pentagon spends money.\n\"I think this really speaks to the president-elect's focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,\" he said. \"I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we're going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.\"\nCaterpillar CEO likes Trump's business focus, but not anti-trade 'rhetoric' Gail MarksJarvis While concerned about some of President-elect Donald Trump 's \"rhetoric\" on trade policy, Caterpillar chief executive Doug Oberhelman said Tuesday that he thinks those in the new president's administration \"will use every tool they can get\" to promote growth.\nOberhelman, the chairman of the Business...\nWhile concerned about some of President-elect Donald Trump 's \"rhetoric\" on trade policy, Caterpillar chief executive Doug Oberhelman said Tuesday that he thinks those in the new president's administration \"will use every tool they can get\" to promote growth.\nOberhelman, the chairman of the Business...\n(Gail MarksJarvis) During their conversation, Muilenburg assured Trump that the company would work with Trump's Pentagon on any requirement changes to the program in an effort to keep costs down. The call was confirmed by a second person, who was also not authorized to speak publicly about it. Trump himself confirmed the conversation during a Wednesday interview on the Today show.\nSo far, the Air Force has budgeted $2.7 billion for the Air Force One program, which includes two aircraft and is still in the development stages. That money is for research, development and testing - not manufacturing. Over the next few years, the Air Force expects \"this number to change as the program matures with the completion of risk reduction activities,\" it said in a statement.\nCorporate America unnerved by President-elect Donald Trump's unpredictable style Drew Harwell, Rosalind S. Helderman The turbulence began Tuesday morning with one of President-elect Donald Trump 's signature tweets of wrath: a public jab at Boeing alleging that the cost of building Air Force One had spiraled out of control.\nThat came an hour after Boeing's chief executive was quoted questioning Trump's stance...\nThe turbulence began Tuesday morning with one of President-elect Donald Trump 's signature tweets of wrath: a public jab at Boeing alleging that the cost of building Air Force One had spiraled out of control.\nThat came an hour after Boeing's chief executive was quoted questioning Trump's stance...\n(Drew Harwell, Rosalind S. Helderman) In a statement, Boeing said it is only under contract for $170 million for work \"to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft.\"\nThe real cost could grow to $4 billion, according to an analysis by Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The aircraft are projected to be operational by the mid-2020s, officials said.\nThe planes, which go by the call sign \"Air Force One\" when the president is on board, cost so much because they can do so much, defense analysts said. They are able to safeguard the president in a crisis - even a nuclear attack, allowing him to direct the military from the air, speak with Cabinet members and communicate with the nation. The plane is able to be refueled while in flight, so that it can stay aloft for extended periods. And it has extensive radar and counterattack measures, officials said. Much of its capabilities are classified.\nIt is a \"flying command post,\" Harrison said. \"In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe.\"\nCan Trump cancel the Air Force One deal? That and answers to other questions after his tweet Tribune news services President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet...\n(Tribune news services) The \"capabilities of this plane were there for everyone to see on 9/11\" when Bush was whisked aboard Air Force One and responded to the crisis from there, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group.\nIn their call, Muilenburg and Trump also discussed trade and China, the official said. Boeing sells a large percentage of its jets to foreign countries, including China. If Trump instituted a tariff on China, the country could retaliate by limiting the number of Boeing jets it buys, Aboulafia has said.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Nuclear Disasters",

      "text": "Donald Trump spoke Tuesday with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the president-elect confirmed in a Wednesday morning interview, a conversation that followed his earlier accusation that the airplane manufacturer is fleecing American taxpayers on a contract to create the next generation of presidential aircraft. The president-elect called Muilenburg “a very good man” but nonetheless said that Boeing’s project to build two new planes for the presidential fleet is too expensive. He pledged to bring down the cost of the planes, which are designated “Air Force One” when the president is aboard, or else scrap the project entirely.\nStory Continued Below\n“Well I think the planes are too expensive. I spoke to a very good man yesterday, the head of Boeing, a terrific guy, and we're going to work it out,” Trump told NBC’s “ Today ” on Wednesday morning. “You know, that’s what I’m here for. I’m going to negotiate prices. Planes are too expensive and we’re going to get the prices down and if we don’t get the prices down, we’re not going to order them. We’re going to stay with what we have.” \nTrump wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning that costs on the project were “out of control” and said he would cancel the order as president. In brief remarks to reporters later Tuesday morning, Trump said “Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” implying that the company was artificially inflating costs. He pegged the price of the program at $4 billion, higher than estimates from the Air Force and the Government Accountability Office.\nTrump’s surprise decision to lash out at Boeing came just minutes after the publication of a Chicago Tribune story on Muilenburg in which the Boeing CEO was critical of Trump’s protectionist trade agenda. Muilenburg stated that Trump’s get-tough-with-China proposals could wind up hurting Boeing’s robust business relationship with the world’s most populous nation. He also urged Trump not to back away from the international trade deals he lambasted on the campaign trail, saying that \"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us.\"\nThe president-elect said Wednesday morning that he had not seen the article and that his decision to call out Boeing was based only on the price of the presidential planes, nothing more. He said America’s largest airplane manufacturer stands to benefit as much as every other American company from his policies.\n“My trade policies are going to be terrific. And by the way, we're lowering taxes in this country. We’re getting rid of 90 percent, maybe 85 percent of the regulations which are stifling business,” he said. “Boeing is going to be a tremendous beneficiary of that and maybe even mostly regulations. I mean, people are more happy about the regulations even though we're massively cutting taxes for businesses.”",

      "text": "Trump Says He Will Personally Negotiate Air Force One Price With Boeing  42:  By Damian Paletta and Daniel Nasaw \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would personally \"negotiate the prices\" with Boeing Co. of the planes to be used as Air Force One, promising to block a future order if necessary and to continue using the existing aircraft for the presidential plane. \nMr. Trump, in a Wednesday morning interview on NBC, said he had spoken to \"the head\" of Boeing, likely referring to chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, on Tuesday, following criticism Mr. Trump leveled at the company about what he perceived were elevated prices for the planes. He accused the company of attempting to charge more than $4 billion to build the new planes, a figure that the White House and Air Force have disputed. \nMr. Trump, in the NBC interview, said he saw this as part of his job. \n\"That's what I'm here for,\" he said. \"I'm going to negotiate the prices.\" \nHe also praised the man he will succeed in the White House, saying that he and President Barack Obama have \"really good chemistry\" and that he had run ideas for cabinet picks by him. \n\"I've now gotten to know President Obama,\" Mr. Trump said in the NBC interview, which marked his pick as Time magazine's person of the year. \"I really like him. We have a really good chemistry together. We talk.\" \nHe said Mr. Obama \"loves the country, he wants to do right by the country. I really like him as a person.\" \nMr. Trump is in the process of assembling his cabinet and top advisers, having announced his choices for the secretaries of commerce, defense, education, housing and urban development, health and human services, and treasury, as well as national security adviser. Mr. Trump said he expected to name his pick for secretary of state next week. He said there would be other \"big announcements\" on Wednesday and Thursday. \n\"I have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, adding he takes Mr. Obama's suggestions \"very seriously.\" \n\"We have a very good dialogue,\" he said on NBC. \"I do like him. I love getting his ideas.\" \nWrite to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com and Daniel Nasaw at daniel.nasaw@wsj.com  160942ET  ",

      "text": "International Business Trump defends Boeing tweet, says companies shouldn't worry U.S.   Trump on Wednesday defended his direct interventions with companies, including making statements on Twitter, saying businesses will benefit from his actions and his upcoming term in office. Posted 07 Dec 2016 21:20 Updated 07 Dec 2016 22:45 U.S.   Trump speaks at a USA Thank You Tour event at Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S., December 5, 2016. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton A \nWASHINGTON: U.S.   Trump on Wednesday defended his direct interventions with companies, including making statements on Twitter, saying businesses will benefit from his actions and his upcoming term in office. \nOne day after criticizing one of Boeing Co's high-profile projects in a tweet, Trump told NBC that he anticipated \"tremendous\" economic growth under his administration but reiterated his warning that companies shifting U.S. jobs overseas would have to pay. \nStill, markets and companies should not worry, he said. \n\"I don't know ... how people are unnerved,\" Trump told NBC's \"Today\" program. \"It's just the opposite. Frankly, I think we're going to go up.\" \nThe New York businessman, who has never held public office, begins his term on Jan. 20. \nTrump also said he had sold his stocks in June to avoid any conflict-of-interest with the presidency. \n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I'm making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\" he said. \nHis comments followed a series of actions targeting specific companies, including a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in the United States. On Tuesday, he criticized Boeing in a tweet that dented its shares, and he won pledges from two of Asia's biggest technology companies to expand their U.S. investments. \nOn Boeing, Trump complained about costs for its revamped Air Force One plane, a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency, and urged the government to cancel its order. \nThe move was the latest example of Trump's using his podium, often via Twitter, to rattle companies and foreign countries. \nTrump told NBC that he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg spoke on Tuesday. \"We're going to work it out,\" Trump said. \"That's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices.\" \nHe also cautioned U.S. businesses against offshoring jobs. \n\"If they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country, and sell their product into our country, they're going to be paying a tax,\" he told NBC. \nEarlier this month, Trump lauded a deal with United Technologies Corp's Carrier to keep some U.S. positions in exchange for US$7 million in tax breaks following a Thanksgiving Day tweet on the negotiations. \nTrump also defended his Twitter posts, telling NBC he used the social media platform to \"talk about important things\" and that it conveyed his message \"much faster than a press release.\" \n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) - Reuters",

      "text": "Terms of use \nAir Force One is seen at Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. Obama is scheduled to complete his visit in Greece later today when he will fly to Berlin, Germany. (AP Photo/Yorgos Karahalis) Air Force One at Athens International Airport on Nov. 16. (AP Photo/Yorgos Karahalis) Boeing CEO talks with Trump, promising to keep costs down Wed Dec 7th, 2016 6:40am   \nBy Christian Davenport \nThe Washington Post \nHours after Donald Trump promised to kill the Air Force One procurement program , Boeing Chief Executive Dennis A. Muilenburg spoke with the president-elect on Tuesday, promising to work with the new administration and to keep the costs of the program down, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. \nEarly on Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the costs of the program “are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Later he told reporters that he thought the cost was “ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe comments sent a shiver through the defense and aerospace industries, which had seen their stock prices soar after Trump’s election. Trump had pledged that he would rebuild the nation’s military and better equip troops with more ships, jets and weapons. But the tweet and the comments were signals that the companies that might benefit from that spending could just as easily be targets under the new administration. \nThe Washington Post had also just reported that the Pentagon buried an internal study that found $125 billion in bureaucratic waste for fear that Congress would slash its budget. And on Tuesday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump plans to carefully scrutinize the way the Pentagon spends money. \n“I think this really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,” he said. “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.” \nDuring their conversation, Muilenburg assured Trump that the company would work with Trump’s Pentagon on any requirement changes to the program in an effort to keep costs down. The call was confirmed by a second person, who was also not authorized to speak publicly about it. Trump himself confirmed the conversation during a Wednesday interview on the Today show. \nSo far, the Air Force has budgeted $2.7 billion for the Air Force One program, which includes two aircraft and is still in the development stages. That money is for research, development and testing – not manufacturing. Over the next few years, the Air Force expects “this number to change as the program matures with the completion of risk reduction activities,” it said in a statement. \nIn a statement, Boeing said it is only under contract for $170 million for work “to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft.” \nThe real cost could grow to $4 billion, according to an analysis by Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The aircraft are projected to be operational by the mid-2020s, officials said. \nThe planes, which go by the call sign “Air Force One” when the president is on board, cost so much because they can do so much, defense analysts said. They are able to safeguard the president in a crisis — even a nuclear attack — allowing him to direct the military from the air, speak with Cabinet members and communicate with the nation. The plane is able to be refueled while in flight, so that it can stay aloft for extended periods. And it has extensive radar and counterattack measures, officials said. Much of its capabilities are classified. \nIt is a “flying command post,” Harrison said. “In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe.” \nThe “capabilities of this plane were there for everyone to see on 9/11” when Bush was whisked aboard Air Force One and responded to the crisis from there, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group. \nIn their call, Muilenburg and Trump also discussed trade and China, the official said. Boeing sells a large percentage of its jets to foreign countries, including China. If Trump instituted a tariff on China, the country could retaliate by limiting the number of Boeing jets it buys, Aboulafia has said.

      "text": "print \nJeff Swensen/Getty Images \nA day after President-elect Donald Trump said he would \"cancel\" an order with Boeing for new Air Force One jets, he on Wednesday explained his criticism of the company. \n\"Well I think the planes are too expensive,\" Trump told NBC host Matt Lauer on the \"Today\" show. \"I spoke to a terrific guy yesterday, the head of Boeing, and I think we're going to work it out, but you know, that's what I'm here for — I'm going to negotiate prices.\" \nTrump on Tuesday said the cost of developing the new Boeing 747-8s that are slated to become the next Air Force One is upward of $4 billion. A statement from Boeing clarified that it was under contract for $170 million to explore the development of a new plane. The Air Force also said it had budgeted $3.2 billion to be spent over 10 years for two planes that would both act as Air Force One. \n\"The planes are too expensive, and we're going to get the prices down,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"If we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them, and we're going to stay with what he have.\" \nAs reported by Business Insider's Benjamin Zhang , the new planes would be scheduled to enter service in 2024, when the current planes will be 34 years old. \nTrump said criticism from Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was not the reason for his tweet. Multiple media outlets pointed out that Trump's tweet on Tuesday came shortly after a Chicago Tribune article highlighted comments from Muilenburg criticizing some of the president-elect's trade policies. \n\"Only the planes, because I didn't see any article where he was critical of trade policies, and my trade policies are going to be terrific,\" Trump said. \nBoeing is one of the US's largest exporters . \nLauer also asked Trump whether he thought his tweet had made business leaders and CEOs nervous they would be the next to be targeted by the president-elect on social media, pointing to a Washington Post story that said CEOs were \"unnerved\" by Trump's \"unpredictable\" tweeting. \n\"What happens is they are so unnerved that the stock market is at an all-time record since I won the nomination — number one, we did well — and after I won the election you see what happened,\" Trump said. \"In the history of our country, there's never been an up this big after an election. So I don't know how somebody said that people are unnerved — it's just the opposite.\" \nTrump also defended his trade policies, which economists and business leaders have worried could cause a damaging trade war in the US. In fact, Trump himself compared trade to war at a victory rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Tuesday night. \n\"I believe in free trade, but I don't believe in stupid trade,\" Trump said. \"Stupid trade is when companies all move out of country, fire their workers, and then come back in Matt and sell their product back in with no retribution.\" \nTrump also reiterated his proposal that if a company off-shores jobs, their products will be subject to a tax .

      "text": "* Boeing top drag on Dow on Trump's tweet\n* Intralinks jumps on deal to be bought by Synchronoss\n* Dow down 0.1 pct, S&P down 0.05 pct, Nasdaq flat (Updates to open)\nBy Yashaswini Swamynathan\nDec 6 Wall Street was slightly lower on Tuesday morning, as gains in financial stocks failed to make up for losses in energy stocks following a drop in oil prices.\nBrent crude prices fell 2.5 percent, the first decline in five days, after data showed an increase in output from major producers, just days after OPEC and Russia agreed to a production cut.\nThe S&P 500 energy sector fell 1.07 percent, weighed down by Exxon and Chevron. Oil prices had risen more than 18 percent since last Wednesday when the producers agreed to limit output.\nInvestors are now shifting their focus to the upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, where traders see a 92 percent chance of an interest rate hike.\nU.S. stocks have climbed since the Nov. 8 election, driven by expectations of significant economic stimulus and cuts in corporate taxes and regulations under President-elect Donald Trump.\nFinancials provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 on Tuesday, but failed to counter the impact of weaker oil.\nFive of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower.\nAt 9:45 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was down 18.46 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,197.78.\nThe S&P 500 was down 1.03 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,203.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.05 points, at 5,308.84.\nBoeing's shares fell 1.1 percent to $150.53, after Trump tweeted that costs of the planemaker's 747 Air Force One aircraft were \"out of control\" and that the order should be canceled. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.\nIntralinks soared 16.2 percent to $13.10 after Synchronoss Technologies said it would buy the cloud-based business software provider for $821 million, representing a 15.4 percent premium. Synchronoss shares were off about 12 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,429 to 1,189, for a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the upside. On the Nasdaq, 1,186 issues fell and 1,093 advanced for a 1.09-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 100 new highs and 5 new lows.

Obama returns from a 2-day trip to Detroit, Michigan to speak about the economy before traveling to Phoenix, Arizona to speak about housing. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.” \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official. \n“The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They’ll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nTrump’s comment emphasizes that he’s looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said. \nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \n“This Air Force One that we’re currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,” Earnest said. “It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.” \nOf the two Air Force One jets that are currently in use, one has been flying since Ronald Reagan was president, and the other was delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing’s first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a “great company!” ",

      "text": "Boeing Says China Must Hire More Than 100,000 Pilots Over Next 20 Years \nAngus Whitley , Bloomberg - Dec 07, 2016 10:03 am \nBoeing says China will have to hire 5,500 new pilots annually over the next 20 years as its aviation market booms. Pictured are two China Airlines pilots in an A350 flight simulator. China Airlines Photo: China Airlines   \nThere is a pilot shortage — in China, at least, but that will likely impact pilot hiring by airlines around the world. The shortage over the long term could have a ripple effect down to regional airlines, too. — Dennis Schaal \nAirlines in China need to hire 5,550 pilots a year for the next two decades as new plane orders and demand for air travel surges, according to Boeing Co. \nWith the nation on course to eclipse North America as the world’s largest travel market, China will need 111,000 new aviators through 2035, Boeing said in a forecast released on Monday. That’s more than anywhere else in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 40 percent of the global pilot requirement, the Chicago-based plane maker said. \nAviation is booming in China, where the number of airlines has increased 28 percent to 55 in the past five years. Air traffic over China is set to almost quadruple in the next two decades, making it the world’s busiest market, according to rival Airbus Group SE. \n“We are continuing to see a significant need for new pilots and maintenance technicians in the Asia-Pacific region and across the globe,” Sherry Carbary, vice president of Boeing Flight Services, said in a statement. \nAs China endures a pilot shortage, local airlines are dangling lucrative pay packages at foreigners with cockpit experience, according to recruiters. Foreign aviators can earn as much as $26,000 a month in net pay in China. \nThe Asian country also needs 119,000 flight technicians over the next two decades, while Southeast Asia requires 62,000 pilots and 67,000 technicians, Boeing said. \nIn a global forecast in July, the aircraft maker said airlines worldwide will need to recruit and train about 617,000 pilots to fly 39,620 planes, valued at $5.9 trillion, that are expected to be added through 2035. \nThe Asia-Pacific region will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at $2.35 trillion in the next two decades, according to Boeing. \n–With assistance from Chris Cooper To contact the reporter on this story: Angus Whitley in Sydney at awhitley1@bloomberg.net.

LOUIS, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- Boeing will soon purchase autonomous maritime systems developer Liquid Robotics, expanding its seabed-to-space autonomous assets.\nNeither company has revealed the terms of the deal, or how much Boeing will pay for the acquisition. Boeing officials say the move is beneficial for their customers.\n\"With Liquid Robotics' innovative technology and Boeing's leading intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions, we are helping our customers address maritime challenges in ways that make existing platforms smarter, missions safer and operations more efficient,\" Boeing Defense, Space, & Security CEO Leanne Caret said in a press release .\nLiquid Robotics' products include the Wave Glider , an autonomous maritime platform with defense applications including vessel detection and avoidance, multi-vehicle fleet operations, and third-party navigation support.\nThe acquisition announcement follows an earlier agreement between the two companies in September 2014 to develop a variant of the platform called the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft, or SHARC. The vessel aimed to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations.\n\"I am proud of our team, culture, and relentless commitment to designing the best ocean surface robot in the maritime industry,\" Liquid Robotics president and CEO Gary Gysin said. \"This acquisition allows us to leverage the strengths of one of the world's leading global companies while continuing to push our innovation to new levels.\"\n  U.S. Air Force approves Lockheed Martin's SBIRS ground system Netherlands taps Northrop Grumman for electronic countermeasures U.S. State Dept. approves sale of Stryker vehicles to Peru",

      "text": "Trump denies Air Force One threat is retaliation for Boeing CEO’s comments  36 A.M. By John T. Bennett Tribune News Service SMS \nWASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to keep the existing Air Force One fleet flying into next decade unless Boeing reduces costs on replacement jets, and denied his broadside came after reading critical comments from the company’s CEO. \nTrump set off a firestorm Tuesday morning when he – seemingly out of nowhere – tweeted that the cost of the replacement program would hit $4 billion. The social media post ended with two ominous words for Boeing: “Cancel order!” \nHe later made a rare appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower to tell reporters “the plane is totally out of control,” adding that he thinks “Boeing is doing a little bit of a number – we want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nJust over 24 hours later, Trump was asked about his criticism on NBC’s “Today Show” program. The president-elect denied seeing a Chicago Tribune article posted Tuesday morning that contained comments from Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg about the importance of free trade to his company’s overall business – and noted it sells one of every three 737 airliners to China. \nDuring the campaign – and since, including a U.S. foreign policy protocol-breaking phone call with Taiwan’s president – Trump used an anti-trade and tough-on-China populist position to help win over working-class Democrats in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. \nBut Muilenburg, in comments that the newspaper reported were from the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association last week, argued Washington cannot afford to sit on the sidelines of global trade talks. \n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” he said. \nThe Tribune article was posted at online at 7:30 a.m. Trump’s tweet went out at 8:52 a.m, as CNN’s Jake Tapper pointed out. \nOn Wednesday the president-elect denied, when pressed by “Today” co-host Matt Lauer, that his attack on the Air Force One replacement program was retaliation for Muilenburg’s pro-trade and friendly-with-China stances. \nBut he did escalate his growing war with the Chicago-based defense and aerospace giant when he threatened again to cancel the new program and merely keep the 25-year-old existing Air Force jets in service unless Boeing reduces costs. \nBut here’s the catch: The new presidential planes are still in development, and not set to being service until 2024. The youngest of the two current jets would have flown for 33 years at that point. \nWhen the Pentagon announced the deal in early 2015, the Air Force set the budget for the new planes at $1.65 billion, but current estimates have varied. \nTodd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, on Tuesday said the president-elect’s cost estimate was not that far off. That’s because the Pentagon’s last budget plan included $2.9 billion for research and development, but does not yet show the cost of actually buying the two new jets at a cost of more than $1 billion, Harrison tweeted. \nWhen asked for comment, Boeing at first seemed caught off guard. In a later Tuesday statement, the company claimed its existing contract for the program is worth $170 million. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,” Boeing said in a statement. \nIn other news, Trump on “Today” said he is “fairly close” to selecting a secretary of state nominee. “I think next week will be the time I announce it,” adding that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney remains in the running. So, too, does ExxonMobile Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson, he said. \nMeantime, he said his transition team could make other Cabinet announcements on Wednesday or Thursday. \nAdditionally, a Trump aide on a Tuesday conference call with reporters said the president-elect sold all of his stocks in June. Trump a day later said he did so not to make money but because he sensed he would win the presidency. \n“I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I’m making decisions for this country,” Trump said.  36 a.m.",

      "text": "Shell, Total Reportedly To Invest In Iran Despite Trump Threat (Investor's Business Daily) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's Tweet on Tuesday shocked the airline industry and had everyone talking. \nBoeing Co (NYSE: BA ) \"is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nOn the one hand, Trump's threat shows his willingness to cut costs out of the federal budget wherever he can. On the other hand, Air Force One could withstand a nuclear blast from the ground, so maybe the cost is justified. Airline Exec Offers His Take \nDoug Parker, CEO of American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL ) was a guest on CNBC Wednesday and naturally the conversation focused on Trump's Tweet. \nCNBC's Joe Kernan asked the executive if there are times when the executive feels the urge to call up Boeing and scream out, \"Are you kidding me?\" \n\"We do it all the time,\" Parker answered. \"We have a great relationship with Boeing but Donald Trump is not the first person to complain about their prices. I can assure you that.\" \nCNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin also jumped in and asked the executive how much Air Force One should cost. Sadly, the executive acknowledged that he has \"no idea\" how much the plane should cost given all the high tech and secret technology involved. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "title": "Trump Says He Will Personally Negotiate Air Force One Price With Boeing -- Update",
      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Damian Paletta and Daniel Nasaw\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would personally \"negotiate the prices\" with Boeing Co. of the planes to be used as Air Force One, promising to block a future order if necessary and to continue using the existing aircraft for the presidential plane.\nMr. Trump, in a Wednesday morning interview on NBC, said he had spoken to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Tuesday following criticism Mr. Trump leveled at the company about what he perceived were elevated prices for the planes. Mr. Trump accused the company of attempting to charge more than $4 billion to build the new planes, a figure that the White House and Air Force have disputed.\nMr. Trump, in the NBC interview, said he saw this as part of his job.\n\"That's what I'm here for,\" he said. \"I'm going to negotiate the prices.\"\nIn a statement, Boeing confirmed Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Muilenburg by phone and said the company's chief \" committed to working with the new administration to control costs as they establish requirements for the new Air Force One to keep the program as affordable as possible and deliver the best value to American taxpayers.\"\nAlso in the interview, Mr. Trump said he was going to put together a series of government policies to encourage business growth. \"We're getting rid of 90%, maybe 85% of the regulations which are stifling business,\" he said.\nThe president-elect also went into greater detail about his decision in June to sell his stock holdings, revealed by his campaign on Tuesday.\n\"I felt that I was very much going to be winning\" and that it would be a \"conflict of interest owning all of these different companies,\" he said. \"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks.\"\nHe also praised the man he will succeed in the White House, saying that he and President Barack Obama have \"really good chemistry\" and that he had run ideas for cabinet picks by him.\n\"I've now gotten to know President Obama,\" Mr. Trump said in the NBC interview, which marked his pick as Time magazine's person of the year. \"I really like him. We have a really good chemistry together. We talk.\"\nHe said Mr. Obama \"loves the country, he wants to do right by the country. I really like him as a person.\"\nMr. Trump is in the process of assembling his cabinet and top advisers, having announced his choices for the secretaries of commerce, defense, education, housing and urban development, health and human services, and treasury, as well as national security adviser. Mr. Trump said he expected to name his pick for secretary of state next week. He said there would be other \"big announcements\" on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\"I have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, adding he takes Mr. Obama's suggestions \"very seriously.\"\n\"We have a very good dialogue,\" he said on NBC. \"I do like him. I love getting his ideas.\"\nDoug Cameron contributed to this article.\nWrite to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com and Daniel Nasaw at daniel.nasaw@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-07-161018ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Travis Pittman, KING 10:27 PM. EST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "• Donald Trump will have to think bigger than the Carrier deal \nBoeing said yesterday that it was “currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” the company said. \nExecutives of the company told officials on Trump's transition team that the cost of a new version of Air Force One could be lowered if the government agrees to reduce its requirements for the plane, people familiar with the discussions said. \nAsked today if his tweet was in response to a report that had been published a short time earlier, in which Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was quoted as criticizing Trump's trade rhetoric, Trump said he had not seen the article.",

      "text": "Trump Says He Will Personally Negotiate Air Force One Price With Boeing -- 2nd Update December 07, 2016, 11:10:  By Damian Paletta and Daniel Nasaw \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would personally \"negotiate the prices\" with Boeing Co. of the planes to be used as Air Force One, promising to block a future order if necessary and to continue using the existing aircraft for the presidential plane. \nMr. Trump, in a Wednesday morning interview on NBC, said he had spoken to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Tuesday following criticism Mr. Trump leveled at the company about what he perceived were elevated prices for the planes. Mr. Trump accused the company of attempting to charge more than $4 billion to build the new planes, a figure that the White House and Air Force have disputed. \nMr. Trump, in the NBC interview, said he saw this as part of his job. \n\"That's what I'm here for,\" he said. \"I'm going to negotiate the prices.\" \nIn a statement, Boeing confirmed Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Muilenburg by phone and said the company's chief \" committed to working with the new administration to control costs as they establish requirements for the new Air Force One to keep the program as affordable as possible and deliver the best value to American taxpayers.\" \nAlso in the interview, Mr. Trump said he was going to put together a series of government policies to encourage business growth. \"We're getting rid of 90%, maybe 85% of the regulations which are stifling business,\" he said. \nThe president-elect also went into greater detail about his decision in June to sell his stock holdings, revealed by his campaign on Tuesday. \n\"I felt that I was very much going to be winning\" and that it would be a \"conflict of interest owning all of these different companies,\" he said. \"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks.\" \nHe also praised the man he will succeed in the White House, saying that he and President Barack Obama have \"really good chemistry\" and that he had run ideas for cabinet picks by him. \n\"I've now gotten to know President Obama,\" Mr. Trump said in the NBC interview, which marked his pick as Time magazine's person of the year. \"I really like him. We have a really good chemistry together. We talk.\" \nHe said Mr. Obama \"loves the country, he wants to do right by the country. I really like him as a person.\" \nMr. Trump is in the process of assembling his cabinet and top advisers, having announced his choices for the secretaries of commerce, defense, education, housing and urban development, health and human services, and treasury, as well as national security adviser. Mr. Trump said he expected to name his pick for secretary of state next week. He said there would be other \"big announcements\" on Wednesday and Thursday. \n\"I have asked him what he would think of this one and that one,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, adding he takes Mr. Obama's suggestions \"very seriously.\" \n\"We have a very good dialogue,\" he said on NBC. \"I do like him. I love getting his ideas.\" \nDoug Cameron contributed to this article. \nWrite to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com and Daniel Nasaw at daniel.nasaw@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-07-161110ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Email \nWASHINGTON — Donald Trump wants to cancel a government order for a new Air Force One. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet early Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, he responded, “We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nThe new Air Force One would be a 747-8 instead of the 747-200 that is now in use by President Barack Obama. \nIt has a longer range, can travel faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and it gets better fuel economy. \nBoeing, which is the nation’s largest exporter, has built the plane used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” ",

The Air Force has budgeted $102 million in the next fiscal year and $3 billion in the next five years for the replacement, the Times reported . \nTrump’s tweet caused mixed reactions on the social media site. Some pepole applauded the idea that Trump will rein in government spending while others criticized the potential damage it could cause on American businesses and jobs. https://twitter.com/sweetatertot2/status/806155806991417344 ",

Cancel order!”\n“We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City later.\nBoeing said in a statement Tuesday that it was “currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.”\n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” the company said.\nThe firm’s share price fell as much as 1.5 percent before regular trading Tuesday. The shares rose less than 0.1 percent to $152.24 at the close in New York.\nExecutives of the company told officials on Trump’s transition team that the cost of a new version of Air Force One could be lowered if the government agrees to reduce its requirements for the plane, people familiar with the discussions said .\nAsked Wednesday if his tweet was in response to a report that had been published a short time earlier, in which Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was quoted as criticizing Trump’s trade rhetoric, Trump said he had not seen the article.",

Oil prices had risen more than 18 percent since last Wednesday when the producers reached an agreement to limit output.\nInvestors are now shifting their focus to the Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, where traders see a 92 percent chance of an interest rate hike.\nU.S. stocks have climbed since the Nov. 8 election, driven by expectations of significant economic stimulus and cuts in corporate taxes and regulations under President-elect Donald Trump.\nHowever, the rally has split, with the Dow marking a series of record highs on gains in industrials and bank stocks, while sectors such as utilities and technology have held back the S&P and the Nasdaq.\n\"You've got a lot of overbought individual components, especially in a rising rate environment, so any bad news, including Trump tweeting on Boeing, is going to have a big impact on the market,\" said Phil Davis, chief executive of PSW Investments.\n\"It's such a narrow rally, with such a small amount of support that it might unwind in a very ugly way.\"\nSix of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by a 1.52 percent rise in the telecom services index due to gains in AT&T and Verizon.\nEnergy was the biggest drag, while technology and financials were flat.\nAt 11:09 a.m. ET (1609 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 14.89 points, or 0.08 percent, at 19,201.35.\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.27 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,204.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.13 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,311.02.\nBoeing's shares edged down 0.7 percent to $151.08, after Trump tweeted that costs of the 747 Air Force One aircraft were \"out of control\" and that the order should be canceled.\nNike fell 2.9 percent to $50.34 after Cowen & Co downgraded the shoemaker's stock to \"market perform\" and cut price target. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.\nAT&T rose 1.7 percent to $39 after CEO Randall Stephenson told investors that the new streaming television service DirectTV Now has so far exceeded expectations.\nVerizon rose 1.5 percent to $50.52 after striking a deal with Equinix to sell 29 data centers for $3.6 billion.\nIntralinks soared 15.4 percent to $13.01 after Synchronoss Technologies said it would buy the cloud-based business software provider for $821 million, representing a 15.4 percent premium. Shares of Synchronoss, which provided a disappointing fourth-quarter revenue forecast, fell 10.2 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,595 to 1,168. On the Nasdaq, 1,342 issues rose and 1,282 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 143 new highs and 13 new lows.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his direct interventions with companies, including making statements on Twitter, saying businesses will benefit from his actions and his upcoming term in office. \nOne day after criticizing one of Boeing Co's high-profile projects in a tweet, Trump told NBC that he anticipated \"tremendous\" economic growth under his administration but reiterated his warning that companies shifting U.S. jobs overseas would have to pay. \nStill, markets and companies should not worry, he said.\n\"I don't know ... how people are unnerved,\" Trump told NBC's \"Today\" program. \"It's just the opposite. Frankly, I think we're going to go up.\"\nThe New York businessman, who has never held public office, begins his term on Jan. 20.\nTrump also said he had sold his stocks in June to avoid any conflict-of-interest with the presidency.\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I'm making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\" he said. \nHis comments followed a series of actions targeting specific companies, including a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in the United States. On Tuesday, he criticized Boeing in a tweet that dented its shares, and he won pledges from two of Asia's biggest technology companies to expand their U.S. investments. [L1N1E11W9]\nOn Boeing, Trump complained about costs for its revamped Air Force One plane, a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency, and urged the government to cancel its order. [L1N1E110N]\nThe move was the latest example of Trump's using his podium, often via Twitter, to rattle companies and foreign countries.\nTrump told NBC that he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg spoke on Tuesday. \"We're going to work it out,\" Trump said. \"That's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices.\"\nHe also cautioned U.S. businesses against offshoring jobs.\n\"If they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country, and sell their product into our country, they're going to be paying a tax,\" he told NBC.\nEarlier this month, Trump lauded a deal with United Technologies Corp's Carrier to keep some U.S. positions in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks following a Thanksgiving Day tweet on the negotiations. \nTrump also defended his Twitter posts, telling NBC he used the social media platform to \"talk about important things\" and that it conveyed his message \"much faster than a press release.\" \n\n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",

      "text": "Air Force One (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.” \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official. \n“The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They’ll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nTrump’s comment emphasizes that he’s looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said. \nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \n“This Air Force One that we’re currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,” Earnest said. “It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.” \nOf the two Air Force One jets that are currently in use, one has been flying since Ronald Reagan was president, and the other was delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing’s first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a “great company!” 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Sara D. Davis/Getty Images \nThe day after President-elect Donald Trump said he would \"cancel\" an order with Boeing for new Air Force One jets, he went on the Today Show to explain his criticism of the company.\n\"Well I think the planes are too expensive,\" Trump told the Today Show's Matt Lauer. \"I spoke to a terrific guy yesterday, the head of Boeing, and I think we're going to work it out, but you know, that's what I'm here for, I'm going to negotiate prices.\"\nTrump claimed on Tuesday that the cost of the new Boeing 747-8s that are slated to become the new Air Force One is upwards of $4 billion. A statement from Boeing clarified that it was under contract for $170 million to explore the development of a new plane. The Air Force also said they had budgeted $3.2 billion for two planes that would both act as Air Force One  to be spent over 10 years .\n\"The planes are too expensive and we're going to get the prices down,\" said Trump. \"If we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them and we're going to stay with what he have.\"\nAs noted by Business Insider's Benjamin Zhang , the development process would put the new planes in service in 2024, meaning the current planes would be 34 years old by that time.\nTrump also explained that criticism from Boeing CEO  Dennis Muilenburg was not the reason for his tweet. Multiple media outlets pointed out that Trump's tweet came shortly after a Chicago Tribune article highlighted comments from Muilenberg criticizing some of the president-elect's trade policies. \n\"Only the planes, because I didn't see any article where he was critical of trade policies, and my trade policies are going to be terrific,\" said Trump. \nBoeing is one of the US's  largest exporters. \nLauer also asked Trump if he thought that his tweet had made business leaders and CEOs nervous that they would be the next to be targeted by the president-elect on social media, noting a Washington Post story  that said CEOs are \"unnerved\" by Trump's \"unpredictable\" tweeting.\n\"What happens is [business leaders] are so unnerved that the stock market is at an all-time record since I won the nomination — number one, we did well — and after I won the election you see what happened,\" said Trump. \"In the history of our country, there's never been an up this big after an election. So I don't know how somebody said that people are unnerved, it's just the opposite.\" \nTrump also defended his trade policies, which economists and business leaders have worried would cause a damaging trade war in the US. In fact, Trump himself compared trade to war at a victory rally in Fayetteville, NC on Tuesday night.\n\"I believe in free trade, but I don't believe in stupid trade,\" said Trump. \"Stupid trade is when companies all move out of country, fire their workers, and then come back in Matt and sell their product back in with no retribution.\"\nTrump also reiterated his proposal that if a company off-shores jobs, their products will be subject to a tax .\nCheck out the exchange between Trump and Lauer: RAW Embed \nNOW WATCH: Watch the Air Force drop 8 armored Humvees out of a plane from 5,000 feet \n",

Cancel order!\n“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,” Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.”\nBoeing released this statement in response.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion.\nRead more: http://kng5.tv/2h6k6cE ",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that's being built to carry \"future presidents\" already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, \"Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,\" he said. \"And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost \"more than $4 billion.\" Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since \"the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.\" \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn't even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n\"We are not sure where he is getting that number from,\" said the Boeing official. \n\"The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,\" said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it \"to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\" \nThe company was caught completely off guard by Trump's comments and contacted the president-elect's team soon after his tweet, a Boeing official told CNN. \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They'll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren't expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing's current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" said Boeing's statement. \nTrump's comment emphasizes that he's looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n\"The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we're seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,\" he said. \nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \n\"This Air Force One that we're currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,\" Earnest said. \"It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.\" \nThe two Air Force One jets currently in use were ordered by President Reagan -- the interiors were selected by Nancy Reagan -- and were delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush's administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. The list price for a basic 747-8 is about $378.5 million. \nA team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do and adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing's first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation's largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump's comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a \"great company!\"",

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Travis Pittman, KING 10:27 PM. EST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg promised President-elect Donald Trump in a phone call Tuesday that the company will work to limit the cost of the new Air Force One after Trump threatened to cancel plans for at least two new presidential jets.\n“Muilenburg congratulated Mr. Trump on his election win and committed to working with the new administration to control costs as they establish requirements for the new Air Force One to keep the program as affordable as possible and deliver the best value to American taxpayers,” said Boeing’s statement. “They also discussed the overall importance of American manufacturing and Boeing’s continuing strong contribution and commitment to U.S.jobs.”\nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter, although it has opened a facility in China to finish jets being sold to Chinese airlines. Boeing has 151,641 U.S. workers and only a few thousand at facilities outside the United States.\nNo matter what happens with Air Force One, it’s important for Boeing to maintain a good relationship with the incoming administration. Boeing is a major defense contractor, in addition to its business making commercial jets. It had about $26 million worth of sales from U.S. government contracts last year, which amounted to 27% of its annual revenue, according to its annual report.\nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning that the plans for at least two new Air Force One jets should be canceled due to the cost. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” he tweeted.\nThe exact cost of the new planes has yet to be set, although the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion for the program through 2021. Boeing’s only existing government contract is for $170 million to do planning for the new planes.\nBut Trump told reporters later Tuesday that the cost of the planes was totally out of control.\n“I think it’s ridiculous,” he said. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump took a slightly more conciliatory approach to Boeing when was interviewed on NBC’s Today Show Wednesday morning, leaving open the possibility of going ahead with the planes if the cost comes down.\n“I spoke to a very good man yesterday, the head of Boeing, terrific guy, and we’re going to work it out,” said Trump. “But you know, that’s what I’m here for. I’m going to negotiate prices. Planes are too expensive. We’re going to get the prices down. If we don’t get the prices down, we’re not going to order them, we’ll stay with what we have.”\nThe two current Air Force One jets started service in 1990 under the administrations of George H.W. Bush, and they are reaching near the end of their planned life.\nBy Chris Isidore",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands.\nThe aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been in service since the Reagan administration and are due to reach the end of a 30-year design life in 2017.\nBoeing, which has built presidential jets since the early 1960s, has been doing early development work on the replacement likely to be outfitted with the latest in gadgetry, including top-secret communications equipment, countermeasures to spoil missile attacks, and aerial refueling capability so it can fly for days without landing.\nTrump would not get a chance to fly in a new Air Force One unless he is reelected; the replacement isn't slated to begin flying until 2024 at the earliest. So far, Boeing has been given three contracts amounting to $170 million to develop the aircraft, which is based on the new and larger version of the 747 dubbed the 747-8 Intercontinental.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted.\nTrump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday that he thought the Air Force One program was “ridiculous.”\n“Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” he said. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money — but not that much money.”\nAs president-elect, Trump has no power to cancel procurements, but the Air Force has yet to issue a contract for the next-generation Air Force One, which will include at least two planes.\nFederal budget documents published in February estimated research, test and development costs on the program to be around $2.87 billion through fiscal year 2021. The figure doesn’t include the costs of new planes, however. When that is factored in, the price tag may be around $4 billion, U.S. officials said.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,” Boeing said Tuesday in a statement. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nIt is rare for a president-elect to publicly call out a company by name because of the chilling effect it might have, and it wasn’t clear what prompted Trump’s complaint. Boeing’s shares were down $2 in early trading after Trump’s tweet, but recovered throughout the day, closing up 8 cents, or .05%, to $152.24.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump wants Boeing’s contract for a new Air Force One canceled The aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been in service since the Reagan administration and are due to reach the end of a 30-year design life in 2017.\nThe aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been in service since the Reagan administration and are due to reach the end of a 30-year design life in 2017.\nSee more videos The latest episode raised questions about Trump’s potential conflicts in light of his undisclosed financial holdings, and whether he held Boeing stock at the time of the tweet. Trump sold all his Boeing stock in June, transition spokesman Jason Miller insisted, though no documentation was made public.\n“This really speaks to president-elect’s focus on keeping spending down across the board,” Miller told reporters. “We are going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for areas where we are going to try to save money.”\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters traveling on Air Force One that the plane was \"nearing the end of its projected life\" and the Obama administration wanted to ensure that future presidents would have a \"modern presidential aircraft.\"\n\"The American people would expect that future U.S. presidents would benefit from unique and upgraded capabilities while they are traveling and representing the interests of the United States around the world,\" he said, adding that the Pentagon and Boeing were acting on recommendations from national security and technical experts.\nWith worldwide demand steadily shrinking, Boeing has repeatedly slowed the 747 production rate to one per month. The company said this year that if new orders didn’t roll in, it was “reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.”\nCan Trump cancel the Air Force One deal? That and answers to other questions after his tweet Tribune news services President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet...\n(Tribune news services) In its heyday, Boeing was producing 60 jumbo jets a year, with many of the components coming from Southern California.\nBoeing has several hundred suppliers in the U.S. supporting the 747 program. One of the largest is Triumph Aerostructures, which assembles the 747's center fuselage panels in Hawthorne.\nTriumph ships fuselage panels and sends them in three custom railroad cars to Boeing's assembly plant in Everett, Wash.\nRep. Rick Larsen and Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, all Democrats from Washington state, defended Boeing, the largest exporter in the U.S. with customers in 150 countries.\n“Replacing the 26-year-old Air Force One aircraft will support good-paying jobs throughout northwest Washington and is important to ensuring the safety and security of future presidents,” they said in a statement. “The president-elect’s tweet does nothing to change those basic facts.”\nThe only other large commercial aircraft manufacturer is Airbus Group SE, which is based in Leiden, Netherlands.\n White House",

      "text": "Trump wants to cancel Air Force One order Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg promised President-elect Donald Trump in a phone call Tuesday that the company will work to limit the cost of the new Air Force One after Trump threatened to cancel plans for at least two new presidential jets. \"Muilenburg congratulated Mr. Trump on his election win and committed to working with the new administration to control costs as they establish requirements for the new Air Force One to keep the program as affordable as possible and deliver the best value to American taxpayers,\" said Boeing's statement. \"They also discussed the overall importance of American manufacturing and Boeing's continuing strong contribution and commitment to U.S.jobs.\" \nRelated: Trump wants to cancel Air Force One order from Boeing \nBoeing is the nation's largest exporter, although it has opened a facility in China to finish jets being sold to Chinese airlines. Boeing has 151,641 U.S. workers and only a few thousand at facilities outside the United States. \nNo matter what happens with Air Force One, it's important for Boeing ( BA ) to maintain a good relationship with the incoming administration. Boeing is a major defense contractor, in addition to its business making commercial jets. It had about $26 million worth of sales from U.S. government contracts last year, which amounted to 27% of its annual revenue, according to its annual report. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning that the plans for at least two new Air Force One jets should be canceled due to the cost. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted. \nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 The exact cost of the new planes has yet to be set, although the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion for the program through 2021. Boeing's only existing government contract is for $170 million to do planning for the new planes. \nBut Trump told reporters later Tuesday that the cost of the planes was totally out of control. \n\"I think it's ridiculous,\" he said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nRelated: Donald Trump doubles down on 35% tax for businesses \nTrump took a slightly more conciliatory approach to Boeing when was interviewed on NBC's Today Show Wednesday morning, leaving open the possibility of going ahead with the planes if the cost comes down. \n\"I spoke to a very good man yesterday, the head of Boeing, terrific guy, and we're going to work it out,\" said Trump. \"But you know, that's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices. Planes are too expensive. We're going to get the prices down. If we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them, we'll stay with what we have.\" \nThe two current Air Force One jets started service in 1990 under the administrations of George H.W. Bush, and they are reaching near the end of their planned life. \nCNNMoney (New York)   12:25 PM ET",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to cancel Boeing's ( BA ) Air Force One deal Tuesday, saying its profits shouldn't be too high, after targeting plans by Ford Motor ( F ) and United Technologies ( UTX ) to use factories in Mexico. Boeing later reportedly expressed a willingness to negotiate.\n \nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nShortly after that tweet, Trump told reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, \"The plane is totally out of control ... We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.\"\nDavid Melcher, CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, tried to play down Trump's threat, telling reporters \"what is tweeted today is not necessarily going to be the policy of tomorrow,\" but said today's tweet needs to be addressed by the transition team.\nHe added that his advice to AIA members is to not tweet back.\nThe White House said the figures that Trump cited don't match the arrangement between Boeing and the Pentagon. The Air Force has previously designated $1.65 billion for two new planes. Boeing also responded that it is currently under an initial contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities for Air Force One replacement planes.\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" Boeing said.\nBut the Government Accountability Office put the eventual cost at $3.2 billion between fiscal years 2010 and 2020, the AP said, and an Air Force official told NBC News that the price tag is expected to top $4 billion when the planes are delivered.\nBoeing has reached out to Trump transition officials saying that the cost of the new Air Force One plans could be lowered if the government reduces its stringent requirements, Bloomberg reported late Tuesday , citing sources.\nAir Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told Politico that Air Force One is a \"flying White House.\"\nLee added, \"There's (electronic) countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner.\"\nBoeing shares closed up less than 0.1% at 152.24 on the stock market today after sinking as low as 150.02. On Monday, Boeing hit a 19-month high of 153.75 intraday. U.S.-listed shares of European rival Airbus ( EADSY ) retreated 1% Tuesday.\n\"While we appreciate the enthusiasm we've seen expressed on social media for Airbus products and their value proposition, it would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate on the future plans and policies of the next administration,\" and Airbus spokesman said.",

      "text": "2016 December 06, 2016 \nAfter Boeing’s CEO fretted publicly about president-elect Donald Trump’s anti-trade views, Trump attacked the company on Twitter , exaggerating the costs of a Boeing project to build new jets for the US president and threatening to cancel the contract. \nAccording to the company, Boeing is under contract for $170 million to design new presidential aircraft, known as Air Force One, to begin service in 2024. (The current planes have been in service since 1990.) No mere jetliner, these planes are required by the US military to allow the president to essentially run the country—or a war—from the air, with classified communication technologies, expensive sensors and defense equipment. \nIn his tweet, Trump claimed that the plane would cost more than $4 billion. An Air Force spokesperson told Quartz that the service is working with Boeing to identify the final cost of the program, and has budgeted $2.7 billion for the two to three aircraft, “but expect this number to change as the program matures with the completion of the risk reduction activities.” A 2016 analysis of the program by the government’s auditors estimated the total cost at $3.2 billion. \nA Boeing spokesperson said Congress will need to appropriate funds for the final contract to actually build the planes, noting that a standard 747-8, the model the presidential aircraft will be based on, has a list price of $379 million. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” the company said in a statement . \nBoeing, the largest aerospace company in the world and biggest exporter in the US, saw its stock fall, then rise again after Trump’s tweet. In 2013, Trump trumpeted his prowess at purchasing Boeing shares during a dip in the company’s fortunes. Boeing was not listed among his $38 million in stock holdings on Trump’s federal disclosure forms in May. A spokesman for the president-elect said Trump sold all of his public company stock in June, but provided no details, so it isn’t known when—or if—Trump sold his Boeing position. The June sales presumably don’t include positions held by his children, who remain official advisers to his presidential transition team. \nAsked by reporters where Trump had gotten his information about the cost of the new planes, Trump’s spokespeople declined to say, but noted that when you add up the costs “it’s a pretty big number,” and that the president-elect will “look to try to save taxpayer money.” \nThe reason for Trump’s outburst isn’t clear; the Boeing contract was awarded in January 2015. As Trump tweeted, the Washington Post broke news about a Pentagon report identifying $125 billion in unnecessary spending. The Post said that the report was quashed by Defense officials. \nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg did express his worries about the future of US trade policy in remarks on Dec. 2 at the Illinois Manufacturers Association, which were covered today in a Chicago Tribune story published shortly before Trump’s tweet. \n“Now that the campaign is over, I hope we can work together to make sure the United States continues to play a leading role in shaping the global economy through trade agreements,” Muilenburg said . “[If] we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us. For Boeing, that could result in higher costs, disrupted supply chains and regulations that diminish our ability to sell products around the world.” \nExports make up a huge portion of Boeing’s business, according to Aviation Week , with 5,500 of 7,522 jets built by Boeing between 2000 and 2015 heading to overseas customers. Many are sold in China, the target of much of Trump’s trade ire. Any backlash could be painful for Boeing and its stakeholders. \nThe president-elect may want the contract cancelled, but it will be difficult for the US government to find a different vendor. Air Force officials insist that the plane have four engines for extra reliability; the only two companies who make four-engine jet airliners are Boeing and the European champion, Airbus, which is based in a suburb of Toulouse, France. \nAfter handing out tax breaks to keep just 800 jobs in Indiana, it’s hard to imagine the Trump team sending jobs—and a massive symbol of national pride—to France.

      "text": "SHARES Albin Lohr-Jones| Pool | Bloomberg U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media in the lobby at Trump Tower in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. \nDonald Trump claimed Wednesday that he did not see an article in which Boeing 's CEO criticized his trade agenda before sending a surprise tweet that hit the aerospace giant's stock. \nIn the Chicago Tribune column published Tuesday morning , Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg expressed concerns about resistance to trade, which is partly driven by Trump repeatedly slamming the Trans-Pacific Partnership and North American Free Trade Agreement. Shortly after , Trump threatened on Twitter to \"cancel\" Boeing's contract for new Air Force One jets, arguing that an unconfirmed $4 billion cost was too high for the project. \nTrump has often tweeted in response to news reports in the past, leading to speculation that he had seen the Tribune article. He denied that Wednesday in an interview with NBC's \"Today.\" \n\"I didn't seen an article where he was critical of trade policies,\" Trump said. \nBoeing fell nearly 2 percent at its lows Tuesday in response to Trump's tweet. It eventually recovered to finish near the flat line Tuesday and traded 0.5 percent higher Wednesday.",

      "text": "22 minutes ago So Airbus bilked at the idea of having to build 3~4 aircraft in the US leaving Boeing as the only company capable of building an airplane of the size and specs need to replace the 2 VC-25s. The planes need to be EMP hardened, have a fully operational surgical suite, house defense systems, and have redundant everything including a full 2 way communication suite that can work over the ocean.Boeing should just keep raising the price of everything every time Trump opens his mouth outside of ULA with SpaceX and the ilk Boeing is not being challenged anywhere. Thanks to buying Mcdonnell Douglas and Lockheed giving up after the L1011 who is going to challenge Boeing domestically in the large aircraft market? Let him try to hit them with the Import-Export bank, try to go full Jackson and get the full JacksonThe CRJs and EMBs are starting to push into the lower end of the 737/A318 market but the chance they decided to build a US based factor and turn out jumbos is about the same as that really being a hot women that wants to bang you on the other side of that chat ad",

      "title": "Trump’s Boeing Tweet is — Surprise — Completely Wrong",
      "text": "  \nDonald Trump blurted out another wildly inaccurate tweet on Tuesday morning, claiming that Boeing is $4 billion over budget on building two new Air Force Ones. He demanded that the whole thing be canceled. The Washington Post points out all of the falsehoods in that claim. First, the tweet: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \nAnd Glenn Kessler’s fact checking : \nCost have actually not been set. The Defense Department’s five-year plan indicates a cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years for design and development. It’s logical to assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and procure the aircraft. \nSo an estimate of $4 billion — for design, testing and manufacture of at least two jets — is not completely out of line. But the budget is subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the aircraft. Boeing literally needs to re-engineer the plane from the ground up, so there are many one-time expenses. \nAir Force One needs to be designed to survive a nuclear war. It requires all sorts of undisclosed security upgrades and countermeasures. It can refuel in flight. The actual cost of the plane will depend on the equipment that goes into it. There also needs to be extensive testing, probably lasting two years, before the plane is deemed ready for presidential travel. \n“Cancel the order!” \nNothing has been ordered yet. But the program could be eliminated. This may not be a problem for Trump, but certainly would affect his successors, especially if no order is placed before Boeing stops making 747s. The current aircraft were delivered in 1990, and as we noted, the life cycle is about 30 years. The Pentagon says the current fleet “faces capability gaps, rising maintenance costs, and parts obsolescence as it reaches the end of its planned 30-year life-cycle.” \nTodd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said “the program is very new and hardly had a chance to get started yet.” So, in effect, there are no real cost overruns yet. He added that the estimated $4 billion cost is reasonable given the requirements of the project. \nMaybe he just wants to keep using his gold-plated plane instead of the Air Force’s plane, which is far less safe and far more open to being shot down. Feature? Bug? I’ll leave that up to you to decide.",

      "text": "Karl Rove scolds Trump over Boeing comments By Mark Hensch - 12/07/16 01:09 PM EST 1 \nGOP strategist Karl Rove is criticizing President-elect Donald Trump \n“He said something that was not accurate that had a negative impact on that stock, namely that there was a $4 billion contract,” Rove told Fox News’s Bill Hemmer on “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT \n\"There is no contract for $4 billion, there’s a contract for $170 million. There is no $4 billion contract,\" he continued. \"The impulse — that we want to save the taxpayers money — that’s admirable. But this was fire, ready, aim in my opinion.” \nRove said Trump's actions also hurt Boeing stockholders. \n“What he did yesterday was he de-stabled the stock of a major American company,” he said. \"That stock is held by millions of Americans.\" \n“Now, it’s not just a bunch of executives in Chicago or a bunch of management types sitting in Charlotte, N.C., or Seattle, Wash., where they have their management facilities,” Rove added of Boeing. \n“[It’s held by] pension funds, by university endowments, by ordinary people who’ve invested in Boeing. There’s one elemental thing a president ought to keep in mind, which is the power of his words, and therefore, the accuracy of his words.” \nTrump on Tuesday ripped Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One plane, calling for the contract to be canceled. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future president, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” he tweeted. \"Cancel order!” \nBoeing responded by insisting its contract is actually for $170 million, far less than Trump claimed. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,” it said in a statement. \nThe Pentagon announced in January that Boeing had won a contract to replace the current Air Force One planes. \nThe initial contract was worth just $25.8 million, but the Air Force planned on spending as much as $1.65 billion on the project, according to Reuters. 1 day 1 Denzel Washington blasts media for...

      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his direct interventions with companies, including making statements on Twitter, saying businesses will benefit from his actions and his upcoming term in office. One day after criticizing one of Boeing Co's high-profile projects in a tweet, Trump told NBC that he anticipated \"tremendous\" economic growth under his administration but reiterated his warning that companies shifting U.S. jobs overseas would have to pay.\nStill, markets and companies should not worry, he said.\n\"I don't know ... how people are unnerved,\" Trump told NBC's \"Today\" program. \"It's just the opposite. Frankly, I think we're going to go up.\"\nThe New York businessman, who has never held public office, begins his term on Jan. 20.\nTrump also said he had sold his stocks in June to avoid any conflict-of-interest with the presidency.\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I'm making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\" he said.\nHis comments followed a series of actions targeting specific companies, including a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in the United States. On Tuesday, he criticized Boeing in a tweet that dented its shares, and he won pledges from two of Asia's biggest technology companies to expand their U.S. investments. [L1N1E11W9]\nOn Boeing, Trump complained about costs for its revamped Air Force One plane, a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency, and urged the government to cancel its order. [L1N1E110N]\nThe move was the latest example of Trump's using his podium, often via Twitter, to rattle companies and foreign countries.\nTrump told NBC that he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg spoke on Tuesday. \"We're going to work it out,\" Trump said. \"That's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices.\"\nHe also cautioned U.S. businesses against offshoring jobs.\n\"If they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country, and sell their product into our country, they're going to be paying a tax,\" he told NBC.\nEarlier this month, Trump lauded a deal with United Technologies Corp's Carrier to keep some U.S. positions in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks following a Thanksgiving Day tweet on the negotiations.\nTrump also defended his Twitter posts, telling NBC he used the social media platform to \"talk about important things\" and that it conveyed his message \"much faster than a press release.\"\n\n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",

      "text": "Dec 6, 2016 21:29:02 GMT -5 tallguy said: According to a Seattle newspaper: A prominent conservative Republican opinion expert, Frank Luntz, used his own tweet to set Trump straight on the facts.\"The actual number is $1.65 billion to build two new Air Force One aircraft ($825 million each),\" wrote Luntz. \"Not $4 billion.\"Why would Trump take a shot at Boeing? Ninety percent of its 151,000-person workforce is U.S. based, along with 80 percent of its suppliers. The company is in major competition with its European rival Aribus.Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO, stressed the importance of exports, and the Chinese market, in a speech to the Illinois Manufacturers Association last week. Trump has blasted China's trade practices.\"I'm not a political pundit or prognosticator -- we have too many of those -- but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" said Muilenburg.The Boeing boss noted that a \"large and growing percentage of our business\" comes from international sales including orders from China. The president of China visited Boeing's Everett plant on a 2015 trip to the Seattle area.\"Last year, we delivered 495 737's from our factory in Renton, Washington, to customers around the world,\" said Muilenburg. \"One in every three of those 737's were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries . . . were bound for Chinese customers. State lawmakers hit Trump for 'unsubstantiated' Air Force One tweet So, is this retaliation for Boeing executives speaking in favor of free and fair trade agreements that Trump has opposed? Considering his history...?And where it says the Chinese president visited the Boeing plant last year, that was his first stop. The factory where his plane was built. Speculation also is that if Trump continues to anger the Chinese government over Taiwan, that Airbus could end up being a major beneficiary of any retribution. Wonderful. as said....not only a sleeze but not my President and he hasn't even been sworn in yet... Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee. Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff, And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff.",

      "text": "Boeing expects business jet sales to recover in next two years Tue Dec 6, 2016 11:29am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Alexander Cornwell \nDUBAI (Reuters) - Boeing BA.N sees sales of its business jets rebounding over the next two years after a \"tough\" 2016, Boeing Business Jet President David Longridge said at a press conference in Dubai on Tuesday. \nBoeing Business Jets (BBJ), which sells variants of Boeing aircraft for the corporate jet market, blames a more than halving of sales this year on the uncertainty created by Britain's Brexit vote and U.S. Presidential election. \nIn 2016, Boeing has booked sales for three business jets, all narrow body aircraft, compared to 10 in 2015, including four wide-bodies, and 14 jets in 2014, BBJ Vice President Jeff Dunn told Reuters. \n\"Now the elections are over and Brexit is decided we're starting to see things pick up,\" Longridge said. \"I think over the next two years we'll go back to the kind of six to eight airplanes that we saw more regularly in the past four years,\" he said. \nBoeing has campaigns open for three to four business jets though is unlikely to close those deals before Dec. 31, Longridge said. He later told Reuters 2016 was likely to be the low point for BBJ in terms of sales since the 2009 global financial crisis. \nBoeing's business jet division, which competes with Airbus Corporate Jets AIR.PA, makes up a fraction of the company's total aircraft sales and deliveries. It delivered four dedicated models of narrow-body BBJ jets plus an unspecified number of wide-body jets for private customers in 2015, out of 762 total jetliner deliveries that year. \nLongridge on Tuesday announced Asia-Pacific-based Orient Global Aviation as the first customer of the recently announced BBJ 737 MAX 7 aircraft. \n(Additional reporting by Tim Hepher.

Frankly, I think we're going to go up.\" \nThe New York businessman, who has never held public office, begins his term on Jan. 20. \nTrump also said he had sold his stocks in June to avoid any conflict-of-interest with the presidency. \n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I'm making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\" he said. \nHis comments followed a series of actions targeting specific companies, including a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in the United States. On Tuesday, he criticized Boeing in a tweet that dented its shares, and he won pledges from two of Asia's biggest technology companies to expand their U.S. investments. [L1N1E11W9] \nOn Boeing, Trump complained about costs for its revamped Air Force One plane, a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency, and urged the government to cancel its order.

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Andrea Shalal and Amy Tennery \nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control. \nIt was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. \nTrump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nBoeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement.

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nA day after Donald Trump criticized the cost of a planned Air Force One replacement, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sympathized with the president-elect Wednesday about the high cost of aircraft. \n“We have a great relationship with Boeing, but Donald Trump’s not the first person that’s complained about their prices, I can assure you that,” Parker said Wednesday morning on CNBC’s Squawk Box. \"I just viewed that as someone trying to save money for the U.S. government and negotiate a price, just like we do all the time.” \nOn Tuesday, Trump criticized plans to replace the two Boeing 747s currently used to transport the president with updated versions. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump said in a tweet. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nBoeing responded that it is currently only under contract for $170 million “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nParker didn’t say what a good price for the Air Force One program would be. \n“I honestly don’t know for all the security that’s built into that airplane what it should cost,” he said. \nHe also didn’t offer much insight into how he thinks the aviation industry will fare under Trump as president. \n“We’ll continue to do what’s right for our people and our customers and not worry about what anyone else thinks about it,” Parker said. “We know how to run our business. We have a fantastic team of people that does a great job taking care of our customers — we’ll just keep doing that.” \nParker was eager to talk about a recent investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, calling it “as good as any validation” that the airline industry has transformed from a consistent money loser into something a bit more stable. \n“You couldn't get long-term investors in the airline business when we weren’t sure we were going to be around for the long term,” Parker said. “As we’ve been saying for quite some time now, this is a whole new business.” \nParker also jabbed at rival Delta Air Lines over efforts to reform the country’s air traffic control system. \nAmerican and other major U.S. airlines have supported moving oversight of the system to a nonprofit organization that they argue would be able to more quickly and efficiently deploy next-generation technologies. \nBut Delta has been a holdout, arguing that needed fixes can be made without changing the governance structure. \n“I don’t know, they’re the only airline that doesn’t,” Parker said when asked about why Delta doesn’t support the proposed reforms.\" \nHe added: “I think there’s a competitive reason. I think they have one large hub in Atlanta that works really well and doesn’t have a lot of [air traffic control] delays. It’s to their benefit to keep the rest of us with some [air traffic control] delays.” Tags",

President-elect Donald Trump tweeted this morning that the government should cancel the order for the new Air Force One replacement from Boeing, citing the more than $4 billion price tag. U.S. President Barack Obama is traveling to Tampa, Florida and will deliver his final national security speech. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch - Pool/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. The president-elect said in a tweet early Tuesday that the new Boeing (BA) 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, he responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force Once contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles they want on the new Air Force One.” \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to give an estimated cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official. \nIn an official statement , Boeing that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones, which will replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. And airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige and revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build two new Air Force Ones. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 can travel an additional 1,000 miles without refueling, fly faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and get better fuel economy than the 747-200 that’s used for the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nIt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment.

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Travis Pittman, KING 9:27 PM. CST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump called into NBC’s “Today” show on Wednesday after being named Time magazine’s Person of the Year, and gave a surprisingly wide-ranging interview on his transition. Among other things, Trump doubled down on his day-old battle with Boeing after calling on the U.S. government to cancel a deal with the aircraft manufacturer to develop of the next generation of Air Force One.\n“I think the planes are too expensive,” Trump said. “That’s what I’m here for. We’re going to negotiate prices. The planes are too expensive, and we’re going to get the prices down. And if we don’t get the prices down, we’re not going to order them.”\nWATCH: @realdonaldtrump talks about his battle with #Boeing https://t.co/6Gf6XeDQN2\n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) December 7, 2016\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” the president-elect tweeted on Tuesday. “Cancel order!”\nIn a statement, Boeing said its current deal for Air Force One development is worth $170 million. An Air Force spokesman, Capt. Michael Hertzog, said the military was working with Boeing to control costs. And Reuters reported that U.S. budgeted costs for the program are $2.87 billion through 2012.\nShares of Boeing’s stock plummeting after Trump’s tweet, which came shortly after an article was published on the Chicago Tribune’s website Quote: d Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, being sharply critical of the president-elect’s trade policies.\nIn his interview with “Today,” Trump denied his attack on Boeing was retribution.\n“This was only about planes because I didn’t see an article where he was critical of trade policy,” Trump said. “My trade policies are going to be terrific.”\nTrump repeated his spokesman’s claim that he sold all of his stock holdings in June, five months before the presidential election.\n“I felt that I was very much going to be winning,” Trump said. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I’m making deals for this country.”\nWhile Trump said he’s “never been a big person for the stock market,” he once boasted about buying stock in Boeing. (“Boeing stock went way down because of 787,” he tweeted in 2013 . “So I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!”)\n“Why’d you sell all your holdings in June?” – @MLauer\n“I felt that I was very much going to be winning.” -Trump\nhttps://t.co/NUbRAiUmVA\n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) December 7, 2016\nOn the search for his secretary of state, Trump said Mitt Romney is still in the running and the delay in naming one is not, as some have speculated, a way of punishing the former Massachusetts governor. Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, was perhaps Trump’s fiercest GOP critic during the 2016 campaign.\n“It’s not about revenge,” Trump said. “It’s about what’s good for the country. And I’m able to put this stuff behind us.”\nTrump said he’s been consulting with President Obama on White House appointments.\n“I really like him as a person,” Trump said of Obama. “I take his recommendations very seriously.”\nTrump further addressed his compulsive use of social media, claiming he’s been more restrained on Twitter of late, despite his online feuds with everyone from the cast of “Hamilton” to “Saturday Night Live.”\n“I think I am very restrained, and I talk about important things,” he said. “It’s a modern day form of communication. I get it out much more faster than a press release. I get it out much more honestly than dealing with dishonest reporters.”\nTrump explained that his attacks against “SNL,” which he hosted last year, was because it’s “not a good show anymore.” Since the election, Trump has tweeted that the show is “unwatchable,” “not funny at all,” and part of the “media rigging election!”\n“The way the show is going now and you look at the kind of work they’re doing, who knows how long that show is going to be on? It’s a terrible show,” Trump told “Today.”\nWATCH: “I like Alec, but his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good.“ @realdonaldtrump on #SNL https://t.co/NEslxLZJuS\n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) December 7, 2016\nAlec Baldwin’s impersonation of Trump, in particular, has irked the president-elect.\n“I like Alec,” Trump said. “But his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good.”\nTrump called it “a great honor” to be chosen Time’s Person of the Year, but said the magazine’s decision to list him as the “President of the Divided States of America” on the cover was “snarky.”\n“I’m not president yet, so I didn’t do anything to divide,” he said.\nView photos",

      "text": "Close The Associated Press \nIn this Aug. 19, 2010 file photo, Dennis Muilenburg, then executive vice president of Boeing Co., and president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, speaks during a ceremony at MidAmerica Airport in Mascoutah, Ill. (Tim Vizer/Belleville News-Democrat via AP, File) Trump defends Boeing tweet, says companies shouldn't worry Reuters 4 hrs ago ( … ) \nIn this Aug. 19, 2010 file photo, Dennis Muilenburg, then executive vice president of Boeing Co., and president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, speaks during a ceremony at MidAmerica Airport in Mascoutah, Ill. (Tim Vizer/Belleville News-Democrat via AP, File) The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON • President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his direct interventions with companies, including making statements on Twitter, saying businesses will benefit from his actions and his upcoming term in office. \nOne day after criticizing one of Boeing Co.'s high-profile projects in a tweet, Trump told NBC that he anticipated \"tremendous\" economic growth under his administration but reiterated his warning that companies shifting U.S. jobs overseas would have to pay. \nStill, markets and companies should not worry, he said. \n\"I don't know ... how people are unnerved,\" Trump told NBC's \"Today\" program. \"It's just the opposite. Frankly, I think we're going to go up.\" \nThe New York businessman, who has never held public office, begins his term on Jan. 20. \nTrump also said he had sold his stocks in June to avoid any conflict-of-interest with the presidency. \n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I'm making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\" he said. \nHis comments followed a series of actions targeting specific companies, including a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in the United States. On Tuesday, he criticized Boeing in a tweet that dented its shares, and he won pledges from two of Asia's biggest technology companies to expand their U.S. investments. \nOn Boeing, Trump complained about costs for its revamped Air Force One plane, a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency, and urged the government to cancel its order. \nThe move was the latest example of Trump's using his podium, often via Twitter, to rattle companies and foreign countries. \nTrump told NBC that he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg spoke on Tuesday. \"We're going to work it out,\" Trump said. \"That's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices.\" \nHe also cautioned U.S. businesses against offshoring jobs. \n\"If they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country, and sell their product into our country, they're going to be paying a tax,\" he told NBC. \nEarlier this month, Trump lauded a deal with United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier to keep some U.S. positions in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks following a Thanksgiving Day tweet on the negotiations. \nTrump also defended his Twitter posts, telling NBC he used the social media platform to \"talk about important things\" and that it conveyed his message \"much faster than a press release.\"",

      "text": "Porto-Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport (OPO/LPPR) Investigating agency: Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) - Ireland Narrative: The aircraft was on a scheduled passenger flight from Lille Airport, France (LFQQ), to Porto Airport, Portugal (LPPR). After an uneventful flight, the aircraft commenced a non-precision approach to runway (RWY) 35 at LPPR. When the aircraft was established on the final approach, the Co-Pilot, who was Pilot Flying (PF), was distracted by a green laser light being shone towards the aircraft and raised his hand to protect his eyes. The Commander, who was Pilot Monitoring (PM), looked up and was struck in both eyes by the laser light. The Commanders vision became temporarily impaired. Due to the laser illumination, Flight Crew coordination was compromised, which led to the final descent being delayed and the approach becoming unstable. The Commander elected to carry out a missed approach. The aircraft subsequently landed on RWY 17 without further incident. There were no injuries. The Portuguese investigation board GPIAA reported that the number of reported laser attacks on aircraft in Portugal was as follows: - 2014, Total Events = 294 of which 107 occurred at LPPR - 2015, Total Events = 264 of which 105 occurred at LPPR In Portugal it was not an offence to shine a laser light or similar at an aircraft. Probable Cause Laser illumination of the aircraft cockpit area that caused temporary flashblindness to a flight crew member during a critical phase of flight. \nSources :",

      "text": "Boeing Chief Pledges To Work With New Administration After Trump Threatened To... Boeing Chief Pledges To Work With New Administration After Trump Threatened To Kill Air Force One Deal December 7, 2016 0 \nHours after Donald Trump promised to kill the Air Force One procurement program, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis A. Muilenburg spoke with the president-elect, promising to work with the new administration and to keep the costs of the program down, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. \nEarly on Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the costs of the program “are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Later he told reporters that he thought the cost was “ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe comments sent a shiver through the defense and aerospace industries, which had seen their stock prices soar after Trump’s election. Trump had pledged that he would rebuild the nation’s military and better equip troops with more ships, jets and weapons. But the tweet and the comments were signals that the companies that might benefit from that spending could just as easily be targets under the new administration. \nThe Washington Post had also just reported that the Pentagon buried an internal study that found $125 billion in bureaucratic waste for fear that Congress would slash its budget. And on Tuesday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump plans to carefully scrutinize the way the Pentagon spends money. \n“I think this really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,” he said. “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.” \nDuring their conversation, Muilenburg assured Trump that the company would work with Trump’s Pentagon on any requirement changes to the program in an effort to keep costs down. The call was confirmed by a second person, who was also not authorized to speak publicly about it. Trump himself confirmed the conversation during a Wednesday interview on the Today show. \nSo far, the Air Force has budgeted $2.7 billion for the Air Force One program, which includes two aircraft and is still in the development stages. That money is for research, development and testing – not manufacturing. Over the next few years, the Air Force expects “this number to change as the program matures with the completion of risk reduction activities,” it said in a statement. \nIn a statement, Boeing said it is only under contract for $170 million for work “to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft.” \nThe real cost could grow to $4 billion, according to an analysis by Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The aircraft are projected to be operational by the mid-2020s, officials said. \nThe planes, which go by the call sign “Air Force One” when the president is on board, cost so much because they can do so much, defense analysts said. They are able to safeguard the president in a crisis – even a nuclear attack, allowing him to direct the military from the air, speak with Cabinet members and communicate with the nation. The plane is able to be refueled while in flight, so that it can stay aloft for extended periods. And it has extensive radar and counterattack measures, officials said. Much of its capabilities are classified. \nIt is a “flying command post,” Harrison said. “In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe.” \nThe “capabilities of this plane were there for everyone to see on 9/11” when Bush was whisked aboard Air Force One and responded to the crisis from there, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group. \nIn their call, Muilenburg and Trump also discussed trade and China, the official said. Boeing sells a large percentage of its jets to foreign countries, including China. If Trump instituted a tariff on China, the country could retaliate by limiting the number of Boeing jets it buys, Aboulafia has said. \n(c) 2016, The Washington Post · Christian Davenport \n{ Matzav.com }",

      "text": "CHICAGO -- A day after sending Boeing Co. stocks down with a tweet about the cost of a new Air Force One order, President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he had spoken with the head of the company and would work out the matter or else forgo the purchases.\n\"We're going to get the prices down and if we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them,\" Trump said in a phone interview with NBC. \"We're going stick with what we have.\"\nTrump tweeted Tuesday that \"costs are out of control\" for planned 747s to serve future presidents' extensive security and cyber-communications needs, saying they were \"more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"\n\"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,\" Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City later.\nBoeing said in a statement Tuesday that it was \"currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\"\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" the company said.\nThe firm's share price fell as much as 1.5 percent before regular trading Tuesday. The shares rose less than 0.1 percent to $152.24 at the close in New York.\nExecutives of the company told officials on Trump's transition team that the cost of a new version of Air Force One could be lowered if the government agrees to reduce its requirements for the plane, people familiar with the discussions said.\nAsked Wednesday if his tweet was in response to a report that had been published a short time earlier, in which Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was Quote: d as criticizing Trump's trade rhetoric, Trump said he had not seen the article.\n Manufacturing Transportation",

      "title": "Boeing's new Air Force One hits turbulence, United States",
      "text": "WASHINGTON • The turbulence began on Tuesday morning with one of President-elect Donald Trump's signature tweets of wrath: a public jab at Boeing alleging that the cost of building a new generation of Air Force One planes had spiralled out of control.\nThat came an hour after Boeing's CEO was quoted questioning Mr Trump's stance on trade.\nIn the afternoon, Mr Trump directed his attention elsewhere, taking credit, in a surprise announcement, for a Japanese conglomerate's months-old pledge to invest US$50 billion (S$71 billion) in the US.\nThis followed his assertion last week that he had saved 1,100 jobs in Indiana through a deal with air-conditioning company Carrier. The agreement includes US$7 million in state incentives for the company.\nIn the raucous hours in between, a top Trump aide announced offhandedly that, months before, Mr Trump had sold his entire stock portfolio, which some ethics advisers had worried could raise questions about conflicts of interest during his presidency.\nIt was a day of big pronouncements and few details, leaving many wondering whether this would be the unusual and unpredictable way that Mr Trump will govern the United States when he takes office next month.\nThat style, including his opaque personal financial dealings and his sudden shots at certain companies, has helped unnerve a corporate America that craves stability. Some business leaders and economists have worried whether executives can speak their minds about him or his policies without fear of provoking his rage.\n\"Twisting people's arms is inherently problematic\" for a president, said Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under president George W. Bush.\n\"The president has so much power, you always wonder if there's some implicit threat to individuals, and that goes beyond what I think a limited government should do,\" Professor Mankiw said.\nBut some defended Mr Trump's highly visible way of doing business in his transition to the Oval Office.\nMr Lanhee Chen, policy director of Mr Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, who is now at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said he was not terribly concerned by Mr Trump's interactions with individual corporations and chief executives.\n\"I just assume this is what generally happens,\" Mr Chen said. \"I don't think it is that unusual for a president to make appeals to specific companies. What may be unusual is the public nature of the communications,\" he said.\nMr Trump has for months targeted companies that, like his own, have shipped jobs overseas. In a string of early-morning tweets on Sunday, he threatened \"retribution or consequence\" for companies that move operations out of the country, as well as a 35 per cent tariff on goods sold back to the US.\nMr Trump's Boeing slam, though, was something new. The contract for the two planes was to be about US$3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion. Cancel order!\" Mr Trump tweeted.\nIn January, the US Air Force awarded Boeing a preliminary contract worth US$25.8 million, Reuters reported. In a statement on Tuesday, the Air Force said it had budgeted US$2.9 billion for research, development, testing and evaluation for the project in 2017, Fortune.com said.\nMr Trump's tweets came roughly an hour after the publication of a Chicago Tribune column citing Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg's suggestion that Mr Trump and Congress \"back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric\".\nTrump spokesmen did not explain why he had targeted Boeing.\nWASHINGTON POST\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on December 08, 2016, with the headline 'Boeing's new Air Force One hits turbulence'.

      "text": "WASHINGTON • The president of the United States has two specially equipped Boeing 747-200s jets that are each known as Air Force One when the president is on board.\nBoth aircraft went into service in 1990 and have a 30-year lifespan. Earlier this year, Boeing received a US$170 million (S$241 million) contract to design a replacement for the ageing pair of Air Force Ones, according to The Washington Post. The US Defence Department's five-year plan indicates a cost of US$2.9 billion over the next five years for design and development.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the price could be more than US$4 billion when finished, which he regarded as too much.\nMr Trump owns a Boeing 757-200 private jet, which he calls Trump Force One. He bought it in 2010 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\nSo what's so special about Air Force One?\n$241m \nContract received by Boeing earlier this year to design a replacement for the ageing pair of Air Force Ones.\n$4.1b \nCost of the US Defence Department's five-year plan over the next five years for design and development.\n•It can refuel mid-air, meaning it has unlimited range and does not need refuelling stops, according to the White House.\n•Onboard electronics have been hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, for example from a nuclear blast.\n•Both planes are equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the US. The president can run the country and a war from the air, like a mobile White House.\n•Inside the plane, there is 373 sq m of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president that features a large office, a toilet and a conference room, the White House says.\n•Air Force One also has a medical suite that can function as an operating theatre, and a doctor is permanently on board. The plane's two food galleys can feed 100 people at a time.\n•The plane's defence capabilities are secret, but it is reported to be capable of repelling missiles and to have a special electronic defence system that can jam enemy radars.\nBy contrast, Mr Trump's plane, which seats 43 people, has gold- plated fittings, a movie theatre, a bedroom and a conference room.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on December 08, 2016, with the headline 'Air Force One: A flying White House'.

President-elect Donald Trump, who has for years flown in a jet bearing his name, appeared to want to cancel a pending ... more Photo: AL DRAGO, STF Trump 'not the first' to complain of Boeing prices, American Airlines CEO says 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A day after Donald Trump criticized the cost of a planned Air Force One replacement, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sympathized with the president-elect Wednesday about the high cost of aircraft.\n\"We have a great relationship with Boeing, but Donald Trump's not the first person that's complained about their prices, I can assure you that,\" Parker said Wednesday morning on CNBC's Squawk Box. \"I just viewed that as someone trying to save money for the U.S. government and negotiate a price, just like we do all the time.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump criticized plans to replace the two Boeing 747s currently used to transport the president with updated versions.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said in a tweet.\nBoeing responded that it is currently only under contract for $170 million \"to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\"\nParker didn't say what a good price for the Air Force One program would be.\n\"I honestly don't know for all the security that's built into that airplane what it should cost,\" he said.\nHe also didn't offer much insight into how he thinks the aviation industry will fare under Trump as president.\n\"We'll continue to do what's right for our people and our customers and not worry about what anyone else thinks about it,\" Parker said. \"We know how to run our business. We have a fantastic team of people that does a great job taking care of our customers — we'll just keep doing that.\"\nParker was eager to talk about a recent investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, calling it \"as good as any validation\" that the airline industry has transformed from a consistent money loser into something a bit more stable.\n\"You couldn't get long-term investors in the airline business when we weren't sure we were going to be around for the long term,\" Parker said. \"As we've been saying for quite some time now, this is a whole new business.\"\nParker also jabbed at rival Delta Air Lines over efforts to reform the country's air traffic control system.\nAmerican and other major U.S. airlines have supported moving oversight of the system to a nonprofit organization that they argue would be able to more quickly and efficiently deploy next-generation technologies.\nBut Delta has been a holdout, arguing that needed fixes can be made without changing the governance structure.\n\"I don't know, they're the only airline that doesn't,\" Parker said when asked about why Delta doesn't support the proposed reforms.\"\nHe added: \"I think there's a competitive reason. I think they have one large hub in Atlanta that works really well and doesn't have a lot of [air traffic control] delays. It's to their benefit to keep the rest of us with some [air traffic control] delays.\"",

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Travis Pittman, KING 10:27 PM. EST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",
