      "text": "Richard Hartley-Parkinson for Metro.co.uk Monday 5 Dec 2016 8:43 am Father-of-two Ion Calin, 42, Marian Olteanu, 35, were both killed in the crash (Picture: PA) \nA lorry driver has been jailed for six years after his HGV ploughed into the back of a line of traffic, killing two men, while he was sending Facebook messages to his girlfriend on his phone for at least 20 seconds prior to the crash. \nSouthampton Crown Court heard that 49-year-old Keith Mees had been reading or sending messages just four seconds before the accident on the M271 in Southampton on December 1 last year in which Marian Olteanu, 35, and 42-year-old Ion Calin, both from Romania, died. Train driver calmly tells passengers about 'man wielding a knife at tube station' \nSimon Jones, prosecuting, said that Mees, who did not have a hands-free kit in the cab, had just completed a phone call to his girlfriend while driving of 13 minutes and 54 seconds just two-and-a-half minutes before the accident, with another two-minute call made earlier in the trip. \nHe also streamed YouTube music videos on his phone during his journey. \nThe court heard that the phone calls involved the defendant ending a relationship with his current girlfriend to return to his previous long-term partner who he was still living with. Their car was completely crushed in the crash (Picture: PA) \nSentencing him, Judge Nicholas Rowland said: ‘You were going through some kind of turmoil in your private life which you were sorting out while you were on the road when you should have been concentrating on the safety of other people on the road.’ \nMr Jones described how the Ford Mondeo, being driven by Mr Olteanu with Mr Calin, a father-of-two, as a front seat passenger, was crushed between Mees’ lorry and another HGV in front which was shunted into a third lorry. Save Llandudno Action Group forced to change its name \nMees, who had only recently gained his HGV licence, told a bystander when he was informed that the two men had died: ‘For f***’s sake, I have only had my licence for a couple of weeks.’ \nMr Jones said: ‘The sole causation of the collision pointed to the defendant being significantly distracted over the final 20 seconds before the impact took place, and as a consequence failing to respond to the fact that all of the traffic was either in the process of slowing down or stationary due to the tailback. Ion Calin with his wife Veronica and their sons David, 12 and James eight (Picture: PA) Marian Olteanu, 35, also lost his life (Picture: PA) \n‘The defendant failed to comprehend the situation due to the fact he chose to use his mobile phone and was reading or composing a message in those critical seconds before the crash.’ \nThe court heard that Mees, of Pringle Farm Road, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and a third charge of causing serious injury to the driver of one of the other lorries by dangerous driving. Tomorrow's tube strike has been cancelled (but there might still be travel disruption) \nHe was previously banned from driving for three years in 1998 for drink-driving. \nJason Taylor, defending, said that Mees had earlier this week attended the funeral of his ex-wife who died after being recently diagnosed with a brain tumour. \nHe added: ‘This is a man who is truly remorseful, he has high level of victim empathy and is struggling to come to terms that he has caused the deaths of those two people and caused serious injury as well.’ \nMees was also banned from driving for seven years, to be extended for three years. He had also been streaming YouTube music videos on his phone during his journey (Picture: PA) Keith Mees was jailed for six years (Picture: Solent) More ",

      "text": "Larry Jefferson is the first black Santa Claus hired by the Mall of America in Minnesota. (Facebook/ Dallas Texas Santa )\nLarry Jefferson was the first ever black Santa Claus hired by the Mall of America in Minnesota . While that should be a cause for celebration, there have unfortunately been countless racist remarks online because of the decision by the mall’s Santa Experience. \nJefferson only signed a four-day contract to work at the mall, since he is based in Texas. However, it was the first time since the mall opened in 1992 that it had a black Santa. \nJefferson calls himself the Dallas Texas Santa , a “Santa for All” and is the only black member of the Lone Star Santas . \nHere’s a look at Jefferson’s life and career.\n1. The Star-Tribune Had to Close the Comment Section on Its Profile of Jefferson Because of Racist Comments (Facebook/ Dallas Texas Santa )\nLast week, media outlets in Minneapolis began publishing profiles of Jefferson, including WCCO and The Star-Tribune . Stories like these were meant to help celebrate the first time the 24-year-old Mall of America, the largest in the country, hired a black Santa. \nHowever, the comment sections of both stories began to fill up with offensive messages. “Stupid. Incredibly stupid. Santa is WHITE. BOYCOTT Mall of America. Maybe they should change their name to MALL of RAGHEAD LAND,” one person wrote on the WCCO profile, notes RawStory . \nThe messages got so offensive that the comment sections were closed. “Looks like we had to turn comments off on story about Mall of America’s first black Santa. Merry Christmas everyone,” Star-Tribune editor Scott Gillespie wrote on Twitter . \nMichelle Herren: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Dr. Michelle Herren has lost her position at the University of Colorado for calling Michelle Obama 'monkey face' on Facebook.\nClick here to read more 2. The Mall of America’s Santa Experience Found Jefferson at a Santa Convention, Where He Was the Only Black Santa \nWhen Landon Luther, who co-owns the Santa Experience , was trying to find a diverse Santa for the Mall of America, he went to a Santa Claus convention in Branson, Missouri in July. Of the 1,000 Santas there, Jefferson was the only black Santa. \n“This is a long time coming,” Luther told the Star-Tribune . “We want Santa to be for everyone, period.”\n“We had close to a 1,000 Santas there, and I was the only Santa of color,” Jefferson told WCCO . \nBeverly Whaling: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Beverly Whaling was the mayor of Clay, West Virginia and has come under scrutiny for agreeing with a friend who called Michelle Obama an 'ape in heels.'\nClick here to read more 3. Jefferson Was a Member of the U.S. Army Reserve for 25 Years \nAccording to his website , Jefferson is a veteran. He retired from the U.S. Army in February 2015 and was a member of the Army Reserve for 25 years. He even served in the Gulf War.\nHe is also a professionally trained Santa, attending Santa University in Denver. He also has a B.A. in Sociology from Henderson State University . \nCan I Call Santa Claus On the Phone? What’s His Number for 2016? What is Santa Claus' phone number? Can I call him for free?

Jefferson Has Been Playing Santa Since He Was 12 Years Old & Began Playing Santa Professionally in 1999 \nJefferson has loved playing Santa for most of his life. After his father hurt his back, he began playing Santa for his family in Arkansas when he was only 12 years old, the Star-Tribune notes . \nHe continued playing Santa for his family, buying a $30 suit to cheer up his nephews when they were sick. He decided to “go pro” in 1999 and has been doing it ever since. \n“It’s no big deal, I’m still Santa, I just happen to be a Santa of Color,” Jefferson told WCCO . \n‘Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town’ 2016: What Time Does the ABC Special Air?

Jefferson Says That Parents are the Only Ones Who Mention His Race & Children Don’t Notice \nJefferson told the North Dallas Gazette in November 2015 that most children he has encountered never mention the color of his skin. It’s only the parents who see that he is black. \nBlack Santas are a rarity. Jefferson is the only black member of the Lone Star Santas , a non-profit group in Texas made up of men and women who dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus to cheer up children throughout the state. \nJefferson told the Washington Post that there was a recent incident where a child told him that he didn’t know Santa was brown. \n“I said, ‘Yes, I am brown… And Santa comes in many different colors,'” Jefferson recalled. “It’s always so genuine. Kids are going to speak their mind at a young age.”\nJefferson told WCCO that it is important for children of color to see a Santa who looks like them. “It gives them something to identity with, but Santa is still just Santa,” he said. \nWhat Is Santa Claus’ Address at the North Pole?

(AP) - Police in one Pennsylvania town have sent an armed robbery suspect a message on Facebook, and it's not because they want to be friends. \nBridgeville police say 32-year-old Robert Watkins III has been identified as the suspect in the Thanksgiving Day robbery of a Gulf station. \nThe police post, which includes the message, \"It's only a matter of time before we find you\" shows several pictures of Watkins, and says he's been identified through surveillance video at the scene. \nThe police believe Watkins may be headed to his hometown of Meadville, about 100 miles north of Bridgeville, in western Pennsylvania. \nOnline court records show police were still looking for Watkins on Monday on an arrest warrant for robbery and other charges.

Post to Facebook The 5 biggest turning moments for struggling teams This is what went wrong.  //usat.ly/2h89czg   Join the Nation's Conversation   The 5 biggest turning moments for struggling teams Andrew Joseph 5:01 p.m. EST December 5, 2016 \nDwight Howard and Carson Wentz (Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \nWhen teams are struggling, it's just practical to look for answers. After all, if you can pinpoint the moment where everything went wrong, there's a chance that it can be corrected. \nLuckily for these five struggling teams, we've saved them the trouble. 5. Dwight Howard's ejection against the Hornets \nThe Hawks entered their game against the Hornets on Nov. 18 tied for the best record in the Eastern Conference at 9-2. They had won six straight games, and the Dwight Howard experiment appeared to be an extraordinary success for the Hawks. They had wins against the Cavaliers, Bulls and Rockets and looked like real contenders in the East. Everything changed when Howard drew a Flagrant 2 foul with the Hawks up 89-86 in the fourth quarter. Atlanta lost that game and has unravelled to a 10-11 record, losing the past two games by a combined 80 points. Is this bad? pic.twitter.com/RBD0hKEDPe — Andrew Joseph (@AndyJ0seph) December 5, 2016 4. Carson Wentz killed a deer during the bye week What do you do on your bye week? You get your first bow buck! Thanks @DougBurgum for the help!!! #ndlegendary #Sitka pic.twitter.com/QQQCN6TL70 — Carson Wentz (@cj_wentz) September 29, 2016 \nThe Eagles were riding high at 3-0 heading into the bye week, and Carson Wentz looked like a future superstar at quarterback. Then , he went out and hunted a deer. Sure, Wentz has every right to go hunting at his leisure, but since that fateful afternoon, the Eagles are 2-7. Wentz has thrown 11 interceptions to 7 touchdown passes in that span. He had no interceptions through his first three games and five touchdowns. The deer must've cursed them. 3. Cam Newton throwing the \"12\" flag \nCam Newton angered quite a few Seahawks fans and players when he grabbed and threw a \"12\" flag after Carolina's divisional round win over Seattle. The Panthers went to the Super Bowl (where they lost), but since then, they've been terribly disappointing in 2016 and even benched Newton over a necktie. Richard Sherman called the Panthers' poor season karmic payback for the 12 flag incident, and you know - he might be right. 2. J.R. Smith giving Jason Terry a high-five instead of playing defense \nI really don't want to say anything bad about J.R. Smith here . When he gave Jason Terry a high-five on the Buck's bench instead of playing defense, it instantaneously became a top-10 J.R. Smith moment. The Cavaliers haven't won a game since that happened, though. This is why we can't have nice things. 1. When Jeff Fisher waited two years to diss Bruce Arians \nJeff Fisher took a swipe at Bruce Arians TWO YEARS after Arians' \"Always 8-8\" comments. The Rams were 3-1 at the time. They have won just once in the eight games since that comment. Wait, 3-1? There's the explanation. Never be 3-1 . Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2h89czg Most Popular",

      "text": "December 5 at 6:12 PM Follow @ErikWemple Chavelo Borden, an inmate at Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York, gave the New York Times a memorable Quote: about how correctional officers view black inmates. “They don’t see us with pristine eyes,” he said. He also commented that black inmates were viewed as if “we’re another species.”\nSuch quips helped the New York Times to frame a Sunday front-page story on the persistence of racial bias in New York state correctional facilities, a story that managed to bridge punitive policies in the state prisons and broader cultural, racial and demographic issues across the vast state. “The largely white work force comes from places in northern, western and central New York like Elmira, Malone, Rome and Utica,” write Michael Schwirtz, Michael Winerip and Robert Gebeloff in the story. “These are some of the state’s poorer and less diverse communities, where, even as far north as the Canadian border, a Confederate flag can be spotted on the back of a pickup truck or hanging from a front porch. Inmates refer to some of the big maximum-security facilities as ‘family prisons,’ where members of the same family have worked for generations. In these communities, prisons are often seen as political spoils, fiercely protected by upstate politicians for the jobs they provide.”\nThe upshot? Black inmates were 30 percent more likely to draw a “disciplinary ticket” than white inmates and 65 percent more likely to make a trip to 23-hours-per-day solitary confinement.\nBehind those numbers is a great deal of storytelling, though the New York Times had limits on how it could express the anecdotage. As Winerip tells the Erik Wemple Blog, there are two ways to interview inmates in the New York state system: One is to arrange an interview through the system’s PR arm. At such interviews, reporters can come equipped with all their favorite recording devices. Bummer is that inmates tend to say only so much in front of prison officials. The other approach is to meet up in visiting rooms, though reporters cannot carry in their tools of the trade. In certain visiting rooms, facilities may have pencils and paper so that the inmates can keep score in card games and the like — those are helpful. But such situations are “rare,” says Winerip.\nMemory becomes important: Winerip says he and Schwirz would hold long interviews in visiting rooms, and then rush outside to write down everything they could remember, a relationship that many restaurant critics have with bathrooms. It’s why the inmates in this remarkable investigative project come off as terse Quote: -meisters. In describing an affinity between white inmates and white correctional officers — which may help explain why famous white escapees Richard W. Matt and David Sweat got help from prison employees — Green Haven Correctional Facility inmate Markus Barber cited a “complexion for the connection.” Who would need an iPhone to remember that one? “Rhymes are easier to remember,” notes Winerip.\nGetting to the locations yielded important details. At the visiting room in Clinton Correctional Facility, guards had hung a sign saying, “All Lives Matter.”\nThe trio of New York Times reporters started on the project in April 2015, though they’ve been deployed on other stuff as well. In reaching their conclusions, they analyzed nearly 60,000 disciplinary cases that they secured through the state’s Freedom of Information Law. The state did things with the records requests that thwarted accountability, most notably by redacting the names of the correctional officers involved in the clashes that took place inside prison walls. It didn’t redact the names of the inmates.\nSo the New York Times reporters often went directly to the inmates and asked them for their copies of the reports. In a story about race, it helps to be able to identify key actors by race, a task that’s not easy when the records don’t even indicate the names of the corrections officers. Yet the New York Times report carried a painstaking level of detail on this front. For instance, the newspaper reported that seven white guards corralled inmate Darius Horton at Groveland Correctional Facility, after a run-in over a bowl of hot water that the inmate had microwaved for coffee (he has since been released). “Two of the officers had minor injuries; the other five were unharmed. Mr. Horton was sentenced to 270 days in isolation,” notes the New York Times story. The reporters used other sources, the officers’ Facebook accounts, the database-heavy website See Through NY and other means to nail down the racial dynamics.\nAfter spending some time with a massive trail of disciplinary records, Winerip and Co. started to notice a pattern or two that shaped this investigative project. Considering that the reports are written by officers, it’s hard to tell when there may be an incident of wrongdoing. Yet: “When it’s six on one and none of the officers are injured and an inmate has a broken arm or has to be seen in the clinic, you start to notice,” says Winerip. That’s when you pay a visit and get ready to memorize an inmate’s every word.",

      "text": "GATLINBURG, Ohio (WDTN) – The bodies of two girls who died trying to escape the Tennessee wildfires have been officially identified along with their mother.\nOn Saturday, the world along with the Reed family learned that Constance and her daughters Chloe and Lily did not make it out of the Smokey Mountains alive after wild fires destroyed their home.\nMonday, The Reed family told 2 NEWS they were given the devastating news just moments before Saturday’s press conference.\nA grief-stricken Michael Reed posted on Facebook a heartfelt message to his wife and kids Monday morning.\nCourtesy the Reed family Reed’s father, Grant Reed, lives in Centerville. We asked the elder Reed how does a family cope with such a tragic loss he said, “You don’t surround yourself with each other, you draw strength from each other, but we’ll never get over this…He certainly will never get over this.”\nThe heartbroken grandfather said the family is now in limbo and are uncertain when he and his wife will return to Miami Valley. They’re still trying to cope with the loss of Constance, Chloe and Lily.\n“Family has to be strong for him, family has to be there to support him to help him go through the acceptance,” the elder Reed said. “You can’t close up in a cocoon and live in depression he’s got to get out and live with a purpose so we’ll help him find that purpose.”\nA GoFundMe account has been set up for the family.",

      "text": "How to play Instant Games on your Facebook Messenger By 0 \nAs we’ve continually said, Facebook seems bent on making people not want to leave their Messenger app. They’ve added a lot of new features like chatbots, Instant Articles, Group Calling, shopping options, plus more messaging add-ons like emoticons, stickers, animations, and mini-games. They have brought it one step further when they announced earlier this week that they’re letting users play Instant Games now on the messaging app. Starting a game is actually pretty easy (the rest of it is of course up to you). \nThe first step is of course to update your Messenger to the latest version through the Google Play page. Once you’re on the updated version, start a new chat with one of your contacts. You can either tell the person in advance you want to play a game or just surprise them. In the feature strip, you’ll see a game controller icon next to the GIF button, which of course means you have to tap it to start. \nA list of the available games will appear. This includes popular games like Words With Friends, PacMan, Galaga, Everwing, Space Invaders, and many more. Press Play Now on the game that you want to use and then start actually playing it. Once your turn is done, your contact will be asked to challenge your score and so it’s their turn to play. You will also be able to search for games in the Messenger search field or through your Facebook News Feed. \nThe most important thing to know by now is that this has rolled out to 30 countries initially, including the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Singapore, and other countries in Europe and Asia. They will probably expand it even more soon, so if your country isn’t included yet, then be content with playing hoops and football on your Messenger for now. TAGS",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nRyan Lochte and his fiancée had one of the weirdest meet-cutes imaginable. \nIt’s been an odd year for the Olympic swimmer . After evading a band of made-up Brazilian gangsters after taking home a bunch of medals at this past year’s Rio games, the 32-year-old headed back to America and proceeded to get engaged to a former Playboy model, Kayla Rae Reid . \nWhat makes their story interesting is that they met the same way I’ve met 85 percent of the women I’ve talked to in the past 15 months… through Tinder. \nYup, supposedly Tinder in certain areas is just full of Olympic athletes and Playboy models. \nLochte recalls how after swiping with the future Mrs. Him, he ran into her at a bar. The soon-to-be couple instantly recognized one another, he told Cosmo, \nWe did that double-take, like, ‘Oh, my gosh, it’s you,’ and then we reached out and grabbed each other’s hands. \nOK, OK, OK, let’s take a break for a second. Who does that?!?! \nWho sees someone they recognize and automatically goes for their hands? I feel like Mother Teresa and hand doctors are the only ones that is an acceptable move for. \nAlso, why the hell was she on Tinder to begin with? She’s a Playboy model! Shouldn’t she be on some upscale dating app that’s just full of Marc Cubans?! \nThat being said, Lochte makes sense for Tinder. \nThe next night, he took her on their official first date: to see Justin Bieber perform at a nightclub. \nJeah. \nIn the interview, Reid went on to prove she is Lochte’s true soulmate without even meaning to when she said, \nI don’t like the term ‘Playboy model.’ I’m not a Playboy model. I’m a centerfold. Once you’re a centerfold, you’re a centerfold for life. I have a month designated for me. No one can take that away. I am Miss July 2015 — like, that’s it. \nAt the end of the day, she seems to be pretty devoted to Lochte, standing by him during that whole fake robbery story . \nHe told Cosmo, \nShe was like, ‘F–k this, I don’t care. I’m with you no matter what… She saw my life pretty much going up in flames. I was like, ‘What am I doing here? I should just die and end this.’ I was getting death threats. It was just the darkest point in my life. I was like, ‘I’m just never going to come out, never.’ \nReid went on to say, \nYou kind of felt violated, in a way. Yes, he did let down a lot of Americans, and Brazilians as well, but at the same time, it felt like it was a murder case or something. It was something just completely, I don’t know, catastrophic. \nLuckily, their lives have seemingly turned around. \nMazel tov to the future Lochte mishpacha! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "As we’ve continually said, Facebook seems bent on making people not want to leave their Messenger app. They’ve added a lot of new features like chatbots, Instant Articles, Group Calling, shopping options, plus more messaging add-ons like emoticons, stickers, animations, and mini-games. They have brought it one step further when they announced earlier this week that they’re letting users play Instant Games now on the messaging app. Starting a game is actually pretty easy (the rest of it is of course up to you).\nThe first step is of course to update your Messenger to the latest version through the Google Play page. Once you’re on the updated version, start a new chat with one of your contacts. You can either tell the person in advance you want to play a game or just surprise them. In the feature strip, you’ll see a game controller icon next to the GIF button, which of course means you have to tap it to start.\nA list of the available games will appear. This includes popular games like Words With Friends, PacMan, Galaga, Everwing, Space Invaders, and many more. Press Play Now on the game that you want to use and then start actually playing it. Once your turn is done, your contact will be asked to challenge your score and so it’s their turn to play. You will also be able to search for games in the Messenger search field or through your Facebook News Feed.\nThe most important thing to know by now is that this has rolled out to 30 countries initially, including the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Singapore, and other countries in Europe and Asia. They will probably expand it even more soon, so if your country isn’t included yet, then be content with playing hoops and football on your Messenger for now.",

      "text": "NASA/JPL \nAtlas Obscura on Slate is a blog about the world’s hidden wonders. Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter . \nIt’s entirely possible that someone alive today on Earth will be the first person to die on Mars . The private company Mars One expects that, after a one-way flight, its interplanetary travelers will remain there for the rest of their lives. \nBillionaire space magnate Elon Musk has said that, eventually, he’d like to die on Mars himself. His company, SpaceX, is planning a return flight on its Mars journeys, but, as Musk said last week, with the risk of death so high, anyone who goes on the first Mars flights must be prepared not to come back. If humans reach Mars, at least a few of us are likely to die there. Advertisement \nThis would be a milestone of its own. In the history of humanity, only three people have died in space—cosmonauts on the Soyuz 11 mission when their return capsule depressurized at 104 miles above sea level, well past the boundary between Earth and the rest of the universe. No one’s ever been buried, cremated, or left to the elements on another planet. \nIf a person did die on Mars, what would happen to his or her body? \nIf left out on the Martian surface, a human body would last a very, very long time. On Earth, post-death destruction starts with decomposers, which move in fast and start using organic matter to fuel their own little lives. Mars has no biology, that we know of. \nIn the immediate aftermath of death, a body would still start to decompose there: The bacteria inside, transplanted from Earth, would go to work. If a dead body was left outside at the Martian equator, where temperatures sometimes reach pleasant-enough highs during the day, this could go on for a few hours. Without an insulating atmosphere, though, the planet cools quickly, and even balmy Martian nights are as cold as polar nights here. The body would freeze, stopping the work of the bacteria, and begin the slow, dry process of mummifying . Advertisement \nWorking against the preservation of the cold would be ionizing radiation, which destroys organic compounds and bathes Mars at levels unheard of on Earth. One plausible explanation for why we haven’t found any traces of life on Mars is that the high levels of radiation there zapped any organic compounds into gases that show no trace of their former life. \nEventually, radiation would do away with more of the body, but it would take eons—100 million years from the first human death on Mars, it’s possible that the person’s bones could still be found. \nBeing human, Mars colonists probably wouldn’t just throw bodies out on the ground and leave them there. If a body was buried, though, it would be even better preserved than if it were left on the surface—the conditions would still be cold and dry, but the body would be protected from radiation. \nTo dispose of a body, Mars explorers or colonists would have to resort to cremation or deliberate decomposition. Either is possible; Mars One already chosen cremation as its method for disposing of the dead. A cremation fire would require two resources that Mars missions are already looking to extract or manufacture on Mars: oxygen and fuel. But even if the settlement is not manufacturing fuel, there could be enough leftover from the trip there to feed a fire. Advertisement \nThe other option is less conventional, since it would basically amount to composting human bodies. However, a space bioethicist told Slate that this option seemed unlikely—“There are societies that desperately need fertilizer, and even they don’t use their dead bodies for the purpose,” he said—but it seems to be one of the first options that pops into people’s minds. \nIt makes sense: Any semi-permanent Mars colony would benefit from a composting system that reserved food waste and recycled it back into new plants, and astronauts already violate earthly taboos about waste by drinking recycled urine, for instance. If it’s possible to get past the taboo of death, actively composting a human body isn’t so different than burying it in the ground. \nBesides Mars One, Mars-faring expeditions haven’t been so clear-cut about their plans for death, though. NASA, presumably, would use a similar approach to its current preparation for astronauts— ”contingency” or death sims , in which, astronaut Chris Hadfield has written, an entire team works through the basic questions: what to do with the corpse and its smell? How quickly will a body decompose? How should the person’s family be notified? How should the PR team respond? \nOf course, we have to get to Mars first for any of this to be relevant. But planning ahead for end-of-life is always advisable. \nSpecial thanks to the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science and to Jim Cleaves for their thoughts on death and decomposition on Mars. \nIf you liked this, you’ll probably enjoy Atlas Obscura’s New York Times best-selling book, which collects more than 700 of the world’s strangest and most amazing places: Atlas Obscura: An Explorer’s Guide to the World’s Hidden Wonders . \nSarah Laskow is a staff writer at Atlas Obscura .

      "text": "  06:37PM GARNER (WTVD) -- Many go online to find a new vehicle. Craigslist and Facebook groups are filled with vehicles for sale. Along with legitimate cars for sale, you need to watch out for fake vehicle ads.Monique London thought she found the perfect used car advertised in a Facebook group she belongs to. It was an ad for a 2004 Lexus RX330 for $2,500. She adds, \"It was in really good shape. It was a decent price.\"Monique responded to the Facebook ad and received emails from the seller with more pictures of the SUV and an explanation of why she wanted to sell it. \nThe Facebook group ad Monique saw. It turned out to be an Amazon card scam. \"She said she went through a divorce, and it was painful to have the car. I was like OK she just wanted to unload it.\" Monique said.It seemed like the perfect fit so Monique wanted to buy the Lexus. When she reached out to the seller, she was surprised with how the seller wanted to be paid.Monique said, \"She said I'll send you over the information from Amazon car payments, that way we are both protected and you won't have any issues and both of us can feel safe during this transaction.\"Monique wasn't familiar with this type of payment, but she thought it seemed legit when the seller sent her this invoice along with a purchase protection. SEE THE BOGUS INVOICE MONIQUE RECEIVED (.pdf) The red flags started to go up as she read through the invoice. Plus, she continued to ask the seller to see the vehicle in person and that wasn't an option.\"That's when I started thinking, this seems kind of weird. I don't want to just buy a car I haven't seen. I won't buy a car like that, I have to see what it looks like,\" she said.With a little research, Monique found the same SUV advertised for sale on several different Facebook groups under different sellers. Also, a quick check on Amazon shows it has warnings about this scam on its website. It clearly states people should not send money by using Amazon Payments where the seller claims that Amazon or Amazon Payments will guarantee the transaction.Scammers are using fake invoices to make it appear they are from Amazon, but they are not. Here's more advice from Amazon on how to avoid getting scammed .Monique wasn't wasting any more time on the bad deal.She said, \"I sent an email back to the email address that sent me an invoice and I said 'I will not be paying for this with Amazon gift cards, instead I will be using my American Express card. Will you please provide me the information to pay you through that source? No response.\"Luckily Monique didn't fall for this scam. However, I have heard from several drivers who have lost thousands of dollars to this scam.The best advice is you should never buy a vehicle, no matter how good the price is, without seeing it in person. Also, do not pay for the vehicle in gift cards. If the seller won't let you test drive it, walk away from the deal.",

      "text": "Santa Monica High teachers, grads mourn alum killed in Oakland warehouse fire David Cline. (Facebook photo) By Larry Altman , Daily Breeze Posted: # Comments \nDavid Cline was “just one of those kids you remember,” one of his former teachers said Monday. \nExcelling in music and sports and earning a 4.0 grade-point average, Cline was quickly recalled by those who knew him at Santa Monica High School. \n“He was one of the brightest kids I’ve ever taught,” said Amy Chapman, who taught Cline in her English 10 Honors class. “Sharp. Funny. Kind. Kind of like a Renaissance man.” \nNews that Cline was among the victims in Oakland’s tragic warehouse fire shocked the faculty at Samo High as teachers opened their emails Monday morning. \nChapman called it a tough email to receive. Teachers felt the loss “profoundly,” she said. \n“He was insightful,” Chapman said. “He saw the world in a different way than most teenagers. He was just a good guy. He was a kid that when you were discussing literature or a current event, he took the topic to a different level.” \nCline, 24, a 2011 graduate who went on to study at UC Berkeley, was among the first confirmed names to be released following the devastating fire that gutted the warehouse in Oakland where an electronic dance party was held Friday night. Authorities said at least 36 people are believed dead. \nAuthorities have identified many of the deceased, but several names have been withheld until the families can be notified. \nA memorial page on Facebook contains a list of those still considered missing after the fire, among them is 21-year-old Vanessa Plotkin , an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley who grew up in Lakewood. \nCline’s brother, Neil Cline, made the announcement of his brother’s death on his Facebook page Sunday afternoon, one day after posting a message saying his brother was among those missing. \n“We just received word that my brother David Cline passed away in the Oakland fire,” Neil Cline wrote. “To all of you, thank you. Thank you for your kindness, help and love. To David, we love you. You will be with us always.” \nHis family members asked for privacy Monday. \nBy the afternoon, Neil Cline had received about 200 posts on his Facebook page from friends offering sympathies. \n“Such a tragedy,” wrote Rose Robitaille. “Sending love and peace. Condolences.” \nIn high school, Cline was popular for his wit, his skills on the volleyball court, and in the music department, where he played the clarinet in the school’s wind ensemble. Advertisement \n“He was a really nice, pleasant guy,” said the school’s band director, Terry Sakow. “Really bright, and he was one of a lot of really good clarinet players that we had at that time. That was a really amazing clarinet section.” \nSakow said Cline and his brother, who played the trumpet, were “really nice kids.” \n“(David Cline) was always really happy,” Sakow said. “I just remember him smiling. He always had a smile.” \nCline was a valedictorian candidate who went off to UC Berkeley. He graduated last year with bachelor’s degrees in cognitive science and computer science. \n“David Cline was and will forever be the epitome of what makes Santa Monica High School great,” said Al Trundle, Cline’s adviser for four years. \nTrundle called him an “amazing student,” a “courageous competitor,” and a “consummate musician.” \n“Most importantly he was a young man of honor and character,” Trundle said. “It would not surprise me at all to learn that David lost his life as he tried to save others.” \nSanta Monica alumni planned to get together on the beach Monday evening to light candles and remember Cline. \nBlake Bijari called Cline “hands down my favorite teammate from our Samo volleyball days.” He described Cline as “one of the most unique, fun, and loving personalities I’ve ever come across.” \n“He made every single person around him laugh to no end regardless of the mood they were in. I remember trying to avoid him at practice because I didn’t want to get in trouble for goofing off because any encounter with him guaranteed it,” Bijari wrote on his Facebook page. \nIn an interview, Bijari, a teammate of Cline on the 2010 and 2011 volleyball teams, their junior and senior years, said Cline drew people together. \n“He had no shame in being the goofiest,” Bijari said. “Everyone who went to our school knows he didn’t really have to speak too much to make you laugh. He had this signature look on his face to make you laugh.” \nBijari described Cline as “very smart,” and perfect for UC Berkeley. \n“I think personality-wise it fit him,” Bijari said. “They are very open to their opinions and I think that’s a place that fit David well.” \nThe Santa Monica high school volleyball community established a Gofundme page to raise money to assist his family with burial and other expenses. Bijari described Samo High classmates as “one big giant group of family.” \n“I would have never guessed in a million years that would happen to him or someone like him,” Bijari said.",

      "text": "For those of you who are looking to develop a successful marketing plan that reaches huge groups of people in a short time frame, you may want to consider a Facebook Ads campaign. If done correctly, this type of marketing strategy can completely revolutionize the way your company advertises all of its products and services. Before getting started, there are a few things that you should know about optimizing your campaigns so that you can achieve the best results. One of the most important is testing the ads to make sure that they will be effective. With this being said, here's 3 essential areas that you should be aware of when you are developing and creating your plans for testing. \n\n\nFACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN FOR A BOOK Split testing to find the best winning ads When a marketing specialist or team creates an ad for the company that they are working for, one of the main objectives that they strive for is to generate money. In fact, if the ad is not generating money, it may need to be modified or scrapped completely. In either case, when the ad is being placed on Facebook, the individual can find out how well it is performing by using split testing. For example, if the marketing specialist has 2 ads that they want to compare, they can test both ads to simultaneously to see which one does the best financially. Although the ads may be similar in nature, even the smallest modifications can make a significant difference in how well it is received and how much money the ad will pay in the long run. Therefore, split testing is considered to be an excellent way to identify the best winning ads. Creating multiple ads to find the winner One of the best things about developing any type of Facebook marketing campaign is it gives people an opportunity to experiment and be innovative. In fact, when one Facebook Ad does not work, another one can be created. In fact, one of the best ways for a company to maximize their ad earnings is to create a diversity of ads to deploy and then test each of them to see which one is actually the winner. Testing images / different text / subject lines When an individual or a team begins their Facebook Ad campaign for a book, there are many different scenarios that they can test. To make sure the FB ads are successful, people should test images, the different text that's used , the subject lines and other things that the tester can think of. All of which are essential in ensuring the entire ad performs at its best.

These plans are ideal for many reasons including identifying the winning ad via split testing, creating multiple ads, and testing images, testing text on essay checker , subject lines and much more.

Post to Facebook Meyers Leonard yelled at Bulls PA guy over his name That probably happens a lot.  //usat.ly/2gKjQzi   Meyers Leonard yelled at Bulls PA guy over his name Andrew Joseph 10:56   \nScreenshot (Photo: Twitter) \nTrail Blazers forward Meyers Leonard grew up in Illinois and played for the Illini in college, but that didn't seem to help his cause during Monday's game in Chicago. He was just another name. \nMeyers is a relatively unique first name, and the Bulls public address announcer kept saying it as \"Miles,\" which was not the correct name. But mistakes happen, and it was a Monday - you can't get too upset about that. Tell that to Leonard, though. Illinois native Meyers Leonard can't get any love, has to correct PA announcer, who keeps calling him \"Myles\" https://t.co/y11xozx7hF — CSN Northwest (@CSNNW) December 6, 2016 \nAfter hearing his name pronounced as \"Miles\" late in the first quarter, Leonard yelled his correct name at the PA announcer. Judging from Leonard's obvious frustration, he's probably been called \"Miles\" quite a few times in his life. \nOverall, it wasn't a great night for Leonard. He fouled out after 12 minutes with two points. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gKjQzi Most Popular",
