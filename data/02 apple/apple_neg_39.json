Apple is also supporting The Conservation Fund’s donation of an endowment to the Forest Society that the society says will ensure the easement is monitored and enforced. \nThe Forest Society says the easement ensures the land will become “a healthy, sustainable working forest.” It says the easement will protect the forest’s wetlands, rivers, streams and aquatic habitats. Some outdoor recreation will also be allowed. \nApple and The Conservation Fund partnered to protect the land last year. \nThe Forest Society says protecting Maine’s forests is important because they provide habitat for species such as Atlantic salmon, bald eagle and Canada lynx.

      "text": "man drops iphone into lake n More Better Motivate/Facebook\nOne of Apple’s famous slogans is “it just works,” although if they always worked, would there be a use for the Genius Bar? Anyway, when you purchase a pricey smartphone, you expect performance and reliability. After all, we depend on these devices for everything from calling emergency road service to ordering pizza. And of course, you’ve got your Android fans and your iPhone fans. Michael Guntrum of Knox, Pennsylvania is one of the latter. He was ice fishing with a friend on Kyle Lake on March 2015 when he accidentally dropped his iPhone 4 into the freezing water.\nAccording to Neowin , he said “We were sitting in our portable shanty, and I got a bite on my rod. I laid the phone on my lap, and it slipped off. Instead of landing flat in the snow, it hit its edge and rolled into the hole. I caught the fish — it was a blue gill — but it wasn’t worth it.”\nNo, it wasn’t. But there’s more to the story. In September the lake was drained. Then in October, Daniel Kalgren was out hunting for buried treasure with his metal detector in the now-empty lake basin, and what did he come across? An iPhone 4 buried in the mud. Via Neowin, he told BuzzFeed News , “I took the phone home, cleaned it, and put it in rice — just out of curiosity to see if it would still work.”\nMore: What makes a smartphone rugged? IP67, MIL-STD-810G, and other certifications explained\nTwo days later Kalgren checked on the phone and it booted right up (there’s that “it just works” slogan earning its keep). Kalgren located Guntrum’s number and told him about the phone he had found. Guntrum was skeptical at first. “‘I had just been talking about that lake early that day. It was eerie,’” he said. “’He sent me a picture and asked, ‘Does this look familiar?’ and I recognized the screensaver.’” Kalgren said the phone was in an OtterBox iPhone case , and that might have helped the device survive the chilly waters for so long.\nApple commented, “It never ceases to amaze us, all the incredible iPhone survival stories our customers have shared with us.”\nKalgren only buys Apple devices, and it’s a pretty safe bet that Guntrum is a Cupertino loyalist, too. According to the story, Guntrum is going to have the phone repaired and eventually pass it onto Mom.\nInteractive apartment block prototype is a voyeuristic Arduino-powered experience Bring Polygons, the origami-like, all-in-one measuring spoon, into the fold Why are video cards selling for way above MSRP?

      "text": "Some Of Apple’s New MacBook Pros Are Experiencing Video Glitches   16:59 PST \nLike tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube \nApple’s new MacBook Pros are expensive and when you drop that amount of money on something, you expect it to work. Unfortunately some MacBook Pro owners are finding out that this isn’t always the case as quite a few users are reporting that the video on their laptops have been glitching out . \nAccording to the users, it seems to affect both the MacBook Pro with a discrete GPU and the ones that use the motherboard’s GPU, which seems to suggest that this isn’t a hardware issue and could be due to a driver problem. It also seems to be mainly affecting the 15-inch MacBook Pro, so for now 13-inch MacBook Pro users are “safe”. \nAlso a common thread has been found and that is users who encounter this problem seem to be using Adobe’s software when it happens, such as Adobe Media Encoder and Lightroom, just to name a few. At the moment there does not appear to be a fix for the problem, so for now MacBook Pro users will just have to deal with it. \nWe’re not sure if this is grounds for a return/exchange for a new unit, but you could try your luck, although you might want to call ahead and check with your local store first. In any case hopefully Apple will be able to address this problem ASAP, so check back with us soon where hopefully a fix will have been made available. \nFiled in Apple > Computers .

      "text": "Apple Faces Decade Of Uncertainty After Next Year’s iPhone \nAnalysts think that a lack of innovation and increasing competition from Google and Amazon’s phone, video-streaming, and augmented-reality services will result in a \"decade-long malaise\" for Apple. I wonder when the Apple Surface is coming out… \n…Uerkwitz believes next year’s iPhone cycle will present \"one last growth hurrah\" before consumers begin to drift away from the high prices Apple commands for it smartphones. Apple may struggle to raise iPhone prices meaningfully beyond the next cycle as it deals with fewer hardware breakthroughs and a narrowing performance gap between the iPhone and its closest premium-tier competitors, Uerkwitz wrote. \"The risks to the company have never been greater,\" said Uerkwitz, who has a perform rating on the stock. \"We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.\"",

This is despite Apple's tradition of rolling out annual upgrade to its iPhones. iPhoneDigital / Flickr \nAmidst the rumors and excitement about the upcoming iPhone 8 with OLED display, iPhone SE owners are left wondering if Apple is going to refresh the low-end smartphone. A top analyst has speculated that the tech company may be focusing more on its high-end iPhones. \nKGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple will not upgrade the iPhone SE in the second quarter of 2017. He also forecasted that Apple will suffer a decline of total shipment volume for iPhones in the first half of next year, according to Mac Rumors . The reason being that iPhone demand in the Chinese market is low. The tech company would want to address this. There may also be a slow shipment volume of 4.7-inch iPhones. It will be a disappointment if Apple will indeed not refresh the iPhone SE. This is considering the fact that iPhone shipment volume had actually risen in the first half of 2016 caused by the \"upbeat demand for the iPhone SE\", according to Kuo. \nKuo added that the company will try to \"exert pressure on iPhone component makers to drop prices in an effort to maintain its margins\". It seems that Apple might be more concerned of their suppliers to cut prices. However, Kuo noted that it will be hard for Apple to achieve that since most of them \"have weak bargaining positions with Apple\". This is driven by fierce competition among suppliers. Samsung, Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone market, is one of its main suppliers. The Korean-based company will likely raise its prices. It also does not help that Samsung \"have stronger bargaining positions than Apple\". \nTo put it simply, Apple's attempt to maintain the high margins on its high-end iPhones might cost the lack of upgrade for iPhone SE. Other iPhone owners who prefer the larger iPhones will be looking forward to the release of iPhone 8 next year along with the 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus and the 4.7-inch iPhone 7S. According to Apple Insider , the iPhone 7S could be a new midrange or low-end model. \nOn the other hand, those who prefer the smaller and cheaper iPhone will have to wait until Apple does roll out an upgrade. The iPhone SE costs only $399 compared to the next cheapest iPhone that has a starting price of $549, according to the Investors. It was introduced back in March and has the features of the iPhone 6S. \nThough the phone is probably going to survive for the next few years, iPhone SE owners would still want an upgrade since the high-end ones will receive the traditional annual upgrade. CIO reports that iPhone owners might resent that scenario as the \"lesser model\" of the iPhone will lag behind with the lack of upgrade. ",

      "text": "1 1 ⁄ 2 kg sugar 10 Favorite Apple Recipes Directions To make this quince jelly you just need 4 ingredients, 1 kg of quince, 1 kg of apple, 1 dl of a sweet Aloe Vera drink, and 1,5 kg of sugar. You can use a sweet Aloe Vera drink from okyalo (http://www.okyalo.com/aloe-vera-gel-drink.html) or any other type of sweet Aloe Vera drink. Using a sweet Aloe Vera Drink is quicker than having to prepare the Aloe Vera. Peal the quinces and the apples and take out their seeds. Cut them into small pieces. Put the quinces, apples, the sweet Aloe Vera drink and the sugar in a pan. Stir the pan and simmer it for about 1 hour. Blend everything with an hand blender until the mixture looks like a puree. Stir it again and let the puree simmer for 10 minutes. After those 10 minutes put a little bit of that jelly in a plate. Draw a road in the middle of the jelly with a spoon and see if that road stays like that. If it doesn`t stay like that continue to stir the puree. When it stays like that your quince jelly with apple and Aloe Vera is ready to put in a sterilized bowl. Put a vegetable paper on top of the quince jelly with apple and Aloe Vera. Let it cool, and then you may eat it! It is really tasty!",

      "text": "(Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) × Apple offers Black Friday gift cards to shoppers (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — Apple is offering up gift cards in lieu of discounts to its Black Friday shoppers. \nThe company is giving out gift cards ranging from $25 to $150 with the purchase of select products on Black Friday . The amount ranges depending on what shoppers buy. \nA $25 Apple gift card goes to Apple TV or Apple Watch Series 1 buyers; $50 gift cards for select SIM-free iPhones; $100 for some iPad models and $150 cards when buying select Macs. \nThe products are older models — not Apple’s newest offerings like the latest MacBook Pro or iPhone 7. \nOf course, there are also other ways of getting discounted Apple products. Best Buy, for instance, is selling the 13-inch MacBook Air at a discounted rate of $999. \nApple’s Black Friday offering wasn’t a given: The company didn’t offer any sales or discounts in 2015. \nThe gift card perk is valid online as well as in Apple stores. 37.331695 -122.030091 ",

In the picture I attached I have circled where I believe the damage is. I'm not sure if this is a resistor or what. though it seems to be missing on my logic board after someone replaced the ram and now the HDD is not being read. Any help would be appreciated !!!! Attached Images Specs: 2011 13\" MBP 2.3ghz, 8gig ram, OS 10.8.5 What sort of help are you looking for? Are you looking for logic board repair help? If so...I'm afraid only seriously skilled folks usually do this. And by \"serious\"...I mean depot repair employees with access to seriously expensive equipment (and this is if the logic board repair makes financial sense). You may want to look into Apple flat rate repair service for this. The cost may still be worth it on a 2011 15\" MBP. - Nick - Too many \"beachballs\", read this: Beachballs - Computer seems slower than it used to?

I have someone capable of doing the repair, but I figured I would find out on my own first what i'm dealing with. To my belief it is a resistor so i would need to know the specs. Regards,",

      "text": "\nApple has revealed its official Philippine pricing for the wireless AirPods, and it looks like it will battle other current wireless headsets in its price range.\n\n\n\n\nUnveiled alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in its global unveiling, the AirPods are the Cupertino company’s first true wireless earbuds as they only rely on wireless connections to transmit audio data, with a microphone that senses the direction of your voice for better audibility. The AirPods are also equipped with the first Apple W1 chip designed for high-fidelity and consistent audio output. As for its battery life, these alone can play back up to 5 hours of music. With its portable battery case, it is said that it can deliver up to 24 hours of music experience.\n\nIt will be available locally for Php8,990 , which is a thousand bucks more expensive than Samsung’s wireless Gear IconX . No word on availability yet, but the release may be near as the price tag is now revealed. Would you get one, if it comes out this holiday season?\n\nSource \n\nThe post Apple’s Wireless AirPods Now Priced appeared first on YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews .\n",

      "text": "Apple iPhone Updates: Explores the idea of Foldable iPhone with \"Flexible Display Design\" By Cristina Limpiada | Nov 26, 2016 08:24 PM EST facebook tweet   Getty Images/Junko Kimura) A Model displays the world's thinnest W-CDMA clamshell model mobile phone N703i mu (L) and the D800iDS (R) handset, with screens on both upper and lower halves, by NTT DoCoMo. Apple iPhone update is getting a little more nostalgic as Apple is said to be bringing back the idea of producing the foldable of flip phone again for another iPhone model. According to Digital Trends , Apple would like people to see the creating a foldable phone isn't dead yet. And for this, the company has been granted a new patent for iPhone, which shows a design that it can be folded in half. Advertisement The said iPhone patent design can be gripped onto your clothes. This means that this might not need to put it in your pocket for the design is very compact. As per CNN Tech , this deign would be potentially cut down on the need to stuff device into pockets. Advertisement Meanwhile, this new design is allegedly showing a glimpse into what Apple is been thinking for the future. The said patent for the \"flexible display devices\" was said to be filed since 2014 at the month of July. Since that the time, Apple is still thinking if the idea would be a big hit for the masses. Additionally, the \"flexible display design\" will feature a touchscreen smartphone with a design being popularized by clamshell phones. The patent design even highlights the possibility of its screen to be flexible with OLED display . Its face could be bent or fit back-to-back. More so, it is said that the new design could be bend in thirds because its hinges can accommodate not just the typical folding design, but now it would be different from what people used to know. Accordingly, the patent shows that the device could be folded and the device will show two screen halves touch each other. This would let half of the screen on either side of the outside of the device. Consequently, the patent's details about how the new device would look like is not yet approved. Apple has just been granted a patent, but that doesn't mean that it will ever be release to the market. Advertisement Hopefully, Apple iPhone update will release the said flexible design patent soon, for Samsung has been long working for this and rumors claim that it will finally release in 2017. Likewise, LG is doing the same thing for a flexible phone model. hone with \"Flexible Display Design\" Patent!?",

EST November 26, 2016 (Photo: NEWS CENTER) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nREED PLANTATION, Maine (AP) - Computer giant Apple and The Conservation Fund are donating a 32,400-acre conservation easement to Forest Society of Maine. The Reed Forest land is located in Aroostook County in northern Maine. Apple is also supporting The Conservation Fund's donation of an endowment to the Forest Society that the society says will ensure the easement is monitored and enforced. The Forest Society says the easement ensures the land will become \"a healthy, sustainable working forest.\" It says the easement will protect the forest's wetlands, rivers, streams and aquatic habitats. Some outdoor recreation will also be allowed. Apple and The Conservation Fund partnered to protect the land last year. The Forest Society says protecting Maine's forests is important because they provide habitat for species such as Atlantic salmon, bald eagle and Canada lynx. \n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOne of Apple’s famous slogans is “it just works,” although if they always worked, would there be a use for the Genius Bar? Anyway, when you purchase a pricey smartphone, you expect performance and reliability. After all, we depend on these devices for everything from calling emergency road service to ordering pizza. And of course, you’ve got your Android fans and your iPhone fans. Michael Guntrum of Knox, Pennsylvania is one of the latter. He was ice fishing with a friend on Kyle Lake on March 2015 when he accidentally dropped his iPhone 4 into the freezing water. \nAccording to Neowin , he said “We were sitting in our portable shanty, and I got a bite on my rod. I laid the phone on my lap, and it slipped off. Instead of landing flat in the snow, it hit its edge and rolled into the hole. I caught the fish — it was a blue gill — but it wasn’t worth it.” \nNo, it wasn’t. But there’s more to the story. In September the lake was drained. Then in October, Daniel Kalgren was out hunting for buried treasure with his metal detector in the now-empty lake basin, and what did he come across? An iPhone 4 buried in the mud. Via Neowin, he told BuzzFeed News , “I took the phone home, cleaned it, and put it in rice — just out of curiosity to see if it would still work.” \nMore: What makes a smartphone rugged? IP67, MIL-STD-810G, and other certifications explained \nTwo days later Kalgren checked on the phone and it booted right up (there’s that “it just works” slogan earning its keep). Kalgren located Guntrum’s number and told him about the phone he had found. Guntrum was skeptical at first. “‘I had just been talking about that lake early that day. It was eerie,’” he said. “’He sent me a picture and asked, ‘Does this look familiar?’ and I recognized the screensaver.’” Kalgren said the phone was in an OtterBox iPhone case , and that might have helped the device survive the chilly waters for so long. \nApple commented, “It never ceases to amaze us, all the incredible iPhone survival stories our customers have shared with us.” \nKalgren only buys Apple devices, and it’s a pretty safe bet that Guntrum is a Cupertino loyalist, too. According to the story, Guntrum is going to have the phone repaired and eventually pass it onto Mom. Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge ",

      "text": "Dave Greenbaum | November 26, 2016 in deals \nThis week’s free app is the kid’s drawing game Artie’s Magic Pencil . Normally it’s $3, but you can get it free from iTunes until Thursday, December 1st. What Is It? \nThis game is just for kids: adults won’t be entertained at all. Sorry, Mom and Dad! Artie walks around to find his Magic Pencil to trace shapes. Players need to be precise in drawing. After your child draws the figure, they can then color it in by swiping left and right. If they want flourishes like clouds or flowers, just swipe up or down. Artie’s Magic Pencil gives fun sound effects when you swipe in either direction. Who Is It Good For? \nThe target market is young kids that like to trace but not quite at the drawing skill level. The app has no audio or text instructions. They’ll catch on pretty quick that all they need to do is trace with their finger. They’ll need some hand/eye coordination. Even as a (reasonably) skilled adult, I didn’t get the finger tracing on the first try. Players need to drag completely straight lines. Should You Download It? \nThe app loads slow on my iPhone 5s, but not intolerable. At about 270 MB, it isn’t a huge space hog but isn’t a light app. I’m keeping this one on all my devices for when the very young ones are antsy and need quick entertainment.

      "text": "\nWhile shoppers were going crazy over Apple 's Black Friday deals, Hermés quietly released a new band for its Apple Watch. Called the Equateur Tatouage, the band features a black and white jungle print featuring a dash of color in the form of a leopard. The design is the first from Hermés' Apple Watch collection to feature graphics instead of a solid color. This band joins the Single Tour line and will be available for the 38mm and 42mm sizes. \nThe print pays homage to the '80s, and is reminiscent of an Hermés scarf print by artist Robert Dallet, who passed away in 2006. His illustrations often featured lions and tigers, and are responsible for some of the best known scarves available. These bands are only available at Hermés locations and the brand's website. \nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "» News & Magazin-Redakteur Als Bragi mit The Dash die komplett kabellosen Bluetooth In-Ear-Kopfhörer auf Kickstarter finanzierte, gab es noch wenig Gründe auf Bluetooth-Headsets zu setzen. Doch 2016 fühlen sich manche gezwungen, eine Alternative zu traditionellen verkabelten Kopfhörern zu suchen, seitdem mehr und mehr Hersteller den Kopfhöreranschluss auf Smartphones weglassen. Wer dann keine Lust auf Adapter-Orgien hat, vor allem wenn man gleichzeitig Musik hören und laden will, der hat nur eine Wahl: Wireless. So ist es kein Wunder, dass dieses Jahr eine ganze Menge neuer Funk-Kopfhörer vorgestellt wurden, die versuchen, das Konzept kabelloser Bluetooth-Kopfhörer zu verbessern. Beispielsweise hat Samsung die Icon X auf den Markt gebracht, krankt damit aber vor allem an zu kurzer Akkulaufzeit. Letzteres soll beim mittlerweile finanzierten Kickstarter-Projekt The Catalyst besser sein, dafür verzichtet Zipbuds nicht ganz auf die Kabel. Apple hat ja als kabellose Sidekicks zum iPhone 7 die Airpods angekündigt, kann diese aber bisher immer noch nicht liefern und ist aufgrund des eigenwilligen Designs und der eingeschränkten Kompatibilität mit Android außerhalb des Apple-Universums nicht jedermanns Sache. Möglicherweise kommt Bragi mit The Headphone jetzt Apple zuvor. Der deutscher Hersteller will die abgespeckten In-Hear-Ohrhörer noch im November ausliefern und listet sie in seinem Online-Shop für 149 Euro, also genau halb so teuer wie The Dash. Dafür muss der Käufer auf sämtliche Fitness-Features, den integrierten 4 GB Speicherplatz, die Touch-Buttons und das Charging-Case verzichten, bekommt dafür aber 6 Stunden Batterielaufzeit (2 Stunden mehr als bei The Dash). Leider wurde auch auf Widerstandsfähigkeit gegen Wasser verzichtet, auch wenn das Werbevideo (siehe unten) kein Problem mit der Nähe zu Wasser suggeriert. Engadget hat ein Vorserienexemplar bereits getestet und war vom Ergebnis positiv überrascht. In mancher Hinsicht sei der Neuzugang sogar dem Vorgänger überlegen, beispielsweise bei den Funk-Drop-Outs, die nun fast gänzlich verschwunden wären. Einzig die etwas schwergängigen Buttons könnten Druckgefühle beim Bedienen hervorrufen, wird kritisiert. Die Audioqualität wurde als gut eingestuft, auch wenn dem Engadget-Tester The Dash hier noch etwas besser gefallen haben, zudem dürfte Bragi das Audioprofil bis zur Auslieferung noch verändern. Mit dem Preis von 149 Euro liegt Bragi jedenfalls unter den von Apple veranschlagten 179 Euro und ist wohl auch kompatibler mit Android-Geräten. Tests",

      "text": "Apple's 'spaceship' campus looks like a futuristic, solar-powered fortress in new drone video Published by Mashable on Sun, 27 Nov 2016 A number of drone videos have captured the construction of the new UFO-style Apple Campus 2, but this latest video is the best look we've had yet.The new video, captured by YouTube user Sexton Videography, shows the Apple structures in their nearly completed form, with most of the walls and solar panels now in place.From the main circular structure, to the similarly flying saucer-like underground auditorium, to even the massive 20,000 car parking lot, it's now clear that this solar-powered complex could easily double as a self-sustaining city and/or fortress when the zombie apocalypse arrives.

      "text": "Jony Ive is a British industrial designer who is also the CDO (Chief Design Officer) of Apple. Apple is preparing a design overhaul with its launch of iPhone 8 next year. In a similar effort, the company appears to be putting a lot of effort into ensuring that no leaves remain unturned. Incidentally, Jony Ive, the Chief Design Officer at Apple will not be designing next year’s iPhone.\nIve is reportedly less involved in the iPhone design process. Instead, he is more focused on other projects at Apple including the new spaceship campus.\n‘I’ve heard that he (Jony Ive) has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture,’ said Apple expert, Jason Snell during John Gruber’s ‘The Talk Show’ podcast. ‘Meaning the spaceship capus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who’s been working the most with Ive is Angela Arhendts,’ he added.\nThe 2017 iPhone will mark the 10 th anniversary of iPhone. If rumours are believed to be true, the iPhone 8 could come with an all-glass body and metal frame. The company is also reportedly exploring ways to eliminate bezels and introduce OLED screens. Additionally, expert analysts speculate that the display could integrate an all front-facing part such as the FaceTime camera and the Home button.",

      "text": "A s tech companies in Silicon Valley strive to make their workforces more diverse, many of them have remained stagnant when it comes to progression. One of those companies is Apple.\nApple’s workforce is still predominately White and male, reports Recode .\nApple has made statements about advocating for diversity in the tech industry. “The most diverse group will produce the best product, I firmly believe that,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook . “ If you believe as we believe that diversity leads to better products, and we’re all about making products that enrich people’s lives, then you obviously put a ton of energy behind diversity the same way you would put a ton of energy behind anything else that is truly important .” \nBut the newly released figures prove otherwise.\nThe data, which was released by the company, shows that out of 107 high-level executives, only 20 are women. When it comes to racial diversity, the numbers are worse. There are only five executives who identify as Black, Latino or Native American and 14 executives who are Asian compared to 88 White executives. Over 65 percent of mid-level managers are White compared to only 11 percent who are from culturally diverse backgrounds. Apple is claiming that the figures can’t be used to illustrate its progress when it comes to diversity. The company says that the EEOC data isn’t reflective of how it assembles its workforce.\nDespite the stagnant numbers, Apple saw a rise in the number of minorities at the company, the report says.There was 27 percent of minorities and 37 percent of women who landed jobs with the company.\nAlthough the numbers of women and people of color are low within the company, Apple still remains one of the leading tech businesses when it comes to employing individuals from those groups.\nDuring an interview in 2015, Apples HR chief Denise Young Smith shared that the diversity issue would take time to change, reports CNET . She said the “diversity challenge … didn’t happen overnight so it’s not going to be changed overnight.” She also added, “The long-term aspect of it is what I hope people start to really internalize and understand.” \nSOURCE: Recode , CNET \nSEE ALSO: \nBlack Data Processors Seek To Increase The Number Of African-Americans In Tech \n4 Big Things Google Is Doing To Improve Diversity In Silicon Valley ",

      "text": "Two years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn’t crack the top five in China’s smartphone market. Now they outrank everyone after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning.\nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping into her WeChat social media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that’s Oppo and Vivo. While such payments start at about 40 yuan ($6), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo’s high-end smartphones.\n“That’s why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,” she said. “Business has been perfect, actually never been better.”\nCheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair’s charge against Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China’s far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi Corp. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the iPhone’s market share at 7 percent stood at its lowest in almost three years.\nOppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping and employ similar strategies. That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It’s where Apple’s vulnerable given the iPhone’s lofty price tag. They eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters.\n“Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,” said Jin Di, an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. “They’re doing something different — they do local marketing.”\nChina had for years driven Apple’s and Samsung’s growth. The U.S. company generated almost $59 billion of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. During that time its shares surged more than 60 percent. At its peak, Greater China yielded almost 30 percent of its revenue and Apple was neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for the mantle of market leader as users clamored for the larger iPhone 6 models. Even as the domestic economy began to sputter, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook spent a good chunk of an earnings call last year talking up the country’s promise, saying Apple’s investing there “for the decades ahead.”\nThen the country’s slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. But perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo’s gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the U.S. company will need an answer. Some think the 10th-anniversary iPhone due in 2017 could deliver.\n“Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,” Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah writes. Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said.\nTogether Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34 percent of devices sold in the world’s biggest market, according to IDC. In 2012, their combined share was about 2.5 percent. IPhone shipments plunged more than a third to 8.2 million during the period — less than half of Vivo’s. Samsung, which once led the market, now settles for roughly 5 percent, according to Counterpoint.\nAs Apple has faltered in China, Cook has stepped up his courtship of decision-makers. He visited the country several times this year, unveiled plans for research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen, and invested $1 billion in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Cook said on his last earnings call he remains confident of a return to growth this quarter.\nSamsung declined to comment for this story, while Apple directed Bloomberg to Cook’s previous remarks on China.\nIt’s unclear how Apple can reclaim lost ground in the interim. Previous attempts to drift down-market — with the iPhone 5c and SE, for instance — fizzled as local users shunned seemingly inferior devices. Apple doesn’t run a vibrant online social community for users the way some of its local rivals do. And competing on price will jeopardize the industry’s fattest profit margins.\nOppo and Vivo pack high-end specs into a phone that sells for a fraction of its rival’s in China, where iPhone 7s start at 5,388 ($784). Consider the Oppo R9 plus: for 2,999 yuan, buyers get an aluminum body, 6-inch display, 16-megapixel camera and a battery that claims 19 hours of calls, photo and web browsing. Vivo’s high-end Xplay6, with a price tag of 4,498 yuan, also undercuts Apple.\n“Both companies invested heavily in marketing,” said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific research director at consultancy Canalys. Oppo and Vivo have a strong grip on the middle market for phones from $200 to $500, she said. “Their offline channel strategy paid off.”\nThe man who’s clobbering Apple started out low on the tech spectrum. Duan made his fortune selling DVD players, telephones and game consoles similar to Nintendo’s. Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. Ltd., the parent of Vivo, emerged from a restructuring in 1999 that split his company. The billionaire later teamed with long-time colleague Tony Chen and others to found what came to be known as Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co.\nWhile Duan has kept a low profile since moving to the U.S. in 2001, he occasionally makes his way into the spotlight. In 2006, he bid a then-record $620,100 to have lunch with Warren Buffett. Oppo’s first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, Bubugao created the business that would become Vivo.\nToday, Vivo touts its cameras and Oppo focuses on rapid-charging and battery life. But their offline strategies remain the same: mobilizing tens of thousands of private shop owners. Oppo said it sells its products through roughly 240,000 privately owned stores as of June — six times the global count of McDonald’s. Vivo manages about half that, said Jin. Oppo, which doesn’t disclose sales figures, said about 90 percent of its phones were sold offline.\nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn’t work so well in the countryside, where novice buyers want advice and demonstrations. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run.\nApple, in contrast, has fewer than 40 stores across the mainland, most of which are in large cities. Cook has said its iPhones are sold through about 40,000 locations, though that includes stores controlled by wireless carriers and spots within nationwide electronics chains. While its retail network is lauded for helping weave an aura of exclusivity and chic around its higher-priced gadgets, Chinese consumers — particularly in smaller, poorer cities — value access to someone local who can work out kinks. That sort of after-sales support is in itself a powerful marketing tool, IDC’s Jin said.\nFor now, neither Oppo nor Vivo appear overly concerned with the world’s most valuable company. Their executives say they’ll stick to their winning strategies, while exploring ways to keep pushing the smartphone envelope.\n“We have to keep our minds clear in the fast-changing market,” said Allen Wu, Oppo’s vice-president in charge of sales. “All we need to do is to keep our heads down and make the correct moves.”\nTo Vivo, that means targeting younger users with higher-performance devices. “Camera and music will be our key focuses in the future. We are seeing greater customer expectations out of these two areas,” company vice-president Ni Xudong said.\nThat message resonates with the likes of Chen Siyu, an accountant who uses her Vivo phone at least four hours a day to chat with friends, watch videos and apply for jobs.\n“I chose Vivo because of its design and photographing capability,” said the 26-year-old who lives in the town of Pu’tian in Fujian. “It is not expensive and doesn’t slow down after longtime use like many Android phones do.”",

Subscribe Nokia Returns To Smartphone Market In 2017 Richard Yu introduces the Huawei Mate 9 at a launch event in Germany on November 3, 2016. Photo: Christof Stache/AFP/Getty Images \nA lot of eyebrows were raised back in June when Richard Yu, Huawei’s head of consumer electronics, told a packed tech conference that the Chinese company has set its sights on overtaking both Apple and Samsung to be the number one phone company in the world. \nHuawei’s still got some ways to go, but it’s already achieved a small victory: overtake Samsung as the world’s most profitable Android maker and second most profitable phone company in the world, according to the latest report by research firm Strategy Analytics. \nNow I say the victory is small because of two reasons: Samsung’s fall this quarter is almost certainly tied to the Note 7 fiasco (so it might just be a temporary dropoff), and Apple soaks up so, so much of smartphone profits that finishing second is still a tiny chunk of the pie. Sri Lankan models displays Huawei P9 smartphone during the phone’s launch ceremony in Colombo on June 24, 2016. Huawei has found success in emerging markets as well as Europe. Photo: Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty \nThe latest numbers has Huawei taking in $200 million in profits in quarter 3 of this year, good for second place but still only 2.4% of the $9.4 billion total profits generated from smartphone sales. During that same stretch, Apple raked in $8.5 billion in profits, aka 91% of all profits. \n(That Apple take more than 90% of all smartphone profits when its phones only make up about 20% of the global market share is a testament to how much fans are willing to overpay for Apple products) \nThough Samsung suffering the biggest consumer tech crisis ever certainly helped Huawei take this lead, much credit should be given to Huawei for building good phones that are becoming popular in Europe (the Huawei P9) and finding ways to lower costs (moving some manufacturing to India ). \nThe rest of the smartphone profits went to fast-rising Chinese brands Vivo and Oppo (owned by the same man, so they’re basically one company). That’s it. Everyone else lost money. Samsung fell all the way to ninth place this recent quarter, due to the Note 7 fiasco. Photos: Justin Chin/Bloomberg \nThere’s a good chance Samsung bounces back by the next quarter and regains the number two spot again. But for now, Huawei can say it’s on its way to achieving it’s goal. Its well-received and excellent Mate 9 should keep the momentum going. \nI will be visiting Huawei headquarters tomorrow, and I’ll be sure to talk to some execs about this recent development. Stay tuned for a more in-depth story. \n",

The $5 billion pricey structure is slowly approaching its final stages and is expected to open gates in the coming year. Till now, there have been multiple footages of the awe-inspiring Apple building but a latest video offers the best look of the campus yet. The Apple Campus 2 is spread over 126 acres and includes wooded walking areas, restaurants and fitness centres. It has the capacity to accommodate up to 13,000 employees. Separate buildings for research would be built nearby and occupy about 300,000 square feet. As",

The amount ranges depending on what shoppers buy. \nA $25 Apple gift card goes to Apple TV or Apple Watch Series 1 buyers; $50 gift cards for select SIM-free iPhones; $100 for some iPad models and $150 cards when buying select Macs. \nThe products are older models — not Apple’s newest offerings like the latest MacBook Pro or iPhone 7. \nOf course, there are also other ways of getting discounted Apple products. Best Buy, for instance, is selling the 13-inch MacBook Air at a discounted rate of $999. \nApple’s Black Friday offering wasn’t a given: The company didn’t offer any sales or discounts in 2015. \nThe gift card perk is valid online as well as in Apple stores.

      "text": "print A guest points to a new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \nThe new MacBook Pro is here, and with it, the Mac line has completely hopped aboard the USB-C train. \nThat means no more standard USB-A ports, no more HDMI ports for connecting to a TV, and no more SD card readers for moving photos from your camera. \nIn their place, you either have to buy a new cable or some sort of adapter to keep your current gear relevant. \nTo say the transition hasn't gone over well with hardcore Mac users is an understatement. That it comes just a couple months after Apple killed the still-ubiquitous headphone jack on the iPhone 7 hasn't helped. \nNevertheless, it’s worth remembering that Apple has helped lead the tech world down this path many times before. In most cases, we’ve all come out alright. \nSo to help you take a deep breath, let’s take a quick stroll down memory lane. In the process, you might see just how familiar the current dongle mania really is. View As: One Page Slides The Apple device that made the most drastic changes is also the one that brought the company back to life after years of struggle: the iMac G3. That all-in-one famously ditched the floppy disk when it launched in 1998, but it also did away with the SCSI and ADB ports Mac owners used for connecting hard drives and keyboards and mice, respectively. Mousse Mousse/Reuters \nIt's also worth noting that Apple, along with Sony, had previously helped shift the industry from 5-inch floppy disks to 3.5-inch floppy disks in the early 80s — though that’s not quite the same as removing them altogether. In their place were a couple of ports using USB, a then smallish standard that soon became the most widely accepted connector in consumer tech. The iMac G3. YouTube Apple got equally trigger-happy in 2008, when it launched a trio of new MacBooks, including the first-generation MacBook Air. That machine was incredibly slim for its time, but to get there, it had to lose the Ethernet port and the CD/DVD optical drive. AP Those things are far from “dead” today, but Steve Jobs wasn’t necessarily wrong when he declared that most people wouldn’t miss the optical drive in the first place. The continued rise of digital media — and the many like-minded Ultrabooks that soon followed the Air — should prove that. Reuters/Robert Galbraith However, those who still wanted to watch DVDs on the MacBook Air could do so — with a $99 adapter. Apple One thing that applied to both the Air and that year’s regular MacBook was the lack of a FireWire port. (The MacBook Pro, meanwhile, went from two FireWire ports to one.) Apple’s speedy USB equivalent was a key feature of the first iPod but gradually drifted away in favor of USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt. It was gone from Macs for good by 2013. Reuters/Kimberly White In 2012, the iPhone 5 peeved hundreds of millions of iOS users by killing Apple’s 30-pin dock connector in favor of another proprietary standard, Lightning. That thinner port seems like a worthwhile upgrade today, but watching Tim Cook decree a decade’s worth of accessories worthless with the latest iPhone wasn’t exactly easy at the time. Getty Images/Justin Sullivan And again, there were dongles: a standard Lightning to 30-pin adapter for $29, and a wired one for $39. Apple The jury’s still out on whether or not Apple’s ultra-slim MacBook will ever gain the prestige of its predecessors, but it did cause some MacBook Air-style déjà vu when it launched last year. Like the original Air, it features one lonely USB port — only here, it’s based on the still-growing USB-C. No USB 3.1, no Thunderbolt, no HDMI, nothing else. Marque Brownlee/YouTube But, as always, there are plenty of accessories you can buy to make the MacBook more connected, from a $19 USB-C to USB adapter, to a $79 USB Digital AV Multiport adapter. Apple Which brings us to this year, and the headphone jack-less iPhone 7. Again, time will tell if Apple's push into wireless audio will prove wise. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \nUnlike most of the other swaps on this list, it's hard to say that the standard Apple is promoting here (Bluetooth) is clearly superior than the one it's replacing (3.5mm). \nBluetooth still has connection, battery life, and audio quality issues that have yet to be solved en masse. And for all of Apple's claims that the headphone jack was eating up valuable space, the iPhone 7 itself isn't notably thinner or longer-lasting than the iPhone 6s. \nIf you'd prefer to stay wired, you have to turn to a pair of Lightning-based headphones — which are still nowhere near as ubiquitous as 3.5mm pairs, and usually more expensive to boot — or use the included dongle. Extras of the latter go for $9. Finally, there's the new MacBook Pro. Though plenty other devices had adopted USB-C before the latest Mac's unveiling (MacBook included), Apple is one of the first to wipe away all other ports and exclusively use the standard on a notebook that's ostensibly designed for professionals. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nGiven the Pro's relatively modest upgrades, some of those professionals have questioned whether the slimmer design allowed by ditching the usual ports is worth the inconvenience of carrying a bunch of adapters. Making the switch will be annoying to start. \nHowever, unlike the iPhone 7's push toward Bluetooth and Lightning, the MacBook Pro is promoting a more advanced and more open technology. It has clear rough edges with compatibility and reliability today, but given some time, it should be the path forward. \nJust try not to lose your dongles in the meantime.  ",

      "text": "Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \nThe new MacBook Pro is here, and with it, the Mac line has completely hopped aboard the USB-C train. \nThat means no more standard USB-A ports, no more HDMI ports for connecting to a TV, and no more SD card readers for moving photos from your camera. \nIn their place, you either have to buy a new cable or some sort of adapter to keep your current gear relevant.  \nTo say the transition hasn't gone over well with hardcore Mac users is an understatement. That it comes just a couple months after Apple killed the still-ubiquitous headphone jack on the iPhone 7 hasn't helped. \nNevertheless, it’s worth remembering that Apple has helped lead the tech world down this path many times before. In most cases, we’ve all come out alright. \nSo to help you take a deep breath, let’s take a quick stroll down memory lane. In the process, you might see just how familiar the current dongle mania really is. \nThe Apple device that made the most drastic changes is also the one that brought the company back to life after years of struggle: the iMac G3. That all-in-one famously ditched the floppy disk when it launched in 1998, but it also did away with the SCSI and ADB ports Mac owners used for connecting hard drives and keyboards and mice, respectively. Mousse Mousse/Reuters \nIt's also worth noting that Apple, along with Sony, had previously helped shift the industry from 5-inch floppy disks to 3.5-inch floppy disks in the early 80s — though that’s not quite the same as removing them altogether.  \n\n\nIn their place were a couple of ports using USB, a then smallish standard that soon became the most widely accepted connector in consumer tech. YouTube \n\nApple got equally trigger-happy in 2008, when it launched a trio of new MacBooks, including the first-generation MacBook Air. That machine was incredibly slim for its time, but to get there, it had to lose the Ethernet port and the CD/DVD optical drive. AP \n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "print \nThomson Reuters \nWhen Apple unveiled the App Store in 2008, it effectively laid the groundwork for the the $51 billion-and-growing app economy we have today . \nOver the short history of the app store model, the lion's share of that revenue has gone towards consumer apps, as companies like Uber and Snap have become tech titans in their own right. But over the last year or so, we've seen business-focused companies try to stake their claims — Slack, for instance , launched its own app store and venture capital fund in late 2015. \nThis is nothing new for Atlassian, the $6 billion publicly-traded collaboration software company behind popular tools like the JIRA issue tracker or the HipChat work chat service . \nOn its most recent earnings call, Atlassian announced that its own Atlassian Marketplace recently hit $200 million in all-time revenue. And Zephyr, a startup that builds a software management tool designed to plug into Atlassian's JIRA, raised a $31 million round of funding in May 2016. \nBut, as software keeps eating the world, Atlassian spies an even larger opportunity. That's why Atlassian has hired its first-ever Vice President of Ecosystem, Max Mancini. \nAtlassian cofounders Mike Cannon-Brookes (left) and Scott Farquhar (right) Atlassian \nPreviously, Mancini had served as the head of engineering for Apple's online stores, and before that, as head of eBay's ecosystem and mobile shopping. Now, he'll be in charge of Atlassian's relationships with software developers, convincing them to build their businesses on the company's tech platform in the same way Uber has on iPhone and Android. \n\"For me, it's a bit of an ideology,\" Mancini says. \"I believe tech can help us be better people.\" The right tool for the job \nMancini says he was attracted to Atlassian by the simple fact that he was a big fan of the company's products — he had his team at Apple used HipChat to work with each other. \n\"When you're doing software in Silicon Valley as long as I have, you recognize the value of tools,\" Mancini says. \nApple already has a very established set of ways for getting things done, and so his efforts to get the team started with JIRA and HipChat met with \"a lot of resistance,\" Mancini says, \"as you might expect.\" \nOnce they were up to speed, though, his team found itself working better, faster, and smarter. It was an object lesson to him how the right software with the right team can make all the difference. \nThe Uber integration with Atlassian HipChat. Atlassian \nThat lesson tied into another he learned at eBay: A properly-maintained community of developers can make or break the success of a product. \n\"I saw the power of driving innovation,\" Mancini says. \nAt eBay, those developers were the ones building tools to let power-sellers do things like make and manage multiple listings; at Atlassian, it's tools like Tempo, that integrate timesheets into JIRA, or Sentry, which send alerts into HipChat when a developer's app goes down. \nIn either case, Mancini says, it's making the core business more accessible and more suitable for users that the main business could otherwise never reach. Opening up \nMancini says the key to the whole affair is openness, in more ways than one. \nFirst, it's a kind of technological openness: When Zephyr originally came around to Atlassian in the mid-2000's, looking to build tools that integrated with JIRA, company cofounders Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes simply sent over the source code and let them have at it, Mancini says employees have told him. \n\"I think that openness drove some early success,\" Mancini says. \nThe new JIRA Software, tailored for programming teams. Atlassian \nNow, his role is to figure out how to take that spirit of openness, and scale it out for developers of all shapes and sizes. That means building the infrastructure needed for developers to do what they do on top of Atlassian products, whether they're building new JIRA integrations for the Marketplace or just building custom tools for their own business. \n\"You have to be willing to allow tight integration,\" Mancini says. \nThere's a second kind of openness, too: Openness about what you're up to, Mancini says. If a developer is building their business on Atlassian, the last thing you want to do is take them by surprise with a new feature that could compete with what they're up to. The opportunity \nFor Atlassian, there are two major benefits to Mancini's philosophy of growth via ecosystem. \nFirst, it means that Atlassian can market to customers with tailor-made packages of products and partner apps that basically turn into a bespoke solution for different industries. That's important, as Atlassian looks to grow beyond its traditional core customer base of software developers and into new markets. \nSecond, since Atlassian takes a 25% cut of all transactions, a growing Atlassian Marketplace means a growing bottom line for the company. \nIt's a long-term investment, Mancini says, taking its early successes and looking to replicate what worked and fix what isn't. As the appetite for business software and new ways to work grows, Mancini says, the company is standing poised to take advantage. \n\"You have to plant seeds,\" Mancini says.",

      "title": "Apple's Touch Bar brings MacBook Pro 2016 to new level",
      "text": "November 28, 2016, 12:05 AM \nBy Jonathan Kevin Castillo \nApple’s new MacBook Pro is not just another refresh from older models. The new laptop comes with a lot of changes, big changes, like a massive trackpad, a redesigned keyboard, a great screen, slimmer than any MacBook Pro in the past; and it ships out with a space gray color, which looks really nice. However, the most important change about this year’s laptop, is the removal of the function keys, replaced with the all-new Touch Bar. \nThe Touch Bar is a strip of OLED that runs from where the ESC key all the way across to where the power button was. It is designed to change the way how you use laptops. Or at least, make things a little easier. \nThe Touch Bar’s functions changes depending on what app you have on. \nIf you’re watching movies, you can use it to go fast forward or rewind with the precision of your finger. \nIf you open up Safari, you will have quick access to tabs, bookmarks, and a search bar. When popping up Messages, you have a wide selection of emojis to choose from. \nYou can use the Touch Bar to change the screen’s brightness, volume, pause and play music. There is a dedicated Touch ID in the bar, which unlocks the laptop in a flash. There are many other uses for the Touch Bar and they all work on different apps installed to the MacBook Pro. \nTime to retire your mouse, because the MacBook Pro’s trackpad is big. It is wider than the space bar with both command keys. It is spacious, leaving a lot of room for your finger that you wouldn’t need a mouse for navigation. \nThe MacBook Pro’s keyboard has surprised us. In spite of its looks, the keyboard is comfortable. There may be some getting used to at first, as the keys are built a little too low in the laptop. That’s the price for having a thinner device. \nApple is ramming the future into its new devices, as the MacBook Pro has four USB 3.1 Thunderbolt ports. There is no memory card slot or ports where normal flashdrives can fit into for data transfers. \nThe screen gives us a maximum brightness of 500 nits. That is the brightest any laptop can ever give, so when it comes to lighting up the entire room like it was a street full of Christmas lights, the MacBook Pro will get the job done. With that said, the screen has 25% wider color gamut, plus a P3 color space, which means basically means, better colors. This is a feature considered important for creative people in film and photography. \nIn performance, the entry 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 2.9GHz dual-core i5 processor, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, and Intel Iris 550 graphics. It has a display resolution of 2560×1600 with 227ppi. \nThe 15-inch MacBook Pro has 2.6GHz quad-core i7 processor, 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM, and Intel Graphics 530, along with Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB of GDDR5 memory. With specs sheet like that, you’re pretty much secured when using power-hungry apps like Photoshop. \nSome laptop makers have decided on putting less emphasis on speakers as most people use headphones, anyway. \nApple on the other hand, added stereo speakers on the keyboard sides, and the result was a loud and clear audio, coming from a laptop. It’s actually a nice little enhancement that gives room for sharing. \nThe MacBook Pro points where Apple is headed with their laptops. It is fast and powerful. The Touch Bar is more intuitive than what some people have expected. It’s new, and it’s good.",

      "text": "A brief history of Apple killing off ports and drives you loved — and others you didn't (AAPL) Jeff Dunn, provided by | on November 27, 2016 \nReuters/Beck Diefenbach \nThe new MacBook Pro is here, and with it, the Mac line has completely hopped aboard the USB-C train. \nThat means no more standard USB-A ports, no more HDMI ports for connecting to a TV, and no more SD card readers for moving photos from your camera. \nIn their place, you either have to buy a new cable or some sort of adapter to keep your current gear relevant. \nTo say the transition hasn't gone over well with hardcore Mac users is an understatement. That it comes just a couple months after Apple killed the still-ubiquitous headphone jack on the iPhone 7 hasn't helped. \nNevertheless, it’s worth remembering that Apple has helped lead the tech world down this path many times before. In most cases, we’ve all come out alright. \nSo to help you take a deep breath, let’s take a quick stroll down memory lane. In the process, you might see just how familiar the current dongle mania really is. The Apple device that made the most drastic changes is also the one that brought the company back to life after years of struggle: the iMac G3. That all-in-one famously ditched the floppy disk when it launched in 1998, but it also did away with the SCSI and ADB ports Mac owners used for connecting hard drives and keyboards and mice, respectively. Mousse Mousse/Reuters \nIt's also worth noting that Apple, along with Sony, had previously helped shift the industry from 5-inch floppy disks to 3.5-inch floppy disks in the early 80s — though that’s not quite the same as removing them altogether. In their place were a couple of ports using USB, a then smallish standard that soon became the most widely accepted connector in consumer tech. YouTube Apple got equally trigger-happy in 2008, when it launched a trio of new MacBooks, including the first-generation MacBook Air. That machine was incredibly slim for its time, but to get there, it had to lose the Ethernet port and the CD/DVD optical drive. AP",

      "text": "The President-elect has vowed to bring Apple manufacturing back to the US. \nDonald Trump can impose tariffs on Chinese made goods, including iPhone. \nIn the event of a Chinese goods tariff, Apple would likely relocate manufacturing to India. \nAlthough a Trump tariff would do more harm than good, Trump's promise of a repatriation tax break would greatly benefit Apple. Following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock fell to about $105 as it was widely assumed that Trump's trade policies would be bad for Apple. Trump had threatened to force Apple to manufacture its products in the US. In fact, it's unlikely that Trump can compel Apple to do so, although he can make Apple products made in China more expensive by imposing tariffs. The harm this might do to Apple may be more than offset by Trump's corporate tax policy: a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15% and a one-time repatriation rate of 10%. Click to enlarge Never To Return In an interview with the NYTimes, Trump stated: \nI got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' Apple and its investors would indeed be very happy about a tax cut, and the prospect of repatriating Apple's $216 billion of cash held overseas at a 10% tax rate is enough to make any shareholder's mouth water. Getting Apple to build plants in the US? Not so much. Trump's ability to overturn the status quo regarding US jobs that have been lost overseas is probably more limited than he claimed during the campaign. At a dinner in 2011 in California attended by Steve Jobs and President Obama, Obama asked what it would take for Apple to make iPhones in the US. As reported by the NY Times: \nMr. Jobs's reply was unambiguous. \"Those jobs aren't coming back,\" he said, according to another dinner guest. Jobs was probably right. Typical monthly compensation at a Foxconn iPhone factory is about $400. IHS estimates that assembly and test of the iPhone 7 costs a mere $5, which amounts to about 2.5 hours of labor assuming that Foxconn workers work 200 hours/month (a lot of overtime is typical). US workers would probably receive 10 times the compensation, raising labor cost/phone if assembled in the US to $50. This is actually below the estimated $65-100/device impact that economists estimate would result from US production. In addition to the labor cost impact, there's the issue of availability of job skills and the responsiveness of manufacturers in the US. The NY Times article went on to describe other benefits of manufacturing in China: \nOne former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone's screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight. \nA foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. \n\"The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,\" the executive said. \"There's no American plant that can match that.\" What of the prospect of building highly automated plants that can minimize labor costs? Apple actually has a wealth of experience building such plants. In 1984, Apple opened what was hailed as \"one of the nation's most automated plants\" in order to produce Macintosh computers in Fremont, California. The effort was led by Matt Carter, Apple's manufacturing director. The video below will give you an idea of the complexity and cost of creating the Macintosh factory. Apple continued to manufacture Macs and peripherals at various sites in the US until 2004, when it shut down its last US plant. By this time, Apple had already moved most of its manufacturing to China, performed by contractors such as Foxconn. Three years before the advent of the iPhone, Apple had already abandoned manufacturing in the US, despite having the most advanced and automated plants available. If Apple couldn't make the economics of automated assembly in the US work for the Mac, is it reasonable to expect that it could do so for iPhone? I seriously doubt it. Automation is not a panacea for high labor costs. Automation brings its own set of labor costs, since highly skilled workers are required to program and maintain the \"machine that builds the machines.\" Furthermore, much of the manufacture of the iPhone already is automated. That includes manufacture of almost all the major components including the major electronic components such as the A series systems on chip. Manufacture of the screens and circuit card assemblies are undoubtedly automated by their respective suppliers. Final assembly of iPhones is currently a hand process requiring considerable manual dexterity. This is due to the delicate nature of the components and the limited space available in a mobile device. Whether this could ever be fully automated is questionable. All the manufacturing automation that can be done for iPhone is probably already being done. And it's being done overseas, where labor costs are lower even in the highly skilled areas needed to support automation. So even in automated manufacturing, the US is significantly cost disadvantaged. What Trump Can Do Although free trade and globalization have arguably been the root cause of the loss of many manufacturing jobs in the US, Trump claims to be fighting for free trade. According to Trump, the problem is trading partners, such as China, who aren't living up to free trade agreements. Yet Trump seems to be anxious to scrap or significantly modify existing free trade agreements. According to his \" 7 Point Plan To Rebuild the American Economy \", he intends to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and modify or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, both of which have received considerable bi-partisan support. By virtue of various laws enacted since WW I, Congress has delegated most of its Constitutionally mandated power to impose tariffs to the President. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese made goods (including iPhone), as well as file unfair trade practice complaints against China in the World Trade Organization (WTO). There's plenty of precedence. In 2009, President Obama imposed a 35% tariff on Chinese made tires on the grounds that China was dumping them in the US. China subsequently retaliated with tariffs on US chicken and automotive parts. The WTO sided with the US, but the matter is still under appeal . If Trump imposed a 35% tariff on Chinese made electronics, it would certainly tilt iPhone costs in favor of manufacturing somewhere besides China. But in the interim it would increase iPhone costs to consumers, as well as virtually all other Chinese made electronics. Not only Apple would be hurt, but many other companies as well, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). A tariff also would almost certainly lead to retaliatory actions by China, not only in tariffs, but in regulatory actions against US companies doing business in China. A Trump tariff could definitely hurt Apple as well as other US companies in the near term. It's unlikely a Trump tariff would ultimately succeed in bringing back US manufacturing jobs. It's more likely that those jobs would simply move from China to regions such as Southeast Asia and India that are not under the Trump tariff. Fortunately, Trump has not explicitly threatened to withdraw from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that has been the fundamental regulatory mechanism for free trade, or from the World Trade Organization which administers GATT. I consider this a hopeful sign that Trump will stop short of igniting an all-out trade war with China. One of the points of the 7 Point Plan specifically calls for working within the WTO: \n6. Instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO. Investor Takeaway Although Donald Trump has the power to inflict some harm on trade relations with China, as well as Apple, I think it's unlikely that he will hurt Apple in the long run. The immediate impact of a tariff would be to increase the cost of Apple products until such time as Apple could move product assembly out of China to another low cost region. I think it's likely that the Republican establishment will try to moderate Trump's views, seeing the potential damage that a large tariff could do. But a tariff of some form is probably on its way. So, there is some near-term downside for Apple due to a Trump tariff, which may cause some downward pressure on the stock. This is largely offset by the prospect of a huge repatriation windfall for investors. If Apple only gives half of its offshore cash (after taxes) to investors as a one-time dividend, it would still amount to about $18/share. This would make the lackluster YTD stock price gain of about 6% much easier to bear. I think the repatriation benefit makes it worthwhile to accumulate Apple, even if Trump goes ahead with a tariff. I continue to be long Apple and recommend Apple as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.

      "text": "Home Technology Apple Watch Deals End Cyber Monday Apple Watch Deals End Cyber Monday Like \nThere are a lot of deals going on for the Apple Watch as the company tries to sell it for $198 during its Black Friday deals. But there is a catch. \nWell, it’s Black Friday 2016 and the new Apple Watch is on sale for $198 at Target, falling below the $200 price point for the first time during the holiday season. \nEvery other day but Black Friday weekend, this iWatch normally sells for $270. That’s a $72 discount on the refreshed Apple Watch. \nNow, it’s not the Apple Watch 2, but it’s also not the Apple Watch 1. This is the newer Apple Watch Series 1 that comes with the Apple Watch 2 dual-core processor. \nThat means it’s just as fast as the Apple Watch 2 at $369, which doesn’t have a Black Friday deal anywhere we have seen. It’s our recommended Apple Watch for most people. You’re just missing out on GPS and waterproofing, so unless your a running or a swimmer, this shouldn’t matter very much. \nNot surprisingly, this is a limited-time Black Friday deal, as it expires at the end of the day on Saturday, as soon as Cyber Sunday begins. \nThere’s no telling if Target or any other US retailer will keep the Apple Watch on sale through Cyber Monday. It may come as another deal, or go back to full price, but include a gift card bonus. \nYour best bet is to order the new Apple Watch Series 1 right now, see if the deal gets sweeter (which it likely won’t, according to Black Friday deal history) and either keep, cancel or return your new Apple Watch. That way, you’re sure to get the best Apple Watch price no matter what.",

      "text": "A brief history of Apple killing off ports and drives you loved ' and others you didn't (AAPL) Published by Business Insider on Sun, 27 Nov 2016 The new MacBook Pro is here, and with it, the Mac line has completelyhopped aboard the USB-C train.That means no more standard USB-A ports, no more HDMI ports for connecting to a TV, and no more SD card readers for movingphotos from your camera.In theirplace, you either have to buya new cable or some sort of adapter to keep your current gearrelevant.To say the transition hasn't gone over well with hardcore Mac users is an understatement. That it comes just a couple months after Apple killed the still-ubiquitous headphone jack on the iPhone 7 hasn'thelped.Nevertheless, it's worth remembering that Apple has helped lead the tech world down this pathmany times before. In most cases, we've all come out alright.So to help you take a deep breath, let's take a quick stroll down memory lane. In the process, you might see just how familiar the current dongle maniareallyis.SEE ALSO:25 essential tips and tricks for Mac ownersThe Apple device that made the most drastic changes is also the one that brought the company back to life after years of struggle: the iMac G3. That all-in-one famously ditched the floppy disk when it launched in 1998, but it also did away with the SCSI and ADB ports Mac owners used for connecting hard drives and keyboards and mice, respectively.It's also worth noting that Apple, along with Sony, had previously helpedshift the industry from 5-inch floppy disks to 3.5-inch floppy disks in the early 80sthough thats not quite the same as removing them altogether.In their place were a couple of ports using USB, a then smallish standard that soon became the most widely accepted connector in consumer tech.Apple got equally trigger-happy in 2008, when it launched a trio of new MacBooks, including the first-generation MacBook Air. That machine was incredibly slim for its time, but to get there, it had to lose the Ethernet port and the CD/DVD optical drive.See the rest of the story at Business Insider",

      "title": "$6 billion Atlassian just hired this former Apple exec to grow its next big business",
      "text": "When Apple unveiled the App Store in 2008, it effectively laid the groundwork for the the $51 billion-and-growing app economy we have today.\nOver the short history of the app store model, the lion's share of that revenue has gone towards consumer apps, as companies like Uber and Snap have become tech titans in their own right.  But over the last year or so, we've seen business-focused companies try to stake their claims —  Slack, for instance , launched its own app store and venture capital fund in late 2015. \nThis is nothing new for Atlassian, the $6 billion publicly-traded collaboration software company behind popular tools like the JIRA issue tracker or the HipChat work chat service .\nOn its most recent earnings call, Atlassian announced that its own Atlassian Marketplace recently hit $200 million in all-time revenue. And Zephyr, a startup that builds a software management tool designed to plug into Atlassian's JIRA, raised a $31 million round of funding in May 2016.\nBut, as software keeps eating the world, Atlassian spies an even larger opportunity. That's why Atlassian has hired its  first-ever Vice President of Ecosystem, Max Mancini. \nThomson Reuters \nPreviously, Mancini had served as the head of engineering for Apple's online stores, and before that, as head of eBay's ecosystem and mobile shopping. Now, he'll be in charge of Atlassian's relationships with software developers, convincing them to build their businesses on the company's tech platform in the same way Uber has on iPhone and Android. \n\"For me, it's a bit of an ideology,\" Mancini says. \"I believe tech can help us be better people.\" \nThe right tool for the job Mancini says he was attracted to Atlassian by the simple fact that he was a big fan of the company's products — he had his team at Apple used HipChat to work with each other. \n\"When you're doing software in Silicon Valley as long as I have, you recognize the value of tools,\" Mancini says. \nApple already has a very established set of ways for getting things done, and so his efforts to get the team started with JIRA and HipChat met with \"a lot of resistance,\" Mancini says, \"as you might expect.\"  \nOnce they were up to speed, though, his team found itself working better, faster, and smarter. It was an object lesson to him how the right software with the right team can make all the difference. \nThomson Reuters \nThat lesson tied into another he learned at eBay: A properly-maintained community of developers can make or break the success of a product. \n\"I saw the power of driving innovation,\" Mancini says. \nAt eBay, those developers were the ones building tools to let power-sellers do things like make and manage multiple listings; at Atlassian, it's tools like Tempo, that integrate timesheets into JIRA, or Sentry, which send alerts into HipChat when a developer's app goes down. \nIn either case, Mancini says, it's making the core business more accessible and more suitable for users that the main business could otherwise never reach. \nOpening up Mancini says the key to the whole affair is openness, in more ways than one. \nFirst, it's a kind of technological openness: When Zephyr originally came around to Atlassian in the mid-2000's, looking to build tools that integrated with JIRA, company cofounders Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes simply sent over the source code and let them have at it, Mancini says employees have told him. \n\"I think that openness drove some early success,\" Mancini says.  \nThomson Reuters \nNow, his role is to figure out how to take that spirit of openness, and scale it out for developers of all shapes and sizes. That means building the infrastructure needed for developers to do what they do on top of Atlassian products, whether they're building new JIRA integrations for the Marketplace or just building custom tools for their own business. \n\"You have to be willing to allow tight integration,\" Mancini says.  \nThere's a second kind of openness, too: Openness about what you're up to, Mancini says. If a developer is building their business on Atlassian, the last thing you want to do is take them by surprise with a new feature that could compete with what they're up to. \nThe opportunity For Atlassian, there are two major benefits to Mancini's philosophy of growth via ecosystem.  \nFirst, it means that Atlassian can market to customers with tailor-made packages of products and partner apps that basically turn into a bespoke solution for different industries. That's important, as Atlassian looks to grow beyond its traditional core customer base of software developers and into new markets. \nSecond, since Atlassian takes a 25% cut of all transactions, a growing Atlassian Marketplace means a growing bottom line for the company. \nIt's a long-term investment, Mancini says, taking its early successes and looking to replicate what worked and fix what isn't. As the appetite for business software and new ways to work grows, Mancini says, the company is standing poised to take advantage. \n\"You have to plant seeds,\" Mancini says.   \nNOW WATCH: The creator of the Mac startup chime reveals how he snuck in the iconic sound \n",

      "text": "Samsung is paying attention to Apple when it comes to plotting the course of it smartphone division. According to numerous reports, the Galaxy S8 will bring over a few features that are surely coming on the iPhone 8 next year (all-screen design with buttons and sensors incorporated into the display) and features that are available in this year’s iPhone 7 (3D Touch support, dual-lens rear camera, and a personal voice assistant). That doesn’t mean the Galaxy S8 won’t turn out to be a great phone. In fact, there’s at least one new Galaxy S8 feature that’s worth getting excited for: that personal voice assistant that Samsung never had.\nDEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now! \nGone are those days now, as Samsung has acquired Viv, a startup that makes Siri-like products. In fact, one of the people behind Viv worked on Siri for Apple in the early days. And, rumors are saying that Viv might be a lot better.\nAccording to GalaxyClub, the Galaxy S8’s AI assistant will come with two personalities, including male (Bixby) and female (Kestra) voices, and bring over support for mobile payments by voice.\nThe site discovered new AI-related trademark applications filed in South Korea and the European Union, which mention the two names and variations thereof.\nInterestingly, the name Bixby Pay has also been spotted, suggesting that Samsung is looking to let people pay for goods by simply voicing the appropriate instruction to either Bixby or Kestra.\nThis might be just of the novel AI features heading to virtual assistants next year, and probably one of the tricks coming out of Viv’s coffers.\nSiri currently does voice payments via PayPal, and Apple’s virtual assistant might get iMessage peer-to-peer payments support in the future.\nTrending right now: \nWarning: Target’s Black Friday ‘sale’ on the iPhone is a massive rip-off Ratings for ‘The Walking Dead’ are the lowest they’ve been since 2012 Two of eBay’s most popular Black Friday 2016 deals are still available today See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple’s MacBook Pro is Selling Hot, But Performance is Not The Associated Press by Chriss W. Street 26 Nov 2016 Newport Beach, CA 0 26 Nov, 2016 26 Nov, 2016 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Apple’s new MacBook Pro is a hot seller, but nasty performance reviews for high-end applications will eventually cause sales to slow dramatically. \nAccording to BGR.com, “ You probably shouldn’t buy a new MacBook Pro right now ,” because “ Apple has completely abandoned its core base of creative professionals.” SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nSlice Intelligence , backed by supply-chain reports of increased component orders, reported that Apple’s new MacBook Pro line set an online sales records in its first five days by outselling every high-profile laptop on the market, including the Dell XPS 13 and 15 that have been available for ten months. It also sold 4 times as many units as Microsoft’s highly-acclaimed Surface Book introduced last year. \nThe MacBook Pro suffered 10 delays over 2 years before its November release featuring the Intel sixth-generation Skylake processor. High-end laptops from HP and others are already shipping products with Intel’s seventh-gen Kaby Lake that can support greater random access memory (RAM). \nDuring the endless delays, Slice found that high-end power users showed a willingness to switch to Windows-powered machines. Among those who had purchased an Apple laptop in 2014, 40 percent bought another brand since. Slice based its statistics on the behavior of a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers that it continuously tracks. \nApple’s 2016 Worldwide Developer Conference in June was panned because the company did not announce any hardware enhancements for the type of high-end creative applications that have allowed Apple to charge premium prices across its entire product line. Apple’s marketing group reassured attendees that the new MacBook Pro delay was aimed at incorporating disruptive low power features to maximize battery life. \nBut the only reason the just released top-end MacBook Pro 15 inch model weighing 4 lbs. and selling for $1,799 gets a superior 10 hours of battery life, is that the product’s maximum RAM configuration is only 16 gigabytes (GB). \nThe real reason behind the inability to upgrade to a 32GB of RAM configuration, according to a tech tear-down thread shared on Reddit, is the MacBook Pro mobile proprietary currently interface does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) RAM. \nEarly MacBook Pro buyers are complaining that they can “eat 16GB in a few milliseconds” doing sophisticated design, architectural and financial simulations. With the lack of memory causing glitches and pauses, many users are being forced to close tabs and shut down their browsers to save up to 7GB of memory. \nDespite the hype about the new “ touch bar ” on higher end MacBook Pro models that replace the physical function keys, Apple still refuses to make Mac OS with the type of touch screen applications that were introduced with Windows 8 in 2011. \nMac users unsure about whether or not to upgrade, should probably wait until mid-2017 when Apple will have lowered the price of its MacBook Pro line and incorporated Intel’s eighth-gen Cannonlake processor that are being designed to support for 32GB of RAM and use 15-25% less power consumption, according to MacRumors.

      "text": "Homeless in Vancouver: Apple and Samsung race to patent flexible smartphones by Stanley Q. Woodvine   9:03 AM 1 of 4 2 of 4 \nApple Inc. made news on November 22 when it was granted a U.S. patent for an iPhone design that uses a flexible OLED display and can fold in half like a man’s wallet. Gosh golly, right? \nActually Apple already has a few patents for folding touchscreen phones; this latest one—U.S. Patent No. 9,504,170 for “flexible display devices”, which Apple originally filed in 2014, is especially notable for employing both an OLED display as well as possibly nickel titanium alloy, aka, nitinol, which exhibits both shape memory and superelasticity. \nAn OLED display works without a backlight, so it displays deeper blacks and facilitates thinner and lighter hardware designs than a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) can also be bonded onto thin sheet plastic, allowing display screens that are flexible to a degree. \nHowever, as the Guardian points out , Apple’s latest flexible iPhone patent shows a patently impossible degree of flexibility. OLED displays cannot currently fold perfectly flat like a piece of paper—not without leaving a permanent, damaging crease. \nBut that’s Apple: always trying to bend reality, always wanting its own way, always thinking differently. Samsung’s latest effort along the same lines is a bit more…flexible, reality-wise. Samsung’s less rigid approach to flexibility Images from Samsung's April 2016 filing for a flexible device. \nIn March and April of 2016 Samsung filed two different patents with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, both for smartphones that can fold in half—screen and all. \nDetails and images from the March patent filing only appear on the Dutch website GalaxyClub, along with an unfortunately broken link to the patent filing itself. \nHowever, Samsung’s original April patent filing for a “flexible device” is available. The filing is in the Korean language but its extensive illustrations, also first revealed on GalaxyClub , speak volumes. \nA succession of detailed images show a typical touchscreen phone form factor with a hard-shell body that employs an intricate, segmented hinge. This hinge allows the phone body and flexible OLED display to fold in half gently, without putting a crease in the display. Close-up of the Surface Book hinge. Microsoft \nThe hinge shown in the April Samsung flexible phone patent looks similar in method and result to the hinge used on the Microsoft Surface Book . \nSamsung has applied for at least 40 patents relating to folding and/or flexible smartphones and displays, going back to 2012, according to the PatentlyMoble website . Tech watchers have been expecting the Korean electronics giant to come out with a flexible smartphone any day now for the last few years. \nBut aside from the round-sided Edge smartphones and curved display monitors Samsung has yet to come out with a consumer product using a flexible OLED screen. \nApple, which has applied for relatively few flexible display device patents over the years, uses a flexible OLED display in its Apple Watch. \nIn June, at Lenovo’s Tech World, the Chinese computer maker showed off actual, functioning engineering concepts of two foldable devices : a tablet-phone and a bendable wrist-phone.

      "text": "Laptops Did Apple ship $4099 MacBook Pros with a faulty GPU? The dGPU curse has passed over to Apple's latest MacBook Pros, with owners of the $4000+ model reporting serious video issues \nIt appears that Apple's new $2399 MacBook Pro may have some sort of hardware fault, with quite a few users reporting similar video and screen tearing/flickering issues that could be linked to the ultrabook's Radeon Pro discrete GPUs. \nThe issues seem to be affecting the latest 15-inch MacBook Pro models outfitted with a dedicated GPU from AMD's new Radeon Pro 400 Series , suggesting that a faulty graphics card could be the culprit. Many frustrated Apple users have been sharing their horror stories on the MacRumor Forums , and some aren't even able to use their MacBook Pros without visual issues. \nThe glitches appear to be widespread in the initial first wave of MacBook Pros, with Radeon Pro 450 and Radeon Pro 460 users reporting what appear to be symptoms of video card failure--artifacts, distorted colors, flickering and tearing. Bear in mind that the Radeon Pro 460 MacBook Pros cost a staggering $4,099, so at that price you'd expect everything to be in tip-top shape. \nTo illustrate how widespread the problems may actually be, 9 to 5 Mac ran a poll asking MacBook Pro owners if they're having problems--a whopping 47%, or 713 users, said they had problems with their 15-inch Radeon Pro 460-powered MacBook Pros. \nDespite the evidence, we can't be exactly sure what's causing the problem. Some users say the screen glitches out while running Adobe apps like Premiere Pro, especially with Adobe Media Encoder. Some suggest it could be a driver fault, whereas others are pretty sure its the dGPU. \nOn the other hand, an Apple Store technician apparently told one affected user that it sounded like a hardware problem . \"I put my new MBP to work right away and edited a project in Premiere Pro. \n\"When I used the Adobe Media Encoder the graphics card freaked out and computer crashed. \n\"I went to the Apple Store and they said it's probably a hardware problem. So I ordered a new one. \n\"I kept the MPB I have now because when I switched over to FCPX everything seems to be working fine. \n\"But the technician said I shouldn't trust it after I showed him the video of it freaking out. \n\"I have the Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory\" \nOne MacBook Pro owner apparently found an exact trigger for the glitch, which seems to happen when a specific process maxes out the onboard Radeon Pro GPU. \"I was letting Photos do its thing syncing 13k images, and all of a sudden the whole system locked up and was flashing violently with red/green hues and a sort of checkerboard pattern. \n\"For me the panics occur when the upload process runs and \"ImageConversionService\" maxes out the GPU. \n\"All the .gpurestart and kernel panic logs in Console point to an interaction between \"com.apple.photos.ImageConversionService\" and the discrete video card.\" \nThis actually isn't the first time that this has happened, and Apple's dGPU MacBook Pros have a long history with serious video problems . \nIt'll be interesting to see how Apple officially responds to this apparent outbreak, but with these kinds of prices, it's absolutely unacceptable that this is happening at all. \nI'm sure that the affected users will be taken care of eventually, but it's still extremely disappointing realizing you spent $2300 or $4000 on a lemon.",

      "text": "How to use AirPlay with Apple TV Submitted by Fred Straker on November 27, 2016 - 3:25pm \nOne of the key advantages to Apple TV for iPhone owners is AirPlay. While tvOS continues to offer new features and easy access to content, sometimes sharing content directly from the iPhone to the big screen is best. In fact, since AirPlay is peer-to-peer technology, friends and family interested in showing photos or video from their iPhones don't even have to be connected to the local Wi-Fi network. Once the Apple TV is set up, follow these steps to share from any app on the iPhone using AirPlay : \nApps supporting AirPlay On the iPhone, make sure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both ON under Settings. The iPhone does not have to be connected to a Wi-Fi network. If the app supports AirPlay directly, tap the AirPlay icon. Tap the Apple TV in the list to start streaming live content to Apple TV immediately. \nNo AirPlay support On the iPhone, make sure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both ON under Settings. The iPhone does not have to be connected to a Wi-Fi network. If the app does not support AirPlay, swipe up from the bottom to open Control Center. Tap the AirPlay Mirroring button from the menu. Select the Apple TV in the list to start mirroring the iPhone display on the Apple TV. Note that everything you do on the iPhone will appear on the television until mirroring is switched off. tags:",

      "text": "Few people took Mr Donald Trump seriously when he said in March that he'd \"get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China\". But his election appears to have caused a change of heart.\nApple has reportedly asked the two Asian companies that assemble the bulk of its iPhones to assess whether they can bring the work to the United States. One of them, Foxconn, has agreed to look into the matter.\nMr Trump's supporters have embraced this news as a sign of his power to persuade wayward corporations to make the US great again. But as Apple and its manufacturing partners know, and as President-elect Trump will soon find out, it'll never happen. The US lacks the workforce and supply chains necessary for Apple to move its iPhone operation back home. And more to the point, Americans shouldn't want it to.\nAlthough Apple's original supply chain included a suburban American garage, Asia quickly became central to the company's growth.\nIn 1981, it opened a facility in Singapore to manufacture logic boards and other components. It was a no-brainer, according to a manager who ran the facility: \"We find that no country can provide the combination of infrastructure, technical ability, supporting industries, governmental efficiency, support and incentives that Singapore offers.\"\nIn the decades that followed, China emulated Singapore's approach on a massive scale, developing industrial clusters with world-class infrastructure and offering land and subsidies to companies willing to relocate. By 2004, Apple had shut down its last US manufacturing operation, and China had become the industrial hub of its global empire.\nLow labour costs and minimal regulation were certainly part of China's appeal. But the most important factor was its huge and nimble workforce.\nThe main iPhone facility in Zhengzhou now employs 110,000 workers, with other factories employing hundreds of thousands more. China's 270 million migrant labourers - most of them ambitious and opportunistic - have proven indispensable to a business that prizes flexibility. Last summer, Apple contractors reportedly hired 100,000 workers to ramp up production of the iPhone 6s in advance of its autumn release.\nNothing comparable could ever happen in the US, no matter what the president wants. A mass mobilisation on that scale, and at that speed, likely hasn't been attempted since World War II. And there's little reason to think it would be successful or desirable today, even if Apple was willing to try.\nFinding enough skilled labour wouldn't be much easier. Apple CEO Tim Cook told 60 Minutes last year that, thanks to better vocational education, China now has a more skilful workforce than the US. Apple's executives estimate that they would need 8,700 industrial engineers to oversee 200,000 assembly-line workers, yet only 7,000 students completed university-level industrial- engineering programmes in the US in 2014. Shenzhen, by contrast, is home to 240,000 Foxconn employees - and millions of additional engineers and labourers.\nSuch a heavy concentration of manufacturing and skills in one place gives China its other major advantage. Most of the hundreds of parts that go into an iPhone are made a short distance from where the devices are assembled. This speeds up production, reduces the need for warehousing and trims logistics costs. Those factories can also ramp up production as quickly as Apple needs, thanks to a ready supply of labour. It's an industrial ecosystem that took decades to evolve, and it's not going to relocate to the US.\nMoreover, Americans shouldn't want it to. That ecosystem has made Apple one of the world's most profitable companies, supporting two million domestic jobs. It's what allows Americans to buy some incredible gadgets at a (relatively) affordable price. And it's helping to give rise to a vast and tech-savvy Asian middle class - which will produce plenty of customers for American goods and services. All that would disappear if Apple were somehow forced to ship production back to US shores, likely doubling its costs in the process.\nIf Mr Trump wants to revive manufacturing in the US, it will require more than hectoring Apple. It will mean supporting vocational education on a huge scale, offering Chinese-style industrial subsidies and waiting around for decades for all of it to have an effect - all in pursuit of tedious, low-paid jobs that are increasingly obsolete as industrial robots improve.\nIn reality, an American iPhone is likely just one more empty campaign promise. And that's for the best.\nBLOOMBERG\n•Adam Minter is based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and junk. \nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on November 28, 2016, with the headline 'Sorry, Trump, but iPhones should still be made in China'.

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nHere's a look at four stocks that could make notable moves as the holiday shopping season officially kicks off. Ulta Beauty \nUlta Beauty ( ULTA ), which reports earnings on Thursday, closed Friday at 263.62, in sight of a double-bottom-base buy point at 268.88. Shares were able to find support at the 200-day line on Nov. 7 and have risen in 13 of the last 14 sessions. The beauty segment is expected to be a hot performer again this holiday season, which should benefit Ulta and potentially its stock. Best Buy \nBest Buy ( BBY ) and Amazon are competing for your consumer electronics spending for the remainder of the year. Best Buy gave bullish holiday guidance earlier this month. Shares surged 14% on earnings to become quickly extended from a 40.31 buy point. The stock closed Friday at 46.58, nearly 16% above the entry. When a stock is 20% to 25% above a buy point, that's a good time to take at least partial profits. Amazon \nAmazon ( AMZN ) has been a highflying stock this year, but shares recently corrected as much as 16% in the wake of the e-commerce giant's latest earnings report. But the stock has now started to climb higher, and is nearing its 50-day line. At 780.37, it's 8% below an 847.31 buy point. Stellar Black Friday weekend stats could boost Amazon. Apple \nApple ( AAPL ) is also expected to benefit from its new product releases — the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2 and MacBook Pro — this holiday quarter. Like Amazon, Apple has fallen off its peak and is still below the 50-day line. But it has retaken its 110.33 buy point, initially cleared Sept. 14, closing Friday at 111.79. Apple also is building a new base with a potential buy point at 118.79. Stock-ing Stuffers \nAnd if you're still looking for stocking stuffers for your portfolio, Patrick Industries ( PATK ) and Cantel Medical ( CMN ) are both staging breakouts from bases. Chipmakers Cirrus Logic ( CRUS ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are nearing buy points as well, while Semtech ( SMTC ) closed right at a 23.30 buy point ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday.

      "text": "MacBook Pro 2016 shows Apple is increasingly in a no-win situation when it comes to narrow product focus intersecting the widest possible audiences. If they spec bump and spec bump alone, they're no longer innovating. If they make larger changes, they're abandoning the traditional pro market.\nSomewhere between a solid block of aluminum and Homer Simpson's MacBook Pro, though, Apple has made something incredibly interesting.\nAdam Geitgey, writing on Medium :\nBut in some ways, the new MacBook Pro is the most techy and expandable laptop Apple has ever made. They are trusting their pro users to wade into murky USB-C waters in search of the holy grail of a universal, open standard for moving data and power between devices.\nI'm not here to change your mind about the MacBook Pro. Yes, it's probably too expensive and more RAM is better than less RAM. But everyone posting complaints without actually using a MBP for a few weeks is missing out on all the clever things you can do because it is built on USB-C. Over the past week or two with a new MacBook Pro (15in, 2.9ghz, TouchBar), I've been constantly surprised with how USB-C makes new things possible. It's a kind of a hacker's dream.\nI think history — and customers — will look back more favorably on the MacBook Pro than tech Twitter would have many believe. Yes, dongles are a drag, but we've been dealing with them forever. At least with four USB-C / Thunderbolt 3, I can plug in to any of them to charge, and I can plug any dongle into any of them, meaning I can make any port be anything I want.\nJust how far in will Apple go with USB-C, though? Neither the Magic accessories nor the Siri Remote charge via USB-C, but by Lightning.\nOn iPhone and iPad, Apple wasn't patient enough to wait for USB-C. Instead, they drove forward with the similar-though-proprietary Lightning connector and got out a few years ahead.\nIt's slimmer and Apple doesn't have to wait on standards bodies to debate changes. But it doesn't benefit from the momentum that's turning USB-C's way.\nMany people were outraged by the switch from 30-pin to Lightning after just a decade. How many would be outraged by the switch from Lightning to USB-C after only 5 years?\nMacBook Pro MacBook Pro review Touch Bar: The ultimate guide MacBook news MacBook forums Buy at Apple ",

      "text": "  New MacBook Pro users need to be warned about installing Windows on their new devices. According to numerous reports on both the Reddit and the MacRumors forums , some early users reported damaged speakers because of loud pops and distorted audio that apparently originated from a faulty Windows Audio driver that was installed by Boot Camp. It does not seem to matter which model of MacBook you run, both the 13 and the 15 inch model are affected. We also experienced this problem during our test of the 15 inch model, which now has a damaged left speaker. We will update our test shortly to reflect this unexpected development. There seem to be a couple of ways to prevent the problem from occurring however: Do not install Windows or Boot Camp drivers until this issue is resolved. Install inoffical Realtek audio drivers, for instance these . Plug in your headphones or turn off the speakers in the audio settings. If your speakers are damaged already you will need to have your MacBook Pro repaired or exchanged by Apple. See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

      "text": "NEW YORK Thanksgiving weekend shoppers picked up hot toys, TVs and new Apple products, buying both online and in stores, but spent less per person because of rampant discounting that they've come to demand.\nOnce all the receipts are in, customers look to have spent an average of $289.19 over the four-day weekend, down nearly 3.5 percent from a year ago, based on a survey by the National Retail Federation. The pressure on prices was especially strong on products like TVs.\nMore than 154 million customers said they had shopped or planned to this up from 151 million a year ago, according to the survey conducted Friday and Saturday by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. And more were doing it online, as about 99.1 million went to the stores and 108.5 million shopped online.\nCarmen Cunnyngham of Kansas City, Kansas, was in Denver on Sunday and decided to stop at the mall to pick up a new pair of Ugg boots for her daughter. They were discounted at Nordstrom, which is one of her favorite places to shop. She said she got a bit of a late start this year because of the presidential election, so she's been looking online for deals and jumping when she sees them.\n\"I'm trying to make sure I get the wish lists in and look at those and shop and do what I can before Christmas gets here,\" she said.\nThe drop in spending underscores how even with an improving economy, many shoppers are still focused on habit developed during the Great Recession. They're fixated on deals and more readily using technology to find them whenever they want to buy. More than a third of customers surveyed by the NRF said that all of their purchases were on sale, up 11 percent from a year ago.\nThe Thanksgiving weekend kicks off the holiday shopping season but stores have increasingly started their sales earlier. Stores had been wary about being left with a lot of inventory they would have to discount to get off the shelves, and so started the season with less on hand. That will help preserve profit margins, but they've still planned aggressive promotions to grab shoppers.\n\"People are much more deliberate about the purchases they make,\" NRF CEO Matthew Shay said Sunday. \"In a perfect world, everyone would sell at full price, but as consumers and as buyers all of us would like to get a deal on things we buy. The era of promotional sales is with us to stay.\"\nEven though shoppers are spending less per person, more shoppers could still translate into more spending. MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks spending on all kinds of payments, estimated that spending over the four-day weekend will be up 3.8 percent, with online sales up by double-digit percentages and in-store sales up in the single digits. But MasterCard Advisors' Sarah Quinlan also cited a slight decline in the average sale because of promotions.\nStores trying to snag customers first and compete with Amazon are shifting to a steady stream of online discounts and alerts instead of focusing on doorbuster sales on a few products. That meant that online shopping stole thunder away from sales at stores. And while areas like electronics and toys remained strong for the weekend, clothing, particularly basic sweaters, were still a tough sell.\nShoppers are visiting fewer stores and the rate at which browsers converted into buyers was slightly lower than last year, said William Taubman, chief operating officer at Taubman Centers, which operates 24 malls around the country. Still, after a contentious presidential election, he believes people are ready to buy.\n\"Resolution is a good thing,\" he said. \"That makes people feel somewhat more comfortable.\" And for wealthier customers, he said, the prospects of tax cuts will help.\nJanice Allsop, 66, a retired secretary who worked in the trucking industry, said she'll likely spend more this year because of the election.\n\"The stock markets have gone up. I'm just delighted with President Trump,\" said Allsop, who was shopping at Water Tower Place mall in Chicago on Saturday. \"I'm not afraid (to spend more). If Hillary Clinton would have gotten in, I would have been very scared, very reluctant.\"\nBut shoppers may still be split. Joyce Hill, a 67-year-old retired auto worker from Inkster, Michigan, who was also shopping in Chicago. Hill said she will stay on the low end of her usual spending this year because she's worried that Trump will start to cut back on Social Security.\n\"I'll spend less because you don't know what's going to happen. I don't think he'll (Trump) support us but I don't know if he's gonna let things stay status quo,\" said Hill.\nEven though the weekend bring many out shopping, Black Friday usually vies with the Saturday before Christmas as the busiest sales day. But this year, that falls on Christmas Eve, so Saturday, Dec. 17 is the big contender, says Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. The retail trade group's survey found that fewer shoppers had finished their holiday buying and more hadn't even started compared to a year ago.\n\"We've seen in recent years that most places will have good sales after Black Friday comes and goes, so we don't have to do everything this weekend,\" said William Junkin, who was at the Best Buy store in Howell on Thursday night. \"We'll see how it all plays out.\"\n Sadie Gurman in Denver, Don Babwin in Chicago, Bruce Shipkowski in Howell Township, New Jersey and Josh Boak in Washington, D.C.

      "title": "Thanksgiving weekend shoppers spent less due to discounts",
      "text": "NEW YORK Thanksgiving weekend shoppers picked up hot toys, TVs and new Apple products, buying both online and in stores, but spent less per person because of rampant discounting that they've come to demand.\nOnce all the receipts are in, customers look to have spent an average of $289.19 over the four-day weekend, down nearly 3.5 percent from a year ago, based on a survey by the National Retail Federation. The pressure on prices was especially strong on products like TVs.\nMore than 154 million customers said they had shopped or planned to this Thanksgiving weekend, up from 151 million a year ago, according to the survey conducted Friday and Saturday by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. And more were doing it online, as about 99.1 million went to the stores and 108.5 million shopped online.\nCarmen Cunnyngham of Kansas City, Kansas, was in Denver on Sunday and decided to stop at the mall to pick up a new pair of Ugg boots for her daughter. They were discounted at Nordstrom, which is one of her favorite places to shop. She said she got a bit of a late start this year because of the presidential election, so she's been looking online for deals and jumping when she sees them.\n\"I'm trying to make sure I get the wish lists in and look at those and shop and do what I can before Christmas gets here,\" she said.\nThe drop in spending underscores how even with an improving economy, many shoppers are still focused on habit developed during the Great Recession. They're fixated on deals and more readily using technology to find them whenever they want to buy. More than a third of customers surveyed by the NRF said that all of their purchases were on sale, up 11 percent from a year ago.\nThe Thanksgiving weekend kicks off the holiday shopping season but stores have increasingly started their sales earlier. Stores had been wary about being left with a lot of inventory they would have to discount to get off the shelves, and so started the season with less on hand. That will help preserve profit margins, but they've still planned aggressive promotions to grab shoppers.\n\"People are much more deliberate about the purchases they make,\" NRF CEO Matthew Shay said Sunday. \"In a perfect world, everyone would sell at full price, but as consumers and as buyers all of us would like to get a deal on things we buy. The era of promotional sales is with us to stay.\"\nEven though shoppers are spending less per person, more shoppers could still translate into more spending. MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks spending on all kinds of payments, estimated that spending over the four-day weekend will be up 3.8 percent, with online sales up by double-digit percentages and in-store sales up in the single digits. But MasterCard Advisors' Sarah Quinlan also cited a slight decline in the average sale because of promotions.\nStores trying to snag customers first and compete with Amazon are shifting to a steady stream of online discounts and alerts instead of focusing on doorbuster sales on a few products. That meant that online shopping stole thunder away from sales at stores. And while areas like electronics and toys remained strong for the weekend, clothing, particularly basic sweaters, were still a tough sell.\nShoppers are visiting fewer stores and the rate at which browsers converted into buyers was slightly lower than last year, said William Taubman, chief operating officer at Taubman Centers, which operates 24 malls around the country. Still, after a contentious presidential election, he believes people are ready to buy.\n\"Resolution is a good thing,\" he said. \"That makes people feel somewhat more comfortable.\" And for wealthier customers, he said, the prospects of tax cuts will help.\nJanice Allsop, 66, a retired secretary who worked in the trucking industry, said she'll likely spend more this year because of the election.\n\"The stock markets have gone up. I'm just delighted with President Trump,\" said Allsop, who was shopping at Water Tower Place mall in Chicago on Saturday. \"I'm not afraid (to spend more). If Hillary Clinton would have gotten in, I would have been very scared, very reluctant.\"\nBut shoppers may still be split. Joyce Hill, a 67-year-old retired auto worker from Inkster, Michigan, who was also shopping in Chicago. Hill said she will stay on the low end of her usual spending this year because she's worried that Trump will start to cut back on Social Security.\n\"I'll spend less because you don't know what's going to happen. I don't think he'll (Trump) support us but I don't know if he's gonna let things stay status quo,\" said Hill.\nEven though the weekend bring many out shopping, Black Friday usually vies with the Saturday before Christmas as the busiest sales day. But this year, that falls on Christmas Eve, so Saturday, Dec. 17 is the big contender, says Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. The retail trade group's survey found that fewer shoppers had finished their holiday buying and more hadn't even started compared to a year ago.\n\"We've seen in recent years that most places will have good sales after Black Friday comes and goes, so we don't have to do everything this weekend,\" said William Junkin, who was at the Best Buy store in Howell Township, New Jersey, on Thursday night. \"We'll see how it all plays out.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writers Sadie Gurman in Denver, Don Babwin in Chicago, Bruce Shipkowski in Howell Township, New Jersey and Josh Boak in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.",

The glass-filled main atrium can be seen, and solar panels are noticeable on the top of several buildings, including the garage structure and main building. \nViews of structures beyond the main \"spaceship\" are shown in the video, including the 100,000-square-foot fitness center, massive parking structure and the underground auditorium.

      "title": "Drone Footage of the New Apple Campus 2 Looks So Impressive",
      "text": "Screengrab via Sexton Videography/YouTube Way cool. \nApple is currently constructing a new campus, so far known only as Apple Campus 2, not far from its existing one in Cupertino, Calif0rnia. But the look of the new building is dramatic—it’s virtually something ripped straight out of science fiction, a giant, shimmering loop coated in solar panels. It looks breathtakingly impressive and possesses that distinct, terrifying-yet-exciting, bold new future vibe. \nAnd thanks to the intrepid work of a videographer, there’s no need to sit around impatiently waiting to see what it looks like. To the contrary, a new update has been posted to the YouTube account Sexton Photography , documenting the new campus’s construction by way of some aerial drone footage, peeking at the impressive new structure from high in the sky. \nIn June, a drone videographer named Matthew Roberts provided the world with a compelling glimpse of the new campus in its early stages. You can already see the basic shape of the new building, but it’s still stripped bare enough that one can only imagine what it might look when it’s all done. Given Apple’s notorious penchant for crisp design, it was a sure bet that things would start to look smoother , slicker, and more polished as the months dragged on.\nNow, as this latest video shows, things are really coming together. Apple Campus 2 is slated to open at some point in early 2017, so if all goes according to plan, it won’t be too much longer. Here’s how things look now. \nThe new campus has been a long time coming. First pitched to the Cupertino City Council by the late Steve Jobs in 2011, Apple, which started in the project in 2013, is reportedly aiming to get the construction finished by the end of 2016. \nWhenever construction does finish and the doors are finally opened to Apple employees, you can bet the size and scope of this new headquarters are going to drop some jaws.",

      "text": "by Carl Lamiel · November 27, 2016 \nApple has revealed its official Philippine pricing for the wireless AirPods, and it looks like it will battle other current wireless headsets in its price range. \nUnveiled alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in its global unveiling, the AirPods are the Cupertino company’s first true wireless earbuds as they only rely on wireless connections to transmit audio data, with a microphone that senses the direction of your voice for better audibility. The AirPods are also equipped with the first Apple W1 chip designed for high-fidelity and consistent audio output. As for its battery life, these alone can play back up to 5 hours of music. With its portable battery case, it is said that it can deliver up to 24 hours of music experience. \nIt will be available locally for Php8,990 , which is a thousand bucks more expensive than Samsung’s wireless Gear IconX . No word on availability yet, but the release may be near as the price tag is now revealed. Would you get one, if it comes out this holiday season?",

      "text": "in Parent Cafe I am thinking about getting H an Apple watch for Christmas. I'm getting increasingly frustrated with him not answering his phone or text messages because he left the room or his office and didn't have his phone with him, or had it muted and forgot. He will fight it at first because it's a new learning curve for him, but once he's had it for a few weeks or months, I suspect he will really like it and wonder why he didn't get one sooner. Question is - what is battery charging like? How long does the watch hold a charge? Those of you have one, is it something you just plug in at bedtime like you do your cell phone, so that it becomes part of your routine that way?",

      "text": "0 New Samsung S7 (R) and S7 edge smartphones are displayed after their unveiling ceremony at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 21, 2016. The incremental upgrades may not be enough to rejuvenate sales for the world's No. 1 smartphone maker. Reuters/Albert Gea \nThere’s no denying that the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Apple iPhone 7 are the best smartphones in the world right now, while the upstart Google Pixel intends to make a name for itself. The three flagship phones are great in terms of design and features, but which of them lasts the longest performance-wise? \nThe Galaxy S7 equips a 3,000 mAh lithium-ion battery that provides 22 hours of talk time and 62 hours of music play. It can last a whole day of regular use. The Samsung flasghip is fully charged within 75 minutes and has wireless charging support, which the iPhone 7 and Pixel lack. \nREAD: Samsung registers own patent for future flexible and bendable Galaxy smartphone \nApple’s latest flagship is backed by a non-removable1,960 mAh lithium-ion battery. While it’s an improvement over that of the iPhone 6s, it’s one of the weakest phone batteries in the market, bearing in mind Apple’s status and the iPhone 7’s rivals. It provides 14 hours of call time or 40 hours of music playback. \nAccording to Trusted Reviews , the iPhone 7 drains itself by night time. The Apple flagship lasted approximately 7.5 hours on Phone Arena’s custom test before it was totally drained. It also took 2 hours and 20 minutes for the iPhone 7 to be fully charged. In comparison, the Google Pixel took 20 minutes faster to reach 100 percent battery life. \nREAD: Apple iPhone upgrade: Camera may soon boast of new feature \nThe Pixel packs a 2,770 mAh lithium-ion battery. Google’s new Android handset is almost the same with the iPhone 7 when it comes to endurance, per GSMArena . Google has said that the Pixel can provide about 13 hours of video playback and 26 hours of talk time. GSMArena’s test results proved to be lower, though, as the Pixel only lasted 11.5 hours of video playback and close to 22 hours of talk time. \nWhen TechRadar pitted the Samsung Galaxy S7, Apple iPhone 7 and Google Pixel against each other in a rigid battery performance test, the Apple flagship was completely drained after only 3 hours and 44 minutes of work. The Pixel phone lasted 4 hours and 47 minutes while the Samsung Galaxy S7 withstood the heavy labour the longest, lasting 5 hours and 21 minutes.",

      "title": "New MacBook Pro Alternatives: Your Options When The Apple Laptop Just Doesn't Cut It For You",
      "text": "Apple’s new MacBook Pro upgrade might be outselling its rivals but that doesn’t mean that it’s the best laptop out there. Here are a few alternatives to consider. ( Stephen Lamb | Getty Images ) Advertisement Those on the fence about purchasing one of Apple's new high-end MacBook Pro offerings might take a liking to some of these alternative laptops which are equally as powerful, if not more powerful and just as aesthetically refined as a MacBook Pro. More notably, these alternative laptops might be more able to deliver on certain fronts where the new MacBook Pro falls short . For those unimpressed by Apple's MacBook Pro refresh, here's a chief overview of worthy, bang-for-your-buck Windows 10-powered alternatives. Dell XPS 13 It can be argued that the Dell XPS 13 is the MacBook Pro's direct rival. It sports a gorgeous display enclosed in a tiny bezel that offers an immersive and almost borderless visual experience. It also features a sleek, ergonomic keyboard; an excellent trackpad; a sturdy chassis; an excellent design and a battery that lasts for 10 hours. All the bells and whistles are inside the XPS 13, and Dell even upgraded it with Intel's newest seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors, a whole generation ahead of the Skylake chips inside the MacBook Pro. The XPS 13 starts at $1,119 which comes with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. The presence of major ports alone renders the XPS 13 already a more attractive choice than the MacBook Pro, which only sports two to four USB-C ports and nothing else . In comparison, the MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, which is considerably more bank-breaking than the XPS 13 for virtually similar, if not better, features. Microsoft Surface Book Make no mistake about the newly refreshed performance base Surface Book model. It being a hybrid laptop doesn't defer its power, unlike many hybrids and two-in-ones that suffer the stereotype of being underpowered given its moniker. In fact, it's quite the opposite, since Microsoft bills the new Surface Book as all about power and graphics, which is only fitting for it to serve as another formidable opponent of the MacBook Pro. The Surface Book features a detachable touch screen, a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU, up to 16 GB of RAM and up to 1 TB of internal storage. The Surface Book doesn't come cheap, though. The performance base Surface Book model starts at $3,299, almost two thousand dollars more than the MacBook Pro, but it certainly fails to disappoint for those looking to purchase a machine that delivers top-notch performance and graphics. HP Spectre x360 The newly updated HP Spectre x360 seems to have been created solely to trawl those disappointed with the MacBook Pro and offer a better alternative. It rocks an edge-to-edge 1080p display like the Dell XPS 13 but it also has a rotating hinge like the Surface 4 Pro. It comes with two USB-C ports, a regular USB port and an SD card slot, though the latter can only be found on the 15-inch models. Users may either opt for a core i5 or i7 processor, with options for up to 16 GB of RAM and up to 512 GB of internal storage. The HP Spectre x360 's base model starts at $1,159, which gives users a little more freedom to bump up specs without spilling over the budget. These are just a few examples of laptops that are arguably far better choices than Apple's new MacBook Pro lineup, and there are a lot more from the pile, such as the Samsung Notebook 9 and Acer Aspire S 13 , both of which sport comparable specs without the premium price tag. The new MacBook Pro might be outselling other laptops out in the market today, but that doesn't mean that it's the only target visible on potential consumers' crosshairs. There are a lot of powerful and better alternatives out in the market that simply makes the MacBook Pro's premium price hard to justify. \nHave we missed any worthy MacBook Pro alternative?

Are there cheaper insurance options available for my new 7 Plus that would be better or just as good? Or is Apple Care Plus the best insurance out there for the iPhone? Because I purchased the Sim Free 7 Plus, I am unable to insure it with AT&Ts 3rd party insurance company.",

      "text": "Apple working with LG on 3D camera for iPhone 8, claims report Apple working with LG on 3D camera for iPhone 8, claims report Apple iPhone 8 might feature a 3D camera module from LG Innotek, according to reports in Korea. Updated: November 28, 2016 12:46 pm Apple is working with LG Innotek to develop a smartphone camera module that will enable 3D photographing. \nApple iPhone 8 is likely to feature some radical changes in terms of design and features, and it looks like a 3D camera might be just a possibility. According to a report in The Korea Economic Daily, Apple is working with LG Innotek to develop a smartphone camera module that will enable 3D photography. The report points out LG Innotek’s 3D dual rear camera module could be used in Apple’s new products starting as early as latter half of 2017. \nThe site quoted close sources who said, “ Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera. Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year. ” \nLG Innotek’s 3D camera technology has already been used in Optimus 3D, which was launched in 2011. According to the report, LG Innotek is exclusively supplying its dual cameras for iPhone 7, unveiled in Korea in October. \nThe year 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of iPhone and Apple is expected to radically overhaul the iPhone 8 in terms of design and features. Latest rumours around the phone suggest Apple will bring wireless charging for the first time with its iPhone 8. The leak comes from trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (KGI Securities). \nAn earlier report by Kuo has hinted at Apple planning to launch a bezel-less OLED iPhone 8, along with the revisions of the two standard 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays next year. All three phones are expected to come with glass casings and incorporate wireless charging. \nKuo has said that the larger 5.5-inch ‘Plus’ model will no more be the high-end flagship, with the OLED iPhone expected to be technically superior to the other two phones. He has also said that the optical image stabilisation (OIS) will be coming to both the wide-angle and telephoto lens next year. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",
