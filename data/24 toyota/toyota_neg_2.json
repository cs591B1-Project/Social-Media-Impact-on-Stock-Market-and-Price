But Toyota says it will scrimp and save to mitigate the currency's impact - raising its operating profit forecast by 6 percent. SOUNDBITE (English) CHIEF ECONOMIST, WORLD FIRST, JEREMY COOK, SAYING: \"We have seen a very, very large strengthening of the Japanese Yen over the course of the past two years or so. Dollar/Yen used to be as high as 1.20. It spent some time below 100 over the course of the past 6 months or so. The strengthening of yen for such an export reliant economy is obviously going to start pinching on profits.\" Sales have slowed in North America - its largest market. Toyota and rivals Nissan and Honda are struggling to keep up with the trend for larger models thanks to cheaper fuel. Toyota plans to jump on the battery bandwagon. It's been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. And says it's warming to the idea of producing more long range electric vehicles. SOUNDBITE (English) CHIEF ECONOMIST, WORLD FIRST, JEREMY COOK, SAYING: \"The car industry and the car market is also starting to slow. It's not going to be more sales it seems that drives the car market, it's going to be innovation within those sales.\" Despite the rosier outlook - operating profit for the year - even at the revised level - will still be its lowest since 2013. And 40 percent lower than last year's all time high.  //reut.rs/2fXz9VF",

      "text": "TOKYO: Toyota said Tuesday its April-September net profit dived 25 per cent, hit by a sharp rally in the yen and another fall in North American sales, but it upgraded its full-year outlook.\nThe world’s biggest automaker reported a net profit of 946.1 billion yen ($9.1 billion, Dh33.4 billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, down from 1.25 trillion yen in the same period in 2015.\nOperating profit fell nearly 30 per cent to 1.11 trillion yen, while revenue was off 7.2 per cent at 13.07 trillion yen.\nHowever the Corolla and Prius hybrid maker boosted its full-year to March net profit forecast to 1.55 trillion yen from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen estimate.\nThe newest figure is still way down from a record 2.31 trillion yen net profit in the most recently ended business year. \nThe decline in profits underscores the negative impact that a resurgent currency has had on firms doing much of their business abroad.\nJapan’s exporters reaped windfall profits over the past few years as government efforts to kick-start the world’s number three economy sharply weakened the yen.\nThat was good for firms such as Toyota and rivals Honda and Nissan because repatriated foreign profits were worth more when the yen was weak and because it boosted their competitiveness overseas.\nBut the currency has rallied since the start of the year as volatile equity markets and Britain’s vote to exit the European Union boosted demand for a unit widely seen as a safe investment.\n“The yen’s strength remains a major factor squeezing earnings in the Japanese auto sector,” said Shigeru Matsumura, analyst at SMBC Friend Research Centre, before the results were published.\n“Japanese carmakers need to make further efforts to make their corporate structure more resistant to the yen’s appreciation,” he added.\nToyota’s vehicle sales in April-September ticked up to 5.06 million units, from 4.97 million vehicles in the same period last year, with increases in Japan, Europe and Asia.\nStill, vehicle sales fell in the Middle East, Africa and the key North American market, where cheap oil has hit demand for Toyota’s fuel-efficient offerings including the Prius.\nThe North American sales drop was due to a “drastic shift” in demand from passenger cars to SUVs and trucks, the firm said.\nJapanese automakers have benefited from healthy growth in the US where low interest rates boosted demand, although a possible rise in borrowing costs this year could erode sales.\nUnsteady demand in emerging markets such as Thailand and Indonesia are also red flags, as Toyota and other major automakers wrestle with costs linked to a huge scandal at supplier Takata.\nA defect in the firm’s airbags has been linked to more than a dozen deaths and scores of injuries globally, prompting the auto industry’s biggest ever safety recall to replace the problem parts and meaning huge expenses for automakers.\nAutomakers were also hit by temporary factory shutdowns in the south of Japan after a pair of earthquakes caused major damage and claimed dozens of lives in April, affecting production.\nStiff competition at home and abroad has pushed some Japanese automakers to eye tie-ups.\nToyota and small car maker Suzuki said last month they were holding talks about a possible partnership.\nToyota said the possible deal was prompted by the fact that it trails competitors in North America and Europe in some areas, while Suzuki is struggling to forge its own path in the fiercely competitive industry.\nNissan is buying a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors, forging an alliance that will challenge some of the world’s biggest auto groups.\nOn Monday Nissan said net profit in the April-September period fell 13.3 per cent to 282.4 billion yen, the first decline over that six-month span in four years.\nLast week Honda said its net profit rose 12.1 per cent from the same period in 2015 to 351.8 billion yen, as cost cuts offset the impact of the rising yen.",

      "text": "News Toyota Plays Catch-Up In EVs As Tesla Model 3, GM Bolt Loom Toyota is now said to be working on developing an electric car that can last over 186 miles per charge. (Caro / Therese Aufschlager/Newscom) Reprints \nAfter shying away from battery-powered cars, Toyota ( TM ) is now planning to bring its own electric vehicles to the market by 2020, according to Nikkei , as General MotorsGM is set to sell Chevy Bolts later this year and Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) gears up to sell the Model 3 next year. \nThe Japanese auto giant is a little late to the EV game after sticking with its hybrid Prius line, developing the hydrogen fuel cell Mirai, and briefly partnering with Tesla to sell electric SUVs for a few years, but management has been doubtful of the segment. \nAs recently as last month, Toyota appeared to remain skeptical on all-electric cars. Toyota North America CEO Jim Lentz told Yahoo Finance that he sees a place for EVs primarily as short-range commuter vehicles, and affirmed the company's commitment to hydrogen-powered fuel cells. \n\"We believe that hydrogen is nothing more than a better battery,\" he said. \nBut in an apparent split from that outlook, Toyota is now said to be working on developing an electric car that can last over 300 km (186 miles) per charge. It will develop batteries in-house as well as possibly source them externally. \nToyota's U.S.-listed shares were up 1.7% at 114.44 in the stock market today . GM dipped 1.4% and Tesla edged up 0.1%. IBD'S TAKE: As concerns about auto demand weigh, automakers have increasingly turned their attention to the development of self-driving cars. That development is unlikely to slow despite safety concerns . \nIn addition to GM, Ford Motor ( F ) and Volkswagen ( VLKAY ) as well as luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes have already cemented plans for EVs. \nVolkswagen has plans for more than 30 new EV models by 2025, Ford is investing $4.5 billion in electric cars , and General Motors' 2017 Bolt EV boasts a 238-mile single-charge range that beats that of Tesla's Model 3. \nMeanwhile, Nissan, which produces the Leaf EV, on Tuesday rolled out a car-sharing program that will use social media posts and location to match up drivers with complementary commutes, according to the Financial Times . The Get & Go program will kick off in Paris next year. \nBut consumers, at least in the U.S., might not have gas-saving on the brain. \nToyota reduced its North American sales outlook for the year by 60,000 units amid consumer gravitation toward SUVs and trucks over hybrids, said Bloomberg. \nAnd Nissan's co-chief executive officer, Hiroto Saikawa, reportedly said of the U.S. auto market: \"It's a peak and we don't see a potential for further growth.\" \nRELATED :",

      "text": "November 8, 2016 — Japanese / Truck & 4x4 / Under $20k | 2 Comments 4×4 Diesel Camper: 1991 Toyota TownAce European \nThis 1991 Toyota TownAce is a 4×4, 5-speed, diesel powered van with what the seller describes as a factory fiberglass camper shell. Further said to have been a single-family vehicle prior to importation, the seller claims it’s well-maintained with 66k miles. Condition looks quite decent inside and out, and the ad says it will seat seven and comfortably sleep up to five adults. Find it here on Craigslist in Burlington, Vermont for $17k. Special thanks to BaT reader J C. for this submission. \nThough not equipped with a slider like the similar Toyota camper featured here recently , the seller claims this one will seat seven and sleep up to five adults comfortably. Condition looks to be good for a 25 year-old vehicle, though this is typical of Japan-sourced imports. Note the EUROPEAN graphics and old Japanese campsite stickers on back. The pop-top’s canvas has clearly been kept folded away for most of its life, but the seller says it’s in good shape despite its wrinkly appearance. \nNote also the mismatched aftermarket spare. Other photos show a slide-out exterior gray water wash basin–another sink is fitted inside, and presumably can be fed from either the gray or fresh water tank. The cabin is fully curtained, and the two forward facing seats seen just behind the reconfigurable table are fitted with seat belts. Up front, someone’s fitted a Momo wheel and the 5-speed is shifted on the column. \nHere’s a look in back. We see a control panel, the opening for the pop-top and its sleeping area, counter area, rear side door, and lots of storage space. Seat covers all look to be in very good shape, and are reportedly easy to remove for washing. Note also the Japanese electrical outlets, which are similar to US items but non-polarized and 100 V instead of 120. \nA retractable awning is fitted as well, and the seller reports that the van has been well-maintained.

      "text": "Boeing's Retiring Boomers Underscore US Manufacturing Plight \nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March. \nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19% last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10% to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company. \nIncentives Increase \n“It’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth” in the U.S. industry, Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer, said at a press conference on Nov. 8. “Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.” \nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13% from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates Nissan’s spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota’s at $2,270 per vehicle. \nToyota has been using “appropriate levels” of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group LLC. \n“We cannot underestimate risk in this market,” Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report on Nov. 7. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, “reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,” he said.",

But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Tags",

      "text": "Toyota \"should have the edge\" on Porsche in Bahrain 1,720 views By: Jamie Klein , News Editor 08/11/2016 04:27 Toyota Motorsport Director Rob Leupen believes the Japanese manufacturer “should have the edge” on Porsche for the FIA WEC title-decider in Bahrain. \nThe #6 Toyota crew of Stephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi head to the season finale with an outside shot at title honours, having closed to within 17 points of the #2 Porsche thanks to a second-place finish in Shanghai ahead of the sister #5 car. \nTwo slow punctures for Conway put out to any chance of the #6 trio challenging the #1 Porsche for victory in China, meaning the #6 Toyota realistically requires a win in Bahrain to have a chance. \nBut Leupen believes that the likelihood of Porsche team orders, combined with track characteristics more favourable to the TS050 Hybrid, makes Toyota a strong contender for victory. \n“Porsche #1 would have been very difficult to beat [in Shanghai],” admitted Leupen. “Two punctures mixed up the strategy a bit, but I think they would have had the edge at the end. \n“Nevertheless, we still have a chance at the championship, and I think Bahrain is a circuit that will suit us better than here. So we’ll go for it. \n“The #2 started well [before having later trouble], but we know our car improves over the race and it happened this time also. We are the slow starters, but we come in with the pace at the end. \n“We should have the edge on Porsche [in Bahrain], as the #1 will make way for the #2, but Audi in their last race will be strong I think. From that point of view it’s something to look forward to.” \nDespite the #6 crew recovering from fourth to second in the closing stages after the two punctures, Leupen admitted that the #1 Porsche would have still likely been out of reach in Shanghai even with atotally smooth run. \n“We would have been 10 to 15 seconds [behind at the finish] if everything went as expected, but maybe we could have applied some pressure,” he added. \n“We originally planned to splash at the end without changing tyres. The first puncture was then to get rid of the splash, but then we got a second one; Mike should have gone another 10 to 15 laps. \n“That put us back to the original strategy, which meant we had to do a splash at the end. So we were back to where we were without the interference. \n“Luck was not on our side, but in the end we are happy to be second and third.”  ",

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters. Lagging sales also helped send the Japanese automaker’s fiscal second quarter profit lower to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion), down from 611.7 billion yen the same period the previous year. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) Posted: Tuesday, November 8, 2016 3:02 am | Updated: 3:30 am, Tue Nov 8, 2016. Strong yen sends Toyota's quarterly profit sinking 36 pct Associated Press | \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of ¥100 (98 cents) per share in the quarter.\nFY17 Guidance\nToyota reiterated its consolidated revenue guidance of ¥26 trillion ($252.4 billion) for fiscal 2017. The revenue guidance reflects an 8.5% decline over fiscal 2016.\nOperating income guidance has been raised to ¥1.7 trillion ($16.5 billion) from the previous forecast of ¥1.6 trillion ($15.7 billion). The revised guidance implies a 40.4% year-over-year decrease.\nNet earnings are expected to be around ¥1.55 trillion ($15 billion), up from the prior view of ¥1.45 trillion ($14.2 billion).

      "text": "Toyota to Start Mass-Producing Electric Vehicles By 2020 (TSLA, TM) By Rakesh Sharma | November 8, 2016 — 3:59 AM EST \nThe list of competitors for Tesla Motors Corp.’s ( TSLA ) Model 3, its first mass-market electric vehicle, is getting longer. \nAccording to a news report in the Nikkei newspaper, Toyota Motor Corp. ( TM ) will start mass-producing electric vehicles by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The car is expected to have a range of 186 miles on a single charge. In its bid to enter the mass-market electric vehicle space, Toyota joins General Motors Company ( GM ), which unveiled the Chevy Bolt recently, and Volkswagen, which intends to increase the contribution of electric vehicles to its top line from 1% to 25% by 2025. (See also: GM Reveals Price Of Chevy Bolt ). \nToyota had earlier partnered with Tesla to sell electric cars between 2012 and 2014. The Japanese company plans to put a team in place for development of its version of the vehicle “as early as next year.” It established a battery research division in January this year and may also partner with other battery suppliers to speed up development and procurement of affordable electric batteries for its car. (See also: Volkswagen To Launch Electric Car Strategy ) \nTesla plans to start production on the Model 3 early next year and deliver its mass-market EV during the latter half of 2017. The company, which is already facing tough questions from analysts and investors over how it proposes to ramp up production amid a controversial merger with SolarCity Corp. ( SCTY ), is building a Nevada Gigafactory in partnership with Panasonic to develop batteries and bring down costs for its car. \nTesla is facing off against a formidable set of competitors with deep pockets and research expertise. For example, General Motors is already on track to launch the first mass-market electric vehicle by the end of this year. The Detroit-based car company showed off the Chevy Bolt, which is expected to cost $37,495 and offer a 238-mile range, to critical acclaim earlier this year. It confirmed yesterday that production was on track and that it would deliver the first set of Bolts before the end of this year. \nThe entry of major players into the electric vehicle industry is the result of a combination of increasingly favorable regulation and affordable technology. Per some estimates , global car sales are expected to account for 35% of new car sales by 2040.

      "text": "  Peak Autos: Toyota And Nissan Execs Admit U.S. Auto Sales Have Peaked On \"Rapidly Growing Incentives\" Nov 8, 2016 2:15 PM 0 SHARES \nDespite record incentive spending, constantly loosening lending standards and endless cheer leading from the \"Big 3\" U.S.-based auto OEMs, senior executives from Toyota and Nissan are convinced that the U.S. auto market has peaked. According to comments made to Bloomberg , Toyota co-CEO Hiroto Saikawa said \"i t’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth...i ncentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.” \n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said. \n\nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy. For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt. \n\nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March. \n\nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company. \nOf course, this startling dose of honesty shouldn't be a huge surprise to our readers. As we noted last week, October's auto sales implied a total SAAR of 18.0mm for the U.S. market . To put that into perspective, that implies a total rolling stock equal to more than 1 car per driving-age adult in the U.S. \n\nMeanwhile, the inventory/sales ratio for the industry continues to hover near multi-year highs outside of the anomalies around the \"great recession.\" \n\nAs Toyota and Nissan noted, the peak has largely been driven by rapidly rising incentive spending though auto makers are likely reaching the peak of how much they can incentivize additional purchases. \nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates Nissan’s spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota’s at $2,270 per vehicle. \n\nToyota has been using “appropriate levels” of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group LLC. \n\n“We cannot underestimate risk in this market,” Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report Monday. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, “reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,” he said. \nMeanwhile, as we noted below, used car pricing and rising delinquencies on auto securitizations seems to confirm fears that the U.S. auto market is rolling over. \nFor those who missed it, below is what we wrote on the topic previously: \n* * * \nIt will come as no surprise to our readers that sales of automobiles in the U.S. have bubbled over in recent years and stood at a SAAR of 17.7mm units at the end of September. To put that number in context, an assumed 15-year useful life for vehicles would imply that's more than 1 car for every driving age person in the United States . Obviously that's likely not sustainable which is probably why Ford executives admitted on a recent conference call that U.S. auto sales have reached a \"plateau.\" \nAs we've argued in the past, the main reason auto sales have bubbled over is due to the continuous degradation of lending standards over the past 6 years fueled by the Wall Street securitization machine. Of course, the problem with \"rigging\" new car sales in this way is that eventually all of those vehicles come back to flood the used car market with excessive supply resulting in lower used car prices and higher securitization losses... and that's when the whole ponzi starts to unravel . Which, as the Wall Street Journal points out, is exactly what is starting to happen right now. \nSeveral large companies have warned that prices of used vehicles are likely to weaken, potentially leading to higher losses on loans on which cars are the collateral. That, combined with looser terms for loans and the growth of loans going to subprime borrowers, is sounding a warning for the long credit boom that has spurred auto sales. \n\nAuto-loan balances topped $1 trillion for the first time ever this year. Actual default rates remain low, but losses are starting to tick up, leading some big lenders to scale back . That has the credit underpinnings of the auto boom looking shakier. \n\n“Losses are going to go higher—there’s no question about that,” said Hylton Heard, senior director at Fitch Ratings. \n\nEarlier this year, J.P. Morgan chief James Dimon warned about a weakening auto market and the potential for used-car prices to drop. Indeed, prices of used cars that are up to eight years old are down 3.6% in 2016 through September versus the same period a year earlier, according to the NADA Used Car Guide, a division of J.D. Power. \n\n“It is the first time since 2008 that prices have fallen by any material amount,” said Larry Dixon, director of market intelligence at the NADA Used Car Guide. The firm is projecting prices will finish the year down by an average of 4% compared with 2015. \nWhile data from Manheim suggests that overall nominal used car prices have not yet collapsed, they have certainly stalled in recent months... \n\n...while used car pricing as a percentage of new car pricing has been on the decline. \n\nAs we recently pointed out, rising delinquencies are already apparent in GM's subprime securitizations where 31-60 day delinquencies have been on the rise since 2012 and now stand at over 8% of outstanding loans. \n\nMeanwhile, the year-over-year change in 61+ day delinquencies for GM securitizations have been growing at double-digit rates for several months now. \n\nFinally, just like in 2008, wall street is starting to bet against the bubble they created as S&P warns that downgrades of certain subprime securitizations are imminent in the face of mounting delinquencies and write-offs. \n\"The auto industry has also become intensely competitive, which has led to price competition, loosening of credit standards, and higher charge-offs,\" S&P said. U.S. car sales have been growing for six years, but the growth rate is showing signs of slowing after a record 2015. \n\nThe ratings firm said it may have to downgrade some subprime auto loan securities that have high-yield grades because of the increased delinquencies and loan losses, a statement it first made last month. \n\nSome investors believe that subprime auto loans will continue to deteriorate, and have looked for ways to bet against them. After the financial crisis, mortgage lenders have been required by law to verify that applicants can repay their debt, but car lenders do not have that obligation. In the 12 months ended in June, only 5.2 percent of car loan applications were rejected, down from 11.1 percent in the 12 months ended in October 2015, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Lenders are making longer-term loans than before, and used car prices have fallen, which also could hurt loan recoveries, S&P said on Tuesday. \nWith used car prices coming under pressure just as delinquencies and charge-offs start to mount, it's just a matter of time before the subprime auto bubble bursts. Just another sign of the Obama \"economic recovery.\"",

      "title": "Peak Autos: Toyota And Nissan Execs Admit U.S. Auto Sales Have Peaked On Rapidly Growing Incentives",
      "text": "Despite record incentive spending, constantly loosening lending standards and endless cheer leading from the \"Big 3\" U.S.-based auto OEMs, *senior executives from Toyota and Nissan are convinced that the U.S. auto market has peaked. * According to comments made to Bloomberg, Toyota co-CEO Hiroto Saikawa said \"i*t’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth...i**ncentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.”**\n*\n\n\n\n*“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,”* Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market *“really requires very careful managing going forward,”* he said.\n\n\n*The more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy.* For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt.\n\n\nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still *projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March.*\n\n\nNissan, meanwhile, said *operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen.* For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company.\n\n\n\nOf course, this startling dose of honesty shouldn't be a huge surprise to our readers. As we noted last week, October's auto sales *implied a total SAAR of 18.0mm for the U.S. market*. To put that into perspective, that implies a total rolling stock equal to more than 1 car per driving-age adult in the U.S. \n\n\nMeanwhile, the inventory/sales ratio for the industry continues to hover near multi-year highs outside of the anomalies around the \"great recession.\"\n\n\nAs Toyota and Nissan noted, the peak has largely been driven by rapidly rising incentive spending though auto makers are likely reaching the peak of how much they can incentivize additional purchases.\n\n\n\n*Automakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier,* according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates *Nissan’s spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota’s at $2,270 per vehicle.*\n\n\nToyota has been using “appropriate levels” of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group LLC.\n\n\n*“We cannot underestimate risk in this market,” *Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report Monday. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, *“reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,” *he said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as we noted below, used car pricing and rising delinquencies on auto securitizations seems to confirm fears that the U.S. auto market is rolling over.\n\nFor those who missed it, below is what we wrote on the topic previously:\n\n* * *\n\nIt will come as no surprise to our readers that sales of automobiles in the U.S. have bubbled over in recent years and stood at a SAAR of 17.7mm units at the end of September. To put that number in context, *an assumed 15-year useful life for vehicles would imply that's more than 1 car for every driving age person in the United States*. Obviously that's likely not sustainable which is probably why *Ford executives admitted on a recent conference call that U.S. auto sales have reached a \"plateau.\"*\n\nAs we've argued in the past, the main reason auto sales have bubbled over is due to the continuous degradation of lending standards over the past 6 years fueled by the Wall Street securitization machine. Of course, the problem with \"rigging\" new car sales in this way is that eventually all of those vehicles come back to flood the used car market with excessive supply resulting in lower used car prices and higher securitization losses...*and that's when the whole ponzi starts to unravel*. Which, as the Wall Street Journal points out, is exactly what is starting to happen right now.\n\n\n\n*Several large companies have warned that prices of used vehicles are likely to weaken, potentially leading to higher losses on loans on which cars are the collateral.* That, combined with looser terms for loans and the growth of loans going to subprime borrowers, is sounding a warning for the long credit boom that has spurred auto sales.\n\n\n*Auto-loan balances topped $1 trillion for the first time ever this year. *Actual default rates remain low, but *losses are starting to tick up, leading some big lenders to scale back*. That has the credit underpinnings of the auto boom looking shakier.\n\n\n*“Losses are going to go higher—there’s no question about that,”* said Hylton Heard, senior director at Fitch Ratings.\n\n\nEarlier this year, J.P. Morgan chief James Dimon warned about a weakening auto market and the potential for used-car prices to drop.* Indeed, prices of used cars that are up to eight years old are down 3.6% in 2016 through September* versus the same period a year earlier, according to the NADA Used Car Guide, a division of J.D. Power.\n\n\n*“It is the first time since 2008 that prices have fallen by any material amount,”* said Larry Dixon, director of market intelligence at the NADA Used Car Guide. The firm is projecting prices will finish the year down by an average of 4% compared with 2015.\n\n\n\nWhile data from Manheim suggests that overall nominal used car prices have not yet collapsed, they have certainly stalled in recent months...\n\n\n...while used car pricing as a percentage of new car pricing has been on the decline.\n\n\nAs we recently pointed out, rising delinquencies are already apparent in GM's subprime securitizations where 31-60 day delinquencies have been on the rise since 2012 and now stand at over 8% of outstanding loans.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the year-over-year change in 61+ day delinquencies for GM securitizations have been growing at double-digit rates for several months now.\n\n\nFinally, just like in 2008, wall street is starting to bet against the bubble they created as S&P warns that downgrades of certain subprime securitizations are imminent in the face of mounting delinquencies and write-offs.\n\n\n\n*\"The auto industry has also become intensely competitive, which has led to price competition, loosening of credit standards, and higher charge-offs,\" *S&P said. U.S. car sales have been growing for six years, but the growth rate is showing signs of slowing after a record 2015.\n\n\nThe ratings firm said it may have to downgrade some subprime auto loan securities that have high-yield grades because of the increased delinquencies and loan losses, a statement it first made last month.\n\n\n*Some investors believe that subprime auto loans will continue to deteriorate, and have looked for ways to bet against them.* After the financial crisis, mortgage lenders have been required by law to verify that applicants can repay their debt, but car lenders do not have that obligation. In the 12 months ended in June, only 5.2 percent of car loan applications were rejected, down from 11.1 percent in the 12 months ended in October 2015, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Lenders are making longer-term loans than before, and used car prices have fallen, which also could hurt loan recoveries, S&P said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nWith used car prices coming under pressure just as delinquencies and charge-offs start to mount, it's just a matter of time before the subprime auto bubble bursts. Just another sign of the Obama \"economic recovery.\"",

(Source: Toyota/CNN) The i-Road navigates takes on curves like a motorcycle, but the driver and passenger are fully enclosed. (Source: Toyota/CNN) \n(CNN) - A three-wheeled, two-seater electric vehicle called the Toyota I-Road is being billed as a “personal mobility vehicle” - an innovation that lands somewhere between a car and a motorbike. \nAt 3 feet wide and 7 feet long, the futuristic vehicle is minuscule. It has built-in safety software that controls how deep it leans, based on the driver's speed.If the driver goes too fast, the steering wheel will vibrate as a gentle reminder to slow down to prevent the i-Road from tipping over. \nThe i-Road, developed to accommodate city dwellers, takes about three hours to charge and can go about 30 miles per hour, with a top speed of 37 mph. Two of them can easily fit into a small of parking slot, and the vehicle can weave through traffic while reducing congestion and carbon emissions, the company said. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

Sales in North America, one the world's biggest car markets, slowed after record sales last year. \nREUTERS \nJapanese lender to start Manila back-office centre \nTOKYO • Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is planning to set up a back-office centre in Manila to handle operations for Asia outside Japan, sources said. \nThe move is part of its efforts to improve the efficiency of its global operations, as the banking industry faces weak revenue growth in an ultra-low interest rate environment. \nThe centre in Manila will start operating in its next financial year beginning April, taking over some back-office operations at branches in Singapore and Australia. \nREUTERS   'Money Briefs'.

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters.

Strong yen sends Toyota's quarterly profit sinking 36 pct Associated Press | \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

The Japanese automaker reported consolidated net income of ¥393.71 billion ($3.86 billion) in second-quarter fiscal 2017, down from ¥611.72 billion ($5.01 billion) posted in the year-ago quarter. \nConsolidated revenues decreased 8.6% year over year to ¥6.48 trillion ($63.32 billion) in the reported quarter.

Sales inched up 0.1% to 684,985 vehicles in North America but declined 21.3% to 346,001 units in other regions (Central and South America, Oceania, Africa and the Middle East). \nOperating income plunged 42.6% to ¥474.6 billion ($4.65 billion) from ¥827.4 billion ($6.78 billion) a year ago. The decline was due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and increase in expenses, partially offset by cost-reduction efforts and higher sales volumes. \nSegment Results \nThe Automotive segment’s revenues fell 8.7% to ¥5.9 trillion ($57.8 billion) in the reported quarter, while the operating income plunged 44.8% to ¥393.9 billion ($3.23 billion). \nThe Financial Services segment’s revenues declined 9.9% to ¥432.1 billion ($4.24 billion), while the operating income decreased 35.2% to ¥62 billion ($508.2 million). \nAll Other businesses’ revenues dropped 3.7% to ¥283.8 billion ($2.78 billion) in the quarter.

The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of ¥100 (98 cents) per share in the quarter. \nFY17 Guidance \nToyota reiterated its consolidated revenue guidance of ¥26 trillion ($252.4 billion) for fiscal 2017. The revenue guidance reflects an 8.5% decline over fiscal 2016. \nOperating income guidance has been raised to ¥1.7 trillion ($16.5 billion) from the previous forecast of ¥1.6 trillion ($15.7 billion). The revised guidance implies a 40.4% year-over-year decrease. \nNet earnings are expected to be around ¥1.55 trillion ($15 billion), up from the prior view of ¥1.45 trillion ($14.2 billion). The net income guidance reflects expectations of a 33% decrease over fiscal 2016. \nTOYOTA MOTOR CP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise \n\nZacks Rank \nCurrently, Toyota carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \nStandard Motor, with a long-term expected growth rate of 15%, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Lagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). The manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. Volkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. Toyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Toyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Latest News Video ",

Report says that by early 2017, Toyota will assemble a team committed to developing electric vehicles with more than 299 km range on a single charge, which are expected to arrive in the market by 2020 in Japan and other countries. However, the Japanese manufacturer neither declined nor confirmed this report. Instead, Toyota said that they will continue in developing various fuel-efficient technologies, including electric vehicles. \"Toyota has been a major hold-out on EVs, but it appears that it now realizes that without them it may be difficult to satisfy tightening regulations. Not [including EVs as an option] would run the risk that it could face sales restrictions in some areas,\" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. Also, according to the brand's engineers, the company intends to produce a battery for their own models in the future to ensure a safe and efficient lithium-ion battery. Toyota also said that they are aiming to make all the brand's vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.",

      "text": "Toyota Highlander gets a refresh for 2017 Text: Nica Onate / Photos: Toyota | posted November 09, 2016 07:38 More power, safety tech arrive in updated Toyota Highlander Toyota Motor Corporation recently revealed a refresh 2017 Highlander with more power, safety as well as model choices. Starting with the exterior, the front grille on LE, LE Plus and XLE grades features a silver-painted finish, while Limited and Platinum grades have a painted chrome finish. The taillights are redesigned for a sleeker look and now feature standard LEDs, and the Limited and Platinum models receive an improved rear bumper chrome garnishes. Apart from these, three new exterior colors are made available such as Celestial Silver Metallic, Toasted Walnut Pearl, and exclusively on the new SE, Salsa Red Pearl. Inside, the 2017 Highlander features a distinct black leather-trimmed seats accented with silver stitching and pattern inserts, along with matching dark dash and door accents. It also now offers room for up to eight with three-row seating. The Limited Platinum, on the other hand, offers a new brown leather interior. The refresh 2017 Highlander is powered by a new 3.5-liter D-4S Injection V6 that produces an output of 299 PS and 375 Nm of torque. Toyota also said that to make best use of the engine’s upgrade, the V6 Highlander now employs a new Direct Shift – 8AT 8-speed automatic transmission. In addition, all Highlander Hybrid models now offers Electronic On-Demand All-Wheel-Drive System with intelligence (AWD-i) as standard. Instead of transfer gears and a driveshaft to the rear wheels, this AWD-i system employs a second, independent electric motor to drive the rear wheels when needed to help maintain optimal traction. \nIt also gets new feature, Stop and Start Engine System (S&S), which enables the engine to shut off when the vehicle comes to a complete stop, and then restarts when the driver’s foot lifts from the brake pedal. The Highlander Hybrid adds two new grades, (LE and XLE), joining the Limited and Platinum models for a total of four. Accompanying the gas model’s all-new SE grade are LE, LE Plus, XLE, Limited and Limited Platinum, all available in either FWD or AWD. Related Articles",

      "text": "0 Comments \nEvery year at SEMA, you can expect Toyota to bring a few interesting builds to the showroom floor. This year, the automaker brought out a 2,000-horsepower monster that claims to have a top speed of 220 MPH. Oh by the way, it’s a 2016 Land Cruiser, or in this case, a “Land Speed Cruiser.” When you think about a car with those outrageous numbers, that last thing on your mind would be a full-size, luxury SUV. But whatever, Toyota thought it would be a neat idea, and boy did they make the right call. The Land Speed Cruiser was by far the brand’s most-talked-about SEMA vehicle. \nGetting a car to hit 220 MPH is a feat within itself, but getting a large, heavy SUV up to those speeds is a whole different story. For starters, the 3UR-FE 5.7L V8 was fitted with two “volleyball sized” turbochargers, courtesy of Garrett. The twin-turbocharged V8 was then mated to an ATI racing transmission. \nToyota didn’t reveal any details on the modifications made to the chassis, but we can be sure the frame has been tweaked for maximum performance. In addition to making the Land Speed Cruiser lighter and stronger, the suspension and exterior were also addressed to help make it slip through the air as easily as possible. The ride height was obviously lowered to help reduce drag and lift, meaning this particular Land Cruiser is no off-road warrior after all. An aerodynamic hood can be spotted up front, as well as a rear spoiler and diffuser to help with the airflow out back. \nSet to be the fastest SUV in the world, we can’t help but be anxious to see the Land Speed Cruiser hit its 220 MPH top-speed promise. For now, all we have are words to go by. Let’s see it Toyota!",

CNN 1:24 Last 24 hours: Day in the life of an election campaign Sky News 1:53 UP NEXT Japan’s two largest carmakers have arrived at the same conclusion: the U.S. auto market that’s functioned as a growth engine has run out of gas.\nToyota Motor Corp. cut its forecast for North American sales this fiscal year by 60,000 vehicles and for the first time said it’s expecting a decline for the year, as American consumers shift away from fuel sippers like the Prius hybrid and toward trucks and sport utility vehicles. Nissan Motor Co., which posted a drop in profit as it gave heftier incentives that buoyed deliveries, said it’s not seeing room for further expansion.\n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said.\nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy. For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt.\nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March.\nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company.\nIncentives Increase\n“It’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth” in the U.S. industry, Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer, said at a press conference Monday. “Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.”\nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates Nissan’s spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota’s at $2,270 per vehicle.\nToyota has been using “appropriate levels” of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group LLC.\n“We cannot underestimate risk in this market,” Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report Monday. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, “reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,” he said.\nAsia Demand\nToyota and Nissan are more upbeat about the prospects for markets in Asia outside Japan.\nFor Toyota, it’s now forecasting 1.56 million vehicle sales for the region this fiscal year, 90,000 more than projected just three months ago. Nissan boosted China sales by 8.2 percent this year through September and is targeting deliveries of 1.3 million vehicles to the market this year.\nIndustrywide passenger-vehicle deliveries surged 20 percent in October to 2.22 million, the China Passenger Car Association said Tuesday. Consumers are rushing to buy models with smaller engines ahead of a tax cut due to expire at the end of this year, even as the government said it’s looking at extending the rebate.\n“Regardless, it may impact buying behavior in the fourth quarter this year,” David Schoch, president of Ford Motor Co.’s Asia-Pacific unit, said on Tuesday in Chennai, where the automaker will spend $195 million to open a technology and business center by early 2019. “There is still a lot of growth left in China, particularly in lower-tier cities. They still have millions and millions of people.”\n--With assistance from Ma Jie and Ganesh Nagarajan To contact the reporters on this story: Craig Trudell in Tokyo at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, Masatsugu Horie in Osaka at mhorie3@bloomberg.net.

      "text": "Toyota Top Automaker at 2016 R&D100 Awards November 08, 2016 Washington, D.C. (November 8, 2016) – Toyota is already the leading automotive innovator, having been awarded more patents than any other automaker over the past 8 years. So it was no surprise when R&D Magazine awarded the year’s top 100 innovations in the global research and development space, that Toyota was the most awarded carmaker. During the November 3 rd event in Washington, D.C., innovators from the Toyota Research Institute, North America (TRI-NA) were recognized for their work on advances in hybrid and electric vehicle systems. The awarded technologies include dynamic wireless charging that allow EV/PEV/Hybrid batteries to be charged while driving and traction inverters that allow more efficient use of battery power. Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) was also recognized with an R&D 100 award for thermal cooling advances in the Land Cruiser Prado. Aside from the industry-leading three awards, Toyota was also nominated for two other technologies; Automotive electronics power cooling and omnidirectional structural color.“As companies in the automotive industry transform themselves into broader mobility providers, no auto company better demonstrates innovation and technology for the future than Toyota,” said Jeff Makarewicz, senior vice president, Toyota Technical Center (TTC), Toyota’s North American research & development headquarters. “We’re focused on delivering great experiences for our customers, a cornerstone of Toyota’s product commitment, and this recognition is proof we’re living up to that promise.” Toyota’s recognition at the awards ceremony and its industry-leading patent numbers illustrate the company’s increasing success not only as global auto leader, but also as one of the world’s leading innovators. Toyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to building vehicles for the way people live through our Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands. Over the past 50 years, we’ve built more than 30 million cars and trucks in North America, where we operate 14 manufacturing plants (10 in the U.S.) and directly employ more than 44,000 people (more than 34,000 in the U.S.). Our 1,800 North American dealerships (1,500 in the U.S.) sold more than 2.8 million cars and trucks (nearly 2.5 million in the U.S.) in 2015 – and about 80 percent of all Toyota vehicles sold over the past 20 years are still on the road today. Toyota partners with philanthropic organizations across the country, with a focus on education, safety and the environment. As part of this commitment, we share the company’s extensive know-how garnered from building great cars and trucks to help community organizations and other nonprofits expand their ability to do good.

      "text": "\n* Q2 operating profit falls 43 percent \n* Toyota more exposed to currency swings than domestic rivals \n* Raises full-year operating profit outlook to 1.7 trln yen (Adds context) \nTOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said operating profit almost halved in the second quarter as the world's top-selling automaker smarted from a strong yen that has made its Japan-built cars less competitive and crimped the value of overseas earnings. \nOperating profit fell 43 percent to 474.6 billion yen ($4.55 billion) in the July-September period compared with a year earlier. The result was roughly in line with the 476.26 billion yen average of 12 estimates from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nWhile all Japanese automakers are feeling the currency pinch, Toyota is more exposed to swings in foreign exchange because it produces two-fifths of its vehicles in Japan, half of which it exports. \nThe latest yen squeeze also comes as sales in North America, one the world's biggest auto markets, slow after record sales in 2015 that automakers and analysts saw as the peak of the U.S. recovery from the 2008-2009 economic crisis. \nCheap fuel is also spurring demand for petrol-guzzling models leaving Japanese automakers struggling to raise production of sport utility vehicles and trucks. \nToyota has said it will make more of those larger vehicles including its popular RAV4 crossover model in the United States, to take advantage of that shift in consumer preference. \nOn Tuesday, Toyota also changed its full-year budgeted yen rate to 103 versus the U.S. dollar and 114 to the euro, from 102 and 113 respectively. It lifted its forecast for full-year operating profit to 1.7 trillion yen from 1.6 trillion yen, which would be its lowest since 2013.

      "text": "The FJ Company introduced its latest FJ Land Cruiser project at the SEMA Show. The Aspen Project aims to blend old styling with new tech and it modernized a 1982 model as a one-off piece. More Classic Toyota FJ Land Cruisers have a strong following among automotive collectors. Their durable design and iconic shape have made them prime candidates for restoration. Now, some wish to go a step further — to modernize one of the best off-road vehicles ever built.\nThe FJ Company is one such outfit, specializing in 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s Land Cruisers (FJ20, FJ40, and FJ60 series models). Once the FJ Company acquires a donor car, it sets about transforming it into a customized, reliable work of vehicular art.\nThis year, the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) invited the FJ Company to strut its stuff and instead of displaying one of its more traditional Cruisers, the specialty shop went to work on the “ Aspen Project .”\nWhat began life as a 1982 Toyota FJ43 Land Cruiser has become a tailor-made beauty. FJ Company President Juan Diego Calle asked for a “purpose-built, family-friendly beast that could take on the rigors of everyday highway driving as well as the back-country near Aspen, Colorado.” What we see here goes just a tad beyond those loose specs.\nMore: Classic Recreations Mustang GT500CR\nThe build started by removing the FJ’s frame, tweaking the car’s power steering, front disc brakes, and climate controls, then addressing the powertrain. Toyota’s 1FZ engine, a 4.5-liter inline six-cylinder with electronic fuel injection, serves up 210 horsepower in this configuration. That is paired with a five-speed manual transmission for optimal off-road responsiveness.\nA passing glance would overlook the trail-ready equipment on this FJ because the original Land Cruiser exterior remains mostly unchanged. In addition to a matte white paint job, the FJ Company added a Warn 8274 winch on the original front bumper, flanked by a pair of seven-inch LED fog lights. Most importantly, a custom roll cage was engineered to keep all occupants safe — especially since the back half of the rig is only covered in canvas.\nInside, the Aspen Project gets Recaro Speed seats, trimmed in the same marine-grade material as the door panels and fold-down rear seats. The floor is also coated in Rhino Linings bed liner for all-weather protection. As convenience features go, there is a digital instrument cluster — which some luxury cars do not even have — LED interior lighting, and a premium sound system with Bluetooth.\nAs a one-off build, the Aspen Project FJ has already been sold (price unknown), but we wager if you have a healthy bank account, the FJ Company will design any Land Cruiser you fancy.\nHow the Alternative Limb Project is transforming prosthetics into an astonishing artform Google does not want to only build cars, it wants to build superhuman drivers Awesome tech you can’t buy yet: Water drones, fire-spewing speakers, and more",

(Photo: John T. Greilick / The Detroit News) Buy Photo \nJapan’s two largest carmakers have arrived at the same conclusion: the U.S. auto market that’s functioned as a growth engine has run out of gas. \nToyota Motor Corp. cut its forecast for North American sales this fiscal year by 60,000 vehicles and for the first time said it’s expecting a decline for the year, as American consumers shift away from fuel sippers like the Prius hybrid and toward trucks and sport utility vehicles. Nissan Motor Co., which posted a drop in profit as it gave heftier incentives that buoyed deliveries, said it’s not seeing room for further expansion. \n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said. \nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy. For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and four times the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt. \nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March. \nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company. \n“It’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth” in the U.S. industry, Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer, said at a press conference Monday. “Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.” \nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates Nissan’s spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota’s at $2,270 per vehicle. \nToyota has been using “appropriate levels” of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group LLC. \n“We cannot underestimate risk in this market,” Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report Monday. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, “reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,” he said. \nToyota and Nissan are more upbeat about the prospects for markets in Asia outside Japan. \nFor Toyota, it’s now forecasting 1.56 million vehicle sales for the region this fiscal year, 90,000 more than projected just three months ago. Nissan boosted China sales by 8.2 percent this year through September and is targeting deliveries of 1.3 million vehicles to the market this year. \nIndustrywide passenger-vehicle deliveries surged 20 percent in October to 2.22 million, the China Passenger Car Association said Tuesday. Consumers are rushing to buy models with smaller engines ahead of a tax cut due to expire at the end of this year, even as the government said it’s looking at extending the rebate. \n“Regardless, it may impact buying behavior in the fourth quarter this year,” David Schoch, president of Ford Motor Co.’s Asia-Pacific unit, said on Tuesday in Chennai, where the automaker will spend $195 million to open a technology and business center by early 2019. “There is still a lot of growth left in China, particularly in lower-tier cities. They still have millions and millions of people.” \nStrong yen sends Toyota’s quarterly profit sinking 36% \nToyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker’s fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that’s still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2fBQbpH TOP VIDEOS",

Nissan Motor Co., which posted a drop in profit as it gave heftier incentives that buoyed deliveries, said it’s not seeing room for further expansion.\nQuote: s in the article Toyota Motor Corp TM\n▲ 113.81 +1.33 +1.18% Nissan Motor Co Ltd NSANY\n▲ 19.91 +0.11 +0.56% Ford Motor Co F\n▼ 11.48 -0.10 -0.86% “The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said.\nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy. For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt.\nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March.\nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company.\nIncentives Increase\n“It’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth” in the U.S. industry, Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer, said at a press conference Monday. “Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.”\nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp.

Related Stories Toyota operating profit slumps as strong yen, U.S. headwinds zap earnings \nJapan's two largest carmakers have arrived at the same conclusion: the U.S. auto market that's functioned as a growth engine has run out of gas. \nToyota Motor Corp. cut its forecast for North American sales this fiscal year by 60,000 vehicles and for the first time said it's expecting a decline for the year, as American consumers shift away from fuel sippers like the Prius hybrid and toward trucks, crossovers and SUVs. N \nNissan Motor Co., which posted a drop in profit as it gave heftier incentives that buoyed deliveries, said it's not seeing room for further expansion. \n\"The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,\" Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market \"really requires very careful managing going forward,\" he said. \nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan's economy. For the nation's automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt. \nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it's still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March. \nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company. \nIncentives increase \n\"It's a peak and we don't see a potential for further growth\" in the U.S. industry, Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer, said at a press conference Monday. \"Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.\" \nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates Nissan's spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota's at $2,270 per vehicle. \nToyota has been using \"appropriate levels\" of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group. \n\"We cannot underestimate risk in this market,\" Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report Monday. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, \"reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,\" he said. \nAsia demand \nToyota and Nissan are more upbeat about the prospects for markets in Asia outside Japan. \nFor Toyota, it's now forecasting 1.56 million vehicle sales for the region this fiscal year, 90,000 more than projected just three months ago. Nissan boosted China sales by 8.2 percent this year through September and is targeting deliveries of 1.3 million vehicles to the market this year. \nIndustrywide passenger-vehicle deliveries surged 20 percent in October to 2.22 million, the China Passenger Car Association said Tuesday. Consumers are rushing to buy models with smaller engines ahead of a tax cut due to expire at the end of this year, even as the government said it's looking at extending the rebate. \n\"Regardless, it may impact buying behavior in the fourth quarter this year,\" David Schoch, president of Ford Motor Co.'s Asia-Pacific unit, said on Tuesday in Chennai, where the automaker will spend $195 million to open a technology and business center by early 2019. \"There is still a lot of growth left in China, particularly in lower-tier cities. They still have millions and millions of people.\"",

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) November 09, 2016 1:00 AM Toyota sees strong yen slice profits YURI KAGEYAMA | Associated Press \nTOKYO – Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker’s fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot.

      "text": "Toyota Roomy And Tank Minivans Launch In Japan | By Share Toyota has just launched the new Roomy and Tank available exclusively in the Japanese market . Both the new models are offered solely with a small 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine, which delivers 140 Nm of torque, a figure which Toyota says is more reflective of a 1.5-liter. This engine comes standard alongside a CVT transmission and can be paired to either front- or all-wheel drive. Given that both models are about moving people in comfort, it's no surprise that the brand is at pains to point out some of the key interior features. These include rear seats which can be moved forward by up to 240 mm, allowing for four suitcases to be loaded into the cargo space while still carrying five occupants. Additionally, the rear seats can be reclined by up to 70 degrees to offer occupants sleeping space. There's also walkthrough front seats which makes ingress and egress between the front and rear seats very simple. Elsewhere, the new Roomy and Tank include a 5-liter removable center trash bin, a 4.2-inch TFT color display and a wide array of storage spaces. Also found within both models is a collision avoidance assist system which has five key functions. It includes collision avoidance brake assist, a line deviation warning function, an accidental-start control component for forward and backward starts, collision warning for other vehicles and pedestrians and finally, a system which notifies the driver that the vehicle ahead has started moving forward. Prices for the models range between 1.46 million yen ($14,200) and 2.008 million yen ($19,600). TOYOTA ROOMY",

Photo: Bob Levey, Getty Images For BT PR Image 40 of 40 Adele shares lots of stories and songs with Houston 1 / 40 Back to Gallery Adele is a testament to the absolute power of music.\nHer Tuesday night show at Toyota Center, the first of two sell-outs in Houston, was a respite from so much uncertainty and turmoil in the city, the country and the world.\nAdele herself acknowledged it throughout the show.\n\"I thought you weren't gonna come today with everything that's going on for you,\" she said early in the set, a tip to the night's presidential election.\nShe prefaced her gorgeous take on Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\" with another sweet sentiment.\n\"There's lots of different people here who support lots of different things,\" she said. \"But we've all come together to enjoy the music.\"\nSTRIKE A POSE: Adele, Destiny's Child take the Mannequin Challenge\nIt may sound like syrupy hyperbole. But anyone inside the arena sensed that energy. You could feel it even before she took the stage.\nMerchandise and concession stands closed at 7:55 p.m. in advance of an 8 p.m. start time and reopened later. (The show actually started at 8:13 p.m.)\nOpener \"Hello\" induced goosebumps. It was a perfect introduction, a declaration and a conversation with the crowd. They veered from awestruck silence to rapturous cheers within the song.\nShe started on a small stage near the back of the venue, walked through the crowd and onto the main stage during the instrumental break and asked them to sing the chorus. It was a striking display of poise and power.\nThe Houston show was No. 103 of 107 dates. The tour wraps this month with two dates in Mexico City and a rescheduled Phoenix show.\nImages of the Houston skyline flashed on the large screens during \"Hometown Glory.\"\n\"My queen is from here,\" Adele told the Houston crowd. \"Beyoncé is from here.\"\nShe joked frequently and chatted endlessly, asking the crowd to prepare for \"two hours of misery about me and my ex-boyfriends.\" The stories were equally as important as the songs.\nShe talked at length about her pregnancy and her son, her heartbreaks and her songwriting. She sang \"Happy Birthday\" to a 56-year-old fan. She apologized to \"anyone that got ripped off\" by ticket scalpers.\nShe also told the crowd she caught a Sia concert a few days earlier in Austin.\n\"By the end I was wearing one of her wigs,\" Adele quipped. \"I don't drink that much, but three beers tipped me over the edge.\"\nAnd the songs -- each one an astonishing display of her vocal power and stage presence. It was a perfect balance of grand pop majesty, true artistry and intimate moments. Adele's voice moves effortlessly from silky smooth to a raspy roar, lifted by that signature wave of emotion.\nLocal teenage singer Ma'at, who appeared on \"The X Factor,\" took the stage and wowed Adele with a soaring version of \"Chasing Pavements\" back on the smaller stage. Adele herself had just wowed the crowd with the song.\nShe gushed about bluegrass singer Alison Krauss, who inspired a striking performance of \"Don't You Remember.\" The solemn \"Million Years Ago\" could have been written by Burt Bacharach.\" And she managed considerable bounce during \"Send My Love (To Your New Lover)\" and \"Water Under the Bridge.\"\nHer most affecting hits -- \"Someone Like You,\" \"Set Fire to the Rain,\" \"When We Were Young,\" \"Rolling in the Deep -- provided some of the night's strongest emotional moments.\nI'll definitely come back,\" she said. \"And I hope you'll have me again.\"",

Photo: Bob Levey, Getty Images For BT PR Image 40 of 40 Astonishing vocal power displayed by Adele 1 / 40 Back to Gallery Adele is a testament to the absolute power of music.\nHer Tuesday night show at Toyota Center , the first of two sellout events in Houston, was a respite from so much uncertainty and turmoil in the city, the country and the world.\nAdele herself acknowledged it throughout the show.\n\"I thought you weren't gonna come today with everything that's going on for you,\" she said early in the set, a tip to the night's presidential election.\nShe prefaced her gorgeous take on Bob Dylan 's \"Make You Feel My Love\" with another sweet sentiment.\n\"There's lots of different people here who support lots of different things,\" she said. \"But we've all come together to enjoy the music.\"\nIt may sound like syrupy hyperbole. But anyone inside the arena sensed that energy. You could feel it even before she took the stage.\nMerchandise and concession stands closed at 7:55 p.m. in advance of an 8 p.m. start time and reopened later. (The show actually started at 8:13 p.m.)\nOpener \"Hello\" induced goosebumps. It was a perfect introduction, a declaration and a conversation with the crowd. They veered from awestruck silence to rapturous cheers within the song.\nShe started on a small stage near the back of the venue, walked through the crowd and onto the main stage during the instrumental break and asked them to sing the chorus. It was a striking display of poise and power.\nThe Houston show was No. 103 of 107 dates. The tour wraps this month with two dates in Mexico City and a rescheduled Phoenix show.\n\"My queen is from here,\" Adele told the Houston crowd. \"Beyoncé is from here.\"\nImages of the Houston skyline flashed on the large screens during \"Hometown Glory.\"\nShe joked frequently and chatted endlessly, asking the crowd to prepare for \"two hours of misery about me and my ex-boyfriends.\" The stories were equally as important as the songs.\nShe talked at length about her pregnancy and her son, her heartbreaks and her songwriting. She sang \"Happy Birthday\" to a 56-year-old fan. She apologized to \"anyone that got ripped off\" by ticket scalpers.\nShe also told the crowd she caught a Sia concert a few days earlier in Austin.\n\"By the end I was wearing one of her wigs,\" Adele quipped. \"I don't drink that much, but three beers tipped me over the edge.\"\nAnd the songs - each one an astonishing display of her vocal power and stage presence. It was a perfect balance of grand pop majesty, true artistry and intimate moments.\nLocal teenage singer Ma'at took the stage and wowed Adele with a soaring version of \"Chasing Pavements.\"\nHer most affecting hits - \"Someone Like You,\" \"Set Fire to the Rain,\" \"When We Were Young,\" \"Rolling in the Deep - provided some of the strongest emotional moments.\n\"I'll definitely come back,\" she said. \"And I hope you'll have me again.\"",

      "text": "Post by suj on Nov 9, 2016 12:02:14 GMT Car: Toyota MR2Engine: 1.8 16v VVTi (140bhp)Mileage: 82k (will go up slightly)Price: £1700onoMOT: 31st March 2017Regrettably my MR2 is going up for sale, I needed something a bit more practical, which is a shame as I really do enjoy this car and will miss it.It is a facelift model, so has the different front and rear lights/bumpers, different seats, 6speed gearbox (with LSD) and slightly refined piston oil rings.It has red leather seats and doorcards that are really comfortable and contrast quite well.Roof is in great condition with no tears, just could do with a good conditioning service on it again (will include the Autoglym product for this)Car has part service history I bought it on condition and how it drove originally. It was just serviced on 08/11/2016 (Shell Helix Ultra, Mahle filter, Corteco sump plug, NGK spark plugs and Mann air filter).The clutch and flywheel was changed by the previous owner on 05/01/2016, it is lovely and light and makes it so easy to drive.It also had a new radiator by the previous owner (and pipework) this is a common fault of them leaking. He also put a “Midship Runabout” badge on the front (the standard one comes with the car)The lambda sensor went early on in my ownership, I have read about loads of problems with poorer branded lambda sensors causing problems, so I changed all 3 to Denso parts.Also while I was doing the lambda sensors, another common problem is the pre-cats breaking up and causing damage to the engine (have a google over this), so I opted to put in a Toyosport stainless steel manifold, I used genuine gaskets from Toyota (engine>manifold and manifold>catalyst).In my ownership I have done the following:* Genuine lower steering UJ (common fault, and not cheap!)* Toyosport stainless steel exhaust manifold + genuine gaskets (precautionary mod to stop pre-cat break up)* All 3 Lambda sensors changed for Denso parts* Serviced myself when I first got it and as mentioned above (oil, oil filter, sparkplugs and air filter)* Genuine chain pre-tensioner (another common leak / failure)* Mitsubishi clear interior light cover + LED bulb (standard is really dim)* Electric-hydraulic powersteering replaced (with used part) + Genuine Toyota EHPS fluid* Rear passenger hub replaced (due to a bush worn causing a knock, cannot buy bush separately)* Gearbox mount changedBad bits:* There is a rattle which sounds like the exhaust, it is intermittent and mechanic when servicing the car had a look but he couldn’t find the cause (you can sometimes simulate it with the car switched off by rocking it back and forth)* I had a nail in one of the rear tyres, the garage didn’t have a Falken to match, so it has a part-worn Nankang* Wheels have bubbling to paintwork (common fault)* It is a 13 year old car, so it has the typical age-related marks / stonechips* Wear on the drivers seat bolster (again a common fault)* Clouding on the plastic headlights, I never got round to sanding, polishing and UV protecting themIt has been a great car, I use it daily for a 75mile round trip to work and it has never missed a beat. I have taken it on two roadtrips round the Peak District, again it never missed a beat and surprised many friends with their more powerful / faster cars. It handles so good and the VVTi engine is very torquey so quite easy to drive daily.It can easily get me 43mpg on a run to work daily (350miles to 37litres) and has averaged 37mpg so it is very economical for such a fun car (thanks to its light weight).Price is £1700 but I am open to sensible offers. I have a replacement so no part-exchange offers please.(I will be out of the country from 17th-22nd November, so will not be able to answer calls)My number is 07886265401",

      "text": "New Toyota C-HR Enters Production In Turkey | By Share Toyota has started the production of its new C-HR crossover model in their Sakarya plant in Turkey. The Turkish plant adds the new Toyota C-HR next to the Corolla and Verso models which are produced on the same line. The new crossover is also the first hybrid model to be built in the country.“The Toyota C-HR is a hugely important product for the whole of Toyota, not just for Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey. The crossover segment is growing fast. This car is Toyota’s very strong entry to this segment,” said Dr Van Zyl, Toyota Motor Europe (TME) President and CEO, during the line-off ceremony at the factory. The new C-HR is also the first Toyota based on the company’s new global architecture (TNGA) to be manufactured outside Japan. “TNGA is our new philosophy of vehicle creation and part of our initiatives for building ever-better cars. Toyota will gradually expand the production of vehicles based on TNGA,” added Moritaka Yoshida, President of the Mid-size Vehicle Company within Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyota’s plant in Turkey already exports around 80 percent of its production to Europe and is planning to gradually expand its export destinations outside Europe to include the USA, Canada, Taiwan, Mauritius and South Africa. Total production capacity has been increased from 150,000 to 280,000 vehicles per year. “It is a great privilege for us to export to North America, because it is Toyota’s biggest market and our customers there expect a lot from Toyota in terms of quality, customer satisfaction, and connection to the brand,” said Dr van Zyl. “TMMT has been one of our best plants globally for many years when it comes to build quality, and I am very confident our members there will exceed our North American customers’ expectations,” he added. The new Toyota C-HR will be offered with either a turbocharged 114hp 1.2-litre petrol engine or a hybrid 120hp petrol-electric powertrain. Selected markets will also get the option of a 142hp 2.0-litre petrol unit, mated exclusively to a CVT automatic transmission. The North American model will debut at the upcoming LA Auto Show while order books in Europe have already been opened ahead of the C-HR’s official launch there. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "The U.S. Car Market's Peak Is Behind Us, Toyota and Nissan Think 9 Nov 2016, 14:34   Industry For a very long time, North America has been the main export market for most Japanese car manufacturers. During the first nine months of this year alone, 1.3 million cars belonging to Japanese companies have been sold in the U.S. and Canada. As a scale reference, that's twice as many as the vehicles sold in Europe and four times more than those sold in the rest of Asia. In other words, excluding the domestic market, North America accounts for more than half of the total number of cars sold by Japanese automakers. Any significant change will not only affect Toyota , Nissan , Honda or Subaru , but also the Japanese economy as a whole. Now, Automotive News tells us that Toyota Motor Corp. has cut its sales forecast for the North American market for this fiscal year by 60,000 vehicles. More than that, the world's number one carmaker also said it expects a drop in profits for the first time, following the US consumer's regained love for large trucks as the price of fuel remains low. Toyota reported a 43 percent slump in quarterly operating profit yesterday, which prompted Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, to declare that \"the market turned out to be somewhat weaker\" and that it will require \" very careful managing going forward .\" Toyota has been guilty of offering a lot of incentives in order to boost its sales, with the flipside of obtaining smaller profit margins. Takahiko Ijichi calls them \"appropriate levels \" (of incentives), but the fact of the matter is that by the end of the fiscal year in March, Toyota is still expecting a 40 percent drop in operating profit to $16.3 billion. The good news for the Japanese manufacturers comes from Asia, where there is still room for growth. China in particular is looking like the most favorable prospect, especially for more accessible models that could appeal to people in less developed cities. Toyota Nissan sales North America Japan",

Toyota super fans! We’re giving you an exclusive sneak peek at the all-new Toyota C-HR. Arriving 2017. What’s your first impression of it? pic.twitter.com/nygCkHx74D — Toyota South Africa (@ToyotaSA) October 25, 2016 \nThe C-HR is based on the same platform as Toyota’s highly successful Prius. \nIt takes its design cues from its Lexus brother with a pronounced front-end. \nOverall, the design is exciting, which is likely to appeal to a younger audience. \nCrossover fans will like the fresh-looking interior. The C-HR comes standard with dual-zone aircon, automated wipers, a Touch 2 touch-screen and a reverse camera. \nTwo engine options will be available: a 1.2-litre petrol producing 85kW (power can be sent to either the front wheels via a 6-speed manual or all-wheels via a CVT box) or a hybrid with a 1,8-litre petrol pushing 90kW (only emits 82g/km CO2). \nThe C-HR will be making its way to local showrooms in the new year. \n– Sthembiso Lebuso",

      "title": "Toyota Starts C-HR Production In Turkey – Surging Subcompact CUV Category Gets New Member",
      "text": "Tweet \nBound for its North American production reveal at the Los Angeles Auto Show next week, production of the Toyota C-HR began today in Sakarya, Turkey. \nThe C-HR becomes the eighth vehicle built by Toyota in Europe and the third model built by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey. The C-HR also joins a booming subcompact crossover segment that’s grown nearly 30 percent in the United States this year. \nIt’s a segment that now produces 3 percent of the U.S. auto industry’s volume, triple its share from just two years ago. \nAs new candidates join the fold, the overall segment grows its volume because existing nameplates tend — at least so far — to lose very little volume to the intruders. Whether that will be true of the Toyota C-HR remains to be seen, of course. We don’t yet know its precise specifications, price point, or the breadth of Toyota’s marketing campaign. \nBut Toyota is a huge force in America’s SUV/crossover arena. The 4Runner, Highlander, Land Cruiser, Sequoia, and top-selling RAV4 grew their collective U.S. volume to 536,334 sales through the first ten months of 2016, a 12-percent increase for a quintet that now accounts for three-in-ten Toyota brand sales. \nThe RAV4 is America’s second-best-selling utility vehicle . \nThe Highlander is America’s second-best-selling three-row vehicle. \nThe 4Runner is America’s second-best-selling body-on-frame SUV. \nAt Toyota’s upmarket Lexus division, the RX is America’s best-selling premium utility vehicle, and by a wide margin. \nThere is therefore plenty of reason to believe that Toyota can succeed in yet another utility vehicle category. \nThe Toyota C-HR exits a 5,000-employee Turkish factory that will now build 280,000 vehicles per year, nearly double the factory’s output prior to the C-HR era thanks to a €350 million ($384 million) investment. Toyota says the C-HR goes down the same line as the Corolla and Verso, although the C-HR is the first Toyota built outside Japan on the new TNGA architecture that underpins the latest Prius. \nIn order for the Toyota C-HR to reproduce RAV4 esque dominance, the new Toyota will need to surpass the steadily growing Subaru Crosstrek (an admittedly large, but still sub-Forester, “subcompact”), the top-selling Jeep Renegade, and GM twins from Buick and Chevrolet that jointly hold 29 percent of the category, tops among any manufacturer. \nIncidentally, with the market’s 6-percent slide in October , the rate of growth achieved by America’s subcompact crossover slowed notably just as Toyota readied production of the C-HR. While segment-wide sales rose 33 percent through the first three-quarters of 2016, October volume rose just 2 percent, year-over-year. \nTimothy Cain is the founder of GoodCarBadCar.net , which obsesses over the free and frequent publication of U.S. and Canadian auto sales figures.

      "text": "Tweet \nToyota’s going to market the new Prius Prime with laser-like precision. Is it because they want to embrace cutting-edge advertising methods or is because they don’t see it as a vehicle with particularly broad appeal? \nThat, BMW thinks it might want to keep an unpopular model around for another generation, Volvo issues a voluntary recall on seat belts, and Toyota and Nissan agree that their prospects have looked better in North America… after the break! \nToyota uses targeted TV to sell the Prius Prime \nInstead of running a national television advertising campaign, Toyota’s media plan is much more focused and includes one of the company’s largest “addressable TV” purchases in history. \nAutomakers like targeted advertising because they can zero in on households with the ideal incomes, interests, and expiration dates on their car leases. Toyota likes addressable TV because it means it can target Prius Prime ads at college-educated people, environmentalists, and those between 18 and 49 with household incomes above $75,000. \nWhile brands have always endeavored to reach their customer base through advertising, addressable TV allows television to become nearly as selective as the internet in terms of who sees what. As automakers frequently have various products aimed at drastically different customers, they’ve become early adopters of the technology. \nAdvertising Age writes: \nOther automakers that have recently made addressable buys include Hyundai, which is currently using the method to run ads for its new luxury Genesis brand by targeting households with incomes of $100,000 or more. “We use it because we understand that that’s one of the most targeted forms of getting a big screen to light up with our message in the exact households you want it to,” said Hyundai Motor America Chief Marketing Officer Dean Evans. “We understand it’s got its limited reach today,” he added. But “we think we have to go there just to become smarter marketers.” \nThe Prius Prime starts at $27,100 before shipping, and is eligible for a federal tax credit of $4,500. If you are an 18- to 49-year-old environmentally minded professional, expect to see ads for Toyota’s new plug-in. \nBMW probably won’t abandon the i3 just yet \nIt seems that BMW is going to continue on with the i3, despite sales being well below expectations. \nWhen Automotive News asked Heinrich Schwackhoefer, i3 project manager, if a replacement is in the cards, he said, “I firmly expect that. It’s not the sentiment within the company that it’s been a failure — absolutely not at all.” \nHowever, failure may be an apt word, as sales have been dismal for the subcompact EV. BMW only sold 443 of them in the U.S. last month and the i3 is routinely outsold by Nissan’s Leaf and more expensive offerings from Tesla. Still, the little electric has made more of a home for itself in densely populated cities than the Mitsubishi i MiEV ever managed. \n“The “i’ subbrand is stable and you can count on a successor to the i3, but I cannot say when that will be,” Schwackhoefer said. \nVolvo voluntarily issues seatbelt recall \nVolvo is recalling about 74,000 late-model vehicles in the U.S. and another 5,000 in Canada. The company is concerned that a issue with the seat belts might inadequately restrain passengers in the event of a crash. \nThe affected vehicles include Volvo’s S60, S90, V60, XC60 and XC90 from the 2016-17 model years. Volvo spokesman Jim Nichols stated the problem is caused by a connecting pin in the buckle that could cause the seat belt to work inadequately during an impact. Nichols said the move is mainly precautionary and no incidents have been reported. \nVolvo owners can take their vehicles into a dealership for an brief inspection. If needed, dealers will replace the affected part free of charge. \nNissan and Toyota think the U.S. market is tapped out \nToyota and Nissan are in agreement that sales in the United States have reached the high water mark. Automotive News reports that Toyota Motor Corp. has scaled back its forecast for North American sales by 60,000 vehicles this year. This reduction is heavily influenced by North America’s gradual turn away from economical cars and a return to SUVs, crossovers, and trucks. \nMeanwhile, Nissan has continued offering heftier incentives to boost its sales. While the incentives worked mainly as intended, the company still reported a 19-percent decrease in operating profit for the third quarter. Autodata Corp estimates that Nissan is spending $3,607 per vehicle while Toyota’s incentives stand at $2,270. \nAutomotive News writes: \n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said.",

What sort of oversight will be enforced upon autonomous vehicles? What about the recently announced expansion of electric car charging stations? \nOnly time will tell, but let’s begin this Wednesday edition of the Daily Drive-Thru with what we do know. Trump’s Mexican tough talk raises concerns On the campaign trail, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was critical of the Ford Motor Company's decision to move some vehicle production to Mexico. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nHaving run a campaign largely centered on restructuring trade deals and bringing manufacturing jobs, specifically those in the automotive industry, back from Mexico, Trump’s election poses a significant threat to American automakers that have been migrating their small car operations to Mexico. \nThe real estate magnate-turned-politician threatened to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, of NAFTA, and impose penalties on American countries that set up shop outside the U.S. Ford was a go-to punching bag for Trump throughout his campaign because of its decision to move its entire small car division south of the border. General Motors is also vulnerable to a potential Trump tariff, as it has made a similar manufacturing shift, though less publically. \nTrump’s electoral victories in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and most likely Michigan too, are a sign that disgruntled former auto workers were a large part of his coalition. The companies that once provided jobs to those workers might not be so enthusiastic about our president-elect. \nSource: Reuters Global automakers shaken by election result BMW will produce 3 Series sedans in its forthcoming a Mexico plant, for which construction began just this week. (BMW) \nIf NAFTA is ended or severely altered, it will affect not only domestic automakers, but also companies from Europe and Asia that have bolstered their North American presences with Mexican facilities. Toyota, Nissan and Honda all saw stock market losses in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s election, posting declines of 6.5 percent, 6 percent and 7.8 percent, in their respective share values. \nAcross the Atlantic, the European automotive stock index fell 2.6 percent based on concerns over the future of Germany’s big three automakers, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW, all of which have made recent investments in Mexico. BMW broke ground on a factory in San Luis Potosi this summer, Audi opened a plant in San Jose Chiapa in September and Daimler recently announced plans to open a Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Mexico by 2018. \nMeanwhile, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which would have opened up free trade with several Asian countries, is as good as dead with Trump headed for the White House. Toyota, Nissan hurt by stronger yen Toyota's profits dropped by 43 percent last quarter because of a strengthened yen. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) \nBefore polls closed for Tuesday’s presidential election in the U.S., Toyota and Nissan saw profits take a dip as Japan’s currency continues to strengthen. Both automakers have, in recent history, both used the relative weakness of the yen compared to other currencies to boost their profit margins. \nNissan reported a 19 percent decline in profitability, while Toyota’s profits tumbled by a hefty 43 percent. There’s no word yet on how the U.S. election results are expected to influence the automakers’ bottom lines. Quebec will lead the way for zero emissions in Canada Quebec is the first Canadian province to push for zero-emissions-vehicles. (AFP/Getty Images) \nIf Tuesday’s results have you seriously considering a move to Canada, you might want to 1) get familiar with the NHL 2) bone up on your Français and 3) consider investing in an electric car. Quebec has announced that it will be the first Canadian province to adopt a zero-emissions mandate for passenger vehicles. \nLooking to get 100,000 emission-free vehicles on the road by 2020, Quebec will offer as much as $8,000 in rebates for plug-in electric vehicle purchases, issue grants for charging stations and set aside lanes for exclusive use by electrified vehicles. Hertz took a beating last quarter This past fiscal quarter was not kind to Hertz. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \nWhile the past three months were disappointing for the entire nation, they were especially bad for Hertz Global Holdings and its car rental operation. Shares fell by 52 percent, $1.5 billion in equity value were lost, rental revenue fell by 2 percent and fleet use was at a subpar 82 percent. \nAnalysts say the issue was largely a matter of pricing. Hertz failed to adequately set and depreciate the prices on its vehicles before selling them at auction. Why? The simple answer is the company failed to realize just how unpopular sedans and compact cars have become. \nWith pickups, SUVs and other light trucks steadily gaining in popularity, rental fleets are one of the last bastions for sedans sales in the U.S. However, when vehicles become outdated rental companies typically sell them at auction, and therein lies the problem for Hertz: the demand for cars is low and resale values are too. \nAs for the drop in rental revenue, it stands to reason that an increase in ride-sharing services might have taken a significant chunk out of the Hertz’s bottom line, but I don’t have hard data to back that up. \nSource: Bloomberg \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Tuesday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "text": "Automakers are drawn to addressable TV because ads can be used to target households with car leases that are set to expire, meaning they could be in the market to buy a car soon. Toyota is pointing Prius Prime TV ads at exactly the customers it wants New addressable ad technique pinpoints potential Prius customers \nNovember 9, 2016 Pinterest Email \nAs Toyota markets its new Prius Prime plug-in hybrid the automaker is going after a very specific consumer: tech-savvy, knowledge-hungry drivers ages 18-49 with household incomes of $75,000 or more and who tend to be environmentally conscious but also economical. \nSo instead of running a national TV campaign, Toyota's media plan is highly targeted, including one of the automaker's largest addressable TV buys ever. Addressable TV ads, which allow marketers to target consumers by household characteristics, remains a small but growing fraction of TV buys. \nResearch firm eMarketer projected in a report earlier this year that addressable in the U.S. would surge by 119.4 percent this year to $890 million. But that remains just 1.3 percent of total TV ad spending, according to the report. \nAutomakers are drawn to addressable because ads can be used to target households with car leases that are set to expire, meaning they could be in the market to buy a car soon. \nToyota declined to release the financial terms of its deal. But Lisa McQueen, media manager for Toyota Motor Sales USA, suggested in a statement that the deal will allow the automaker to target potential Prius Prime buyers who \"see their vehicle as an extension of their consumption of advanced technology.\" \nShe added: \"Addressable TV is an efficient way to reach those consumers while still taking advantage of the premium linear TV positioning to build awareness.\" \n\"An expanded universe of data sources that allow for one-to-one communication is what makes the promise of addressable TV so attractive to the marketplace, and especially automakers,\" said Janet Waters, communications director for Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, which handles media planning and creative advertising for Toyota. \"As the delivery pipes converge and TV simply becomes another screen, the improved ability to reach a targeted audience will significantly increase buying efficiency.\" \nToyota is the world leader in hybrids, pioneering their development as mass-market transportation alternatives 25 years ago and then selling way more of them than any other carmaker on the planet. ... \nHyundai's ads \nOther automakers that have recently made addressable buys include Hyundai , which is currently using the method to run ads for its new luxury Genesis brand by targeting households with incomes of $100,000 or more. \n\"We use it because we understand that that's one of the most targeted forms of getting a big screen to light up with our message in the exact households you want it to,\" said Hyundai Motor America Chief Marketing Officer Dean Evans. \"We understand it's got its limited reach today,\" he added. But \"we think we have to go there just to become smarter marketers.\" \nToyota's addressable buy backs a new ad that portrays a man who has traveled through different historical eras and has remained skeptical about new inventions, including the wheel, electricity and trains. His skepticism vanishes as he is shown in modern times riding shotgun in a Prius Prime. \"He's just poo-pooed all these things and finally he is just impressed with this car,\" said John Payne, Saatchi's executive creative director. \nTo watch the ad, click here \nHybrid car buyers, including Prius consumers, have had the perception that they must make certain compromises, like a lack of style or fun, when buying the cars, he said. \"What this campaign is out to do is to change people's perception of what they get when they buy a Prius -- so this is the new possible.\" \nAs Automotive News recently reported , the Prime \"is basically for buyers who want to dip their toes into the electric-car market but don't want to take any chances with range anxiety or pay a premium they may not be able to recover in fuel savings.\" \nThe car's base sticker price, with shipping, is $27,965. Buyers are eligible for federal tax credits of up to $4,500. When in hybrid mode the Prime can run on gasoline, or use the electric motor alone, or a combination of both. It has an electric-only range of 25 miles. \nWith continued low gasoline prices, Prius sales in the U.S. through October have plunged 28 percent to 113,690 vehicles. \nBy E.J.

      "text": "Toyota and Nissan Both Say Their U.S. Car Sales Have Peaked America isn't the endless car selling machine it used to be for these Japanese automakers. twitter.com/aaronmaxb instagram.com/aaronmaxb \nCar sales in the United States have slowed dramatically for Toyota and Nissan , Japan's two largest automakers, according to a new report—and both brands think their share of the U.S. auto market has gone as high as it will go. \nFor the first time this year, Toyota said it is projecting a drop in sales for the year as American car buyers continue to favor larger cars like SUVs and trucks over more efficient vehicles , Automotive News reported. That's a problem for the Japanese automaker because the company has spent nearly two decades building its reputation off of clean emissions cars like the ones in its Prius lineup. \n\"The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,\" said Toyota executive vice president Takahiko Ijichi Tuesday after the company announced a 43 percent drop in quarterly profit, according to Automotive News . The U.S. automotive market \"really requires very careful managing going forward.\" \nToyota is expecting its operating profit to drop 40 percent for 2016 ending in March, reports said. \nSimilarly, Nissan believes there is no more room for growth in America. The company shared that it has experienced a fall in profits, even while attempting to serve up better incentives for buyers. While continuing these efforts, the company's operating profit dropped 19 percent in the last quarter. Yokohama projects that numbers for its entire sales year—which ends in March, like it does for Toyota—operating income will likely fall by 10 percent, AN reported. \n\"Incentives are rapidly growing in the [American car] industry, and we are paying close attention to it,\" Nissan co-chief executive officer Hiroto Saikawa. \nThe North American car market was the largest export area for Japanese automakers, with more than 1.3 million passenger vehicles delivered to the States over the first nine months of 2016. For reference, that number trumps what those carmakers see at ports onEarth's other six continents.",

      "text": "November 9, 2016 — Inspiration / Japanese / Truck & 4x4 / Under $20k | No Comments Nicely Kept w/ Ideal Options: 1987 Toyota 4Runner SR5 \nThis 1987 Toyota 4Runner SR5 (VIN JT4RN62S6H0137059) comes with the preferred four-cylinder/5-speed manual drivetrain combination, and the seller reports that it runs, shifts and drives very nicely. Tires are newer, and apart from an aftermarket rear bumper, the truck is almost entirely stock. Condition looks excellent throughout, and sale includes all original books and manuals. Find it here on eBay in Portland, Oregon with reserve not met. \nThe seller reports that the truck has been garaged from almost new, and that it has only one small dent anywhere. Paint and graphics are holding up well, and the tubular aftermarket rear bumper isn’t bad. We’d like to see it with the top removed, but all provided photos show it in place–often, these trucks have had their hard rear shells in place since leaving the factory decades ago. Factory wheels are hard to improve on, and the seller says that Toyo Open Country tires are newer–a matching spare will be added prior to sale. \nThe interior shows just as well, with nice upholstery and plastics front and rear. Carpets look decent too, and apart from a worn shift boot and some light wear around the driver’s bottom seat cushion, issues are very few. \nThere’s an older aftermarket Kenwood CD player fitted, as well as what looks to be a factory pop-out sunroof. Note the altimeter/inclinometer gauge pack mounted to the middle of the dash–always cool in 80’s and 90’s Japanese trucks. \nMileage is given as 143k and change, which agrees with what’s shown on the odometer in other photos. These 22R-E engines are known to be virtually indestructible, as well as very long-lived, and the seller reports that this one’s been well-maintained from new. \nThe clutch was new a few years ago, and the ad further reports that the truck shifts, runs, stops and steers very well.

      "title": "2017 Toyota RAV4 Received a Few Nifty Features",
      "text": "2017 Toyota RAV4 Received a Few Nifty Features 30 SHARES \nRevealed at the end of 2012, at the LA Auto Show, the fourth generation Toyota RAV4 brought a sort of revolution for Toyota’s popular compact SUV. It has gotten bigger, angular and wilder in its appearance. Four years have passed since and now we are greeting the 2017 Toyota RAV4. Not much has changed in terms of styling but a lot has happened in regard to safety and luxury. Toyota official press release states, among other things, this – “RAV4 Hybrid is Most Powerful and Most Fuel-Efficient RAV4 Ever.” \nWe knew this for quite some time, but Toyota finally decided to show it off. And not only in the press release but with the introduction of the new SE Hybrid Grade. This brings sporty styling, more equipment, and some cool features to the Hybrid name. What is more, we are wondering could this mean that Toyota wants to closely link all their hybrids with the sporty character of sorts? It could work in some cheesy kind of a way. \nThe SE trim visited all the right parts of the vehicle to steer it a bit on the sporty side. Buyers of the 2017 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid SE can expect aa lot. For the exterior – 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights, honeycomb grill mesh and special S-Code paint motif. The sporty effort continues on the inside as well with many SE exclusive features. Toyota put it like this: “Black headliner, Black A&B-pillar covers, sport floor mats, door sill protectors, and Gunmetal Gray trim.” All this with SofTex-covered seats and contrast stitching. Toyota, obviously, just scanned for all the cliche stuff, put it in and, honestly, it does not look half bad. Also, welcome paddle shifter behind the wheel. Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P) Standard \nApart from gifting the Hybrid with the new SE trim, Toyota introduced a standard safety package. Called the Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), the package includes “Pre-Collision with Pedestrian Detection function (PCS w/PD) featuring forward collision warning and Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist function (LDA w/SA), Automatic High Beams (AHB), and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC).” Nifty package. They want to keep the RAV4 as the pinnacle of the compact class of Crossovers. \nPetrol powered 2017 Toyota RAV4 received an all-new luxury package. Called the Platinum, it introduced the RAV4 to the Entune Premium JBL Audio system with Integrated Navigation and App Suite, and Bird’s Eye View Camera with Perimeter Scan. It packs a whole range of other features (smart key, 8-way powered seats, and remote liftgate just to name a few). \nAs ever, the car comes with a 2.5-liter VVT-i engine developing 176hp. The Hybrid, on the other hand, offers 194hp thanks to a 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle petrol engine and small high-torque electric motor. With it, the RAV4 can accelerate to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds. Apparently plenty enough for the introduction of the sporty SE trim. EPA estimated that the price for the 2017 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid starts at 34 mpg city/30 mpg highway/32 mpg combined. \n2017 Toyota RAV4’s price starts at $24,910 for the LE 2WD. On the other side of the price list sits the $36,150 4WD Platinum model.",

      "title": "Toyota launches all-new minivan model in Japan, also sold under Daihatsu and Subaru brands",
      "text": "Toyota has introduced a new a compact minivan, fitted with its newly developed 1.0-litre in-line 3-cylinder turbo engine. The vehicle will also be sold under the Daihatsu and Subaru brands.\nIHS Markit Perspective\nSignificance: Toyota has launched a new five-seater compact minivan, dubbed as the Roomy and the Tank, in Japan. Furthermore, the automaker also confirmed its plans to add more electric cars as part of its eco-friendly vehicle strategy mainly centred on fuel-cell vehicles. Implications: Both the Roomy and the Tank are fitted with a newly developed 1.0-litre in-line 3-cylinder turbo engine and paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Commenting on the newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine, Toyota claims that it can \"produce torque equivalent to that of a 1.5-litre class engine [140 Nm]”. Outlook: Japanese consumers will be able to purchase the Roomy from Toyota and Toyota Corolla dealerships across the country, while the Tank can be purchased from Toyopet and Netz dealerships across the country. The price range of the models has been kept between JPY1.46 million (USD13,980) and JPY2.01 million. Toyota expects to achieve a monthly sales volume of 3,750 units each of the Roomy and the Tank in Japan. Toyota has today (9 November) launched a new five-seater compact minivan, dubbed as the Roomy and the Tank, in Japan. According to the automaker, both the Roomy and the Tank are available in the following grades: Custom GT, Custom GS/Custom G, G-T, GS/G, and XS/X, all fitted with a newly developed 1.0-litre in-line 3-cylinder turbo engine and paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Commenting on the newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine, Toyota says that it can \"produce torque equivalent to that of a 1.5-liter class engine [140Nm]\". The new minivan is claimed to offer a fuel economy of 24.6 kilometres/litre for the two-wheel-drive model, 22.0 km/L for the four-wheel-drive model, and 21.8 km/L for the turbo-engine model. This will make them eligible for the Japanese government's subsidies and tax incentives for eco-cars. These results are based on the Japanese government's JC08 test cycle.\nThe automaker states that both the Roomy and Tank are based on the \"1LD-CAR\" concept, which combines a spacious interior with ample driving performance, targeted at families with small children, as well as customers with wide-ranging lifestyles. The models feature a power sliding door for easy entry and exit, a spacious interior, and variable seating configurations. In terms of key safety features, the vehicle features Toyota's Smart Assist II collision avoidance assist system. The primary role of this system is to help prevent or mitigate damage resulting from collisions in urban environments. The system provides driver support through five functions: a collision warning function for vehicles and pedestrians, a collision avoidance brake assist function for vehicles, an accidental-start control function for forward and backward starts, a line-deviation warning function, and a function that notifies the driver that the vehicle ahead has started moving forward. It is provided as standard on the XS, GS, G-T, Custom GS, and Custom G-T variants.\nSeparately, Toyota has confirmed plans to add more electric cars as part of its eco-friendly vehicle strategy, reports the Nikkei . The report cited Toyota's executive vice-president, Takahiko Ijichi, who said yesterday (8 November), \"We want to get ready to consider the future release of electric vehicles\". However, Ijichi added, \"We still consider fuel cell vehicles the ultimate eco-cars\", indicating that a dual focus is necessary to account for regional differences in conditions surrounding energy and infrastructure.\nOutlook and implications\nJapanese consumers will be able to purchase the Roomy from Toyota and Toyota Corolla dealerships across the country, while the Tank can be purchased from Toyopet and Netz dealerships across the country. The price range of the models has been kept between JPY1.46 million (USD13,980) and JPY2.01 million. Toyota expects to achieve a monthly sales volume of 3,750 units each of the Roomy and the Tank in Japan. According to Yoshiaki Kawano, a Tokyo-based senior analyst with IHS Automotive, Toyota is trying to make the two models look a bit different (with mild interior and exterior differences) in order to supply dealers catering to different customer groups.\nThe vehicle is developed by Daihatsu, is manufactured at its Ikeda plant in Japan. In addition to Toyota brand, the model will also be sold as Daihatsu's Thor and Thor Custom, and as Subaru's Justy and Justy Sport. Daihatsu expects to sell nearly 1,000 units monthly of the model in Japan. According to IHS Automotive light-vehicle data, the model, called the B-MPV, is expected to record a sales volume of nearly 11,669 units in 2016 and 56,532 units in 2017 in Japan under the Toyota brand. Under the Daihatsu brand, it will record sales of 933 units in 2016 and 4,522 units in 2017, while sales under the Subaru brand are expected to reach 1,050 units in 2016 and 5,086 units in 2017. The model is based on the new D91B(2) platform, on which Daihatsu also manufactures its Boon car.\nEarlier this week, Toyota was reported as planning to mass-produce long-range electric vehicles (EVs) by 2020, part of which plan has been confirmed now. The Japanese automaker will set up a team by next year that will work on developing EVs. No other details, including a specific time frame, were confirmed by the automaker. As part of Toyota's previously stated strategy, the automaker said it would develop only short-range EVs for city use and rely on petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as a replacement for conventional cars. MPV is developed by Daihatsu.\nAbout this article\nThe above article is from IHS Automotive Same-Day Analysis of automotive news, events and trends, and is a deliverable of the World Markets Automotive Service.

      "text": "Tariff on cars made in Mexico would have industrywide effect Policies could spark ‘worldwide trade war,’ U-M economist says Share on Facebook \nFord Motor Co. was a favorite target of Donald Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border throughout his campaign. Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and other U.S. carmakers are just as exposed. \nToyota and Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s largest automakers, were spared from Trump’s critique by name on the campaign trail. Yet, along with General Motors Co. and VW, they all rely on Mexican plants for millions of vehicles and a high volume of parts. That puts them at risk if the president-elect makes good on his threat to levy hefty taxes on cars assembled across the Rio Grande. \n“Trump could, or will, try to set up trade barriers,” said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. “Automakers with U.S. factories will therefore be on the winning side. Mexico, the new El Dorado of the auto industry, could suffer.” \nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments. VW’s Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the low-cost country, which Trump says has benefited at the expense of the American voters who propelled him to victory. Output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \nThe Republican candidate and real-estate developer grabbed headlines during his campaign by threatening to slap a 35 percent tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He called Ford’s plans for a new plant in Mexico “ an absolute disgrace .” A levy would lead to higher prices and hurt demand, said Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \nTrump would “start a worldwide trade war” if he decides to end trade pacts and uses anti-dumping provisions to impose widespread tariffs on other countries, said Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, requires only six months’ notice of termination to Canada and Mexico and doesn’t specify that the president would need congressional approval, he said. \n“These other countries would retaliate. Prices consumers would pay would increase sharply. The Federal Reserve would then increase interest rates. It would be ugly,” Grimes said. \nDespite that threat, U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union extended an olive branch to the president-elect. \n“We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country -- and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,” Ford said in a statement. The company’s plan to shift small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico was attacked by Trump during his first answer of the initial debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in September. \nGM and Fiat Chrysler said in separate statements they would work with Trump and the new Congress on policies that support manufacturing in the U.S. “It’s obvious there is work to be done,” UAW President Dennis Williams, whose union endorsed Clinton, said in a statement. \nGerman executives attending an industry conference in Munich on Wednesday also expressed concerns about Trump’s views. BMW is building a new car plant in Mexico’s San Luis Potosi that’s due to start production in 2019, while Audi started assembling autos in San Jose Chiapa in September. \n“We need open trade,” said BMW CEO Harald Krueger. The luxury automaker ships many of the SUVs assembled at its South Carolina factory to markets around the world and in turn exports sedans and Mini cars to the U.S. from Europe. “We live off exports and imports. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.” Conciliation Hopes \nDaimler CEO Dieter Zetsche and James Verrier, who heads supplier BorgWarner Inc., are among executives who held out hope that much of Trump’s trade talk was campaign rhetoric and would soften with the practicalities needed to govern. “Many things get said during the heat of an election campaign,” Zetsche said. “I hope and believe this is also the case here.” \nFor Bob Lutz, the retired vice chairman of GM, Trump’s victory could ultimately help the auto industry if his advisers and Congress keep him from pushing his protectionist agenda too far. \n“He’s not a dictator,” Lutz said in an interview. “No one can go in and abrogate trade deals. There are some aspects of NAFTA that will probably be re-negotiated, but he will probably be talked out of his crazier ideas.” \nRather than threaten Japan auto imports with tariffs, Trump has pointed to wealth generated from the cars being sold in the U.S. to bolster his argument for America to pay a smaller share of the costs related to stationing troops in its biggest Asian ally’s territory. \n“Japan is ripping us off with the cars,” Trump said at an Oct. 12 campaign event in Florida. In remarks to Ohio volunteers in July, he spoke of “massive ships” delivering vehicles to the U.S. from Japan, which he told Americans was “rich because of us.” \nRepresentatives for Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co. declined to comment. \nJapan’s automakers have combined capacity to build about 1.36 million vehicles annually in Mexico and have announced plans for new plants capable of assembling another 430,000 vehicles a year. Models built or planned for Mexican production and sale in the U.S. include the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Versa and Sentra, and the Honda Fit and HR-V. \n“If NAFTA is going to be up for discussion somewhere down the line, that would affect Japanese companies very much, especially auto-related investments in Mexico,” said Bob Takai, president and CEO of Sumitomo Global Research Co. “If the trading and investing is going to be very difficult because of the new presidency, we may go somewhere else.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "title": "Toyota has decided to punt on Super Bowl LI ads",
      "text": "By Mary Conway 2016-11-09 22:11 Toyota has decided to punt on Super Bowl LI ads Toyota has already decided to not advertise its vehicles during Super Bowl LI. Fox network wants between $5 and $5.5 million for each 30-second spot which would make the ads the most expensive in history. \nToyota has decided to sit on the sidelines during Super Bowl LI. They are the first major automaker to go public with their plans. Ads for the 2017 Super Bowl, on Fox, will cost between $5 and $5.5 million, a staggering amount for a single advertisement. Last year’s ads sold for approximately $5 million. Lexus isn’t saying what its advertising plans are at this point. \nToyota isn’t the first big automaker to take a pass on the big show. Ford hasn’t advertised in the Super Bowl since 2013. \nAccording to Advertising Age, seven carmakers spent a total of about $90 million for nine minutes of ads in Super Bowl 50. The biggest spenders were Hyundai and Kia, which spent about $20 million. Hyundai also signed a deal with the NFL last year so it could use the NFL logos. Supposedly that arrangement is costing $50 million for four years. \nAs exorbitant as those figures sound, spending by the automakers, in the Super Bowl, was down compared to previous years. \nFor 2015’s game, or Super Bowl XLIX, six auto manufacturers spent $96.8 million to air 11 minutes of commercials. In 2014, nine car companies spent a whopping $113 million. \nJust because auto companies may decide to punt on the big game, it doesn’t mean they are pulling back from football. Ford is finding a strong audience with ads during college football games and play-off games. \nFord also announced at the start of the NFL season, that the Ford F series is starting a 3-year stint as the official truck of the NFL. To celebrate the new partnership, Ford is also joining forces with Uber, providing a special fleet of F series super duty trucks that can be ordered for tailgating. The super duty truck is a bigger, more rugged version of the F-150. The trucks are usually F-250s. \nToyota is still very visible in the NFL with ads on “Sunday Night Football” and “Monday Night Football”. Toyota also sponsors the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers, Indianapolis Colts and Seattle Seahawks. \nChevrolet also advertises extensively during college and NFL games. It is too early to know which auto companies or brands will decide to run ads in the 2017 Super Bowl. Fiat Chrysler has been in for at least the last four. It is an opportunity to reach a huge audience, but at more than $10 million a minute, it is a very expensive gamble.",

      "text": "TOYOTA’s LATEST CRUISER 10 Nov 2016, 9:45 a.m. \nOH what a feeling a new sports cruiser from Toyota should provide. Called the Ponam-28V, it sports a Prado diesel engine and hybrid hull comprising fibreglass, aluminium and carbon. Among the technological wizardry is a virtual anchoring system claimed to be the world’s first station-holding pilot for a single-shaft boat. The 260hp, 3-litre inline diesel is derived from Yanmar and coupled with a duoprop sterndrive. Apparently it performs exceptionally well in the lightweight, low-drag hull. Toyota has modest sales expectations, with the Ponam-28V to retail for around $320,000 for the luxury model. Latest News ",

      "text": "November 9, 2016 — 9:03 PM EST November 9, 2016 — 9:03 PM EST Tariff on cars made in Mexico would have industrywide effect Policies could spark ‘worldwide trade war,’ U-M economist says \nFord Motor Co. was a favorite target of Donald Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border throughout his campaign. Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and other U.S. carmakers are just as exposed. \nToyota and Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s largest automakers, were spared from Trump’s critique by name on the campaign trail. Yet, along with General Motors Co. and VW, they all rely on Mexican plants for millions of vehicles and a high volume of parts. That puts them at risk if the president-elect makes good on his threat to levy hefty taxes on cars assembled across the Rio Grande. \n“Trump could, or will, try to set up trade barriers,” said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. “Automakers with U.S. factories will therefore be on the winning side. Mexico, the new El Dorado of the auto industry, could suffer.” Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Since 2010, nine global automakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments. VW’s Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the low-cost country, which Trump says has benefited at the expense of the American voters who propelled him to victory. Output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nThe Republican candidate and real-estate developer grabbed headlines during his campaign by threatening to slap a 35 percent tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He called Ford’s plans for a new plant in Mexico “ an absolute disgrace .” A levy would lead to higher prices and hurt demand, said Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \nTrump would “start a worldwide trade war” if he decides to end trade pacts and uses anti-dumping provisions to impose widespread tariffs on other countries, said Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, requires only six months’ notice of termination to Canada and Mexico and doesn’t specify that the president would need congressional approval, he said. \nRead more: Gadfly looks at which carmakers build the most vehicles in Mexico \n“These other countries would retaliate. Prices consumers would pay would increase sharply. The Federal Reserve would then increase interest rates. It would be ugly,” Grimes said. \nDespite that threat, U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union extended an olive branch to the president-elect. \n“We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country -- and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,” Ford said in a statement. The company’s plan to shift small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico was attacked by Trump during his first answer of the initial debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in September. \nGM and Fiat Chrysler said in separate statements they would work with Trump and the new Congress on policies that support manufacturing in the U.S. “It’s obvious there is work to be done,” UAW President Dennis Williams, whose union endorsed Clinton, said in a statement. \nGerman executives attending an industry conference in Munich on Wednesday also expressed concerns about Trump’s views. BMW is building a new car plant in Mexico’s San Luis Potosi that’s due to start production in 2019, while Audi started assembling autos in San Jose Chiapa in September. \n“We need open trade,” said BMW CEO Harald Krueger. The luxury automaker ships many of the SUVs assembled at its South Carolina factory to markets around the world and in turn exports sedans and Mini cars to the U.S. from Europe. “We live off exports and imports. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.” Conciliation Hopes \nDaimler CEO Dieter Zetsche and James Verrier, who heads supplier BorgWarner Inc., are among executives who held out hope that much of Trump’s trade talk was campaign rhetoric and would soften with the practicalities needed to govern. “Many things get said during the heat of an election campaign,” Zetsche said. “I hope and believe this is also the case here.” \nFor Bob Lutz, the retired vice chairman of GM, Trump’s victory could ultimately help the auto industry if his advisers and Congress keep him from pushing his protectionist agenda too far. \n“He’s not a dictator,” Lutz said in an interview. “No one can go in and abrogate trade deals. There are some aspects of NAFTA that will probably be re-negotiated, but he will probably be talked out of his crazier ideas.” \nRather than threaten Japan auto imports with tariffs, Trump has pointed to wealth generated from the cars being sold in the U.S. to bolster his argument for America to pay a smaller share of the costs related to stationing troops in its biggest Asian ally’s territory. \n“Japan is ripping us off with the cars,” Trump said at an Oct. 12 campaign event in Florida. In remarks to Ohio volunteers in July, he spoke of “massive ships” delivering vehicles to the U.S. from Japan, which he told Americans was “rich because of us.” \nRepresentatives for Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co. declined to comment. \nJapan’s automakers have combined capacity to build about 1.36 million vehicles annually in Mexico and have announced plans for new plants capable of assembling another 430,000 vehicles a year. Models built or planned for Mexican production and sale in the U.S. include the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Versa and Sentra, and the Honda Fit and HR-V. \n“If NAFTA is going to be up for discussion somewhere down the line, that would affect Japanese companies very much, especially auto-related investments in Mexico,” said Bob Takai, president and CEO of Sumitomo Global Research Co. “If the trading and investing is going to be very difficult because of the new presidency, we may go somewhere else.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "title": "Toyota, Nissan agree U.S. market has reached its peak",
      "text": "By : Anthony Karr , Editor No potential for further growth, says Nissan boss. \nWorld’s largest automaker, Toyota , along with another major Japanese company on the market, Nissan , have both agreed that the American car market has already reached its peak. \nToyota might lose its crown as the biggest manufacturer in the world after four consecutive years of lead, since Volkswagen is in position to overtake the Japanese brand. By the end of September, VW has delivered 7.61 million vehicles worldwide against 7.53 million from Toyota. \nToyota experienced some problems with its suppliers, while the Prius hybrid sales were hit by the low gas prices in the United States. That’s why, the manufacturer cut its North American sales forecast by 60,000 years for this fiscal year, which ends in March 2017. \nOn the other side, Nissan posted a drop in its profit thanks to heftier incentives, and declared it’s not seeing room for further expansion on the American market. \n“It’s a peak and we don't see a potential for further growth\" Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer at Nissan, commented at a press conference Monday. \n“Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.” \n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” his colleague Takahiko Ijichi, Toyota executive vice president, agreed. The North American scene \"really requires very careful managing going forward,\" he added. \nThe North American market is very important not only for Toyota and Nissan, but also for Japan’s economy at all. During the first nine months of the year, Japanese manufacturers exported more than 1.3 million vehicles to the region, double the number of cars shipped to Europe and four times the number exported to the rest of Asia, including China. \nSpeaking of China, the largest automobile market in the world is believed to be the key factor for Volkswagen eventually becoming the world’s biggest automaker. While Toyota totally outsells the Germans in the United States, in China for every one Toyota sold, VW sells three cars. \nNote: 2016 Toyota Camry XSE pictured. \nSource: Nissan and Toyota via Automotive News Be part of something big About this article",

      "text": "Be part of something big Toyota C-HR brings first full hybrid to subcompact crossover segment Hide press release Show press release TOYOTA STARTS PRODUCTION OF NEW C-HR CROSSOVER Official production launch for Toyota’s new mid-size crossover Vehicles built at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey, with hybrid versions featuring engines built at Toyota’s Deeside plant in the UK New C-HR takes Toyota’s European production tally up to eight models C-HR to be exported from Europe to North America First UK customer deliveries from January \nToyota has officially launched production of the new C-HR, a model that promises a radical injection of style, handling and driving pleasure into the medium-size crossover market. \nC-HR also signals a further strengthening of Toyota’s European and British manufacturing operations, being built in Turkey with hybrid engines supplied by the company’s Deeside engine plant in North Wales and transmissions from Poland. Toyota has invested an additional £7.1 million in Toyota Manufacturing UK’s operations to bring the hybrid engine into production. \nC-HR’s dynamic quality is rooted in its use of a Toyota New Global Architecture-based platform, securing fundamental advantages such as a low centre of gravity and a highly rigid body construction. The model is the first outside Japan to be manufactured using TNGA, which is a central element in Toyota’s commitment to build ever-better cars \nSpeaking at the line-off ceremony today at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey’s Sakarya factory, Dr Johan van Zyl, President and CEO Toyota Motor Europe, said: “The Toyota C-HR is a hugely important product for the whole of Toyota. The crossover segment is growing fast and this is our very strong entry into the segment.” \nC-HR is unique in its part of the market by offering customers the choice of a smooth and efficient hybrid powertrain and it joins the British-built Auris and the French manufactured Yaris as Toyota’s third European-manufactured hybrid vehicle. The importance of this was emphasised by Moritaka Yoshida, President of Toyota Motor Corporation’s mid-size vehicle company: “Hybrid defines Toyota. Since the first Prius in 1997 we have steadily convinced more and more customers around the world that hybrid vehicles are one of the best solutions to today’s environmental issues. We have now sold more than 9.5 million hybrids globally,” he said. \nThe introduction of C-HR will increase annual production capacity at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey to 280,000 vehicles, including the established Corolla and Verso models built there. Toyota has invested around €350 million (approx. £312.5 million) in the plant for the new model, taking total investment in TMMT to €1.7 billion (approx. £1.5 billion) since the start of operations in 1994. The workforce has been increased by an additional 2,000 people to accommodate C-HR. \nC-HR is available to order in the UK now, with first deliveries to customers from January. \nExport expansion \nDr van Zyl announced that TMMT will develop export markets for C-HR in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, South Africa and Mauritius. \nHe said: “It is a great privilege for us to export to North America, because it’s Toyota’s biggest market and our customers there expect a lot from Toyota in terms of quality, customer satisfaction and connection to the brand. TMMT has been one of our best plants globally when it comes to build quality and I am very confident our members there will exceed our North American customers’ expectations.” \nEuropean collaboration and increased local production \nThe Toyota C-HR is the fruit of collaboration between several European Toyota production sites and supplier businesses. \nIn addition to 1.8-litre hybrid engines from TMUK in Deeside (see above), C-HR is using manual transmissions from Toyota Motor Manufacturing Poland, featured in the 1.2T turbocharged petrol version. TMMP will also start production of a hybrid transaxle for C-HR from 2018; currently this component is manufactured in Japan. \nEuropean suppliers account for most of the individual parts sourced to make C-HR: of the 135 total, 134 of these businesses are based in Europe. With the addition of C-HR to its line-up of vehicles produced in Europe, the ratio of locally produced Toyotas sold in Europe will surpass 75 per cent on a full production year basis.

      "text": "Eighteen years ago Didier Leroy left his job as deputy plant director at Renault's Le Mans facility to join Toyota to help the Japanese automaker launch its greenfield plant in Valenciennes, France. Since then, the French engineer has become one of Toyota's most powerful executives. Although he has a global job now, Leroy still plays a major role in the company's European operations. He recently shared his bullish outlook for Toyota's European sales with A utomotive News Europe Editor Luca Ciferri.\nWill Toyota's sales rise in Europe? \nWe expect to sell more than 900,000 units this year in our Europe region [including Turkey and Russia], up from 875,000 in 2015. I have no doubt that next year our sales will be even higher, largely because of the C-HR [compact crossover], which I'm sure will be a success.\nIs pricing getting more disciplined? \nWe still see a lot of competitors that are trying to push cars in various markets using less profitable sales channels.\nNissan outsold Toyota brand last year in the EU, according to ACEA data. \nBut Toyota was more profitable last year. So far this year we have been outselling them while remaining profitable.\nWhat is your outlook for Europe sales? \nThe Western European car market is on track to grow 3 percent to 5 percent this year and is not expected to decrease in 2017. But Eastern Europe is decreasing, particularly Russia, which was down 36 percent last year and 14 percent so far this year. The future of the Eastern European car market will mainly be linked to what happens with the oil price.\nHow will Toyota react? \nWe have to demonstrate our speed and flexibility to take advantage of any single opportunity that could arise while preventing ourselves from expecting to benefit from any tailwinds from the markets.\nDoes diesel have a future in Europe? \nThe importance of diesel is decreasing, but there is still demand. Toyota’s diesel sales in Europe are now below 20 percent [of total sales], down from 30 percent in the past. We are sure that over time we will see more and more hybrids.\nIs this why you stopped development of a new 1.5-liter diesel. \nNot exactly. We buy 1.6- and 2.0-liter diesels from BMW and we build a 1.4-liter diesel in-house. We are developing an additional new diesel, but its application for Europe in the C-HR was put on stand-by. We did not stop its development.\nWhy no diesel on the C-HR? \nMore than two-thirds of pre-orders from our national sales companies and private distributors were for the hybrid. Therefore, we are launching it with gasoline and gasoline-electric powertrains. Let’s see what the customers decide, but right now we do not see the need for a diesel C-HR.\nWhen will crossovers outsell hatchbacks, sedans and wagons in Europe? \nThe growth of B- and C-segment SUVs and crossovers is strong, but in absolute terms they are still relatively small. They, potentially, could become the largest segment in western Europe, but not in Central Europe, where customers like SUVs but sedans still rule.\nWhy doesn't Toyota offer a pure EV? \nOur view is that a hydrogen-based society is much more promising than a battery-based society. No one knows what the right source of electricity is, fuel cell or battery. In addition, we do not need to rush into EVs like some of our competitors, which have the immediate need to drastically reduce their average fleet CO2 emissions. Our fleet average is one of the best in the world, mainly because of our hybrids. We have more than 9 million Toyota and Lexus hybrids on the road and we have already sold 75,000 plug-in hybrids globally.",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nTOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. is looking at mass-producing long-range electric vehicles that would hit the market around 2020, the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday, in what would be a dramatic reversal of strategy for the automaker. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co., Volkswagen Group and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota has said it would reserve EVs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nBy adding longer-range EVs to its product range, Toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \nThe Nikkei , without citing sources, said Toyota would set up a team in early 2017 dedicated to developing electric cars that can travel more than 300km (186 miles) on a single charge. \nThe paper added that Toyota aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020 in Japan as well as other markets such as California, and China, which is promoting a switch to EVs. \nToyota neither confirmed nor denied the report, saying it does not comment on product development plans. In an emailed response, it said it continued to develop various fuel-efficient technologies, including EVs, with the best application for each in mind. \nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050. \nIndustry experts said emissions regulations in California, widely considered a benchmark in global vehicle emissions standards, and China's push to increase electric car usage could be behind a possible change of heart at Toyota. \n\"Toyota has been a major hold-out on EVs, but it appears that it now realizes that without them it may be difficult to satisfy tightening regulations,\" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. \n\"Not [including EVs as an option] would run the risk that it could face sales restrictions in some areas.\" \nFrom 2018, California and a growing number of U.S. states will require automakers to produce a much larger number of zero-emissions vehicles as a proportion of total sales. \nToyota has promoted FCVs such as its Mirai sedan as the most sensible next-generation option to hybrids, a category it dominates with the Prius, since they have a similar driving range and refueling time to conventional cars. But the lack of hydrogen fueling stations poses a major hurdle for mass consumption. \nToyota will launch an all-new plug-in hybrid version of the Prius in the coming months. Engineers have told Reuters that in developing a safe and powerful lithium-ion battery for the model, Toyota would be able to produce batteries for EVs in future. Contact Automotive News Tags: ",

      "text": "Featured Vehicle: Overland Nomad’s Toyota Pickup \nSometimes the truck of your dreams is the one right in front of you by Chris Cordes Photography by David Alejandro Gonzalez   10th, 2016 \nI feel that there are two types of truly cool four-wheel drives. The first type encompasses all the dream vehicles, Earth Roamers, Unimogs, brand new Defenders, and portal axle G-Wagens. The sort of things we all secretly long for, but realistically could never afford. The second category, which happens to be my favorite, are the down to earth, well used, real world four wheel drives that simply get the job done. Each one is packed with character, and whether from international adventures or just many fun weekends on the trail, their dents, scratches, and unique modifications form stories which capture my imagination like no brand new car ever could. \nAnd that’s where David’s 1994 Toyota Pickup comes in. After repeatedly seeing his truck on Instagram, I reached out to learn more about the cool little camper, and it did not disappoint. With a history spanning back to his early school days, this truck has been a nearly life long passion for David, and it is now as much a part of his family as any vehicle could be. The following excerpts are written by David Gonzalez \nIt’s hard to know where to start. This pickup and I have so much history. From high school, to driving my, then, wife, to having all my friends in the back on the Island, and even now having my son ride with me. \nThis 1994 Toyota Pickup, equipped with a V6 3.0 and 4 wheel drive, was owned by one of my father’s co-workers. They worked at a school, so when she would get picked up by her husband, she would hop in this bone stock pickup and drive right by me. I was in 6 th grade at the time, and I can still remember just how it looked, so clean. \nSenior year in high school she was still working at my dad’s school and I would beg her to sell me the Pickup. I had always wanted a 90’s Toyota 4X4, and this one was the one . Her husband would of course say, “No way, this truck is not going anywhere. Believe me I have gotten many offers for it.” But I didn’t care, I would still bother him. In fact I bothered him for 5 whole months, and by that time his wife had convinced him. With the money I had saved up plus a bit of help from my dad, I bought it, and the rest is history. \nThe Toyota went from being bone stock to getting a full “restoration”. We did everything ourselves, spending countless hours at my buddy’s one garage shop. From the front bumper to the paint job, it was all done there. We took the V6 3.0 3VZE out and rebuilt it, replaced all the hoses, installed a lift, and even added 35″ BFG Mud Terrains. Next we found a $70 LEER camper shell, which we restored with new windows and paint. In the end the truck was torn apart in the shop for a full year, but the final result was just the way I had imagined it. Well how my 19 year old self had imagined it. \nAs the years went by my views on the Pickup changed. I had embraced so much of nature and camping again that I started thinking of different ways to improve its useability. I soon became thrilled with North American expeditions and adventure travels, and eventually discovered Overlanding. That’s when I realized where I wanted to go with the Pickup project, and the path became clear. \nI soon started doing more Texas explorations on back roads, and tied in some more moderate four wheeling. I took the front and rear axles and re-geared them to G2 5.29’s for the correct performance out of the beefy 35’s, before turning my attention to camping systems. \nI had been searching for a different camper shell for some time, as I wanted more room for sleeping in the bed. I soon came across the Wildernest Adventure Camper on Instagram, and knew it would be perfect for the Pickup. I was able to contact someone online that was selling one, and I pulled the trigger and drove to Tulsa, Oklahoma in my Xterra, a 1400 mile round trip with only one stop at a Whataburger parking lot to take a quick nap. It was definitely a smart acquisition though, and it fulfilled what I was looking for in terms of camping and future travels. \nWhen arriving to setup camp, it takes about 5 minutes to deploy the Wildernest by myself, and 8 minutes to put it away. I have a roof top tent on my Xterra, and I can tell you that the Wildernest is much easier to handle and more fun to use. \nI keep most things in a Plano Storage box and in my back seat. Just the essentials like a two burner propane stove, water container, Yeti Roadie, and pots and pans. Mattress, pillow, and sleeping bag are kept away within the Wildernest. Just open up the Wildernest and the sleeping gear is all set. \nSo far this Toyota Pickup has been very dependable and performed well throughout my travels, but it’s not quite done. I hope to turn this rig into a homemade expedition vehicle, one that can handle some heavy weather and terrain. Nothing fancy, but definitely trust-worthy. At the end of the day I’d say this Pickup has some character, and it shows in the expressions of everyone who sees it. This is just the beginning of my travels with my Pickup, and we have many more miles ahead. The Spec’s 1994 Toyota Pickup / Hilux DLX 3.0 V6 3VZE",

      "text": "Craig Trudell, Elisabeth Behrmann and Keith NaughtonBloomberg Ford was a favorite target of Donald Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border throughout his campaign. Toyota and Volkswagen, as well as other U.S. carmakers, are just as exposed. Toyota and Nissan, Japan's largest automakers, were spared from Trump's critique by name on the campaign trail. Yet they, along with General Motors and VW, all rely on Mexican plants for millions of vehicles and a high volume of parts. That puts them at risk if the president-elect makes good on his threat to levy hefty taxes on cars assembled across the Rio Grande. \"Trump could, or will, try to set up trade barriers,\" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. \"Automakers with U.S. factories will therefore be on the winning side. Mexico, the new El Dorado of the auto industry, could suffer.\" Since 2010, nine global automakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments. VW's Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the low-cost country, which Trump says has benefited at the expense of the American voters who propelled him to victory. Output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Republican candidate and real-estate developer grabbed headlines during his campaign by threatening to slap a 35 percent tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He called Ford's plans for a new plant in Mexico \"an absolute disgrace.\" A levy would lead to higher prices and hurt demand, said Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Trump would \"start a worldwide trade war\" if he decides to end trade pacts and uses anti-dumping provisions to impose widespread tariffs on other countries, said Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, requires only six months' notice of termination to Canada and Mexico and doesn't specify that the president would need congressional approval, he said. \"These other countries would retaliate. Prices consumers would pay would increase sharply. The Federal Reserve would then increase interest rates. It would be ugly,\" Grimes said. Despite that threat, U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union extended an olive branch to the president-elect. \"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country -- and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford said in a statement. The company's plan to shift small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico was attacked by Trump during his first answer of the initial debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in September. GM and Fiat Chrysler said in separate statements they would work with Trump and the new Congress on policies that support manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's obvious there is work to be done,\" UAW President Dennis Williams, whose union endorsed Clinton, said in a statement. German executives attending an industry conference in Munich on Wednesday also expressed concerns about Trump's views. BMW is building a new car plant in Mexico's San Luis Potosi that's due to start production in 2019, while Audi started assembling autos in San Jose Chiapa in September. \"We need open trade,\" said BMW CEO Harald Krueger. The luxury automaker ships many of the SUVs assembled at its South Carolina factory to markets around the world and in turn exports sedans and Mini cars to the U.S. from Europe. \"We live off exports and imports. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.\" Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche and James Verrier, who heads supplier BorgWarner Inc., are among executives who held out hope that much of Trump's trade talk was campaign rhetoric and would soften with the practicalities needed to govern. \"Many things get said during the heat of an election campaign,\" Zetsche said. \"I hope and believe this is also the case here.\" For Bob Lutz, the retired vice chairman of GM, Trump's victory could ultimately help the auto industry if his advisers and Congress keep him from pushing his protectionist agenda too far. \"He's not a dictator,\" Lutz said in an interview. \"No one can go in and abrogate trade deals. There are some aspects of NAFTA that will probably be re-negotiated, but he will probably be talked out of his crazier ideas.\" Rather than threaten Japan auto imports with tariffs, Trump has pointed to wealth generated from the cars being sold in the U.S. to bolster his argument for America to pay a smaller share of the costs related to stationing troops in its biggest Asian ally's territory. \"Japan is ripping us off with the cars,\" Trump said at an Oct. 12 campaign event in Florida. In remarks to Ohio volunteers in July, he spoke of \"massive ships\" delivering vehicles to the U.S. from Japan, which he told Americans was \"rich because of us.\" Representatives for Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co. declined to comment. Japan's automakers have combined capacity to build about 1.36 million vehicles annually in Mexico and have announced plans for new plants capable of assembling another 430,000 vehicles a year. Models built or planned for Mexican production and sale in the U.S. include the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Versa and Sentra, and the Honda Fit and HR-V. \"If NAFTA is going to be up for discussion somewhere down the line, that would affect Japanese companies very much, especially auto-related investments in Mexico,\" said Bob Takai, president and CEO of Sumitomo Global Research Co. \"If the trading and investing is going to be very difficult because of the new presidency, we may go somewhere else.\"",
