      "text": "\nPaint 3D is the flagship app of Microsoft’s Creators Update coming early next year, and can already be installed by Windows 10 Users running Insider Builds.\nIf you however want to try it out without putting your PC at risk of turning into a buggy mess you are generally out of luck however.\nThe app can however be sideloaded on Redstone One PCs and Italian site Aggiornamentilumia.it has done the hard work to make it a relatively easy process.\nFirst you need to place your PC in Developer Mode ( under Settings > Update and Security > for Developers )\n\nYou may need to reboot, but for me this was not necessary.\nNext you need to download the ZIP file with the package. Aggiornamentilumia has made both a 32bit and 64bit version available. Download the 32bit version here and the 64bit version here . The ZIP file is password protected and the password is AggiornamentiLumiaPaint3DRedstone1 ?? .\nExtract the package to a convenient location, navigate there in File Explorer, and then go to the File menu of the File Explorer window and choose Open Windows PowerShell as Admin .\n\nOnce Powershell has opened as below, paste add-appxpackage -register appxmanifest.xml and hit enter.\n\nThe app should now be installed as below, but you may need to search for it using your start menu search.\n\nUsers should note that while this is currently the latest version of the app it will not be automatically updated, and may have bugs due to not running in the ideal environment. Users should therefore only expect a taste of what’s to come rather than judge the features and utility of the application from the sideloaded version.\nHave any of our readers given it a try? Let us know below.",

      "text": "Click on the Download button on the template page. Microsoft Excel should open with the time sheet template loaded into the program. Save the template to your computer. Before the download begins Microsoft's web site may check to ensure that your computer is running a licensed copy of Microsoft Excel. Biweekly Time Sheet Template Features \nKeep these points in mind when using the biweekly time sheet template: Do Not write in column L, row 28, or row 30, on the template. The Total column (column L), the Total hours row (row 28), and the Total pay row (row 30) all contain formulas that calculate the number of hours worked per day, the number of hours worked per week, and the total pay owed to the employee. \ncontinue reading below our video Templates in Microsoft Excel Similarly, do not write in column D or cell K7. There are formulas in these locations that add in the dates for the two week period of the time sheet. To add the dates mentioned above, enter the starting date for the two week period in cell K6. The rest of the dates will be added automatically. The time sheet is designed so that all details of the time sheet, such as company name, employee name, manager's name as well as the hours worked and rate of pay can be typed in beside the appropriate heading before the sheet is printed. If you have information that does not change from pay period to pay period - such as the company name - you can save time by entering all the unchanging information and then saving the time sheet as a separate template using Excel's own template creating feature . \nBack to the Excel Templates page \nRelated Articles",

      "text": "In some corners of the Internet, the Zune still lives.\nMicrosoft’s defunct line of music players was launched 10 years ago this week with promotional concerts around the country, a marketing blitz, and promises that this was only the first step in a growing line of entertainment-focused Microsoft devices and software.\n“It’s just the beginning of this vision,” co-founder Bill Gates told revelers at Seattle’s Westlake Park.\nThe vision didn’t pan out. The Zune was no iPod killer, despite hardware that impressed reviewers. Its timing was not impeccable, just seven months before the iPhone kicked off the modern smartphone era and rendered standalone MP3 players obsolete.\nMicrosoft pulled the plug on Zune hardware in 2011, and support for the software was turned off last year. The foray into MP3 players is widely viewed as one of Microsoft’s most prominent blunders during a decade spent chasing Apple’s success in consumer hardware.\nBut five years after the last Zune rolled off the assembly line, some fans still carry the torch for the device.\nEvidence of that lives on Reddit, the online message board community for groups uniting around virtually any niche interest. Look there and you’ll find the home of a small but enthusiastic crew of Zune aficionados.\nGadget fans are a tribal set, prone to clustering around communities that use a certain app, or products built by Apple or Google or Microsoft. The louder among them take to social media to defend their selection as if choice of gadget or software is part of a grand competition.\nMuch of the activity on the Zune appreciation site is related to troubleshooting technical issues. Others swap success stories of hunting for deals on secondhand Zunes (“Got a 30GB for $20!”). One superfan touted his collection of more than 60 Zunes.\nThere are more personal tales, too, including one user’s lament posted last month.\n“A piece of me is gone,” the user wrote of his Zune, which, at the age of seven, will no longer power on. “He lived as he played, loud and with clarity. Rest in peace.”\nAnother user, working on some unspecified research, asked the community if the Zune was still an active brand.\n“The Zune brand is no more,” someone replied.\nSome might beg to differ, Zune fan.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Can Detect Lung Cancer Earlier by Looking at User Search Data GO Microsoft Research claims cancer diagnosis can be done 1 year earlier just by analyzing user search queries Nov 14, 2016 08:26 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft Research has found a new way to detect lung cancer earlier by simply analyzing user search queries and keeping an eye on specific keywords that could indicate signs of disease. A research paper that was published in JAMA Oncology reveals that Microsoft has found a connection between the searches that users perform online and the diagnosis that is performed way later (which in many cases, unfortunately, is too late ). Specifically, Microsoft analyzed Bing searches for queries such as “I was just diagnosed with lung cancer,” and then started an analysis of searches performed by the same user in the months and years before this. Scientists looked at the search history for queries that could be related to the disease, including symptoms, but also demographics. For example, Microsoft was particularly interested in detecting searches for common lung cancer symptoms, including bronchitis and chest pain, but also for factors that could cause the disease, like smoking or exposure to radon gas. Using demographic data, Microsoft was able to create a connection between searches, location, and possible symptoms of lung cancer, explaining that in the end, this complex algorithm could help give a warning no less than one year earlier before the typical time when cancer is detected. 39 percent success rate According to Microsoft itself, the success rate is currently at 39 percent, and even though this means that more than half of users could get a false alarm, it’s particularly critical for those who might be suffering from lung cancer to actually go to a medic. This is actually the purpose of the tech after all, as even though there might be false positives, there’s nothing wrong in going to a doctor to make sure you’re healthy. But in the case of those who are indeed suffering from lung cancer, getting a warning one year earlier could be live-saving. For the moment, Microsoft is still looking into ways to improve the success rate of this tech and is also considering some ways of making it easier to use. An application that would monitor searches with users’ consent is also on the table, as this could be a very simple way to always stay alerted of symptoms that could warn of diseases such as cancer.",

      "text": "New Razer Blade Available From Microsoft Store 9:48 am By Conner Flynn \nRazer’s new notebook is now available to purchase from the Microsoft Store. The company launched the updated version of the Blade notebook a few weeks ago. \nThey have been selling it directly to customers since then, but if you want to pick one up via Microsoft’s online store, now you can. Now on to the info you want to hear about. Microsoft’s online store is offering the Razer Blade notebook in two different configurations. The updated Razer Blade notebook is powered by the latest Core i7-6700HQ processor from Intel coupled with 16GB of RAM. There’s a full HD 14 inch display and an NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics processor which makes this notebook ready for virtual reality. The Razer Blade is of course powered by Windows 10, which is no surprise. \nThe entire package measures 0.7 inches thick and comes in at just 4 pounds. You won’t find any major changes to the design of the notebook though, all of the upgrades are inside. Microsoft’s online store is selling the new Razer Blade with 512GB SSD for $1,999 and with a 1TB solid-state drive for $2,399. The 512GB configuration is already listed as out of stock so we don’t really know how long it’s going to take for this particular model to be back in stock. I guess we will find out soon enough.",

      "title": "Microsoft reveals its biggest wind energy purchase to date: 237 megawatts to power its Wyoming data center",
      "text": "Microsoft has announced it has signed new wind farm contracts that commit the company to buying 237 megawatts of wind energy, enough to power its zero-carbon data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\nThe company says it has contracted to purchase wind from a 178 megawatt Bloom Wind farm in Kansas, and 59 megawatts from the Silver Sage and Happy Jack farms in Wyoming. This is in addition to its existing 75-megawatt wind farm agreement in Illinois and 110-megawatt contract in Texas, meaning this latest news takes the company past the 500 megawatt mark.\nFor the Silver Sage and Happy Jack farms in Wyoming, Microsoft is partnering with Black Hills Energy, and Microsoft has revealed that its data center’s backup generators will be offered for use as a “secondary resource” for the entire grid, meaning that during times of high demand, Microsoft will actually be providing electricity to the local community. The company says that it approached Black Hills Energy with this offer when it discovered that Black Hills Energy was considering building a new energy plant in Cheyenne, and the two subsequently teamed up to offer a new tariff and avoid having to build the plant.\n“This is a small step toward a future where other customer-sited resources may help make the grid more efficient, reliable and capable of integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar,” explained Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. “Unlike traditional backup generators that run on diesel fuel, these natural gas turbines offer a more efficient solution and, more importantly, ensure the utility avoids building a new power plant.”\nMicrosoft opened its Wyoming data center, which it calls a “data plant,” in November 2014 , and is powered by a fuel cell that converts biogas into electricity. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a public commitment to increase its reliance on renewable energies from 44 percent today to 50 percent by 2018 and 60 percent by “early in the next decade.” It’s not the only technology company that’s investing green energy though — a few months back Amazon announced its biggest renewable energy project to date in the form of a 253-megawatt Texas wind farm, which is scheduled to open in 2017.\nElsewhere, Facebook is in the process of building a new data center in Ireland that will be powered entirely by wind, Apple is investing in solar farms , while Google is following a similar path .\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "  \nWhile Microsoft already has revealed some details about what Xbox and Surface sales their retail store will offer up this holiday season, the company is also now highlighting how Santa Claus uses the Microsoft Cloud to meet the high demand for gifting this holiday season. The Santa Cloud \nThe post highlighting the demand was written by Joe Davies, a Senior Content Developer at Azure Documentation. Overall, it looks at how Santa’s annual Christmas process requires massive amounts of computing and storage resources. As seen in the graphic above, the post also puts Santa in the shoes of a CEO, and highlights several steps of the process where the Microsoft Cloud helps Santa in his decisions: Collect and analyze current and historical data and requests for presents from multiple sources (Azure Data Lake, SQL Data Warehouse, and Stream Analytics) Work with vendors and partners during various parts of the manufacturing process Perform the final determination of just who is naughty and who is nice (SQL Data Warehouse and Machine Learning) \nTo learn more about the power of the Microsoft Cloud, and as to why you should use Azure and Azure Solutions, be sure to head over to this official Microsoft website , and download Santa’s Azure infographic . As always, let us know what you think of the power of Microsoft Azure by dropping us a comment in the section below! In this story stream:",

      "title": "Some Zune fans still holding on, 10 years after Microsoft’s failed music player was born",
      "text": "  \nIn the last 16 years, Microsoft made some bold moves to enter new markets that met various degrees of success, to say the least. As a reminder, the company’s mobile efforts started in the early 2000’s with the Pocket PC 2000 OS, while the “Windows Mobile” brand only made its appearance in 2003. Then in 2001, Microsoft entered the gaming console market with the original Xbox, which will celebrate its 15 birthday tomorrow along with the Xbox exclusive Halo franchise . \nTen years ago, the company also entered the portable media player market with its Zune brand, which was discontinued in 2012 after the products were unable to compete with Apple’s iPods and iTunes ecosystem and the global rise of smartphones as digital hubs. However, while Microsoft released its last Zune hardware back in 2010 with the Zune HD 64, there is still a small passionate community of Zune fans who are still using the devices as of today, according to a new report from The Seattle Times . \nThe newspaper took an interesting look at the Zune subreddit , discovering “a small but enthusiastic crew of Zune aficionados” who collect, repair and share tips about how to troubleshoot technical issues with the now-unsupported devices. A lot of them still praise the music players, which were the first consumer devices from Microsoft to feature the “Metro” design language which went to become later one of Windows Phone’s key features. \nWhile some consumers may still find some value in dedicated music players, this product category may well have become a niche market in 2016 as even Apple’s iPods no longer have a dedicated landing page on the company’s website. \nAs for the Zune brand, Microsoft replaced it with the Xbox Music brand back in 2012 before introducing the Groove Music service last year. But while Groove Music is a ubiquitous service and one of the best-designed apps on Windows 10 devices today, it’s not clear yet if the service and the brand will ever get as much devotion and loyalty from consumers compared to the Zune or Xbox brands.

      "title": "Atlassian: Is Microsoft About To Kill HipChat?",
      "text": "Microsoft has launched Microsoft Teams which has been labeled as a Slack killer. \nWe fear that Atlassian and HipChat may get caught in the crossfire. \nThis could result in Atlassian needing to ditch its word of mouth marketing model for a more traditional model. \nThe increase in sales and marketing could ruin margins and slow growth. Click to enlarge Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM ) is a software-as-a-service company with a difference. Not only is it a company that lets its product and its users do the talking, but this recipe has been a proven success. Sales have been growing at an incredible rate. In fact, the recent first quarter result saw the company report sales growth of 34.4% year on year. All without traditional marketing and instead reliant on word of mouth. Click to enlarge Sourced from Atlassian's Q1 presentation. As you can see above the number of customers has risen quarter on quarter for at least the last ten quarters. Impressively the recent first quarter saw the largest single increase in customer numbers during that time, despite using a word of mouth approach. This unorthodox approach really caught our eye and we loved what we were seeing. So much so we invested in the company at the start of May. Since then the stock has rallied higher by over 15 percent. Although we feel the stock could still climb higher in the quarters ahead, we have decided to close our position in the company following the decision of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to take on Atlassian and its rival Slack (Private: SLACK ). Microsoft Teams is a new collaborative communication addition to the hugely popular Office 365 suite that looks set to heat things up in the industry, potentially bringing an end to the dominance enjoyed by both Slack and Atlassian's HipChat. Although it has a number of products, we saw HipChat as a major driver of growth for Atlassian over the next few years. The Uber (Private: UBER ) contract win was the icing on the cake for us. We felt the fact that Uber moved its thousands of users across from Slack was a real testament to the quality of the product. But if this growth is now challenged by Microsoft, which we expect it will be, then this could create a number of problems for the company and its stock. There certainly is a lot of growth priced in at the moment, and failure to deliver on this could see a severe rerating. Perhaps we are panicking over nothing and the word of mouth model will continue to succeed. After all a new entrant to the market is nothing new. But perhaps we have to view things differently when that entrant is revitalized tech giant Microsoft. Although we believe its eyes were firmly on Slack when it made this move, we expect Atlassian to be caught in the crossfire. Our biggest fear is that the increased competition from Microsoft may result in the need for Atlassian to start to ditch its successful word of mouth advertising for more traditional marketing in order to hold its market share. If it were to do this then margins are going to be negatively impacted a great deal, resulting in lower levels of profitability. Which is certainly not something you want to see with its stock trading on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 114. Click to enlarge Sourced from Atlassian Q1 10Q Unfortunately, Atlassian does not breakdown its revenue any further than the table shown above. Because of this we cannot see how reliant the company is on HipChat, but we feel it is reasonable to assume that it is the biggest driver of subscription growth. So if the company does resort to a more traditional marketing approach, we would expect to see its sales and marketing expense rise beyond 25% of revenue and perhaps even higher, slowing its earnings growth drastically. As you can see above, industry peers currently operate with far larger budgets than Atlassian. Whilst in the long-term the move to traditional marketing might in fact benefit Atlassian and result in stronger sales growth. The lower levels of profitability in the short-term will undoubtedly be a real turn off for many investors and have analysts scrambling to adjust their discounted cash flow models. If this happens and the stock plunges, we would very happily revisit the company when it is priced at a more conservative multiple. But for now we wish the company well and are going to watch this battle play out from outside. As always, thanks for reading and best of luck with your investments!

      "text": "Microsoft today announced a new feature on Skype that will make it easier than ever for you to connect with anyone on Skype, without even creating an account or downloading the Skype client. By joining Skype as a Guest, users can quickly chat, voice or video call without any hassle.\nHow to use this feature?\nTo get started, go to Skype.com , tap start a conversation and add your name. You will then be provided with a unique conversation link. You can share this link with your contacts — either individually or as a group — via email or via your social networks. Once they click on the link, they’ll be able to join your conversation immediately. They can also join as a Guest if they’re using Skype for Web. Skype for web supports many features including the one to one and group instant messaging, voice and video calls, screen sharing and even file sharing. Microsoft highlighted that you can invite up to 300 people to chat and up to 25 people on a voice or video call, all for free.\nThe conversations you have using Skype as a Guest will last for 24 hours. Go to Skype.com to give it a try.",

      "text": "If you've had your eye on an Xbox One, Black Friday weekend will be the time to get one. Microsoft has unveiled its suite of Black Friday 2016 deals, which include $50 off any Xbox One, as well has a host of discounts on games and accessories. \nPhoto: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide \nFor starters, you can get the 500GB Xbox One S for $249 — that's $50 off — from Nov. 24 to 28 both in-stores and online. That deal applies the various Xbox One S bundles out there, meaning you can get games like Battlefield 1, Gears of War 4, Minecraft and FIFA 17 right out of the box. If you want to beat the shopping rush or prefer more storage, you can get $50 off any 1TB Xbox One S (normally $349) or Xbox One (normally $299) from Nov. 20 to 23.\nMORE: PlayStation 4 Pro vs. Xbox One S: Which 4K Console Is For You? \nNaturally, you'll probably want to play some games on your shiny new Xbox, and Microsoft is slashing prices on a bunch of them for Black Friday weekend. You can get Gears of War 4 for $35 (which comes bundled with all previous Gears of War games) and ReCore for $20, to name a few of the deals. \nOther specials for the weekend of Nov. 24 to 28 include $10 off a 3-month or 6-month Xbox Live Gold membership, $10 off an Xbox Stereo Headset and $10 off an Xbox Wireless Controller. If you want to customize your own controller via Xbox Design Lab, you'll get free custom engraving (which usually costs $10). \nIf you can't bare the thought of going to physical stores this holiday season, Microsoft has you covered. The company will host its usual Black Friday Xbox Live sale, which starts on Nov. 18 for Xbox Live Gold members and extends to everyone from Nov. 22 to 28. Microsoft hasn't unveiled every single digital deal yet, but it teased Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3 and ReCore as some games that will get discounts. You can also look forward to sales on movies and Windows 10 games such as Quantum Break, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Batman: The Telltale Series. \nAs usual, Black Friday is looking strong for gamers, particularly if you haven't picked up a new console yet. We'll be hand-picking the best holiday tech deals all Black Friday weekend long, so be sure to bookmark Tom's Guide and visit often while you shop.\nSee Also : Best Gifts for Gamers \nOur Favorite Xbox One Games Best Xbox One Accessories Top Gaming Headsets for PC and Console\nAbout the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "Microsoft Black Friday Preview Posted! November 14, 2016 We just posted the 4-page Microsoft Store Black Friday Sneak Peek ad scan ! The majority of Microsoft's Black Friday deals won't go live until 12AM EST on Thanksgiving, but they have released a sneak peek of some of their planned deals. We have a hunch that this isn't the full Microsoft Black Friday ad, and we'll be sure to keep you updated when more deals are released. One standout is the offer for $50 off select Xbox consoles plus a free gift code and game . Prices start at $249.99 so depending on the selection available this could be one of the best Xbox deals of the year. That offer starts on November 24th. Another highlight is the offer for a free $100 gift code with the purchase of an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift . These items are smokin' hot and very on trend so they haven't gone on sale much -- this deal is the best we have seen yet for them. Thank You for Visiting and Tell Your Friends!",

      "text": "Four-time Emmy® winner will be honored at The Novo by Microsoft at L.A. Live on Feb. 19, 2017 Last Updated: November 10, 2016 3:04 pm GMT (Los Angeles, CA--November 10, 2016) Ryan Murphy , four-time Emmy® Award-winning producer, director and screenwriter, will receive this year’s Distinguished Artisan Award at the Annual Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards (MUAHS, IATSE Local 706) honoring both make-up artists and hair stylists outstanding achievements in motion pictures, television, commercials and live theater. The black-tie gala will be held on Sunday, February 19, 2017, at The Novo by Microsoft at L.A. Live. The announcement was made today by Susan Cabral-Ebert, President of IATSE Local 706. Ryan Murphy “We’re excited to bestow our 2017 Distinguished Artisan Award on Ryan Murphy, who constantly raises the bar and challenges the skills of our members to their utmost abilities when delineating his television characters. He has always shown strong support while working in collaboration with our make-up artists and hair stylists,” said Cabral-Ebert.

He has won four Primetime Emmys, 11 additional award wins and 45 nominations and is the originator of the popular American television programs American Horror Story, Glee, Nip/Tuck and The New Normal.

His first program, Popular , a teenager comedy-drama for the WB Network ran for three seasons in 1999. More success came in 2003 with the debut of FX’s Nip/Tuck , which tells the tale of two plastic surgeons living and working in Miami, Florida. In 2009, Murphy debuted Glee about a high school glee club, which was inspired by his days in high school choir. In 2011 Murphy served as executive producer on American Horror Story with Jessica Lange and Dylan McDermott and guest stars Lady Gaga and Kathy Bates. In 2012, NBC announced plans to air Murphy’s newest series, The New Normal . In 2014 HBO film The Normal Heart debuted, chronicling the story of the onset of the AIDS crisis in New York, which won an Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie. Additional credits include American Crime Story, Feud, Scream Queens, Eat Pray Love and The Glee Project among many others. MUAHS Lifetime Achievement Awards recipients will be announced shortly.

      "text": "Reviewed by scamperor 1. Introduction For some time, all-in-one (AIO) water cooling kits have been in the market offering users fuss-free water cooling for their processors, and more recently, graphic cards as well.... New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: What is the alternative to Microsoft's Media Feature Pack? Select All Posts By This User Hey there, I'll try and keep this as short as possible. I'm a privacy nut that has just upgraded to Windows 10 (I know right). Luckily I've learned how to secure the OS and as a direct result and annoyance with Windows Update always reverting my privacy settings, I have completely deleted the Update Service(among other services, *cough* telemetry *cough*) from Windows. This has just happened on a fresh install. It is only after I finished my security business, that I noticed Facebook videos aren't working. Turns out I need Microsoft's Media Feature Pack to play videos on Facebook, which I can only install through the Update Service which I just deleted . To add some context to this, I'm using an N version of the OS. That is, there's no Windows Media player installed and a few other things that I never use anyways. All this said, I find it highly unlikely that Facebook specifically requires the Microsoft Media Feature Pack (a.k.a. codecs really). Surely it doesn't request this pack on a mac or on Linux. With THAT said, I'm sure there's gotta be an alternative but I can't for the life of me find it! Any help figuring this out would be highly appreciated, I really don't want to reinstall again, I had to go through A LOT of setup! Thanks in advance for any help",

      "text": "HoloLens \nPlus, any other devices that Microsoft decides to roll out on to from now on. \nIt pretty much sounds like a multi-platform dream, and it certainly is. But how does UWP handle all the different variations on its platform? Each device is different and has its own unique characteristics. The answer in this case is “Extensions”: \nAs you might expect, Windows 10 has a single “core” which runs on all devices, in exactly the same way. Then for those little extra’s, the UWP platform provides an “Extension” component that is specific to each platform. However, these extensions are also expressed on all the other platforms, so your code doesn’t break and you write the same code as if you were writing for them all. Where a device doesn’t support a certain feature (say the Holographic API on an Xbox), then the code simply does nothing, it doesn’t error, it doesn’t crash, your code still works but nothing actually happens. For those platforms with that feature, lights start shining, the bells ring and the choir sings out with joyful praise. \nAlso as part of this “Extension” framework, Microsoft gives you the ability to test if a feature is available or not, allowing you to write different code depending on whether the feature is active, like if you want to use a devices accelerometer if it has one, or use a virtual joystick on a desktop with a touch screen, or fall back to keyboard if hat isn’t available. Sure, there is a bit of thought to go in to building for “Any” device but that is the trade-off for building one solution. But what about the Games? \nWhen we start looking at building games under UWP, there is a lot of support (that is constantly growing) from third parties. As you can see most of the major engines and frameworks already support the Universal platform out of the box, making it even easier to publish your game as a UWP app. \nStill not see any engine or feature you like, then there is always the ultimate fallback: \nUnder the hood, UWP Games are just a DirectX surface and you can write games using native DirectX in either C# or C++, there are even Visual Studio Templates “out of the box” for UWP as well. Getting started with UWP on Xbox \nNow that UWP apps can be deployed / tested and run by anyone with a Retail Xbox, we can go wild and try out our own games to see how they run on the big screen. Once you lick all the bugs and get it just right, you can publish that game “as is” to the Xbox Store. Well, once you have your project accepted by the ID@Xbox team (which is even easier for UWP developers now) \nSo long as you have a Windows 10 PC and a retail Xbox, your good to go as everything else is free, the tools, the software, even the ability to switch your retail XboxOne over to a UWP dev kit. All from the comfort of your own home (or hotel room with free wifi) \nThere is one other caveat, that you need to also have a Windows Store developer account. This normally costs about £19 for an individual, a little more for a company account. You can either get this yourself, or when you are accepted by ID, you will get this account plus a load of other software completely FREE. Up to you. \nP.S. If you have an MSDN account, you also get a code for FREE, check your benefits. Setting up your development environment \nOnce you have everything ready, getting started couldn’t be simpler and there are only a few short steps. As the slide above shows, you can get up and running with your first project deployed in just 5 Minutes. (if your using Unity, it might take a little longer ) \nIn short, what you need to do is: 1: Install the “Dev Mode Activation” app on to your Xbox from the Xbox Store 2: Launch the “Dev Mode Activation” app. You will be presented with a code and a URL. Navigate to the URL on your PC, sign in with your Windows Account (same one used with your Xbox Live Gamertag) and enter the code to register the Xbox to your Microsoft Account 3: Once complete, your Xbox will automatically refresh and then ask you to restart. This will now boot your Xbox in to UWP developer mode with a completely separate sandbox inside your Xbox. Your Retail settings / apps are still safe on your Xbox, you just can’t access them from developer mode. You can return to Retail mode at any time. 4: Once you have signed in to your Xbox using your Microsoft account, you can launch the Developer Portal app on the Xbox. This shows you all the apps / games installed plus a ton of other developer details. Take note of the Tools IP in case Visual Studio doesn’t automatically detect it. 5: The first time you connect to your Xbox from Visual Studio (selecting the deployment as remote and selecting the Xbox, as shown here) you will be asked for a code to pair the Xbox. You get this code from the Developer Portal on the Xbox in the “Pair with Visual Studio” section. Visual Studio and the Xbox must be signed in using the same Microsoft account you activated with. 6: Done. You should now be able to deploy and run games from Visual Studio on your Xbox. You can also see debugging information from your Xbox (providing your local network supports it) while the game is running. Just make sure you Run in “Release” or “Master” mode when looking at performance issues as the debugger has an impact. \nAnd that’s it. You are up and running. The security of the setup ensures that you (and only you) can connect to your Xbox in dev mode and deploy apps, so long as you use the same Microsoft account for everything. You can still sign in other gamers, using their GamerTags for local multi-player (although you can’t grant gamerscore ). If you also are a member of ID and have access to to the Live SDK and services, you can also test networked multi-player and all the other Live services. Checking out the demos \nFor the demo’s, you are going to need to watch the video but here are some handy links to the start of each demo: *Click on images to view the demos \nWhat’s Next? \n\nRight, so you have your project ready, plans are afoot and you know what you either want to build or have a tech-demo (or even a full project) ready. To get ready to be published on the Xbox and Windows Store (for games) you need to be registered with the awesome ID@Xbox program. in the past some developers have been a bit disillusioned with the responses to the program but Times have changed . The team has evolved (especially with UWP deploy now coming to light) and it’s now even more streamlined to get access to the program. \nOnce registered and signed up, the ID team are fully behind you, giving you: Free software and a Windows Store account Access to all major gaming events Support through the MS Game Developer network Enablement to Xbox Live for access to achievements, networking, leader boards and much more. \nMy recommendation (especially if you have a mobile game already or the beginnings of a desktop app) is to apply just for Windows 10 first, get your project out there in the hands of players and then either publish it as a UWP to Xbox or then also apply for the Xbox tier to build a native game (although check the next section for more detail on that). Windows 10 has much easier access but has all the same rewards for all ID developers, it also has fewer requirements and certifications to get published (you can’t ship a game that randomly crashes for instance!). \nThe key here is that you are getting your game out as early as possible, getting it in to the hands of players and gaining presence. I state this in the video but you must be prepared for the amount of footwork you need to put in to promoting your game with the general public. ID will be behind you every step of the way to take your content further (many ID games are now even getting in front of Major Nelson these days, thanks to ID). I will stress though, expect a lot of work, ID won’t do it for you and you need to be ready to produce high quality videos, marketing material and make yourself available. At least 80% of the effort in your game will come from the last 20% (as they say). \nIf you want your game to be successful, you need to be out there building presence and touting your game! Only you can promote your game the best way. (But ID will help with guidance and weight) \nKey Differences between UWP & Native \nTo round this session up and to allay some of the concerns and comments I’ve either heard or been asked about UWP on Xbox, I’ll walk through some of the key differences between publishing UWP on Xbox and going native. UWP projects \nin short, UWP is simply easier. It’s a friendlier platform and the key benefit is that the single project you build, is also directly shippable on all of Microsoft’s other Windows 10 platforms. \nWhile at FutureDecoded , the VISR-VR team showcased an awesome VR project called Botanika aimed at helping children and adults cope with the effects of Autism (it’s also a fun game for anyone btw ). This game was written in Unity, running as a UWP using the Vive VR setup. To make it even more amazing, the lead developer spent 10 minutes converting the project over the HoloLens (the night before the event no less) and had it running perfectly. Granted it wasn’t the full scope of the project but all the key elements were there, all now using HoloLens’s gestures to control the game instead of the Vive Controllers. \nGetting Botanika up and running in about 10 minutes on a HoloLens in Unity was an awesome effort Louis! \nWhen publishing UWP games to the Xbox, there are slightly fewer resources to native games (about 70% of resources are available) but there are also fewer certification requirements, meaning less headaches trying to figure out why a controller keeps getting disconnected. As the demo’s show, there is a LOT you can get done with that 70% (remembering, it’s 70% of a very powerful beast, do not be fooled in to thinking it’s not much) Native development \nIf you get invited in to the Xbox Native group, which is a tougher crowd and you need your project to shine, you will be given 2 developer enabled Xbox’s and a couple of years to get your project “finished”. \nA great number of developers are also taking up Microsoft’s offer of getting a “ Preview ” version of their title out even earlier to consumers. Something not offered on other platforms. Yes, it’s more work but it means you get to build more presence and get feedback direct from your players while building. \nI cannot stress more, just how much extra effort is needed to get a native Xbox game out, apart from the stricter certification requirements (which with some engines, you can run into trouble if it’s the engine causing the issue). Most certification builds take months of testing and validation to get ready. There are also stricter controls placed on console projects from a ratings perspective (and in some cases, quite costly), IARC hasn’t reached Xbox native yet (like with the Windows Store) but hopefully it will be coming soon. \nThere is also the fact that in a lot of cases, you will need C++ skills (or contract them) to work on the interconnectedness of things, or if you need the utmost performance on the platform. Although, I’ve known a fair few devs who haven’t had to go down this route but there are always compromises. Summing up \nThe world just got that little bit bigger and if you are already working on a project for Windows 10, the reach of your title has now opened up even more and for very little effort. If you want to then use the success of your game to then build the “Evolved” edition and build that native later, then you already have a foot in the door and it also becomes easier (although harder from an effort perspective ) \nSo, if you want to build one game and ship it on to several platforms at once, then UWP is the answer (yes I know mobile share is small at present but MS is still committed to it ). You’ll still be able to take it to other platforms later as most engines and frameworks also support more than UWP, so if you architect your project right, the world is your oyster. \nIf you are making games these days, NEVER restrict or limit your dream to one platform. Go BIG, go WILD and get out there! License \nThis article, along with any associated source code and files, is licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL) Share",

      "title": "The New Microsoft Is Playing Dirty Like the Old Microsoft, Says Salesforce CEO",
      "text": "They say the new Microsoft has become a completely new company under the guidance of CEO Satya Nadella, as it’s a friendlier partner and rival that no longer seems to be interested in dirty tricks to increase its customer base (as it was the case of the Scroogled campaign launched by Steve Ballmer). But according to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, the new Microsoft is nothing different from the old Microsoft, as the company still turns to some questionable strategies when it comes to its rivals. Benioff revealed one such episode at the Code Conference on Monday, explaining that he was invited by Microsoft chairman John Thompson to a meeting with Microsoft's cloud boss Scott Guthrie to discuss the possibility of becoming an Azure customer. “The message was 'Why don’t you meet with Scott Guthrie? He runs Azure and would really like to walk you through the details of your business because maybe we could get Salesforce to run on Azure'... and I'm like OK, and it ...",

      "text": "The Surface Studio impressed many in the tech world when Microsoft took the wraps off its $2,999 desktop PC last month. But it sounds like Apple's Phil Schiller doesn't share that point of view based on his comments about touch screen-equipped desktop machines.\n\n\"Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things?\" Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, told Backchannel editor Steven Levy . \"That becomes absurd.\"\n\nIf a touch screen iMac is absurd, what would Phil Schiller say about the Surface Studio? To be clear, Schiller wasn't speaking specifically about the Surface Studio when he made that comment. Rather, he was outlining Apple's stance on touch interfaces -- good for mobile devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and not so hot for laptops and desktop computers -- as part of Levy's review of the latest MacBook Pro. It comes a Touch Bar strip on top of the keyboard but not touch-enabled displays.\nStill, it's hard not to compare and contrast between Apple's stance that touch interfaces don't work on desktop machines and Microsoft's counter-argument that they very much do.\n\nLevy's article clearly outlines how Apple approaches its product lineup: the iPhone and iPad are computers just as much as the MacBook Pro and iMac, Schiller argues. But people use those different devices in different ways, so their design needs to follow that function. \nMORE: Best All-in-One PCs \n\"Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal,\" Schiller tells Levy. \"People in the industry may question them--we don't, for some very simple reasons.\"\n\nTo that end, Apple can't understand would want to reach out over a keyboard or trackpad to jab at an iMac screen. And it's apparently done the testing to support that conclusion. Schiller tells Levy that Apple tested touch screens \"a number of times over the years\" to see if they worked on the Mac platform. \"Our instincts were correct,\" Schiller added.\n\nSome might counter that if the form of a device doesn't support touch interaction, maybe you should try changing the form itself. That's what Microsoft has seemingly done with the Surface Studio. The PC features a zero-gravity hinge and custom-tuned springs, giving the display a weightless feel when you shift it to a 20-degree angle. When my colleague Mark Spoonauer went hands-on with the Surface Studio , he found it easy to change modes and was also impressed by the optional Surface Dial, a handy tool for creative professionals that can handle tasks like changing colors on the fly.\nMicrosoft Surface Studio Hands-on \nIn his interview with Levy, Schiller brings up a strong point about how designing an interface that accommodate both your fingers and input devices like a mouse just won't fly. \"You can't optimize for both. It's the lowest common denominator thinking,\" Schiller says in the article.\n\nWe've seen more iOS features find their way into the Mac operating system over the years — Apple even changed the name OS X to macOS to mirror the naming convention of its mobile OS — and Apple trackpads now support the pinching gestures that are commonplace on the iPhone. But, based on Schiller's comments to Levy, if you're expecting Apple to take a page out Microsoft's book regarding touch interfaces on its desktops, you're in for a long wait.\n\nAs for the Touch Bar, in his review, Levy praises some of the shortcuts the strip provides, particularly for predictive typing, though he's not convinced the feature is all that transformative. (Levy also wonders if it could be the first step toward the end of a physical keyboard; you will not need to guess on what Schiller thinks about that idea.)\nFor our part, our review of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar on sister site Laptop found that model awfully expensive to justify the experience, while the 15-inch MacBook Pro looks like the better buy , even if more developers need to support the Touch Bar to make it a worthwhile feature.\nSee Also : Best Laptop Gifts 2016 - Top Picks for Every Budget \nBest Gaming PCs Apple Hopes a Friendlier Siri Will Make You Use It More The Best Gifts for Gamers About the author Philip Michaels @PhilipMichaels Philip Michaels is a senior editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft has taken measures to prevent Xbox Club owners and admins from spamming other Xbox users with invites. \n“With the latest Xbox One System update, we have added Clubs as one of the many new features,” says the official statement Xbox’s Larry Hyrb’s blog . “I wanted to let everyone know that based on the feedback received from our Xbox Insider audience and the data collected, we have adjusted the maximum of invites each club can send and go unanswered. Most clubs won’t notice any changes. But if you are one of the few clubs that has reached that maximum, when you try to send new club invites, only a subset will be sent. The other invites will be dropped silently.” \nThis is a change that really does benefit all Xbox One and Windows 10 users. There’s nothing worse than being bombarded with random invites to join online clubs that you have no interest in. For Xbox Club owners and admins who want to see their clubs grow though, Larry Hyrb offers two suggestions; Only invite users who have expressed interest in joining or simply direct people to the “Request to join” button. \nXbox Clubs are a new social feature that launched this month on Xbox One and the Xbox apps on Windows 10, iOS, and Android devices. Their primary purpose is to allow gamers to communicate with each other easily and discover new friends with similar interests . \nAre you enjoying the new Xbox Clubs feature ? How many clubs have you joined? Let us know  ",

      "text": "• @mggjim \nMicrosoft Edge may not be the most capable Web browser but it has some unique features that make it worthy of a second look, even if it’s not your browser of choice in Windows 10. One cool feature is Cortana integration, which provides context-sensitive info as you browse the web. Starting with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (released in August 2016), Cortana’s “smarts” can also help save you money by automatically finding and displaying applicable coupons at popular online stores. Here’s how it works. \n  make sure you’re running at least the Anniversary Update build of Windows 10, as the feature discussed here isn’t present in earlier versions of the operating system. Next, launch the Edge browser from your Start Menu or taskbar and navigate to the website of a large online store (e.g., Target , Best Buy , Sears , etc.). \nBased on data provided by mobile coupon service Shopular , Cortana will check for any available coupons. If she finds any, Cortana will display a notification in your Edge toolbar or alert you via voice, depending on your Cortana settings. \nTo access the coupons, you can verbally ask Cortana to display (again, if you’ve set up voice control), click on the notification in your toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Alt-C . \nThe Cortana interface will slide out of the right side of the Edge window and display any current coupons for the applicable store, along with terms, expiration dates, and coupon codes if necessary. If a coupon code is required, you can copy it with a single click, making it ready to paste into the order form at checkout. \nCortana coupons aren’t available at every online store, but she often has something to display at most of the major online retail outlets. Having quick access to coupons via Cortana also eliminates the need to search for and visit the many shady coupon sites around the Internet. \nThis feature probably isn’t enough to persuade Chrome and Firefox users to switch to Edge but, especially with the holiday shopping season fast approaching, it may be enough to keep Edge in mind when it’s time for some online shopping. \n ",

      "text": "Microsoft Black Friday Preview Posted! November 14, 2016 We just posted the 4-page Microsoft Store Black Friday Sneak Peek ad scan ! The majority of Microsoft's Black Friday deals won't go live until 12AM EST on Thanksgiving, but they have released a sneak peek of some of their planned deals. This isn't the full Microsoft Black Friday ad, and we'll be sure to keep you updated when more deals are released. One standout is the offer for $50 off select Xbox consoles plus a free gift code and game . Prices start at $249.99 so depending on the selection available this could be one of the best Xbox deals of the year. That offer starts on November 24th. Another highlight is the offer for a free $100 gift code with the purchase of an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift . These items are smokin' hot and very on trend so they haven't gone on sale much -- this deal is the best we have seen yet for them. Thank You for Visiting and Tell Your Friends!",

      "text": "Loading... \nA reader is having an issue with the Chrome browser. “I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4. I have been using Google Chrome for years, but now it crashes almost every time I try to connect to it. Is it not compatible with Windows 10 or what? Should I change to another browser?” \nChrome is compatible with Windows 10. Let’s try a few things. First, make sure you have the latest version of Chrome. Click the menu button on the upper-right and check the drop-down menu. If there’s an option to update Chrome, you’ll see it. If not, you’re up-to-date. \nIf updates don’t help, I’d suggest checking what types of extensions you have running in Chrome. One of them may be causing the problem. Or, you can try uninstalling and re-installing Google Chrome. \nOne of these options should take care of the problem. \n~ Cynthia \nTags: Chrome broswer , quick tips , troubleshoot chrome , Windows 10 This entry was posted on Tuesday, November 15th, 2016 at 7:31 AM and is filed under Quick Tips , Using The Internet .

      "text": ".pdf (Portable Document Format; Adobe Acrobat) .doc, .docx (Microsoft Word Document) .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx (Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation) .odt (OpenDocument Text Document) .xls, .xlsx (Microsoft Excel Document) \nWhile WordPress allows all of the files above, your hosting provider may not, especially if you’re on a shared server. You’ll also have a limit to the size of the file you can upload. \nThe limit will vary depending on your hosting or if you manually increase the limit yourself in your php.ini file. You can learn how to do this in our post How to Increase the Maximum Upload Limit in WordPress . Understanding the Upload Settings \nWhen you click the Add Media button at the top of the visual editor, you will automatically see all the media files you have previously uploaded. \nWhen you click on one, options will appear on the right hand side. The first section you’ll see is called Attachment Details . You can also select multiple images to add to the post or page you’re editing by simply clicking on each additional file you would like to add while also pressing the Ctrl key in Windows or Command key on Mac OS X. \nAn overview will be displayed of the file’s details and links to edit the image in WordPress or delete it permanently. You’ll then see the file’s meta data fields to fill out including a direct URL path among your site’s files. Adding or editing these fields is entirely optional, but it’s a good idea to at least add “Alt Text” to your image before you add it to your post or page. The Title field should contain a good, brief description of your image since it will be shown if your image or file fails to load. It will also be displayed on its attachment page which is displayed only if you select that option further down the attachment details section. It’s also picked up by search engines so having a generic title with a random string of letters or numbers won’t help you rank higher in search results. The Caption is a short description or note about the image that is displayed below the image on the post or page. Depending on the theme you are using, it may be contained within a border along with the image or otherwise could have different styling than the rest of your page. The Alt Text (alternative text) field is meant to have an accurate description of the image or video for visitors who are visually impaired. You should describe what is shown or what is happening in the image or video so visitors can follow along with your post and not skip a beat, even if they can’t see what’s being shown. The Description is similar to alt text, but the difference is that it’s displayed on an file’s attachment page if the theme supports it. You can also add HTML to this section. You may not need to use this type of meta data, but it can be useful if you’d like to offer your visitors downloads of your content. \nThe final section of the available options is called Attachment Display Settings and it sets how the image or other media file is displayed on your site. One of the best ways to get familiar with these options is to test them out on a sample page and see the direct results of the options you choose. \nWith the Alignment option, you can choose to have your file positioned on the left, center or right of your post. \nSelecting the default None option in the drop down box will display your image to the left and any text that you enter will appear at the bottom of the image on a new line. \nLeft alignment will display your image on the left, but it will also activate text wrapping. This means text that you enter will appear beside the image for its full height, then appear at the bottom. Adjusting the size of the image will help text wrapping fit nicely. \nThe Center option will position the image in the middle of the page on the line its on. Text will appear above and below the image. \nThe last option is Right and it’s similar to left aligning since text wrapping is enabled with this option, but it differs because an image is displayed to the right with text wrapping on the left. \nLink to is another drop box option that has different ways your media file can display when it’s clicked. There are four choices for images and the default is Media file . When this option is selected, a clicked image will link directly to the file on your site. \nA blank page with the image on the very top, left of the page will be displayed. There are plugins that will change how this option is displayed when an image or other file has been clicked such as the Easy FancyBox and WordPress Colorbox Lightbox plugins. \nOther files such as MS Word documents and PDF’s will launch the file’s download when the displayed link is clicked. \nSelecting Attachment Page displays links on a separate page that is styled to look like another page on your theme, but instead of post or page content being shown, your image or other file is displayed with the title and description attributes.   \nThe Media file and Attachment Page options are available for all uploaded file types, but there are an extra two options for images. \nThe first of the two is the Custom URL option which allows you to choose any link on the web for your visitors to be directed to when they click your image. The other option is None which displays your image without a link attached. Clicking it will have no affect. \nThe last option in the Attachment Display Settings for image files only is Size . You will be able to choose between pre-defined sizes including Thumbnail which is set to 150 pixels by 150 pixels by default, Medium with a height of 300 pixels and Full Size which does not scale your image and displays the original uploaded size. \nWhen you select these options, your original image is scaled to fit in your post or page, but the original file’s size remains untouched. This means that you can resize an image to be smaller in one post while also displaying it in another post as its original size. \nWith all the options covered, let’s dive into the different ways you can upload content to your site. Uploading from Your Library \nAfter clicking the Add Media button when editing a post or a page, an in-line pop-up will appear where you have a few different options to choose the file location of media you would like to upload. The default location is from your media library. You can sift through the list faster by selecting a sorting option in the drop down boxes or search box above the thumbnails. \nThis is helpful if you’ve previously added a file to your site and want to use it currently, even if you have already used it before on your site. \nAll you have to do is click on the thumbnail of the file you want to add, then include any extra options you’d like on the right hand side of the pop-up. Finally, click the Insert into Page/Post button to add the file. Uploading from Your Computer \nAfter clicking the Add Media button, Select the Upload Files tab under the “Insert Media” title. On larger screens there is an additional menu on the left of these tabs, but it is listed on smaller screens as a drop down list when hovering over the “Insert Media” title. \nNext, click the Select Files button that appears to choose the files you wish to upload or drag and drop them from your computer’s files directly to this area in the pop-up. \nEither option will upload your selected files and display them in the media library. Once the upload is complete, you will be automatically redirected to the Media Library tab where you can select the files you want to use. Creating an Image Gallery \nTo create a gallery with the images of your choice, select the Create Gallery link in the menu on the left after opening the media uploader. You can select multiple images by simply clicking them with your mouse. You don’t need to press any keys on your keyboard like you would in the media library. You can also add individual meta data for each image you select. \nChoose the images you would like to use in the order you would like them to appear and enter in any meta data you would like to add. When you’re done, click on the Create a new gallery button at the bottom, right of the pop-up. Selecting the “Add to Gallery” link on the left will bring you back to the “Media Library” to select other images to include in your gallery. \nYou’ll have the chance to delete any images you don’t want to include on the Edit Gallery page that loads by clicking on the X buttons on the top, right of each thumbnail. \nYou can also reorder the images by clicking on one, then dragging and dropping it in your desired place, although, this may not be an option with certain themes or gallery plugins. There is also the Reverse order button next to the Gallery Settings which will flip the order the images. \nYou can also cancel the creation of the gallery or add more images by selecting those links from the menu on the left. Once you have all the images ready, choose the Gallery Settings you would prefer on the right. \nYou’ll see the familiar options of Link to and Size along with two new options: Columns and Random Order . \nSelecting a number value in the Columns drop down box will determine how many images are displayed on one line. Keep in mind that if your images are larger, they may not all fit on one line and may spill over to a new one. \nThe Random Order radio button will display your images in a random order not just once, but for each time the page is loaded. \nWhen you’re done setting up your new gallery, click the Insert gallery button on the bottom, right of the pop-up to add it to the post or page you’re editing. Adding an Audio or Video Playlist \nEmbedding videos or music to your site is very similar to adding image galleries. For the full instructions you can check out our post How to Create Audio & Video Playlists in WordPress Without Plugins . \nKeep in mind that if you want your playlist to work, your selected files need to be .mp3 for audio and .mp4 for videos, otherwise only a download link will appear. It may also help you to note that in order for the Create a Video/Audio Playlist buttons to appear, you need to upload your files first. The audio and video meta data is added in the same way you would images for a gallery. Inserting a Featured Image \nThe next option listed in the media uploader menu is Set Featured Image . Unlike image galleries and adding images to your post or page, you can only select one image to be featured. \nOnce you upload the image you would like to display as the main image for your post or page, click the featured image link and select the image. Add the meta data you need and click the Set featured image button on the bottom, right of the pop-up. Add an External Media File \nYou don’t just have the option to add files you uploaded to your site from your computer. You can also choose to embed a file from a direct link from another site. This means you can easily add Vimeo or YouTube videos to your site without having to upload them. \nTo do this, click the Insert from URL link in the left menu of the media uploader window and enter the link of the file you wish to embed to your post or page. Adding a title is optional since YouTube videos, for example, already include a title with the video. \nFinally, click the Insert into page button at the bottom, right corner of the pop-up to add the media file to your post or page. Conclusion \nNow you’ll be able to help your site stand out and become more dynamic by adding media files including images, audio and video. \nThere are also many plugins to enhance the image gallery feature. To learn more about some of the best ones, check out our post 5 Best Free WordPress Gallery Plugins . \nIf you would like to learn more about optimizing your images for your site to reduce load times, check out our plugin WP Smush Pro . \nThere are also many resources available for sourcing free images you can use on your site.

The HPDA analytics market size is estimated to reach USD 78.26 billion by 2021. The proliferation of open source frameworks (Hadoop) for big data analytics and the ability of powerful HPC systems to process data at higher resolutions has fueled the growth of HPDA. However, high investment costs and government rules & regulations are acting as the restraining factors for the HPDA market. The software segment is inevitably gaining traction in the HPDA market owing to the aggressive deployment of supercomputers with high performance computing and advanced analytics in various verticals. The ability to ingest data at high rates and provide analytics in the real-time to create competitive advantage is the driver promoting the HPDA technology. The software market includes programming tools, middleware, performance optimization tools, cluster management tools, and fabric management. APAC is estimated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The developing APAC market is poised to grow, as the developing economies are pushing themselves up the analytics edges to be competitive with the developed economies in the world. Higher adoption of supercomputers in China and India with enormous government support is boosting the adoption of HPDA market. China has the fastest supercomputers in the world and would be looking to proliferate further in this burgeoning market. Companies Mentioned: Cisco Systems and SAP SE Cray Inc.",

The proliferation of open source frameworks (Hadoop) for big data analytics and the ability of powerful HPC systems to process data at higher resolutions has fueled the growth of HPDA. However, high investment costs and government rules & regulations are acting as the restraining factors for the HPDA market. \nThe software segment is inevitably gaining traction in the HPDA market owing to the aggressive deployment of supercomputers with high performance computing and advanced analytics in various verticals. The ability to ingest data at high rates and provide analytics in the real-time to create competitive advantage is the driver promoting the HPDA technology. The software market includes programming tools, middleware, performance optimization tools, cluster management tools, and fabric management. \nAPAC is estimated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The developing APAC market is poised to grow, as the developing economies are pushing themselves up the analytics edges to be competitive with the developed economies in the world. Higher adoption of supercomputers in China and India with enormous government support is boosting the adoption of HPDA market.

Specifically, we are highlighting the process of marking specific chat entries so you can easily find them later. \nChatting and discussions in Microsoft Teams is a key element of the collaboration tool and they come in a three varieties - voice, video and text. \nThe text based discussions can become very lengthy for many reasons and you may need to mark a certain entry so that you can come back to it later so that you can take action or use it as a reference later in the project. \nMarking these chat entries as saved is very straight forward and then links to those chats will be under your Microsoft Teams user profile. The best part is that this element of the chat is saved in context to the chat entries before and after it which is very handy. \nHere is how you mark a chat entry as saved in Microsoft Teams: \nIn each text based chat window you can hover your mouse over an entry and it will show you the ribbon icon. Click that to save the chat. \nOnce that chat is saved the icon will fill in to indicate that your choice was successful. \nOnce a chat entry is saved it will appear under your Saved list of items on your user profile section of Microsoft Teams. \nYou can also continue to participate in that same chat and review it in its entirety from your profile page without needing to open it up in its original channel. \nBe sure to check out other Quick Tips for Microsoft Teams including creating a team , building channels , adding Connectors , and holding scheduled & impromptu meetings . \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "title": "Microsoft: Would I Buy It Again, Knowing What I Know Now?",
      "text": "Microsoft is going thru a transition. Question is will it work? \nMicrosoft's numbers are a mixed bag, given the direction it is going. \nDoes the valuation line up as a buy? Microsoft, Would I buy it again? Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), one of the largest, best-known tech companies out there. It is an interesting mix of trendy and hip. Or old-school tech with its previous reliance on arguably outdated tech, laptop computers and Windows operating systems. With the advent of cloud computing and data storage, it has recently soared back into our collective conscience with its success in this field. This company was the first stock I ever purchased so it has a soft spot in my heart. And always will. I have never sold that original purchase and have made additional ones since. I would like to take some time to look at why I bought this stock back then and what I think of the purchase now based on my evaluation of today's company. Would I have bought it back then knowing what I know now? Let's take a look and see. Business Overview According to Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft , \n\"The past year was pivotal in both our own transformation and in partnering with our customers who are navigating their own digital transformations. Microsoft Cloud is seeing significant customer momentum and we're well positioned to reach new opportunities in the year ahead.\" For the year ending 2016, Microsoft reported revenues of $85.320 billion, which resulted in net income of $16.798 billion. This was a decrease of 9% in revenue from 2015 and an increase of 11% in net income from 2015. The earnings per share increase from $1.48 in 2015 to $2.10, which was an increase of 42%. Some explanations from Microsoft for these changes were in 2016, there was a deferral for net revenue from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion (9%) and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of about $3.8 billion or 4%. There are going to be ongoing impacts with foreign currency given the unstable nature of the world's economies right now. Additionally the changes in EPS from 2015 to 2016 were due to the negative impact of the Windows 10 net revenue deferral and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses. This drove down the EPS $0.69 to $2.10. This was an increase over 2015 but not as much as it could have been, obviously. Some key changes in expenses were: Cost of revenue decreased $258 million or 1%, mainly due to a reduction in phone sales, which was a result of the change in strategy regarding the phone business. Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses decrease $8.9 billion, due to prior-year goodwill and asset impairment charges related to the phone business and restructuring charges associated with changes in the phone business. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1 billion or 6%, driven by a reduction in the phone business and a favorable foreign currency impact of about 2%. Some highlights for 2016 were: Commercial cloud annualized run rate exceeded $12.1 billion. Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 23.1 million. Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online seat additions more than doubled year over year. Microsoft Azure revenue grew 113%, with usage of Azure compute and Azure SQL database more than doubling year over year. Enterprise Mobility customers nearly doubled year over year to over 33,000. Windows 10 is now active on more than 350 million devices around the world. Xbox Live monthly active users grew 33% year over year to 49 million. In June 2016, the big announcement occurred that Microsoft was going to buy LinkedIn. The agreement was for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion. In other news from Microsoft, in May 2016, the announcement of the sale of the entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The sale is expected to close towards the end of 2016 but no announcement has come yet. The change in direction in regards to the phone business was a smart one on its part. To be blunt, it was not in a position to compete with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) at this point. It was a prudent decision to cut its losses and move on. The monies used for this segment of the business could better spent elsewhere, like with the cloud segment. The hope is to streamline Microsoft into one Windows experience and continue to focus its energies on the cloud experience as the driver of future incomes. Click to enlarge Source: Microsoft 10-K 2016 Productivity and Business Processes The focus of this part of the business is helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar office apps that they use every day. Microsoft recently introduced cloud power intelligence to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. The company is also building intelligence into its apps to provide advanced security for its customers. The linking of all these services via the cloud is going to continue to drive more revenue to this segment. Monthly users of Office 365 commercial are now over 85 million, which is up more than 40% year over year. Office 365 seats were also up 40% year over year and revenue up 54%. Office is available on other devices as well, which now has over 45 million users on iOS and Android, which is an increase of 70% year over year. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, due primarily to an increase in Office and Dynamics revenue. This revenue included a loss due to foreign currency exchange of 6%. Office commercial revenue saw an increase of $135 million or 1%, which was driven by increases in Office 365 commercial revenue. This was mainly due to an increase in subscribers. This was offset by lower license volume as Microsoft has seen a shift in business PC market to Office 365. Office consumer revenue decreased $69 million or 2%, which was driven by the decline in the consumer PC market. This was offset by an increase in Office 365 revenue, mainly due to subscribers. Lastly, Dynamics revenue increased 4%, this was mainly because of higher revenue for Dynamics CRM Online. This was driven by seat growth. Operating income and gross margin decreased for Productivity and Business Processes for 2016 primarily due to lower gross margin and higher cost of revenue, respectively. Each was down 7% and 4% or $898 million and $970 million. The gross margin included the unfavorable impact from foreign currency which was 6%. The cost of revenue increase $1 billion or 26%, this was due primarily to an increased mix of cloud offerings. Lower marketing expenses helped reduce the operating income by $72 million or 1%. The sales and marketing expenses were driven lower by the reduction in headcount-related expenses. This decrease was $82 million or 2%. As this segment integrates more with the cloud, MSFT will see an uptick in revenues from this area. As we will see throughout this article, the company is going through a transformation from a PC company to the cloud. Intelligent Cloud The Intelligent Cloud segment consists of public, private and hybrid server products and services. These services include Windows Server, SQL Server and Azure. There is also an Enterprise component as well. These are all designed to help the IT professionals be more productive and efficient. Azure is the main driver of cloud services for Microsoft. It is a scalable cloud platform with computing, networking, storage, database, and management. It is very flexible and allows customers to manage many different aspects of their business and devote more time to the business instead of the management systems. Revenue from this segment increased $1.3 billion or 6% in 2016. This was primarily due to higher server products and cloud services revenue. This, of course included a negative foreign currency impact of about 5%. Server products and cloud services grew revenue $686 million or 4%, driven primarily by growth from Azure of 113%. There was a slight decline in on-premise server products which offset this growth. Enterprise services revenue grew by $536 million or 11%, this was driven by growth in the Premier Support Services. Intelligent Cloud operating income was down $513 million or 5% in 2016. The main culprit was higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $989 million or 12%, which was due to higher research and development expenses and S&M expenses. The increase in R&D of $567 million or 12% and S&M of $347 million or 9% was due to increased strategic investments and acquisitions to drive cloud sales capacity and innovation. The investments and acquisitions strategy that Microsoft follows is key to its growth as a company. Its history is full of examples of additions that have helped the company grow. It is critical that it continues to spend money to create new products and services that will enhance its visions. Gross margin increased $476 million or 3%, which was offset by a higher cost of revenue. This drove a growth in revenue. The costs of revenue increased $851 million or 15%, which was driven by an increased mix of cloud services. More Personal Computing This segment is all about everything Windows. It is meant to connect all users from developers, IT professionals and end users. It includes Windows licensing, devices that includes phones, Surface and PC accessories. Also included in this segment is Xbox revenues and Bing advertising revenues. Windows 10 has been a transformative event for the company as the software moves away from just an operating system on a PC to a service that can power a full array of devices. Again the synergies of the change of direction toward the cloud will be key to Microsoft's continued growth. The devices consisted primarily of phones and Surface. With the changes in the phone business this segment of the business has been hit the hardest with revenue drops. In May 2016, Microsoft announced that it was selling the entry-level phone business. Next up is the gaming business. Xbox, with its multiple streams of revenue, has been a big winner for Microsoft, with the launch of Xbox live and its ability allow people to connect live and share online experience. The purchase of Minecraft in 2014 has helped enhance the gaming portfolio across many different platforms. Last but not least, Bing and the advertising that it brings to the table. In 2016, revenue declined for the More Personal Computing segment by $2.7 billion or 6%. This was mainly due to the lower revenue from Devices and Windows. This was offset by the higher revenues from Search advertising and Gaming. Devices revenue decreased $3.7 billion or 32%, which was mainly due to lower revenue from phones. This was driven by a change in strategy in phones. But there was an increase in Surface revenue. The decrease in phone revenue was $4.2 billion or 56% while the increase of revenues from Surface was $486 million or 13%. This was driven by the release of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Windows revenue decreased $871 million or 5%, primarily from lower revenue from patent licensing. This was driven by a decline in the PC market as less computer sold, the less licenses sold per unit. With situation in the PC market continuing to decline, Microsoft is moving away from its reliance on the PC market to drive revenues for the company. The cloud is the way of the future and it is wise for the CEO to embrace this. There was an increase in Bing advertising revenues of $1.7 billion or 46%. This was primarily because of a growth in Bing due to higher revenue per search and search volume. More Personal Computing saw an increase in operating income of $1.5 billion or 32%, which was due to a decrease in operating expenses, which did see a decrease of $2 billion or 13%. This was all due lower sales and expenses in marketing and R&D. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.3 billion or 19% and R&D decreased $676 million or 10%. All of this was driven by a reduction in phone expenses. Gross margins dropped $564 million or 3% due to lower revenue and despite a reduction in cost of revenue. The cost of revenue dropped $2.1 billion or 9%, driven primarily by a decrease in phone sales. Risks The risks that Microsoft face are twofold. First would be competition in the technology field, which is incredibly fierce. There is a constant battle of who can stay cutting edge and relevant in each field that it competes in. Windows is always going to be in a battle with Mac about which is the better operating system. There is always someone out there trying to develop something better. Microsoft has to devote tremendous time and resources to development to remain competitive. Some of the competitors that exist for market share of operating systems would be Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Apple, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Apple, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), among others. Some very big hitters indeed. In the internet surfing world, which is dominated by Google, Microsoft competes with Bing. In the cloud, it faces competition from Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ), SAP (NYSE: SAP ), and IBM (NYSE: IBM ). And finally in the world of online gaming, it faces off against Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ). With the lifecycle of a gaming station being 5 to 10 years, there is fierce competition to see who will come up with the next best thing. Another big risk is the failure of a new product or system. There is incredible time and resources put into the development of any new product or system. This investment is incredibly speculative because if it fails it can really set a company back, both monetarily as well with its reputation. It can take several years to become profitable on any new release which can affect the revenues of the company. Valuation My process for evaluating companies has grown over the years, like everyone else's. Today, I have a set of criteria that I initially look for before I will look into the company more deeply. If I come across a company that peaks my interest I will do a quick evaluation with the following ratios. If those ratios don't meet the standards then I move on to the next idea. The cool thing about value investing is that you don't need to swing at every pitch. If you don't like something, don't swing. The ratios are as follows: Equity Growth Rate",

      "title": "Microsoft celebrates the Xbox’s 15th birthday",
      "text": "\nThe original Xbox was Microsoft’s very first game console, taking one of the world’s biggest software giants into an all new frontier: the living room. Despite all the effort that was needed to get the system both completed and profitable, Microsoft’s efforts back then paid off, as shown by the massive successes of its successors, the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. The console landscape has changed massively because of the Xbox, and everything goes back to a single day: the system’s North American release on November 15th, 2001.\nIt’s been a long fifteen years, and Microsoft’s celebrating quite a bit. From reminiscing about the past to in-game promotions, there’s a lot to go over. One of the most interesting things shown off would be the full Xbox Live statistics. There’s 222,468,423 players (and counting!) on Xbox Live right now, and they’ve collectively spent over 100,539,390,670 hours playing games. 29,000,304,183 of those hours were spent playing multiplayer, and over 32,667,582,157 achievements have been earned, which add up to 572,605,554,587 gamerscore. The user with the highest gamerscore holds 0.000247371858% of that – a staggering 1,416,465 GS.\nWhen it comes to the in-game event side of things, this is also the fifteenth anniversary of Halo: Combat Evolved. It was one of the Xbox’s launch titles, and impressively still holds up to this very day. Much like Goldeneye and Perfect Dark before it, Halo stood as proof that a first person shooter could work well on a console, and vastly outdid its predecessors.\nHalo 5: Guardians is the latest entry in the series, and 343 Industries are streaming it later today on the official Halo Twitch channel . Additionally, logging in to Halo 5 any time from now until next Tuesday will result in getting a free anniversary REQ pack. This pack contains some classic Halo weapons for use in Warzone modes, as well as the Mark IV armor set.\nForza Horizon 3 owners also get a little surprise, the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor. This is a free truck to drive in game, and it comes with a special 15th anniversary paint job.\nThe Xbox’s past has been a strong one, and it’s exciting to think about what the future holds for it.\nWhat are your memories of the Xbox – be it the original, 360, or One? Let us know in the comments below! \n",

It's also worthy of note that Halo: Combat Evolved was launched at the same time and was crucial to the game console's success. \nMicrosoft followed that up with the Xbox 360 in 2005 and the Xbox One in 2013, which continues to compete with Sony's PlayStation console. \nPeople took to Twitter today to celebrate the Xbox. Let's see what they're saying: \nThose were some of the more commercial Twitter accounts, but there's also plenty of praise from regular fans: \nLike I said, Xbox consoles have had some problems: \nBut the company admits it wasn't always perfect: \nStill, I think people have forgiven them: Internet Microsoft Twitter CNET Review",

The news comes from a blog post on the official Azure blog , which also wraps up some of the history of Functions’ development and showcases all of the features that have been baked into the service leading up to this point. #AzureFunctions is now generally available. Try out serverless compute for FREE here: https://t.co/nbeOIV9r2h pic.twitter.com/XlV48rAV9M \n— Microsoft Azure (@Azure) November 15, 2016 \nFunctions differentiates itself from competitors by offering developers a service that lets your payment scale with the amount of demand that you’re experiencing. \nPut simply, if your code is running for a while, you’ll be charged for the time that it was run. The pricing makes sure that people won’t be charged disproportionately, and makes it more user-friendly. \nIf you aren’t totally sold on Azure Functions yet, you can give it a shot risk-free. Just follow the link in the Azure blog post, and you’ll be able to try Functions for one hour without even submitting a credit card.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft love affair with Linux continues as it joins The Linux Foundation You read the title correctly. Microsoft, yes Microsoft, just joined the Linux Foundation. \nBelieve it or not, Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. \nNo, this isn't The Onion and it's not April Fool's Day. Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation. \nMicrosoft announced that it was joining forces with The Linux Foundation at the Microsoft Connect developer event in New York. \nHeck, Ballmer even recently said he loved Microsoft's porting of SQL Server to Linux . \nSo did someone put some LSD in current Microsoft CEO's Satya Nadella tea? No. \nMicrosoft has changed. Today's Microsoft supports Debian GNU/Linux on Azure and has its own Linux certification . 2016's Microsoft offers the open-source Hadoop big data software on Ubuntu and its CEO proclaims that Microsoft loves Linux . Microsoft even has its own specialized Linux distribution: Azure Cloud Switch . \nWhy has Microsoft done all this? Because, in two words: \" Linux won\" . \nIt's only on the desktop that Microsoft is still omnipresent. Windows isn't even the most popular end-user operating system. That honor goes to Android. \nEverywhere else -- clouds, supercomputers, and servers -- it's a Linux world. Microsoft could have tried to fight it and hemorrhage red-ink or they could embrace it and profit. They choose to make money. \nDon't believe me? Look at Azure. In Microsoft's last quarter, Azure revenue was up 116 percent, with compute usage doubling. What do people run on Azure? More and more they run Linux. One in three server instances on Azure are Linux . I'm counting the days until there's more Linux than Windows Server running on Azure. I won't have that many to count. \nScott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Group, knows what I'm talking about. In a statement, he said: \"As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know. The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community's most innovative open-source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first move in working with the industry's leading Linux group. Microsoft already contributes to several Linux Foundation projects, including the Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative. \nI asked Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation's executive director, if he were surprised that Microsoft had made the jump to joining the Foundation. He replied, \"Our philosophy is that open source should be a big tent where anyone can contribute\". \n\"There was a time where proprietary versus open source was a winner-take-all proposition, but that's in the past,\" he said. \"Open source is now a major force in software development, and the industry realizes you can make yourself better, while also making others better at the same time. Microsoft has been embracing open source increasingly for the better part of a decade, including contributing to and supporting many Linux Foundation projects, so their decision to take the next step and become a Linux Foundation member didn't come as a surprise to us.\" \nZemlin concluded, \"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology. The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open-source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" \nRelated Stories:",

      "text": "Shortly after Microsoft acquired Nokia in 2014, it nixed the Moonraker smartwatch that the Finnish firm was working on, so as to focus on the Band fitness tracker. We hardly got a chance to see what it looked like, save for this lone image. Now, YouTuber Nokibar has shared a video of the wearable in action, showing us its design, features and user interface – and it’s all meh. From the boxy, bulky exterior to its lackluster software with standard features like step tracking and messaging, the Moonraker looks uninspired compared to first-gen smartwatches like the Apple Watch and Pebble’s range…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "title": "When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? As we count down to the New Year, the support clock is ticking. Microsoft will pull the plug on Windows Vista and Office 2007 in mere months. So how long until Windows 7, Office 2010, and other currently supported versions reach the end of the line? | Topic: Enterprise Software \n[This post has been completely updated and republished several times since its initial publication in 2013. Most recent update: November 15, 2016.] \nMicrosoft's support clock never stops ticking. Two very high-profile products will end extended support in 2017: Windows Vista on April and Office 2007. Windows Vista's final date for security updates is April 11, 2017, while Office 2007 support ends on October 10, 2017. tech pro research Read More \nThose are the two most prominent in a long list of Microsoft products reaching the end of the line next year. If you are, for some odd reason, still using Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 or Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Database Professionals, the time is not to begin letting go. \nThese end dates are also mileposts on Microsoft's road to the cloud. \nAs I've noted before , Microsoft has a well-established support lifecycle for its software products. It's basically an agreement that the company makes with everyone who commits to its core products, Windows (desktop and server) and Office. (For details on how those support dates are calculated, see the end of this post.) \nThe terms of that agreement don't change often, which is an important assurance for business customers who tend to be conservative in their approach to upgrades. \nAnd it's worth noting that the end-of-support date is not a death sentence. PCs running Windows XP are still out there, running merrily along. Likewise, Windows 7 PCs will not stop working when the clock runs out. The only difference will be an eerie quiet on the second Tuesday of each month. When the extended support period ends, so do those updates. (Large enterprise customers who have custom support agreements with Microsoft and who are willing to pay a very steep price for the privilege can still get custom updates after the official end of support. But consumers and small businesses will not have that option.) \nIn the past, when Microsoft released a new version of each of its flagship products every two or three years, the company was obligated to offer ongoing support for as many as five versions of Windows at one time, for desktop and notebook PCs. \nThe 10-year support lifecycle is in the process of changing, as Microsoft moves to its \"Windows as a service\" and Office 365 subscription models. But for a few more years, at least, shrink-wrapped software is still alive and kicking. Here's the rundown on support commitments for the client versions of Windows and Office, starting with the newest member of the family: Windows 10 Read More \nIn the run-up to the release of Windows 10, many wondered whether Microsoft would take the opportunity to change its support lifecycle. The answer, as announced with the release of the new operating system in July 2015 , is no. The traditional 10-year support lifecycle continues, with a five-year mainstream support phase that began on July 29, 2015, and a second five-year extended support phase that begins in 2020 and extends until October 2025. \nA note to that policy qualifies the support commitment to devices where the OEM continues to support Windows 10 on that device. \nWindows 10 feature updates (the new name for what used to be full-version upgrades) are delivered via Windows Update automatically. Microsoft released the first major update, version 1511, in November 2015; the second feature update, version 1607 (aka the Anniversary Update) was released last summer. \nThese updates are required for ongoing support. As a result, the only customers who are likely to care about the 10-year upgrade cycle are those running the Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) in enterprise deployments. It's likely that Microsoft will publish a new 10-year support calendar with each LTSB release. \nMainstream support ends: October 13, 2020 \nExtended support ends: October 14, 2025 Windows 8/8.1 and Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 \nMicrosoft's official Windows 8.1 Support Lifecycle Policy treats Windows 8.1 as if it were a service pack for Windows 8. That means the lifecycle calculations start when Windows 8 shipped, in 2012. \nSupport for the original release of Windows 8 ended \"two years after the General Availability of the Windows 8.1 update,\" or October 18, 2015. The same policy applies to Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 (equivalent to Windows 8.1). \nMost PCs that included a preinstalled version of the original release of Windows 8 have long since disappeared from retail channels. For the dwindling population of PC users still running Windows 8, a free upgrade to Windows 8.1 is available through the Windows Store. \nMainstream support ends: January 9, 2018 \nExtended support ends: January 10, 2023 Windows 7 Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 \nThis is still the most popular release of Windows, although Windows 10 is making serious inroads, especially in the consumer segment of the market. The following support dates require that you install Service Pack 1 (Windows 7 RTM support ended in April 2009). \nNote that these dates are identical for Windows Server 2008 R2. \nIn an earlier revision of this post, I predicted, accurately, that Microsoft would not extend the support deadline for XP. I believe the same will be true of Windows 7. There will almost certainly be an outcry for this popular OS to get an extension when January 2020 rolls around, but it's not likely to happen. \nMainstream support ends: No longer supported \nExtended support ends: January 14, 2020 Windows Vista Service Pack 2 \nThe much-reviled Windows Vista will apparently end not with a bang but a whimper. The mainstream support phase ended in 2012, and the extended support phase is about to enter its final year. \nMainstream support ends: No longer supported \nExtended support ends: April 11, 2017 Black Friday 2016 Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Office support dates \nThe Office support lifecycle works just like Windows, with one important difference. Office 365 subscribers pay for a monthly or annual subscription and always receive the most current version of the Office desktop apps, which can be installed on up to 10 PCs or Macs, depending on the edition. \nMicrosoft continues to sell traditional versions of Office with a perpetual license. These products receive regular security and reliability updates but don't qualify for feature upgrades. \nHere are the support dates for each current member of the Office family sold as a perpetual license product: Office 2016 \nThis is the current release of Office, with a support schedule that matches up perfectly with Windows 10. \nMainstream support ends: October 13, 2020 \nExtended support ends: October 14, 2025 Office 2013 \nThe Office 2013 support schedule goes roughly three months past that of Windows 8.1. \nMainstream support ends: April 10, 2018 \nExtended support ends: April 11, 2023 Office 2010 Service Pack 2 \nSupport for Office 2010 Service Pack 1 ended on October 14, 2014. But with Service Pack 2 installed, you'll find this version still has a long extended support period ahead, with end-of-support dates that are 6 months after those of Windows 7. \nMainstream support ends: No longer supported \nExtended support ends: October 13, 2020. Office 2007 Service Pack 3 \nEarlier service pack releases are no longer supported, and this group of products has already passed the end of mainstream support. Extended support ends on October 10, 2017. How the support lifecycle works \nFor all versions of Windows and Office, Microsoft provides at least five years of mainstream support, followed by another five years of extended support. These lifecycles apply equally to business and home versions of Windows and Office . Service packs have separate end-of-support dates. For example, beginning next week you'll need to be running Service Pack 1 to get support for Windows 7. (There's an exhaustive FAQ if you want to dig deeper into this stuff.) \nGenerally, \"supported\" means you have access to at least one type of assisted support option (possibly paid) and no-charge security updates through channels like Windows Update and the Download Center. \nThe calculations start with the general availability (GA) date for each product. The official date of retirement for support is the second Tuesday in the first month of the quarter following that anniversary (which also happens to be Patch Tuesday). That grace period typically means a few weeks or months of extra support tacked on at the end of the five- and ten-year support cycles for each product. \nFor Windows 7, you can do the math yourself. The GA date for all Windows 7 editions was October 22, 2009. Five years after that date was October 22, 2014. The next calendar quarter began in January, 2015, and the second Tuesday of that month wass January 13. So, that's when mainstream support was scheduled to end. Extended support for all editions goes an extra five years, until January 14, 2020, which happens to be the second Tuesday of that month. (Those calculations don't work for Windows XP, whose end-of-life date was extended artificially.) \nTo find the end-of-support date for any Microsoft product, use the Microsoft Product Lifecycle Search page , the product family index , or the full A-Z product index to get the official answer. When you find the entry for a specific product, you can see the general availability date, the retirement dates for mainstream and extended support, and retirement dates for service packs.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced that the software giant is joining The Linux Foundation at its Connect(); 2016 developer event. The latest announcement is part of Microsoft’s aim to work closely with the open source community, which has been the main focus in many of its developer-focused events recently. Additionally, Microsoft is also the leading open source contributor on GitHub , ahead of Google and Facebook. Microsoft will be joining Cisco, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Intel, NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, and Samsung on The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member.\nJoining The Linux Foundation is quite a huge investment from Microsoft as companies need to pay $500,000 every year to become a Platinum member. Scott Guthrie, the Executive Vice President of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise Group stated:\n“As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know. The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community’s most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.”\nIt is worth noting that Microsoft already contributes to several projects from the Linux Foundation, including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative.",

It competes vigorously with Microsoft Windows Server.\nMicrosoft msft executive vice president Scott Guthrie announced the news on Wednesday morning at the Microsoft Connect conference for software developers in New York. Guthrie was joined on stage by Linux Foundation president Jim Zemlin.\nThis is a big deal historically, says Holger Mueller, an analyst with Constellation Research. “Windows and Linux were archenemies in the Ballmer era,” he tells Fortune . “Now Microsoft runs Linux everywhere. The question is what took them so long.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's daily newsletter on the business of technology. \nThe news is not as shocking as it would have been a few years ago. Steve Ballmer was Microsoft’s chief executive until two years ago. Current CEO Satya Nadella was named to replace him, and he has demonstrated a more open approach toward non-Microsoft technologies. Furthermore, Microsoft joined the Eclipse Foundation , another key open source organization, last March.\nFor more on Microsoft, watch \nMicrosoft is aware many corporate and other software developers love to work with Linux and want those workloads to run on the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft has also forged an alliance with Red Hat rht , which offers the flavor of Linux that most big companies run.",

      "title": "Google joins Microsoft’s .NET Foundation",
      "text": "As part of its slew of announcements at its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft unveiled that Google is joining the .NET Foundation. Specifically, Google is becoming a member of the Technical Steering Group, which Microsoft says “reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community” and also underlines “Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET.”\nAt its Build 2014 developer conference, Microsoft created the .NET Foundation, a group for overseeing the open sourcing of .NET. In March 2016, Microsoft formed the Technical Steering Group to share the direction of .NET’s core components with other companies and interested parties. Unity, JetBrains, and RedHat joined the foundation at that point, and Samsung followed in June.\nSo what does Google joining actually mean? In short, Google will help steer the future of .NET in a way that is “similar to an open standard,” Xamarin co-founder and now Microsoft’s vice president of mobile developer tools Nat Friedman told VentureBeat.\nGoogle’s decision is being driven out of its enterprise business ( Google Cloud ) and the desire to keep up with businesses adopting public and hybrid clouds. The company sees it the move as part of its commitment to open source technology, which benefits all enterprises, and cross-platform development that gives developers and IT professionals access to the best tools.\n“.NET is a key component in the modern enterprise, and the Google Cloud Platform team has worked hard to ensure that .NET has first-class support on Google’s infrastructure, including excellent infrastructure for Windows,” Google product manager Chris Sells said in a statement. “For years, Google has offered .NET libraries for more than 200 of its cloud services. More recently, we’ve built native GCP support for Visual Studio and PowerShell. Google is already an active contributor to .NET, including heavy involvement in the ECMA specification for C#. Joining the Technical Steering Group for the .NET Foundation expands our participation.”\nMore than half of the GitHub contributions to .NET’s corefx and coreclr come from outside of Microsoft. It thus makes sense for tech companies that are helping shape .NET to also have a say in the platform’s future.\n",

      "text": "Jeremy Kaplan/Digital Trends Jeremy Kaplan/Digital Trends \nWheels are generally imprecise: Imagine riding a bicycle and trying to stop it so the front tire is precisely poised atop a dime. But with that haptic feedback, the Dial can do precision work. It opens options across a variety of arts. Imagine a video editor using it to scrub through a timeline, a sound editor playing a segment back and forth, and so on. \nMore : Will Surface Pen work better with the Surface Studio? \nWhile he may be lead designer on the project, Schenone stressed that he was not the “man behind the product.” The Dial was very much a group effort, spanning materials and design teams, software engineers, product teams, and dozens of experts. A core team of about 10-15 people did most of the work, but it expanded to be a wider effort. The team includes designers, electrical, mechanical, RF, and software engineers, testers, program managers, and manufacturing members. It also looped in the Windows team, including Connor Weins, a Project Manager on Microsoft Windows. \n“It got really kind of messy, taping things together, trying things out, but we have an amazing shop.” \n“Working with the Surface team to bring Surface Dial to life was such an exciting opportunity,” Weins told Digital Trends. “As an entirely new class of input, it took Windows and Surface collaborating closely and innovating together to determine how one interacts with the other and, ultimately, what that experience looks like for users and third-party partners.” \nSchenone noted that the team created the hardware and software experiences at the same time, so support could be baked into the operating system. \n“It got really kind of messy, taping things together, trying things out, but we have an amazing shop on our campus that the studio is actually in – our design studio – and we do everything in house, we do all the design work, all the engineering work. It’s really organic,” he told Digital Trends. \nNot everything came together quickly, of course. Honing the material and the experience of using the Dial took time, and the passion of Microsoft’s design team comes through in the subtle elements most users don’t think twice about. The base of the Dial is stable on a desktop, but can slide across a monitor AND grip the monitor when it needs to. What substance does that? \n“This foot material? This took a while,” Schenone explained. “Do you want this thing to slide across the screen, or do you want it to stick? We had made both and realized, oh yeah, we want this to stick on screen when I’m resting my hand here… it’s a silicon pad, but we actually custom-lasered this texture in there that adds a level of suction to the screen.” Simplicity is key \nThe true innovation of the Dial is its ability to work both on a desk and on-screen. Give it a long press on your desktop and a circular menu pops up on screen (you can drag it wherever you want with your mouse). Plop the Dial on the Surface Studio’s screen, and you’ll be able to interact it through that menu. Select ruler mode, and quarter inches will be marked off in a circle surrounding the dial. Select volume, and you’ll see sound levels move up and down as you twist the dial. \nThe finished product is elegant in its simplicity. \n“It’s a radial object, you have a radial menu,” Schenone said. “And when you put it on screen, the only thing that changes is the diameter of the menu. We wanted to have the same type of functionality off screen as on screen.” \nLeftys of the world will be pleased to know that the hardware works beautifully in either hand. “You can plug in if I’m a lefty or a righty, and there’s some palm recognition that goes along with that, but the menu actually changes to being preferenced on the left or the right depending on where you’re holding it.” \nMore : Everything you need to know before pre-ordering the Surface Studio \nThe device may have taken years, and the input of dozens of designers and engineers, but the finished product is elegant in its simplicity. And that’s what’s likely to appeal to creative professionals the most. \n“We noticed that it doesn’t need to be overly complicated to be useful. Sometimes the simplest things end up being the things that you latch on to.”",

      "title": "Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member, Google joins .Net community",
      "text": "  \nMicrosoft’s annual Connect() developer conference is officially underway in New York City . At the event, Microsoft announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member and that Google has joined the independent .NET community. The announcements mark another one of Microsoft’s significant steps towards the goal of empowering the ecosystem by giving developers greater choice in the tools they use. \nSince Microsoft is a Platinum Member of the Linux Foundation, Microsoft’s customers will now benefit from increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem. Microsoft has already contributed to several Linux Foundation projects , including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative. According to VentureBeat , the Platinum level membership is the highest level, and will cost the company $500,000 annually. \nJohn Gossman, an architect on the Microsoft Azure team, will sit on the Linux Foundations Board of Directors and help underwrite projects on behalf of Microsoft. In a statement , Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie reflected on Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation: \n“The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community’s most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences… We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry’s shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice…By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we’re helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.” \nSimilarly, Jim Zemlin, the Executive Director of The Linux Foundation also reflected on Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation: \nMicrosoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology… The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions Microsoft loves Linux now more than ever \nIn other Connect() news, Microsoft also announced that the addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group. According to Microsoft, this “further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET.” \nUnder CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has increased its interests in open source projects and communities. Microsoft currently has many open source projects on GitHub, and even released the open source .NET Core 1.0 ; partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10 ; and after acquiring Xamarin, open sourced its software development kit .",

      "text": "  @11:45AM from the boom dept. Emil Protalinski, writing for VentureBeat: As part of its slew of announcements at its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft unveiled that Google is joining the .NET Foundation . Specifically, Google is becoming a member of the Technical Steering Group, which Microsoft says \"reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community\" and also underlines \"Google's commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET.\" [...] So what does Google joining actually mean? In short, Google will help steer the future of .NET in a way that is \"similar to an open standard,\" Xamarin cofounder and Microsoft's current vice president of mobile developer tools, Nat Friedman, told VentureBeat. Google's decision is being driven by its enterprise business (Google Cloud) and the desire to keep up with businesses adopting public and hybrid clouds. The company sees the move as part of its commitment to open-source technology, which benefits all enterprises, and cross-platform development that gives developers and IT professionals access to the best tools.",

Microsoft .NET Core 1.1 Brings Support For More Linux Distributions, Greater Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Microsoft on 16 November 2016 at 02:16 PM EST. 4 Comments Alongside the announcement of Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation , at Connect 2016 today they announced the public preview of SQL Server for Linux, which they originally announced earlier this year, and they also rolled out .NET Core 1.1. The .NET Core 1.1 release adds official support for Linux Mint 18 and openSUSE 42.1 when it comes to expanded distribution coverage. The .NET core has also been made faster through using Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO). They are building the Linux binaries with LLVM Clang and for the .NET Core 1.2 release they expect to use Clang PGO on that front. There are also 1,380 new APIs added to this core release.

      "title": "How to use the Xbox One controller on Windows 10",
      "text": "0 0 \nThe story about the integration of Windows 10 with Xbox One is well-known. Since Microsoft introduced the system in July 2015, the company has been trying to improve the cross-play features between two platforms. One of the earliest cross-platform possibilities available is the ability to use the Xbox One Controller on Windows 10 PCs. \nSo, if you own both platforms, you don’t need to spend extra cash on buying a new gamepad for your PC because you can just use the one for the Xbox One. There are a couple of ways to connect the Xbox One Controller to your Windows 10 PC and in this article, we’re going to show you all of them plus some additional information. How to connect the Xbox One Controller to Windows 10 Method 1 – Use the USB cable \nPerhaps the simplest way to connect the Xbox One Controller to your computer is by using the USB cable. Each Xbox One Controller comes with the USB cable which is primarily used for charging but can be used for PC integration, as well. \nSo, just plug the one end of the USB cable into your controller and the other end into your computer. The connection will be automatically established. Just like it’s the case with almost every other device you plug into your computer, the Xbox One Controller will automatically start charging while plugged in, as well. Method 2 – Use Wireless adapter \nAnother practical way to connect the Xbox One Controller to your computer is with the Wireless adapter . Some Xbox One Controllers come bundled with this device, but in most cases, you need to buy it separately. Bear in mind that Xbox 360 Wireless adapter won’t work with the Xbox One Controller. \nNow, just plug the Wireless adapter into any USB port on your computer. To establish the connection between two devices, do the following: Hold the Home button on your controller to turn it on. Now, press the button on the adapter. After that, press the bind button , located near the top of your controller Wait for the controller to establish the connection. The LED on the controller will blink while it searches for the Wireless Adapter. Method 3 – Use Bluetooth \nIf your computer supports Bluetooth , you can use this type of connection to connect the Xbox One Controller with your computer. However, this method is more demanding and slightly more complicated than the previous two. \nFirst thing first, you need to have the Anniversary Update for Windows 10 installed on your computer, because Microsoft introduced the ability to connect the Xbox Controller to Windows 10 with this update. Second, you must use the controller for Xbox One S . Of course, this controller comes bundled with the console, but you can also purchase it separately. \nOnce you’ve made sure you meet all requirements, here’s what you need to do to connect your Xbox One S Controller with Windows 10: Hold the Xbox One button to turn on your controller. Now, open the Settings app , and navigate to Devices > Bluetooth . Make sure you have the Bluetooth option enabled , by sliding it to On. Now press the bind button on your controller. Wait for the Xbox Wireless Controller will appear on the device listing. Now, jut click Pair to connect the two devices. \nThere you go, after performing this action, you’ll be able to use your Xbox One S Controller for playing games on your Windows 10 PC. Update Xbox One Controller drivers \nNo matter which method you’ve used to connect the Xbox One Controller to your Windows 10 PC , there’s one more thing you should do. You need to make sure that your Xbox One Controller drivers are up to date because updated drivers are required for your device to work properly. \nYou now know how to connect the Xbox One (S) Controller to your Windows 10 PC and how to make it work properly. We hope you’ll have a great time playing your games and we’re looking forward to seeing more amazing cross-platform features in Windows 10 and Xbox One from Microsoft in the future. \nIf you have any questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Microsoft releases latest pdate for Xbox One; New LFG, Clubs and more : US News : Latin Post",
      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nJust in time for the holidays! Microsoft pushed its latest update for the Xbox One on Thursday, as console deals start dropping for the next weekends. The main reason for the updates is to bring the LFG (looking for group) and Clubs into the Xbox One and Xbox Live to make it easier for users to connect with other gamers. \nAccording to The Verge , the feature has already been used for years to find and connect fellow gamers to play multiplayer and this feature has been rolling out into Xbox mobile app for Android, iOS, and windows 10. Now, the Microsoft is bringing its own take on Clubs and LFG to Xbox. It will let people find their fellow gamers to complete the quests and other activities by just posting on Xbox Live so it would be like a forum post that other people can filter to find and quickly start and play the game required. \nThere will be an updated gamerscore leaderboard that allows players to compare their progress with their friends on monthly basis. As it has reported by Inquisitr , the feature was proven useful for games like Rocket League, Battlefield 1, and Destiny. The LFG users can even set a time and date for when everyone in a group can get together to begin their favorite game. This is the very first opportunity for an in-console option though there are already much third-party mobile apps and websites that can do the same. Advertisement \nAlong with the LFG feature, Microsoft also rolling out the Clubs with the holiday update, it is designed for everyone to created their own on Xbox Live, and create unique names for the groups. Clubs is Microsoft's compelling version of clans, creating parties, sharing of game clips and a party chat may achieve a lot easier for people and group of friends that are interested in the same game. \n",

      "text": "Microsoft today announced that its Bing search engine now lets users save certain kinds of content to quickly access later. The feature is currently available on Bing on desktop and on the mobile web, where you can save and bring up images, videos, shopping search results, and places. \nSo long as you’re signed in, you can look through the things you’ve previously saved by going to bing.com/saves , or by clicking on the gear icon at the top of the page and selecting “My saves.” And if you’ve just saved something on desktop, you can easily get to everything else you’ve saved by clicking the “See all” link. From this new area, you can move items to other collections or delete them.\nThe launch comes after Google made it possible for users to save products and images from its search engine. \nBut this comes as companies begin to view search as a bigger entryway for commerce. When you use Bing image search for certain queries — like “thanksgiving decorations” you now see a button that says “See shopping results,” as the Bing team points out in a blog post . If you click the button, the layout changes, and you see prices, product descriptions, and the names of online retailers where you can buy these things. While you can click on these items and eventually buy them, you can also save them for later. Saving is just a part of the process.\nGoogle appears to be keen on going in a similar direction given its recent acquisition of Undecidable Labs . And of course Pinterest sees saving as being something you can do right alongside buying .\n",

      "text": "If you doubted Microsoft’s self-professed love for open-source software , here’s more evidence: the tech giant is joining the Linux Foundation.\nLinux is a popular open-source (a.k.a. freely available) operating system that many companies run in their data centers. It competes vigorously with Microsoft Windows Server.\nMicrosoft msft executive vice president Scott Guthrie announced the news on Wednesday morning at the Microsoft Connect conference for software developers in New York. Guthrie was joined on stage by Linux Foundation president Jim Zemlin.\nThe company also said that Google goog , a rival in cloud and applications, is joining the steering committee of the independent .NET Foundation which promotes the use of Microsoft’s .NET software development technologies. Other members include Samsung, Red Hat, and Microsoft itself. In September, Google announced tools to enable .NET developers to work with the Google Cloud Platform.\nThe fact that Microsoft is officially joining the Linux Foundation (as a highest tier Platinum member) is a big deal historically, says Holger Mueller, an analyst with Constellation Research. “Windows and Linux were archenemies in the Ballmer era,” he tells Fortune . “Now Microsoft runs Linux everywhere. The question is what took them so long.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.\nThe news is not as shocking as it would have been a few years ago. Steve Ballmer was Microsoft’s chief executive until two years ago. Current CEO Satya Nadella was named to replace him, and he has demonstrated a more open approach toward non-Microsoft technologies. Furthermore, Microsoft joined the Eclipse Foundation , another key open source organization, last March.\nFor more on Microsoft, watch\nMicrosoft is aware many corporate and other software developers love to work with Linux and want those workloads to run on the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft has also forged an alliance with Red Hat rht , which offers the flavor of Linux that most big companies run.\nNote: This story was updated to add details on Google joining the .NET effort.",

      "title": "15 classic Xbox games to celebrate 15 years of Xbox | JOE.co.uk",
      "text": "By Rich Cooper It's been 15 years since Microsoft decided to jump into the games console market with the Xbox. \nSince 2001, gamers have been split into two allegiances: are you PlayStation or Xbox? Sorry Nintendo, but this kind of isn't your arena anymore. To celebrate, we're looking back at 15 of the best games to hit the console. The Xbox might be looking slimmer these days, but let's not forget where it all started. 1. Ninja Gaiden \nA brilliant action-adventure game, with a near-perfect combat system and mega hard enemies, the combination of which makes for an extremely satisfying game - and there's plenty of blood and guts too. It's hard, but rewarding, and a hell of a lot of fun. Come on, you're playing a ninja, how could it not be? \n2. Project Gotham Racing 2 \nPGR2 wasn't about crash physics or over-complicated car technicalities - it was a pure driving arcade game. The Kudos system gave you extra things to consider when bombing it round the track - you still needed to win, but if you could pull off some cool drifts while you're winning, you were rewarded for your efforts. Advertisement \n3. Halo: Combat Evolved \nThough maybe not the best of the series, Halo: Combat Evolved did something that few shooters do: it redefined the genre. GoldenEye was once the standard for multiplayer shooters but Halo snatched the crown and ran with it. The depth of storytelling and use of vehicles were groundbreaking - remember the first time you drove a Warthog? You never forget. \n4. Read Dead Revolver \nWith Red Dead Redemption 2 now officially confirmed , we had to give a shoutout to the original. Red Dead Revolver was a very different game to it's successor: no open world gameplay, with more of the feel of an arcade platformer, and a story that was less engrossing than the tale of John Marston. That said, it was still a heck of a lot of fun, with enough OTT violence to keep any cowboy happy. \nAdvertisement 5. Fable \nIt was supposed to be the biggest RPG of its time, but what we got was actually just a very solid fantasy action-adventure game that posed a simple but important question: are you good or evil? Unlike a lot of RPGs, Fable was very straightforward and easy to get into, more about fun and adventure than relentless upgrades and tedious questing. \n6. Jet Set Radio Future \nThere aren't many games like Jet Set Radio Future - can you name another game about a gang of rollerblading graffiti artists taking on the police in Tokyo? Didn't think so. In the race for graphical realism, the anime-like cell-shaded graphics were a breath of fresh air, and the gameplay was so simple and enjoyable that you could sink hours into this game without ever realising. \n7. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Advertisement \nAfter the shitshows that were The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones , it was starting to look like Star Wars was a lost cause. Thank goodness for Knights of the Old Republic , then. Everything that was missing from the prequel movies - characters, story, conflict, interest, competence - could be found in KOTOR . One of the best RPGs ever. \n8. Halo 2 \nHalo: Combat Evolved took shooter campaigns to the next level, but Halo 2 made console online mulitplayer the new norm for gaming. The single-player cliffhanger ending was a bit of a kick in the balls, but Halo 2 really shone on Xbox Live, way before Battlefield and Call of Duty were the accepted faces of online FPS. No wonder it was the Xbox's biggest-selling game. \n9. Spider-Man 2 Advertisement \nWho didn't spend hours and hours swinging around NYC as Spidey? Like the film, Spider-Man 2 was a massive improvement on the first game, particularly the web-slinging gameplay which was just so ahead of its time. At the time, we'd never seen anything as huge as New York City in a game before, and flinging yourself around the place, beating up baddies, then flinging yourself around some more was just amazing (unlike The Amazing Spider-Man game, funnily enough). \n10. Beyond Good and Evil \nBeyond Good and Evil wasn't a smash hit, but everyone that owned it knew what a special game it was. It successfully managed to fuse different gameplay elements into a seamless whole - stealth, puzzles, dungeon exploration, RPG and combat all come together to make an interesting and unforgettable experience. \n11. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind \nTalk about games that you could lose your life to, the world of Morrowind was so huge that you could fall into it and not even realise a week has passed. We've seen Oblivion and Skyrim come and go, but Morrowind will always hold a special place in our hearts as the first Elder Scrolls game that we could plonk ourselves in front of the telly and lose ourselves in. Advertisement \n12. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas \nWhat needs to be said about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas ? Nothing. You know how good Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was. \n13. Jade Empire \nExploring the beautifully-realised Imperial China was one of the many joys of Jade Empire . The combat system was smooth and effective, the script was sharp and funny, the story had interesting twists and turns, and the world felt open and explorable (even though there wasn't that much to explore). Like a good martial arts film, Jade Empire was engaging, exciting and damn entertaining. \nAdvertisement 14. Panzer Dragoon: Orta \nWe don't really play rail shooters these days, but Panzer Dragoon: Orta was a unique and creative example of the genre. Unlike a lot of rail shooters, the story was actually rather affecting, and the design of the game was imaginative and frequently stunning. Plus, flying a dragon around blasting baddies (or are they baddies? Hmmmm...) is never a bad thing. \n15. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 \n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was the game that brought us the revert, and God bless us for it - combos were never the same again. And damn, that soundtrack - you can't hear CKY's '96 Quite Bitter Beings' without thinking of this game (though let's be honest, the only time you hear it is playing this game). \n",

      "text": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates New Delhi : Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation decision, Microsoft founder Bill Gates has said it is a \"bold move\" and will deflate India's shadow economy.\nDelivering the Second Transforming India Lecture organised NITI Aayog here on Wednesday, Gates said that shift to digital transactions will enhance transparency and reduce leakages.\nModi, in surprise decision on November 8, demonetised currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination, replacing them with new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 bills. \"The Prime Minister’s bold move to demonetise high-value denominations and replace with new notes with high security features is an important step to deflate India's shadow economy,\" Gates said.\nIndia, he added, \"has all the pieces in place for a compelling vision for digital financial inclusion. Aadhaar will convert a cumbersome, paper-based account opening process into a 30-second, all-digital system.\"\nHe was of the view that Aadhaar will also create a centralised data repository. The impending rollout of payment banks and the ubiquity of mobile phones can enable access for all Indians to digital accounts connected to a fraud-resistant interoperable payment system, he said.\nReferring to health issues in India, the Co-Chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said, \"If I had a wand and could fix one health issue in India, it would be the malnutrition crisis. There are states that have made great progress, but there also are regions where malnutrition is the norm, not the exception.\"\nObserving India has the largest number of stunted children in the world, he said, \"If (malnutrition) is unaddressed, the lifetime earnings potential of children who suffer from malnutrition will cost the Indian economy a staggering USD 46 billion by 2030.\"\nAbout 44 million children under the age of 5 are stunted, that is nearly four of every 10 children. Besides the huge toll this takes on children and their families, malnutrition takes a toll on the economy, he added.",

      "title": "Using Advanced Header and Footer Options in...",
      "text": "By James Marshall Updated October 17, 2016 . \nBy default, Microsoft Word inserts the same header and footer on all pages of a document. However, there are options for changing this. Word allows you to have different headers or footers for odd and even pages. Or you can have a different header and footer for the first page of a document.These options will suffice for most situations. However, you may want a single page in the middle of your document to have a different header or footer. Or, you may want a section of your document to have different headers and footers.You could split the document into several different files. But this creates problems with AutoText entries , particularly page numbering . Instead, you can create different sections in your document. You can insert headers and footers that differ from other sections.You can set up the sections before or after you begin inserting headers and footers. The Six Steps \n1. Position your cursor where you would like a new section to begin2. \ncontinue reading below our video Word Tutorial: How to Insert Headers and Footers From the File menu, select Page Setup 3.

      "title": "How to Work with Links in Microsoft Word",
      "text": "By James Marshall Updated December 05, 2015 . \nMicrosoft Word is primarily used for creating traditional word processing documents, but it also allows you to work with hyperlinks and HTML code used in websites. Hyperlinks are particularly useful to include in some documents, connecting to sources or additional information related to the document. \nWord's built-in tools making working with hyperlinks easy. Inserting Links \nIf you want to link to other documents or web pages from your Word document, you can do so quite easily. Follow these steps to insert a hyperlink in your Word document Select the text that you want to apply the hyperlink to. This can be the text of a URL , a single word, a phrase, a sentence and even a paragraph. Right-click the text and select Hyperlink... from the context menu. This opens the Insert Hyperlink window. In the \"Link to\" field, enter the URL address of the document or website you want to link to. For websites, the link must be preceded by \"http://\"The \"Display\" field will include the text you selected in step 1. You can change this text here if you like. \ncontinue reading below our video 9 Tips to Extend Your Phone's Battery Click Insert . \nYour selected text will now appear as a hyperlink that can be clicked to open the linked document or website. Removing Hyperlinks \nWhen you type a Web address in Word (also known as a URL), it automatically inserts a hyperlink connecting to the website. This is handy if you distribute documents electronically, but it can be a nuisance if you’re printing documents. \nFollow these steps to remove automatic hyperlinks: \nWord 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2016 Right-click on the linked text or URL. Click Remove Hyperlink in the context menu. \nWord 2008 and 2011 for Mac Right-click on the linked copy or URL. In the context menu, move your mouse down to Hyperlink . A secondary menu will slide out. Select Edit Hyperlink... At the bottom of the Edit Hyperlink window, click the Remove Link button. \nThe hyperlink is removed from the text. Editing Hyperlinks \nOnce you have inserted a hyperlink in a Word document, you may need to change it. You can edit the address and the display text for a link in a Word document. And it only takes a few simple steps. \nWord 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2016 Right-click on the linked text or URL. Click Edit Hyperlink... in the context menu. In the Edit Hyperlink window, you can make changes to the text of the link in the \"Text to display\" field. If you need to change the URL of the link itself, edit the URL displayed in the \"Address\" field. \nWord 2008 and 2011 for Mac \nFollow the Word 2008/2011 for Mac steps under Removing Hyperlinks to open the Edit Hyperlink window. You can make your edits there. More About Editing Hyperlinks \nWhen working with the Edit Hyperlink window, you will see several more features available: \nExisting File or Web Page: This tab is selected by default when you open the Edit Hyperlink window. This displays the text displayed for the hyperlink and the URL of that hyperlink. In the middle of the window you will see three tabs. Current Folder displays all files that are located in the same folder location as the current document. If you want to have the selected link you're editing link to a document located in this folder, simply locate the file and click on it. This will change the \"Address\" field to reflect the document location on your computer. The \"Text to display\" field will also change to the file address, so you may want to edit this field to change the text that will be displayed in the Word document. Browsed Pages shows a list of recent documents and Web pages you have accessed. You can select one of these as the new link destination. Recent Files displays a list of recent files you've worked on in Word. This is handy if you're working on a series of separate documents by letting you create links to them quickly. \nPage in This Document: This tab will display sections and bookmarks contained in your current document. Use this to link to specific locations within your current document. \nCreate New Document: This tab lets you create a new document to which your link will connect. This is useful if you're creating a series of documents but haven't yet created the document you want to link to. You can define the name of the new document in the labeled field. \nIf you don't want to edit the new document you create from here, click the radio button next to \"Edit the new document later.\" \nEmail Address: This lets you create a link that will generate a new email when the user clicks it and pre-populate several of the new email's fields. Enter the email address where you want the new email to be sent, and define the subject that should appear in the new email by filling in the appropriate fields. \nIf you have used this feature recently for other links, any email addresses you used in those will appear in the \"Recently used e-mail addresses\" box. These can be selected to quickly populate the address field. Turning Your Document into a Web Page \nWord is not the ideal program for formatting or creating Web pages; however, you can use Word to create a web page based on your document . \nThe resulting HTML document can have a lot of extraneous HTML tags that do little more than bloat your document. After you create the HTML document, learn how to remove extraneous tags from a Word HTML document .",

      "title": "Should You Upgrade to Microsoft Word 2013?",
      "text": "Word Processing Expert By Rebecca Johnson \nThat seems to be the question that I am hearing all the time! I have to ask you one simple question and then I will give you two very simple answers. Then I will explain the pros and cons of upgrading to Microsoft Word 2013. \nQuestion : Do you want to use a tablet for word processing? \nIf your answer is yes: Upgrade \nIf your answer is no: Don’t \nSee – I told you that it was simple! Now we will explore why. Why Upgrade? \nIf you own a tablet or are contemplating purchasing a touch-screen laptop, then Microsoft Word 2013 is the way to go. Why? Because this is the FIRST word processing software designed to be equally compatible between a touch screen and a keyboard. However, to take full advantage of this feature, you need to subscribe to Office 365, Microsoft Office’s Cloud environment, which is a smaller part of Microsoft’s SkyDrive. In simple terms, cloud computing means that you store your documents on a server on the Internet. That way, you can access them on any device simply by logging into the server. Most cloud services do require a subscription, and Office 2013, also sometimes called Office 365, is the same. For information on pricing, make sure to read Office 365 Subscription Prices . It looks like it will cost you about $100 per year, as an average home user, to subscribe to the cloud. Businesses can look at more substantive costs. \nBut you don’t need to subscribe to the cloud. You can purchase the desktop version and still benefit from Microsoft Word 2013. \ncontinue reading below our video Top Ways to Make Your Home \"Smarter\" How Did Microsoft make Microsoft Word better for touch screen users? \nMicrosoft really did a great job streamlining Office 2013. As a user, you can move seamlessly from your PC to your tablet or even your smart phone. You need to login to Microsoft’s Cloud to accomplish this, but there is a huge benefit in reviewing a document on your computer and then being able to pick up where you left off on your phone or tablet. \nMy first reaction to Office 2013 was that it was not as colorful. It seems like they took all of the extras, like color to the Ribbon, out. However, color really isn’t everything. The Ribbon is a familiar navigation tool for me. The first startup screen does not even resemble a traditional Word program, but after just a few clicks, it is intuitive. I will go out on a limb and say that the transition from Office 2010, even Office 2007, to Office 2013 will be easier to adapt to than the transition from Office 2003 to Office 2007. It is essentially the same environment with just a tweak or two to the look and feel. \nAlong with being able to use Microsoft Word with a touch screen, there are a couple of benefits that really stand out to me: \nBetter wrapping with Live Layout and Alignment Guides : with Word 2013, when you insert images, tables, Smart Art, and even videos, you have better control of the layout. Not only are Layout Options available to the right of the object, but there is a new feature called Live Layout. Other versions of Microsoft Word have similar features, but they are not as user friendly as Live Layout. With Word 2013, when you resize or move an object, the rest of the document automatically adjusted to the changes. Not only does it automatically adjust (which let’s be honest, it always has), it also gives you Alignment Guides! These guides are simply a line that you can use to make sure your objects are all aligned properly. \nResume Reading : I adore the concept of Resume Reading. I often leave the office with a document in the works; either I am writing a document or I am editing a document when I have to run off to my daughter’s basketball game or a meeting. This means I lose my train of thought with the document. However, with Resume Reading and a Cloud subscription, I can easily and seamlessly take the document with me. \nEasier Headers and Footers : I will be completely honest here. The Headers and Footers in Word 2010 really annoy me. I do not like having half a million, or even 30 different choices in style and look and feel. Generally, all I want to do is insert some basic information about the document. I used to be able to do this in older versions of Microsoft Word. It is amazing that they brought this feature back! \nI can now easily insert my document title, author, file name , and file path with just a couple of clicks of my mouse, or even better, taps of my finger! Things That Seem Cool But the Jury is Still Out \nThere are a few things that sound interesting, but I am not sure how useful they will be. I think these need a bit of time to see how useful they really are. \nEnhanced Reading With Read Mode : Another disclosure, I do not like the Reading Pane . I have never, ever used it with my computer. I disable it at every opportunity. However, Microsoft really enhanced this feature. If I only worked on my computer, I would still never use this feature. But now, I work on my computer, my tablet, and even my phone. This means that I might have to take another look at the Reading Pane, which has been retooled as Reading Mode . \nReading Mode will automatically resize the document area to fit the viewing screen. This means that I might have a document that is one page on my PC, and it will automatically be reformatted to four pages when I read it on my phone. Read Mode provides us with a nice, distraction free document environment. \nI can definitely see a use for this; however, I have yet to get excited about it. With that said, I am sure that a document will arrive via my Inbox any day now that will change my mind. \nInserting an Internet Video : Maybe it is the old-fashioned word processor in me that cringes when I read Video in the same sentence as Microsoft Word. Once again, this is a feature that I can see a use for, but it just doesn’t sit right. In my mind, videos belong in presentations, not Word documents. Ok, ok, call me old fashioned. If you want to imbed Internet videos into your Word documents, then you need to upgrade. \nPDF Reflow : My last ‘Jury is still out’ element is PDF Reflow. This could be because I use Adobe’s PDF Writer all the time. I also have always loved being able to transform a Word document into a PDF. But that is not what PDF Reflow does for us. Instead, PDF Reflow allows you to open a PDF document in your Microsoft Word program. However, not all of the PDF features are available, but PDFs do translate better into Word 2013 versus earlier versions of Word. Why Stick With a Prior Version? \nAs much as I love the new features of Word 2013 , if I did not subscribe to Microsoft’s Cloud, I would probably not upgrade. I could even be persuaded to upgrade if I used a tablet for heavy duty word processing. But if you do not subscribe to the cloud and you do not plan on using a tablet or a smart phone to work on word processing, then I would hold off on upgrading. What Do You Think? What are your thoughts on the latest release from Microsoft Office? Please share your reasons for staying or your reasons for going!",

      "title": "Russia officially blocks LinkedIn over data storage issues",
      "text": "  \nJust yesterday news broke that the EU had received commitments from Microsoft on their LinkedIn deal and that the EU set to rule on the merger by December 6th. Today more news has emerged on the LinkedIn front, but it’s not looking good for the now Microsoft-owned business and employment-oriented social networking service. After initially upholding a ban a week ago, Russia has officially blocked LinkedIn over data storage issues ( via TechCrunch ) \nThe block on LinkedIn will affect up to 5 million (of the total 467 million) users, and comes after the social networking service failed to transfer Russian user data to servers located in the country. Enforced by the Russian government’s communications agency Roskomnadzor, Russia recently passed legislation forcing online websites to have localized national servers in Russia, as a way to protect user’s personal information. LinkedIn, however, had tried to meet with Russian authorities on November 11th about the issue, but it would appear that the meeting never occurred. The social networking website issued the following statement in regards to the block: \n“LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for the entire global workforce. We are starting to hear from members in Russia that they can no longer access LinkedIn,” said a spokesperson. “Roskomnadzor’s action to block LinkedIn denies access to the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses. We remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request.” \nA statement seen in Russian on Rokomnadzor’s site reflects the Russian side of the Ban. Citing recent court decisions as reason for the ban, roughly translated, it reads: \n“On the basis of an enforceable court decision LinkedIn social network entered in the register of personal data subjects rights violations and seeks to lock operators. August 4 Tagansky District Court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor to social network LinkedIn for the rights of the general public – the personal data subjects. November 10 the Moscow City Court upheld the decision of the trial court.” \nIt’s not immediately clear why LinkedIn was targeted specifically in this case, or if an exception can be negotiated and applied, but other American websites have already complied to the Russian law. According to TechCrunch, Google and Apple have complied to the law, but Facebook and Twitter have yet to comply or put their data on Russian-based localized national servers. ISPs in Russia will also have to comply, and will have to block said websites without localized national data, or faced fines and blocks. \nWe will be following this situation closely, so be sure to stay tuned to WinBeta. As always, though, let us know what you think of this LinkedIn ban by dropping us a comment in the section  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Is Celebrating 15 Years Of Xbox",
      "text": "By Ryan Winslett 12 minutes ago \nHard to believe, but the Xbox has been with us for a full 15 years at this point, and the folks over at Microsoft are celebrating with a bunch of in-game giveaways. \nIf the Xbox brand was a person, it would be just one year away from earning its driver's license, and that's pretty impressive. Nobody knew quite what to expect when Microsoft came onto the scene with its massive console and equally massive controllers and, today, the Xbox continues to go toe-to-toe with industry mainstays like Nintendo and PlayStation. \nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, team Xbox has invited everyone to share their memories from the past 1.5 decades with the #15YearsOfXbox tag, so feel free to throw that around on social media when reminiscing about your first time playing Halo , Gears of War , Forza and the like. And speaking of trademark Xbox games, a selection of titles are offering free in-game goodies for folks to grab and utilize to show off their support of all things Xbox. \nFor starters, Forza Horizon 3 is giving everyone a 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor boasting a special skin featuring green and black paint and the Xbox 15 logo. If you're a Horizon VIP, you'll get an additional truck in honor of Xbox's big celebration, though no particulars were offered. \nAlso available for a limited time are a pair of Rivals events, one for Forza Motorsport 6 and the other for Forza Horizon 3 . Horizon will also have a special Bucket List Challenge available in the Pink Lakes area, so look for its Bucket List point and select \"Celebrate #15YearsOfXbox.\" \nThe original announcement states that more special offers are coming in more games, so we'll just have to sit tight and see what all becomes available in the coming weeks. Various members of Team Xbox will also be hosting events for players looking to dive into multiplayer with the creators, so keep your attention tuned to your favorite Xbox game's social media to see what/when things are going down. \nA lot can happen in 15 years. To drive that point home, Microsoft shared a whole bunch of stats concerning the Xbox brand, including an audience of 222,468,423 players. That's a lot of people getting mad at a lot of other people for using the Plasma Sword in Halo 2 competitive modes. Achievements have become a big part of the Xbox ecosystem, too, with a whopping 32,667,582,157 unlocked to date. Keep in mind that 'Chievos weren't even available on the original Xbox, so that's just two generations' worth of virtual trophies. Also, the highest Gamerscore at this point in time is 1,416,465 so, whoever you are, you just keep doing your thing. \nAnd now, we turn to our readers. What's your first Xbox memory? What's your best? Let us know in the comments below.  ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Is Joining the Linux Foundation \nIf you doubted Microsoft’s self-professed love for open-source software , here’s more evidence: the tech giant is joining the Linux Foundation. \nLinux is a popular open-source (a.k.a. freely available) operating system that many companies run in their data centers. It competes vigorously with Microsoft Windows Server. \nMicrosoft msft executive vice president Scott Guthrie announced the news on Wednesday morning at the Microsoft Connect conference for software developers in New York. Guthrie was joined on stage by Linux Foundation president Jim Zemlin. \nThe company also said that Google goog , a rival in cloud and applications, is joining the steering committee of the independent .NET Foundation which promotes the use of Microsoft’s .NET software development technologies. Other members include Samsung, Red Hat, and Microsoft itself. In September, Google announced tools to enable .NET developers to work with the Google Cloud Platform. \nThe fact that Microsoft is officially joining the Linux Foundation (as a highest tier Platinum member) is a big deal historically, says Holger Mueller, an analyst with Constellation Research. “Windows and Linux were archenemies in the Ballmer era,” he tells Fortune . “Now Microsoft runs Linux everywhere. The question is what took them so long.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s daily newsletter on the business of technology. \nThe news is not as shocking as it would have been a few years ago. Steve Ballmer was Microsoft’s chief executive until two years ago. Current CEO Satya Nadella was named to replace him, and he has demonstrated a more open approach toward non-Microsoft technologies. Furthermore, Microsoft joined the Eclipse Foundation , another key open source organization, last March. For more on Microsoft, watch \nMicrosoft is aware many corporate and other software developers love to work with Linux and want those workloads to run on the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft has also forged an alliance with Red Hat rht , which offers the flavor of Linux that most big companies run. \nNote: This story was updated to add details on Google joining the .NET effort.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today released Windows 10 Build 14971 to Insiders in the Fast Ring. The update isn’t major and it only brings some minor improvements. The usual bug fixes are still present, but it also includes a few known issues. Keep in mind that the latest build is only available for Mobile devices.\nFind the full changelog below:\nWHAT’S NEW \nWhat’s new Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge: The reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files – you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. You can download and read unprotected e-books from places like Feedbooks, Project Gutenberg, Free eBooks (requires sign-up), ePubBooks (requires sign-up), Open Library and even our own Microsoft Press. Try out reading an e-book in Microsoft Edge and let us know what you think!\nBringing 3D to Everyone via the Paint 3D Preview app: Starting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Opening Paint from Start will now take you to the Paint 3D Preview app. Please try it out and let us know what you think we should improve or add next! Currently, Paint 3D Preview is only available in English (aka, regardless of your display language, the text will be in English) – support for other languages will be coming soon. Remix 3D Preview, the community counterpart to Paint 3D Preview, is expanding to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland for Windows Insiders today! Remix 3D Preview is currently only available in English but we will continue to expand our region and language support. You can check it out at Remix3D.com and from within the Paint 3D Preview app.\nPowerShell in the Shell: In an effort to bring the best command line experiences to the forefront for all power users, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. Typing “cmd” (or “powershell”) in File Explorer’s address bar will remain a quick way to launch the command shell at that location. For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X” to “Off”.\nFun fact! It’s PowerShell’s 10 year anniversary this week. Hop over to Channel 9to see some of the videos we’ve been sharing about it. If you’re looking to learn more about unleashing the “power” in PowerShell, this page is a great resource.\nImproved Typing Experience with Japanese and Chinese Input Method Editors (IMEs) : This build includes many improvements in this space – here are some of the highlights:\nImproved Chinese IME reliability. In particular, we fixed an issue where the IME might crash due to an incompletely downloaded or corrupted dictionary file Improved Conversion Accuracy for the Japanese IME . We also fixed various issues, in particular, when conversion was used mixed with prediction, and an UX issue when trying to change phrase segmentation. Improved resource usage when typing with the Japanese IME . In particular, we fixed an issue that could result in unexpected graphic glitches after using the IME for an extended period of time. Get Office (Beta): We’ve heard your feedback about the Get Office app, and today we’re happy to announce Get Office version 2.0 for Insiders in the Fast ring! (Well, technically, version 17.7614.2377.0). Whereas before Get Office was largely a collection of links to help you get started with Office, the new and improved app will help you explore and manage your Office experience. Easily discover and launch apps and see all your recent Office documents in one place! We still have the familiar help links, but we’ve redesigned the experience to make easier to find what you’re looking for. As you try out the new app, please log feedback – we’d love to hear your thoughts!\nWHAT’S FIXED \nWhat’s fixed First introduced to Insiders in Build 14926, the experimental “Snooze” action on a tab in Microsoft Edge which provides you with a way to set a Cortana reminder on the website you are viewing is no longer available. Based on data we gathered and feedback we received, we decided to remove it from the product and re-evaluate the feature for a future release. The cursor will no longer be shown while inking – we believe this makes the experience feel even more like pen on paper. Try it out and let us know what you think! We’ve improved reliability when using the protractor and inking in Sketchpad. We’ve updated some of our desktop wizards (including “map a network drive” and “extract from zip”) to now be proportionally sized when moved across monitors. We fixed an issue where Magnifier’s keyboard shortcuts sometimes wouldn’t work on the Lock screen. We fixed an issue that could result in sometimes not being able to completely remove files in the Windows.old folder using Disk Cleanup. We have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a more secure experience in the Outlook Mail app. We fixed an issue where trying to shut down the PC while certain Device Manager dialog boxes were open would result in the PC being stuck at the “Restarting…” screen. We fixed an issue where, as closing multiple tabs with middle click in Microsoft Edge, the width of the tabs might change, resulting in potentially unexpectedly closing the wrong tab. We fixed an issue where the copy link option when right-clicking a hyperlink in Microsoft Edge wasn’t work. We fixed an issue where, if you changed the size of the Microsoft Edge window, and then closed the app by closing the final tab, the next time Microsoft Edge is launched it would once again be the default size, rather than retaining the preferred window size. We fixed an issue where pinned tabs in Microsoft Edge were not being restored. We’ve made a number of translation improvements, including for Chinese speakers fixing a translation error in the dialog that appears when installing multiple fonts at once, as well as one in Settings > System > Battery. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback – we’re listening! We fixed an issue where, if you already hand a notification expanded in the Action Center, clicking the chevron to expand a second notification would result in it expanding then immediately closing. We fixed an issue where preferred Start menu width might not be preserved after rebooting. WHAT’S BROKEN. \nWhat’s broken Navigating to Settings > System > Battery will crash the Settings app. Using keyboard monitor hotkeys to adjust brightness won’t work as expected. Desired brightness change could be done via the Action Center or by going to Settings > System > Display. Apps such as Store, Photos, and People may launch on their own after your PC has been inactive for a period of time. To stop these apps from launching on their own, un-maximize the app before closing it. As we have previously announced we are working on the Windows Holographic Shell that is going to be included in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. In today’s flight you will see the Windows Holographic First Run app. While you will be able to launch the app and walk through the first few screens, it won’t detect any hardware. This app and the Windows Holographic Shell is still under active development here at Microsoft and with our partners. \n",

      "text": "Women’s share of Microsoft jobs drops again   12:05 pm The latest data on the diversity of the Redmond software giant’s workforce, released Thursday, showed a second consecutive annual drop in the proportion of women employed by the company. Share story Seattle Times technology reporter \nAt Microsoft, about one out of every four employees is female. \nThe latest data on the diversity of the Redmond software giant’s workforce, released Thursday, showed a second consecutive annual drop in the proportion of women employed by the company. \nMicrosoft’s ranks were 25.8 percent female at the end of September, a decline of one percentage point from a year earlier. Two years ago, Microsoft was 29 percent female. \nMicrosoft attributes the decline to layoffs in units that Microsoft bought from Nokia in 2014 and spent much of the last three years dismantling . Nokia’s workforce, and particularly its manufacturing centers, employed a larger proportion of women than Microsoft units. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nThe report is the latest evidence of Microsoft’s struggles to broaden the makeup of its workforce, which doesn’t look much like society as a whole. Microsoft and other technology firms tend to be male-dominated and employ small percentages of African-Americans and Latinos. \nThose disparities are greater in technology-focused jobs and leadership positions; just three out of Microsoft’s 12 senior leaders are female. \nThe debate about inclusion in technology companies has taken on a civil rights dimension as the industry, an important source of high-paying jobs in a relatively slow-growing U.S. economy, gains clout. \nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson is on a multiyear advocacy campaign , pushing Microsoft and its peers in Silicon Valley to look harder for talented employees and disclose more about the makeup of their workforce. \n“This is a field that really gives you the power to change the world and the power to address societal challenges,” said Ed Lazowska, a longtime University of Washington computer science professor. “These are great jobs, and everybody should have them be available to them. In many ways this involves overcoming what had been kind of a boys club environment for many years.” \nComparing workforce statistics across companies can be misleading, given the differences in job categories, regions, and other factors, Lazowska said. \nBut Microsoft’s portion of female employees would seem to put the company at the back of the pack among technology giants. \nThe workforces of Facebook, Google and Apple are all more than 30 percent female, according to the most recent data from each company. \nThe decline in the portion of women at the Microsoft was disappointing, said Gwen Houston, the company’s director of diversity and inclusion. Still, she said there was a “glimmer of optimism” beyond the headline statistics, particularly in new hires. \nWomen represented 27.7 percent of employees hired in the last year, a higher percentage than the company’s current workforce. \nThe representation of black and Latino employees at Microsoft each ticked higher by tenths of a percentage point, to 3.7 percent, and 5.5 percent, respectively. Those figures were higher for employees hired in the last year, Houston said. \n“It’s about retention,” she said. “We can do all this great hiring but how do we hold onto that great talent?” \nThat effort includes ongoing employee training on unconscious bias, as well as career development programs focused on getting women and underrepresented groups in leadership roles, she said. \nRegardless of the company’s own programs, Microsoft is likely to report a gain in female representation next year. \nLinkedIn, the social networking firm Microsoft is trying to buy in a $26.2 billion deal , is 42 percent female.
