      "text": "Enlarge this image AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson (left) and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes are sworn Wednesday before testifying at a Senate committee hearing on the proposed merger of their companies. Evan Vucci/AP   Evan Vucci/AP AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson (left) and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes are sworn Wednesday before testifying at a Senate committee hearing on the proposed merger of their companies.\nEvan Vucci/AP When AT&T, a leading Internet provider, proposed a massive merger with Time Warner, a huge media conglomerate, the question many people asked was: Will I have to pay more for my TV?\nOn Wednesday, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee quizzed the CEOs of the two companies — over and over posing basically the same question: What will the $85.4 billion merger mean for the prices that consumers may have to pay?\nAT&T is the second-largest wireless Internet provider and one of the largest broadband Internet providers. It already owns satellite TV company DirecTV. With the Time Warner deal, AT&T would also own CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. studios and other media assets.\nIn response to concerns — including from the Republican chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah — AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson kept making the promise that the merger would actually result in more choices and lower prices.\nArticle continues after sponsorship All Tech Considered Big Media Companies And Their Many Brands — In One Chart \"I can and intend to represent to you,\" Stephenson told Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., \"that by virtue of innovation with Time Warner and going head-to-head against the cable providers with new products and new capabilities that we will bring the consumer better-priced options than we have today.\"\nThe proposed merger is facing a review from the Department of Justice, which will decide whether it violates antitrust law. In this case, AT&T and Time Warner argue their deal is in the clear because it's vertical, meaning the two companies don't directly compete and therefore their union wouldn't eliminate any competitor.\nTypically, the Federal Communications Commission would also review such a merger, sizing it up against a much broader standard of whether it's in the public interest. But the FCC's involvement in this merger is unclear — the agency wouldn't have direct oversight power if the deal did not involve FCC licenses issued to Time Warner, and AT&T has yet to reveal whether it will dump such licenses from the transaction.\nAll Tech Considered The AT&T-Time Warner Merger: What Are The Pros And Cons For Consumers? The trajectory of both regulatory bodies is also in the air as President-elect Donald Trump is shaping a new administration — and that could mean a more influential role for Congress during the leadership shift.\nTrump himself did weigh in on the proposed deal during the campaign , saying at a rally that AT&T's merger with Time Warner was \"a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nHis team hasn't spoken about the merger since the election and has not yet nominated the new Republican chief to the FCC. And so analysts and observers are not discounting the possibility that a more traditional Republican approach could prevail, paving the way for the merger with conditions.\nOn conditions, however, the shadow of Comcast's 2011 merger with NBCUniversal continues to loom over AT&T's proposed deal with Time Warner. That vertical merger was approved with numerous conditions, but consumer interest groups have criticized their effectiveness.\nThe Two-Way AT&T Reaches Deal To Buy Time Warner For More Than $85 Billion AT&T's Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes both pushed back against concerns that their merger would also open the door to self-dealing by the two companies, allowing them to shut out or overcharge competing video distributors.\n\"I can't see a case where that would make any sense at all,\" Bewkes said. He and Stephenson argued that such decisions wouldn't make for good business and could drive away customers.\nStephenson also pointed to the company's latest offering called DirecTV Now, which is taking on the cable companies by specifically targeting cord-cutters. It offers a lineup of cable TV streamed over the Internet for prices starting at $35 a month for 60 channels.\nBut Gene Kimmelman, the head of the Public Knowledge consumer advocacy group and a former antitrust lawyer at the Justice Department, argued that business incentives might change after a merger.\n\"The real fear is whether the combined company, once it looks at its overall interests, will favor itself and potentially harm competitors. So that's where the rub comes on the prices,\" he told lawmakers. \"They might offer a better price and they may offer it for some time, but in the long run will the competitive process be benefited? That's where I think the enforcers will need to look at.\"\nThe Two-Way TIMELINE: AT&T's Merger With Time Warner Follows Decades Of Industry Deals Politics Presidential Campaigns Blast AT&T-Time Warner Merger",

Panel looks at AT&T-Time Warner deal By Marcy Gordon • Associated Press 54 min ago ( … ) The Associated Press \nThis Oct. 17, 2012, file photo shows an AT&T logo on an AT&T Wireless retail store front in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) \nUpdated at 1:07 p.m. \nWASHINGTON • Senators questioning the logic of a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner turned their focus to the nickels and dimes of the issue, at least as to how the $85.4 billion mega-deal would affect Americans. OK, you say this huge merger will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay? \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, \"We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.\" He said, though, that it wasn't possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company's DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services. +3 \nIn this Tuesday, May 26, 2015 file photo, pedestrians walk by an entrance to the Time Warner Center in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) The Associated Press \nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson testified. \nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever. \n\"I have yet to be convinced\" that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes. \nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, said, \"The potential anti-competitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns. +3 \nIn this June 18, 2014, file photo, Jeffrey Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, attends the Cannes Lions 2014, (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File) The Associated Press \n\"There are too few players in these markets already. They are heavily concentrated,\" he told the panel. The concentration of market power could \"harm the democratic process\" as well as consumers' pocketbooks, Kimmelman warned. \nMark Cuban, the billionaire sports and media mogul who owns the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, played evangelist for the deal in a fast-moving world of media and entertainment content. Consider Facebook's mergers with WhatsApp, Snapchat and others, he testified: Those deals are driving innovation. Old media like Time Warner can't compete with the likes of Facebook if they can't merge. \nWhat about Trump's avowed opposition? \nStephenson says he's confident the merger will be approved despite the president-elect's objection.",

      "text": "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal Wednesday sided with President-elect Donald Trump in his skepticism about the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger. Trump — who pledged during the campaign that his administration would not approve the mega-deal because it concentrates too much power in one company — offered a \"classic antitrust analysis,\" Blumenthal said at a Senate Judiciary hearing examining the merger. \nStory Continued Below\n\"I may well agree with Donald Trump,\" the senator said.\nBut Blumenthal said Trump's position is partly based on his dislike of coverage by CNN — which is part of Time Warner — and warned about the dangers of government officials dictating news coverage. \n\"For a public official to use the blunt, heavy instrument of law enforcement to try to silence or change coverage in the news department of any company is for me, absolutely abhorrent — would you agree?\" he asked the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner.\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson called himself a \"political novice\" and said he's confident the Justice Department would review the transaction and determine whether it's competitive. \nBoth executives later responded \"yes, of course\" when Blumenthal asked them if they would commit that news coverage would not change due to pressure from Trump.\nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, without naming Trump, said rhetoric during the campaign may change post-election.\n\"There were comments made from candidates on all sides, saying they were against the merger, before any of them had information,\" Bewkes said. \"We’re confident that once everyone has the facts\" the deal will be seen as a good one, he said.",

      "title": "Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- 3rd Update",
      "text": "Shutterstock photo Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- 3rd Update\nBy John D. McKinnon\nU.S. senators on Wednesday raised new questions about AT&T Inc.'s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., suggesting the deal could face more pressure at a time of growing concentration in many businesses and an era of surging populism.\nLawmakers on the right and left raised concerns, some even suggesting the deal might simply be too big and complicated for the government to police.\nMr. Lee also worried that the government wouldn't have the legal ability to regulate large parts of the combined company because of antiquated laws.\nOthers suggested consumers could suffer new harms from the deal at a time when voters are showing their displeasure with big business as well as big government.\nThe November election was an \"outrage moment\" for people who are \"sick of getting pushed around,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the top Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee, following the hearing. \"We need to respond to that.\"\nShe suggested holding another hearing on the broader media environment, including other dominant players such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit and Facebook Inc.\nThe chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, however, pushed back hard, saying the combination of a top content creator with a leading media distribution company would foster innovation and competition, with direct benefits to consumers.\n\"They'll get more choices and lower-priced options,\" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told the senators. \"What this merger is not about is consolidation.\"\nThe deal would combine AT&T, which has millions of pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers, with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner includes HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus networks including CNN and TNT.\nThe AT&T-Time Warner deal is unusual, however, because President-elect Donald Trump criticized it on the campaign trail, and promised to block it.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) at Wednesday's hearing called it \"abhorrent\" that Mr. Trump would do so apparently because he dislikes the news coverage of CNN.\nSen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) raised questions about the merged company's ability to employ \"'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks.\" Mr. Grassley cited \"concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate,\" as well as \"concern about the merger's implications for a free and diverse press.\"\nStill, lawmakers generally stopped short of predicting the deal would go down, and AT&T and Time Warner officials were ready with answers.\nIt is the Justice Department that will ultimately decide whether to approve the deal, and senators will have no direct influence on that decision, though they are well positioned to publicly raise concerns.\nFor all the broader political landscape of rising populism, the deal's success could turn on a tricky call by enforcers on whether it is anticompetitive -- even though it is not a merger of two competitors, but rather a \"vertical\" merger of a company that creates content with one that distributes it.\nThe merger \"eliminates no competitor,\" Mr. Stephenson said Wednesday.\nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said the deal would allow the company to continue innovating in content as well as in consumer experiences, for example by adding more interactive features to video products.\nAT&T and Time Warner will have to apply to the Justice Department for an antitrust review, a process they say has already begun. Traditionally, telecom mergers also get Federal Communications Commission review because the agency must approve a transfer for airwave licenses. Time Warner's license holdings means the FCC should be involved, but the companies may be able to find a way to transfer the licenses to avoid an FCC review.\nWrite to John D.

      "text": "Enlarge this image AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson (left) and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes are sworn Wednesday before testifying at a Senate committee hearing on the proposed merger of their companies. Evan Vucci/AP   Evan Vucci/AP AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson (left) and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes are sworn Wednesday before testifying at a Senate committee hearing on the proposed merger of their companies.\nEvan Vucci/AP When AT&T, a leading Internet provider, proposed a massive merger with Time Warner, a huge media conglomerate, the question many people asked was: Will I have to pay more for my TV?\nOn Wednesday, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee quizzed the CEOs of the two companies — over and over posing basically the same question: What will the $85.4 billion merger mean for the prices that consumers may have to pay?\nAT&T is the second-largest wireless Internet provider and one of the largest broadband Internet providers. It already owns satellite TV company DirecTV. With the Time Warner deal, AT&T would also own CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. studios and other media assets.\nIn response to concerns — including from the Republican chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah — AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson kept making the promise that the merger would actually result in more choices and lower prices.\nArticle continues after sponsorship All Tech Considered Big Media Companies And Their Many Brands — In One Chart \"I can and intend to represent to you,\" Stephenson told Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., \"that by virtue of innovation with Time Warner and going head-to-head against the cable providers with new products and new capabilities that we will bring the consumer better-priced options than we have today.\"\nThe proposed merger is facing a review from the Department of Justice, which will decide whether it violates antitrust law. In this case, AT&T and Time Warner argue their deal is in the clear because it's vertical, meaning the two companies don't directly compete and therefore their union wouldn't eliminate any competitor.\nTypically, the Federal Communications Commission would also review such a merger, sizing it up against a much broader standard of whether it's in the public interest. But the FCC's involvement in this merger is unclear — the agency wouldn't have direct oversight power if the deal did not involve FCC licenses issued to Time Warner, and AT&T has yet to reveal whether it will dump such licenses from the transaction.\nAll Tech Considered The AT&T-Time Warner Merger: What Are The Pros And Cons For Consumers? The trajectory of both regulatory bodies is also in the air as President-elect Donald Trump is shaping a new administration — and that could mean a more influential role for Congress during the leadership shift.\nTrump himself did weigh in on the proposed deal during the campaign , saying at a rally that AT&T's merger with Time Warner was \"a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nHis team hasn't spoken about the merger since the election and has not yet nominated the new Republican chief to the FCC. And so analysts and observers are not discounting the possibility that a more traditional Republican approach could prevail, paving the way for the merger with conditions.\nOn conditions, however, the shadow of Comcast's 2011 merger with NBCUniversal continues to loom over AT&T's proposed deal with Time Warner. That vertical merger was approved with numerous conditions, but consumer interest groups have criticized their effectiveness.\nThe Two-Way AT&T Reaches Deal To Buy Time Warner For More Than $85 Billion AT&T's Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes both pushed back against concerns that their merger would also open the door to self-dealing by the two companies, allowing them to shut out or overcharge competing video distributors.\n\"I can't see a case where that would make any sense at all,\" Bewkes said. He and Stephenson argued that such decisions wouldn't make for good business and could drive away customers.\nStephenson also pointed to the company's latest offering called DirecTV Now, which is taking on the cable companies by specifically targeting cord-cutters. It offers a lineup of cable TV streamed over the Internet for prices starting at $35 a month for 60 channels.\nBut Gene Kimmelman, the head of the Public Knowledge consumer advocacy group and a former antitrust lawyer at the Justice Department, argued that business incentives might change after a merger.\n\"The real fear is whether the combined company, once it looks at its overall interests, will favor itself and potentially harm competitors. So that's where the rub comes on the prices,\" he told lawmakers. \"They might offer a better price and they may offer it for some time, but in the long run will the competitive process be benefited? That's where I think the enforcers will need to look at.\"\nThe Two-Way TIMELINE: AT&T's Merger With Time Warner Follows Decades Of Industry Deals Politics Presidential Campaigns Blast AT&T-Time Warner Merger",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray\nKicking off a day of testimony by AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) regarding their proposed combination, Mark Cuban , who once sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo! ( YHOO ) for a lot of money, told Congress why the deal should be allowed.\nCuban, reading from prepared remarks, painted for the Congress a picture of a media landscape dominated by a handful of big companies who control content today, chief among them Facebook ( FB ), but also Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , because they dominate the apps that people use to “avoid boredom.”\nCuban said that TV was always the dominant medium because it allowed people to avoid boredom “while pretending we were doing something.”\n“The idea TV is the dominant content delivery medium no longer is valid,” said Cuban.\nFacebook, and smartphone apps, and virtual reality platforms such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift headset, now offer consumers “any kind of content, in any manner the consumer would like to receive it,” better than television can do.\n“Facebook is in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for delivery of content.”\nCuban told congressmen to imagine what would have happened had Facebook not bought WhatsApp, Oculus, and Instagram. “The market would be far more competitive,” he concluded.\nIn addition, said Cuban, “ Snapchat is taking over millennials as the best alternative to boredom.”\nAmidst all this, “TV is losing viewers to other dominant content players,” he said, citing Apple, and Google’s YouTube . He made a point of noting that YouTube, for instance, was an “acquired property.” He also referred to Google’s search business as the “ultimate programming guide.”\nCuban said it was serious that there are “Two companies, Google and Apple, that are the sole gatekeepers to content.”\nHe then went on to say that “Neither AT&T nor Time Warner are “in any sort of dominant position,” and that “alone they will have a very difficult time controlling their destinies.”\n“We need more companies to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon ( AMZN ) and Facebook,” continued Cuban. “They have all established dominant positions, and that’s why this is an important, strategic content acquisition.”\n“Together, they will have a chance to battle the dominant players,” he concluded of AT&T and Time Warner.",

      "text": "Why Trump is critical of AT&T and Time Warner merger Former George W. Bush policy advisor Michael Barnes, FBN's Gerri Willis and Deke Digital CEO Dave Maney on Donald Trump's desire to keep jobs in the U.S. and why he is critical about the AT&T and Time Warner merger. \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson testified on Capitol Hill Tuesday, stumping for the proposed $85.4 billion merger between the two companies. \nContinue Reading Below \nDuring the hearing, Bewkes told lawmakers that the merger with AT&T would allow Time Warner to deliver “great consumer experiences.” \nHowever, while campaigning for president, Donald Trump said his administration would not approve the deal, saying it would be “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” \nFormer FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell joined the FOX Business Network’s Cavuto: Coast to Coast to weigh in. \n“It is a vertical merger. You’re not buying a competitor, and there are at least two giants in the cable space that have vertical integration. So Comcast with its purchase of NBC Universal… as well as Charter—Charter with its affiliation with Liberty and John Malone and all the content that they own.” \nMcDowell said there is a demand from consumers to have a “marriage between connectivity, or distribution, and content,” adding: \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \n“If you’re going to have a nationwide counterbalance to large cable companies that are vertically integrated, this makes a lot of sense. So I think this is more pro-competition than anti-competition. Merely the big getting bigger, as the President-elect said earlier in the campaign, is really not a legal basis to go to court to try to block a vertical deal. It’s just not going to work in court.” \nThe former FCC Commissioner also said he believes integration between mobility and content is “good for consumers,” and that there are ways customers can insulate themselves from “anti-competitive conduct.” \n“Consumers can then vote with their feet and go elsewhere, and so it’s still a competitive marketplace. You can fire a bad market actor,” McDowell explained. \nIf AT&T’s proposed purchase of Time Warner is passed, the former would own CNN, TNT, Warner Bros. movie studio, HBO, among other assets. What do you think? ",

Learn more... \nWed, Dec 7, 2016, 20:49 GMT - UK Markets closed AT&T defends Time Warner megadeal to skeptical lawmakers AFP – 1 hour 42 minutes ago View Photo \n\nAT&T (Sao Paolo: ATTB34.SA - news ) defended its $85 billion megadeal with Time Warner (Frankfurt: A0RGAY - news ) on Wednesday saying it would be \"pro-competitive,\" but lawmakers and consumer advocates expressed skepticism over the creation of new media-tech powerhouse. \n\"Our intent is to disrupt the existing pay TV model,\" AT&T chairman and chief executive Randall Stephenson told a Senate hearing on the merger of the huge telecom and broadband provider with the media-entertainment giant. \nThe deal would give consumers \"new lower-priced options and the power to decide themselves,\" he said. \nPresident-elect Trump, who has made public bargaining with major corporations a feature of his transition to the White House, said prior to his election that he opposed the pending merger, which was announced in October. But he has been mum since the election. \nIn public appearances this week, however, CEOs for both companies appeared upbeat about the prospects for approval from government regulators. \nIn his prepared statement to the Senate subcommittee, Stephenson said \"because this transaction will make us a more formidable competitor to cable, it's going to increase competition. In fact, it would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive.\" \nHe said the two firms, with no overlap in their services, would make it easier to offer innovative content and distribution in an era facing disruption from online services such as Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) and Amazon. \nBut senators on a Senate Judiciary Committee panel on antitrust and competition policy expressed concern the deal could concentrate too much power in one firm. \nSubcommittee chairman Senator Mike Lee said the deal raises questions about \"all sorts of anticompetitive abuses.\" \nLee said AT&T (Swiss: T-USD.SW - news ) \"could increase the price or reduce access to Time Warner content\" if it holds a dominant position as both a pay-TV and content provider. \nAnd Senator Chuck Grassley said he worries \"that a combined company will give preferential treatment -- for example, favorable channel placement and zero-rating pricing -- to Time Warner's premium entertainment programming to the disadvantage of other content producers. \n\"There's concern about the merged company?s ability to employ 'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks. There?s concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate, resulting in higher prices and fewer programming options for consumers,\" Grassley said. \n- Tech industry 'gatekeepers' - \nBillionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, chairman of the cable network AXS, told the hearing he favored the merger because it would create an entity sizeable enough to compete with tech industry giants who are now the \"gatekeepers\" for content on the internet, where users increasingly prefer to watch movies and shows over traditional cable television. \n\"We need more companies with the ability to compete with Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , Google, Microsoft (Euronext: MSF.NX - news ) , Amazon and Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) ,\" Cuban said. \nHowever, Gene Kimmelman of the consumer group Public Knowledge warned that allowing the deal to proceed would likely mean \"higher costs and fewer choices for video services, and lower-quality and less diverse programming.\" \nKimmelman said it remains unclear how such a deal would impact emerging giants in video like Netflix. \n\"If a single company is able to control many of the key inputs to online video, from content production to last-mile transmission, then the competitive promise of this new market could be snuffed out, or at least limited,\" Kimmelman said.

      "text": "  If Trump's Really A Populist, He'll Fight Against The Destructive AT&T-Time Warner Merger Dec 7, 2016 3:45 PM 0 \nSubmitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog, \nDangerous consolidation of the media is a trend that has been discussed by many people on many occasions, and many of us by now have heard the stat that in the U.S. just six media giants control 90% of all TV, news, radio and film. Now that Comcast is set to buy Time Warner, the situation is about to get that much worse. \n\nMany people write about the struggle between “liberty” and “tyranny,” including myself, but these may not be the most effective terms to use in order to explain the troubling situation we face to a wider audience. Unfortunately, when people hear the words “liberty” the knee-jerk reaction for many is to associate it with right-wing “conspiracy theorists.” Of course, it is “conspiracy fact” that a small handful of corporations and the executives that run them control more and more of our daily lives. In other words, the forces of “tyranny” use “centralization” as their primary weapon of choice in order to control us. Those of us who long for “freedom” and “liberty” must use “decentralization” as our primary tool to fight back and win. \n\n– From the 2014 post: The Comcast/Time Warner Merger and the War Between Centralization and Decentralization \nForget the Carrier deal, and forget the infamous tweet recently directed at Boeing. If Trump is serious about protecting the American public and being the populist leader he claimed he would be , he will aggressively push back against the proposed AT&T-Time Warner mega merger. \nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump appeared to take a strong stance against a deal that would further consolidate an already grotesquely consolidated media and telecom environment, but concerns have arisen as of late that point to a contradictory position. \nAs Fortune recently reported: \nDuring his campaign for President, Donald Trump declared that he would not approve a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner on the grounds the deal represented “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” But as with so much else when it comes to Trump, it appears that vow is negotiable. \n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s transition team assured AT&T they would review the deal with an open mind, and that company executives came away confident that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny. \nIf this is indeed the case, Trump supporters should see it as a massive betrayal, as well as a sign that Trump, like his predecessors, will rule on behalf of the status quo elites when it comes to the truly big policy decisions. \nFor a little background of why this particular merger is so detrimental to American consumers, let’s take a look at the statement prepared by Sen. Patrick Leahy’s office ahead of today’s hearing on “Examining the Competitive Impact of the AT&T-Time Warner Transaction.” \nToday, the Judiciary Committee examines the competitive impact of AT&T Inc.’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The proposed $85.4 billion merger could dramatically transform our nation’s telecommunications and media landscape, combining two titans of industry. AT&T is the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, largest pay-television provider, and third-largest broadband provider, while Time Warner is a massive media conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. Studio. This proposed massive consolidation of distribution and content raises serious questions. The impact of this transaction on competition, consumer choice, and privacy across the media, pay TV, wireless and broadband industries must be carefully analyzed. \n\nToday’s hearing is a crucial conversation about looming concentration in industries that create and distribute the media that millions of Americans consume every day. Americans are consuming media content in increasingly fragmented ways – on their smart phones and ipads, not just on their televisions. At the same time, the distributors and producers of this content are rapidly consolidating. Given that Americans depend upon these companies to learn about and stay connected to the world around them, it is critically important to preserve affordable access to a diversity of views and ideas. This proposed merger raises serious questions about this prospect and we must carefully consider whether it will benefit consumers in Vermont and across America. \n\nMore than 130 million Americans depend upon AT&T for their wireless internet access. Last year, AT&T acquired DirecTV’s satellite television service. AT&T is now trying to acquire Time Warner’s content. These acquisitions raise serious concerns about whether AT&T could begin to act as a biased gatekeeper for its own affiliated content and services. Questions are already being raised about AT&T’s decision to not charge its wireless customers for data used to view DirecTV on their phones. Anti-competitive and anti-consumer actions by Internet gatekeepers can be prevented under the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet rules. Those rules establish clear and enforceable bright-line prohibitions on blocking, throttling and discriminating against lawful content on the Internet. Meaningful net neutrality protections ensure that the Internet remains an open platform that fosters innovation and free speech. \n\nStrong net neutrality rules help mitigate concerns about a post-merger AT&T’s ability to harm competitors and consumers. Yet these very net neutrality rules that currently protect consumers appear to be under serious threat by the incoming administration. President-elect Donald Trump has been openly opposed to net neutrality. He has formally named three staunch net neutrality opponents to oversee his FCC transition. Any weakening of these rules will cause serious harm to consumers – harm that could be exacerbated by further mergers in this industry. That harm is not limited to this transaction, but would impact all Americans who rely on the free exchange of ideas and information on the Internet. \n\nOver the past few years, at every hearing held by the Judiciary Committee to discuss a proposed transaction we have heard the same buzzwords used to justify further consolidation. These buzzwords are used in industries as different as beer, health insurance, agricultural seeds, or pay- television. We have heard about the vertical integration of complementary portfolios. We have heard about how there will be no further reduction in competition. We have heard that further consolidation is needed to compete with some other entity not involved in the transaction. We have heard about increased innovation achieved through cost savings. We have heard that the merged companies will retain every incentive to serve consumers well. I have no doubt we will hear many of those same arguments today. \n\nWhile massive corporations continue to forcefully defend these claims in service of their bottom line, the American people are facing an economy that is increasingly defined by a small number of dominant corporations and a shrinking number of small, independent competitors. I am deeply skeptical that this highly-consolidated economy is leading to better results for consumers in Vermont and across the country. \n\nEven President-elect Trump has noted the downsides of this major movement towards consolidation when he shared his opinion on the campaign trail that this transaction is “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Mr. Trump even went so far as to say his administration would not approve the transaction. Now, in a sudden shift of tone, press reports suggest that the merging parties are being told by members of Mr. Trump’s transition team that the transaction has a good chance of being approved. \n\nWhether or not this transaction and others in the future are ultimately approved will rest with the antitrust authorities, including the people Mr. Trump nominates to positions at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission. As he makes those selections, as the Senate considers the nominees he selects, and as those people go about their jobs if they are confirmed, we must all recommit ourselves to protecting the hallmark principle of the American economy – competition. \n\nI thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Lee for holding this hearing today and looking forward to the testimony of the witnesses. \nWith all that in mind, I want to turn your attention to a few excerpts from an excellent post published late last month titled, Net Neutrality Shouldn’t be a Debate – It’s a Symptom of Something Worse: Gatekeepers : \nNet neutrality should not even be a debate. Any market actor who abuses their customers and trust to the level of not respecting net neutrality, on a functioning market, will be dropped like a bad habit. Therefore, the mere existence of a net neutrality debate is a symptom of something much worse: the existence of gatekeepers. That’s the underlying problem that needs to be solved. \n\nA politician who trusts the telco industry or the cable industry to roll out the Internet needs to have their brain examined. These two industries will be obliterated when every household has good fiber, and they’re trying to delay that point in time for as long as they can possibly get away with: it’s in the strategic interest of both telco and cable industries to obstruct Internet rollout for as long as is possible. \n\nPonder this: the telco industry wants to charge me by the minute, plus a fixed monthly fee, for usage of a 9.6-kilobit connection to my home that can only be used for their voice application. How does this compare to having a monthly fee in the same ballpark for an unmetered, fixed fee, general purpose, 100-megabit connection to my home, that I can use for anything I want as much as I want? Why would I ever look toward the old telcos again? The telcos are just dead in the water, and they know it. (By the way, sending a text message next door is literally more expensive than sending the same data from Mars, because the telcos are charging a fifteen billion per cent markup.) \n\nThis doesn’t even begin to describe how utterly destroyed the cable industry is. On YouTube alone, people upload 300 hours of video per minute – put differently, YouTube alone serves the equivalent of 18,000 (eighteen thousand!) 24-by-7 TV channels. Granted, most of these are utter crap, so it’s exactly like the cable networks. The Internet has practically already obliterated the cable TV industry, and their only hope is to destroy, delay, and/or obstruct the Internet to milk the last drops of money from an old world that no longer exists. \nIndeed, it seems this is the actual intent of AT&T and Time Warner executives with the proposed merger. They want to “milk the last drops of money from an old world that no longer exists.” As is typically the case, the people who will be harmed most by this will be average American citizens. As such, if Trump is truly a populist, he will stand strongly against the deal. If he doesn’t, it will only raise further concerns about where his real loyalties lie.",

(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. Check CLUE insurance claim database for red flags before buying home \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. Pearl Harbor survivors: War is hell, 75 years later \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/2gTpvDl TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nWASHINGTON - AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson defended his company's proposed megamerger with Time Warner against a wide array of concerns Wednesday, including some that came from business-friendly Republicans in Congress. \nSpeaking before a Senate subcommittee on antitrust issues, the telecom giant's boss touted the $108 billion deal as a way to \"disrupt the entrenched pay-TV model.\" He disputed worries about overconcentration, saying the merger is not about \"consolidation, either in media or in telecom.\" \nAnd he promised -- time and again -- that consumers would see that the \"benefits are straightforward and substantial.\" How to talk about the AT&T, Time Warner deal like an insider \n\"We want to get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices,\" Stephenson said. \nThe hearing was Congress' first swipe at assessing the proposed merger, which would have broad implications for the media and telecom world. The deal would pair Dallas-based AT&T's phone and broadband service with prized Time Warner content like CNN and HBO. \nThough lawmakers have little say in whether Department of Justice regulators will approve the deal, they could sway public opinion . \nStephenson and Time Warner chief executive Jeffrey Bewkes were joined at the hearing by a panel that included Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, a media maven who defended the merger. But the two executives - and Stephenson, in particular - were the focus. \nAnd looming over the proceedings were the mixed signals sent by President-elect Donald Trump over the merger. \nThat fact wasn't ignored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who pointed out that Trump said on the campaign trail that he would block the merger . Though the billionaire has since taken steps that point to a change in heart , Blumenthal said he takes Trump \"at his word.\" \nHe placed Trump's worry about \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few\" before the AT&T chief.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) AP \n\"I'm a novice of the world of politics,\" Stephenson responded, adding that he had not met with Trump's transition team. \"We believe the facts are going to be very compelling and very good. This is pro-competive and pro-consumer. So I'll leave it at.\" \nStephenson again avoided addressing Trump in brief comments to reporters after the hearing, saying that AT&T is anxious to put the merger \"in front of the Department of Justice.\" And asked if anyone at the telecom company had spoken to Trump's transition team, he demurred. \n\"I have no idea,\" he said. \nDemocrats charted an aggressive course, often circling back to the notion that the deal's size and scope could actually result in higher prices and fewer options for consumers. To make their case, they leaned on the testimony of Gene Kimmelman of the consumer watchdog Public Knowledge. \n\"This is not just about money,\" he said. \"It is the diversity of programming owned by different people over different platforms that fuels our democracy.\" \nBut tough questions were also raised by some GOP senators, who were nonetheless careful to couch most of the concerns as coming from critics. \nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee, the subcommittee's chairman, noted that \"critics say that all kinds of competitive abuses might occur.\" And he made a point to bring up AT&T's use of \"zero rating,\" the waiving of data charges for AT&T wireless customers who stream from its TV apps. \n\"The potential anti-competitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well,\" he said. Mark Cuban: Trump is \"our No. 1 draft pick\" \nSenate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, likewise ran through some of the complaints. \n\"There is concern about the merged company's ability to employ bully tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks,\" he said. \"There's concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate.\" \nBut Grassley also said that policymakers also shouldn't \"stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand.\" And Republicans such as Sen. David Perdue of Georgia took a more conventional view of the merger. \n\"The consumer has benefited from the aggregation,\" Perdue said, before citing AT&T's stated desire to provide more content at a lower price. \"That's called capitalism.\" \nStephenson also came ready to offer assurance on all points. \nHe pledged that the merged company would \"not withhold content to disadvantage someone else.\" He promised to protect CNN's editorial independence, saying that \"the purpose of a news agency is to provide objective coverage of the news.\" \nAnd he remained steadfast that the deal would lower prices for consumers. \n\"The lower prices would be the result of the innovation would follow,\" he said. \nTo hammer home his point, the AT&T chief offered up the example of DirecTV Now, the company's new internet TV service. He said the service has \"exceeded all expectations and as predicted the industry has already begun responding.\" \n\"Innovation by one invariably begets innovation by all,\" Stephenson said.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, sought assurances from the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner Wednesday that a proposed merger of the two companies will not increase consumer cable, internet and wireless bills.\nAt a two-and-a-half-hour hearing, Klobuchar, Franken and others questioned AT&T chief Randall Stephenson and Time Warner chief Jeffrey Bewkes about why marrying one of the country's biggest internet, cable and wireless providers with one of the country's biggest sources of movies, shows and news would not end in restrictions or charges that would drive up bills for customers and competing companies.\n\"We have seen this plot before,\" Klobuchar said. \"Like a tired movie franchise, we can predict the ending before it begins. The promise of thriving competition collapses, replaced by dominant firms with monopoly power.\"\nBoth executives pledged under oath that they would not favor their own distribution platforms over others who wanted to distribute their entertainment and news products. They also said they expected the merger to reduce prices.\nAT&T has 15.6 million internet connections, 45.5 million video connections, most through Direct TV, and 141.8 million wireless connections in the U.S. and Mexico. Time Warner owns CNN, HBO, Warner films and Turner Broadcasting. Consolidation would create a company with a huge hold on distribution and content. But executives offered a new Direct TV Go product that provides a 100-channel package for $35 a month as proof of their intent to drive down prices.\nKlobuchar questioned whether that charge would go up once the merged company controlled much of the market. She pointed to a new study by Consumer Federation of America that showed the \"typical\" American household now includes two cellphones, one landline, a broadband connection and a multichannel video service costing about $2,700 per year. The study estimated even before the proposed merger, earlier consolidation in the market was already costing consumers $45 per month more than they should pay.\nFranken bored in on the fact that the proposed merger has been submitted for antitrust vetting by the Justice Department, but has not yet been sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) where the companies would have to prove that the deal would benefit consumers in order to have it approved.\nNot ensuring consumer benefits \"sends a bad message to Americans,\" Franken said.\nThe deal got a thumbs-up from another hearing participant, Mark Cuban, who owns an independent film company and TV network, as well as a string of movie theaters. Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team and a regular on the hit entrepreneurial business show \"Shark Tank,\" said a merger of AT&T and Time Warner was less of a monopoly threat than existing mega-distributors Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple.\nThe $85 billion merger attracted the ire of President-elect Donald Trump when he was campaigning. Trump promised to block the merger because the company it created was too big. But Judiciary Committee member Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) worried that Trump may exact compromises in news coverage by CNN in exchange for approving the merger. Bewkes promised that CNN will remain an independent source of journalism.\nMuch of the hearing focused on the wireless platforms where video content is increasingly distributed. Stephenson and Bewkes said the AT&T-Time Warner merger aims to let customers pay once for content that can be viewed on several kinds of platforms, including new 5G wireless devices. Both executives said the new company would disrupt the market in ways that create competition and lower prices and that competing distribution networks would have access to content under the same terms as AT&T.\nBut independent network executive and filmmaker Daphna Ziman warned that the merger would make it harder for women and minorities to find places to broadcast their shows and movies.\nGene Kimmelman, CEO of Public Knowledge, a group promoting open internet and consumers rights, said a smaller merger of Comcast and NBC Universal had not produced lower prices for consumers and had led to court battles over discriminatory placement of shows. Kimmelman said that unless AT&T and Time Warner can show that their merger will do neither of these things, the government should reject it.\n\"We created a record for the Justice Department and the public,\" Klobuchar said after the hearing. \"We would hope that [AT&T and Time Warner] would also submit to the FCC.\"",

      "text": "Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog,\n\n\n\n*Dangerous consolidation of the media is a trend that has been discussed by many people on many occasions, and many of us by now have heard the stat that in the U.S. just six media giants control 90% of all TV, news, radio and film. Now that Comcast is set to buy Time Warner , the situation is about to get that much worse.*\n\n\n*Many people write about the struggle between “liberty” and “tyranny,” including myself, but these may not be the most effective terms to use in order to explain the troubling situation we face to a wider audience. Unfortunately, when people hear the words “liberty” the knee-jerk reaction for many is to associate it with right-wing “conspiracy theorists.” Of course, it is “conspiracy fact” that a small handful of corporations and the executives that run them control more and more of our daily lives. In other words, the forces of “tyranny” use “centralization” as their primary weapon of choice in order to control us. Those of us who long for “freedom” and “liberty” must use “decentralization” as our primary tool to fight back and win.*\n\n\n– From the 2014 post: *The Comcast/Time Warner Merger and the War Between Centralization and Decentralization*\n\n\n\n*Forget the Carrier deal ,* and forget the infamous tweet recently directed at Boeing. *If Trump is serious about protecting the American public and being the populist leader he claimed he would be*, he will aggressively push back against the proposed AT&T-Time Warner mega merger.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump appeared to take a strong stance against a deal that would further consolidate an already grotesquely consolidated media and telecom environment, but concerns have arisen as of late that point to a contradictory position.\n\nAs Fortune recently reported:\n\n\n\n*During his campaign for President, Donald Trump declared that he would not approve a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner on the grounds the deal represented “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” But as with so much else when it comes to Trump, it appears that vow is negotiable.*\n\n\n*On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s transition team assured AT&T they would review the deal with an open mind, and that company executives came away confident that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny.*\n\n\n\nIf this is indeed the case, Trump supporters should see it as a massive betrayal, as well as a sign that Trump, like his predecessors, will rule on behalf of the status quo elites when it comes to the truly big policy decisions.\n\nFor a little background of why this particular merger is so detrimental to American consumers, let’s take a look at the statement prepared by Sen. Patrick Leahy’s office ahead of today’s hearing on “Examining the Competitive Impact of the AT&T-Time Warner Transaction.”\n\n\n\nToday, the Judiciary Committee examines the competitive impact of AT&T Inc.’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The proposed $85.4 billion merger could dramatically transform our nation’s telecommunications and media landscape, combining two titans of industry. AT&T is the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, largest pay-television provider, and third-largest broadband provider, while Time Warner is a massive media conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. Studio. This proposed massive consolidation of distribution and content raises serious questions. The impact of this transaction on competition, consumer choice, and privacy across the media, pay TV, wireless and broadband industries must be carefully analyzed.\n\n\nToday’s hearing is a crucial conversation about looming concentration in industries that create and distribute the media that millions of Americans consume every day. Americans are consuming media content in increasingly fragmented ways – on their smart phones and ipads, not just on their televisions. At the same time, the distributors and producers of this content are rapidly consolidating. *Given that Americans depend upon these companies to learn about and stay connected to the world around them, it is critically important to preserve affordable access to a diversity of views and ideas. This proposed merger raises serious questions about this prospect and we must carefully consider whether it will benefit consumers in Vermont and across America.*\n\n\nMore than 130 million Americans depend upon AT&T for their wireless internet access. Last year, AT&T acquired DirecTV’s satellite television service. AT&T is now trying to acquire Time Warner’s content. These acquisitions raise serious concerns about whether AT&T could begin to act as a biased gatekeeper for its own affiliated content and services. *Questions are already being raised about AT&T’s decision to not charge its wireless customers for data used to view DirecTV on their phones.* Anti-competitive and anti-consumer actions by Internet gatekeepers can be prevented under the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet rules. Those rules establish clear and enforceable bright-line prohibitions on blocking, throttling and discriminating against lawful content on the Internet. Meaningful net neutrality protections ensure that the Internet remains an open platform that fosters innovation and free speech.\n\n\nStrong net neutrality rules help mitigate concerns about a post-merger AT&T’s ability to harm competitors and consumers. Yet these very net neutrality rules that currently protect consumers appear to be under serious threat by the incoming administration. *President-elect Donald Trump has been openly opposed to net neutrality. He has formally named three staunch net neutrality opponents to oversee his FCC transition. *Any weakening of these rules will cause serious harm to consumers – harm that could be exacerbated by further mergers in this industry. That harm is not limited to this transaction, but would impact all Americans who rely on the free exchange of ideas and information on the Internet.\n\n\nOver the past few years, at every hearing held by the Judiciary Committee to discuss a proposed transaction we have heard the same buzzwords used to justify further consolidation. These buzzwords are used in industries as different as beer, health insurance, agricultural seeds, or pay- television. We have heard about the vertical integration of complementary portfolios. We have heard about how there will be no further reduction in competition. We have heard that further consolidation is needed to compete with some other entity not involved in the transaction. We have heard about increased innovation achieved through cost savings. We have heard that the merged companies will retain every incentive to serve consumers well. I have no doubt we will hear many of those same arguments today.\n\n\n*While massive corporations continue to forcefully defend these claims in service of their bottom line, the American people are facing an economy that is increasingly defined by a small number of dominant corporations and a shrinking number of small, independent competitors. I am deeply skeptical that this highly-consolidated economy is leading to better results for consumers in Vermont and across the country.*\n\n\nEven President-elect Trump has noted the downsides of this major movement towards consolidation when he shared his opinion on the campaign trail that this transaction is “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Mr. Trump even went so far as to say his administration would not approve the transaction. *Now, in a sudden shift of tone, press reports suggest that the merging parties are being told by members of Mr. Trump’s transition team that the transaction has a good chance of being approved.*\n\n\nWhether or not this transaction and others in the future are ultimately approved will rest with the antitrust authorities, including the people Mr. Trump nominates to positions at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission. As he makes those selections, as the Senate considers the nominees he selects, and as those people go about their jobs if they are confirmed, we must all recommit ourselves to protecting the hallmark principle of the American economy – competition.\n\n\nI thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Lee for holding this hearing today and looking forward to the testimony of the witnesses.\n\n\n\nWith all that in mind, I want to turn your attention to a few excerpts from an excellent post published late last month titled, Net Neutrality Shouldn’t be a Debate – It’s a Symptom of Something Worse: Gatekeepers:\n\n\n\n*Net neutrality should not even be a debate. Any market actor who abuses their customers and trust to the level of not respecting net neutrality, on a functioning market, will be dropped like a bad habit. Therefore, the mere existence of a net neutrality debate is a symptom of something much worse: the existence of gatekeepers. That’s the underlying problem that needs to be solved.*\n\n\nA politician who trusts the telco industry or the cable industry to roll out the Internet needs to have their brain examined. These two industries will be obliterated when every household has good fiber, and they’re trying to delay that point in time for as long as they can possibly get away with: it’s in the strategic interest of both telco and cable industries to obstruct Internet rollout for as long as is possible.\n\n\nPonder this: the telco industry wants to charge me by the minute, plus a fixed monthly fee, for usage of a 9.6-kilobit connection to my home that can only be used for their voice application. How does this compare to having a monthly fee in the same ballpark for an unmetered, fixed fee, general purpose, 100-megabit connection to my home, that I can use for anything I want as much as I want? Why would I ever look toward the old telcos again? The telcos are just dead in the water, and they know it. (By the way, sending a text message next door is literally more expensive than sending the same data from Mars, because the telcos are charging a fifteen billion per cent markup.)\n\n\nThis doesn’t even begin to describe how utterly destroyed the cable industry is. On YouTube alone, people upload 300 hours of video per minute – put differently, YouTube alone serves the equivalent of 18,000 (eighteen thousand!) 24-by-7 TV channels. Granted, most of these are utter crap, so it’s exactly like the cable networks. *The Internet has practically already obliterated the cable TV industry, and their only hope is to destroy, delay, and/or obstruct the Internet to milk the last drops of money from an old world that no longer exists.*\n\n\n\nIndeed, it seems this is the actual intent of AT&T and Time Warner executives with the proposed merger. They want to “milk the last drops of money from an old world that no longer exists.” As is typically the case, the people who will be harmed most by this will be average American citizens. *As such, if Trump is truly a populist, he will stand strongly against the deal. If he doesn’t, it will only raise further concerns about where his real loyalties lie.*",

      "text": "Lawmakers 'Yet to be Convinced' of AT&T-Time Warner Benefits The companies' CEOs traveled to Washington on Wednesday to meet with an antitrust panel of lawmakers. By Andrew Soergel | Economy Reporter Dec. 7, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. Cancel AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor Mark Cuban are sworn in Wednesday during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Evan Vucci/AP \nThe heads of AT&T and Time Warner on Wednesday pleaded their case to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, arguing that their proposed $85-billion merger would ultimately be a good thing for American consumers. \nBut they faced steep congressional opposition from some members of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel who believe the union would be detrimental to media and programming at large. \nAT&T and Time Warner in October announced they'd reached an agreement that would allow AT&T – the country's second-largest data provider and third-largest broadband provider – to buy Time Warner for $107.50 per share. The move would place the ownership of HBO, DirecTV, CNN and Warner Bros. under one corporate roof. \nAT&T's Randall Stephenson said in a prepared statement Wednesday that he believes the deal will be successful in giving \"customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband.\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Apple Supplier Weighing U.S. Expansion ] \nHis counterpart at Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, delivered a similar assessment. \n\"By joining forces, we will accelerate the development and delivery of the next generation of video services that provide consumers with greater choice, convenience, value, and affordability,\" he said. \nBut lawmakers weren't entirely on board. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he had \"yet to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the harms to competition and possibly to consumers.\" \nConceding that the potential issues surrounding the massive deal are \"complicated,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, highlighted the \"potential anti-competitive favoritism\" AT&T would be able to engage in should the merger with Time Warner be approved. \nLee and his fellow lawmakers repeatedly touched on the idea that AT&T would have relative control of its programming's entire supply chain, from creation to distribution, should the deal be approved by regulators. Lee noted that such vertically structured mergers \"typically raise fewer concerns than their horizontal counterparts\" but that they can still \"significantly lessen competition.\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Samsung Off the Hook as Legal Battle With Apple Continues ] \nThe move wouldn't result in a traditional monopoly so much as it would position AT&T to potentially limit what consumers have access to. Citing existing complaints against AT&T by the Federal Communications Committee , Lee warned that the merged company runs the risk of becoming a \"gatekeeper\" by limiting whether competitors would, for example, have access to networks like CNN or by engaging in other unfair pricing strategies. \n\"It is the diversity of programming owned by different people over different platforms that fuels our democracy,\" said Gene Kimmelman, the CEO of internet and communications advocacy group Public Knowledge, who joined Stephenson and Bewkes at the hearing, suggesting that the deal's approval \"could be harmful to that democratic process and consumers' pocketbooks.\" \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban also testified, voicing his support for the union. It's not uncommon for lawmakers to invite experts and representatives from the private sector to share their opinions during certain hearings, and Cuban was invited Wednesday to deliver his assessment. \nCuban has been a vocal supporter of the AT&T-Time Warner deal since October and told lawmakers he believes the combined entity would be better equipped to compete with existing tech and media giants. \n\"We need more companies [with] the ability to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook,\" Cuban said in prepared remarks. \"Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete with any of the companies I've mentioned.\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Donald Trump Sold His Stocks, Spokesman Says ] \nThe proposed merger will ultimately be approved or denied by the Department of Justice, so lawmakers' apparent opposition to the deal isn't necessarily a death knell. But Wednesday's hearing allowed Bewkes and Stephenson the opportunity to defend their proposal under oath. \nExchanges between lawmakers and the CEOs were civil and rarely became heated, though Blumenthal at one point veered off topic to note that President-elect Donald Trump has condemned the deal. \nTrump during a campaign speech in October said that \"AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nBut Blumenthal said he believes Trump has been critical of the merger because the president-elect doesn't like CNN, saying that threatening \"more vigorous or adverse enforcement against a particular company because he doesn't like the news coverage is a threat to the First Amendment.\" \nIf regulators don't give the AT&T-Time Warner merger a green light soon, however, Trump may have time to somehow scuttle the deal once he moves into the White House and his administration takes over in January.

      "text": "Broncos Mailbag: Is rookie quarterback Paxton Lynch a bust? \nBy Marcy Gordon, The Associated Press \nSenators questioning the logic of a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner turned their focus to the nickels and dimes of the issue, at least as to how the $85.4 billion mega-deal would affect Americans. OK, you say this huge merger will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay? \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, “We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.” He said, though, that it wasn’t possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company’s DirecTV, broadband and mobile phone services. \nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. “Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,” Stephenson testified. \nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever. \n“I have yet to be convinced” that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes. \nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, “The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.” \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Related Articles",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee during a hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts A \nWASHINGTON: AT&T Inc's planned US$85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc will increase innovation and bring \"better-priced options\" to consumers upset by high cable bills, AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told lawmakers on Wednesday. \n\"We want consumers to pay for their content once and watch it any where any time,\" he said at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. \nSenator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner's movies and television shows to competitors. She also said AT&T could favor its own shows over independent content. \nTime Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio. \nSenator Al Franken, also a Democrat, expressed the same concern and pressed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes on whether the new, combined company would raise rates to others who would broadcast its content. \"It would not have the incentive nor would it have the ability,\" Bewkes responded. \nAT&T's Stephenson agreed: \"It would make no sense ... to do that.\" \nSenator Mike Lee, a Republican who chairs the antitrust panel, said the review by the U.S. Justice Department would be \"very fact-intensive.\" \n\"Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,\" Lee said. \nThe Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a proposed transaction, it must convince a judge to agree. \nStephen has said that the Federal Communications Commission would also review the deal if AT&T decides to assume any of Time Warner's licenses. \nFranken said he wanted to see the FCC review the merger because of their tougher standard. \nSenator Richard Blumenthal said he had \"serious concerns about this transaction. I have yet to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks.\" \nBut he was also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked. \n\"What troubles me is that the president-elect has said that his Justice Department will enforce a different standard of law depending\" on whether he is angered by news coverage, said Blumenthal, calling the notion \"absolutely abhorrent\". \nStephenson said he had not been in touch with Trump's transition team on the issue and that he expected the Justice Department would review the merger fairly. \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create another competitor against large companies like Apple Inc , Google , Microsoft Corp , Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc . \n\"Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy,\" he said in written testimony. \"Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete.\" \nAnd more change would be coming, he said: \"There's going to be people cutting the broadband cord.\" \n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Diane Bartz; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Alan Crosby) - Reuters",

      "text": "AT&T CEO defends Time Warner merger from critics in Congress AT&T denies that it will restrict Time Warner content to its own network. Dec 7, 2016 9:25 pm UTC AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson. AT&T reader comments 3 Share this story \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson spoke at a Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing today about his company’s proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner and denied that the merger will bring any harm to customers or competitors. \nSenators and witnesses at the hearing said AT&T and Time Warner combined might restrict valuable programming such as HBO to AT&T’s TV services or charge rival TV providers a higher price to carry it. They also discussed AT&T’s zero-rating, which exempts the company’s own video content from mobile data caps while requiring online video providers to pay for the same data cap exemptions . Further Reading AT&T and Time Warner reveal merger to create ISP, TV, and media giant \nMerger concerns boil down to AT&T controlling both distribution and video content instead of one or the other. AT&T is already one of the country’s largest providers of home and mobile Internet service, and it's the largest cable or satellite TV provider thanks to its acquisition of DirecTV last year. AT&T controls distribution of video by operating these Internet and TV services. \nBuying Time Warner—the owner of HBO, CNN, Turner, Warner Bros., and more—would also give AT&T control over much of the programming that is viewed on its Internet and TV services. (Note that Time Warner is completely separate from Time Warner Cable, which was recently purchased by Charter.) \nBut there’s nothing to worry about, Stephenson said. Although limiting access to Time Warner content might benefit AT&T’s distribution business, such limitations would cripple the business model of Time Warner, he said. AT&T wouldn’t spend $85.4 billion on Time Warner if it planned to impair that business dramatically, he said. \n“The business model's fundamental premise is wide and broad distribution of content into every home, particularly in the United States of America,” Stephenson said in response to questions from senators. \nThere is no “reason to believe we could use Time Warner programming or AT&T networks to hurt related markets,” he also said in prepared testimony . “Simply put, it would be irrational business behavior to do so. Time Warner’s programming is more valuable when distributed to as many eyes as possible. Moreover, in order to have great programming, it is imperative that we attract great creative talent to develop it. The best way to attract that talent is through widespread distribution of Time Warner content.” “The solution is not even less competition” \nAT&T argues that it can create a more effective competitor to cable TV companies by putting DirecTV and Time Warner content on its mobile network and letting the video stream without counting against data caps. AT&T also wants to be a bigger competitor in the online advertising market against Google and Facebook. \nBut any benefits must be weighed against potential disadvantages for Americans, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). \n“The solution for less competition is not even less competition,” Klobuchar said. \nVideo distributors have complained that AT&T could raise the prices competitors pay for Time Warner content or deny access to that content, she said. Independent content creators worry that AT&T will favor Time Warner programming over content made by smaller companies, stifling diversity of viewpoints, she also said. \nSen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) disputed AT&T and Time Warner’s argument that it wouldn’t be able to attract programming talent if it limited distribution. HBO attracted the talent necessary to put on shows like The Sopranos even though the channel was “exclusive” to those cable customers who were willing to pay extra, he said. \nJust as The Sopranos pushed customers to subscribe to HBO, exclusive access to Time Warner programming could push customers to DirecTV’s satellite and online services or HBO’s standalone streaming service, Franken argued. \nAT&T would have incentive to limit access to Time Warner video because AT&T's distribution network is so large, with more than 130 million wireless subscribers and 25 million TV subscribers in the US, said Gene Kimmelman, CEO of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who also testified at today’s hearing, recently said that restricting content to AT&T’s network “would be like selling toothpaste and not putting it in [drugstore chain] Duane Reade. It doesn’t make any sense.” \nFranken said that analogy doesn’t make sense. “It’s more like selling Game of Thrones and not letting Comcast subscribers watch it,” Franken said. “Or making Comcast pay more for the privilege of having Game of Thrones or Veep or the rest of the lineup.” \n“Nothing is preventing a combined AT&T/Time Warner from going to any of its competitors in the pay-TV market and charging double,” Franken also said. “I don’t think these hypotheticals are outlandish at all; you’d have every reason to do this if you could make more money. This is the incentive that's created by the merger.” \nBewkes testified today that “it would make no sense to not sell HBO on the Comcast system, on the Verizon system.” He also argued that AT&T and Time Warner together still wouldn’t have enough market power to significantly raise competitors’ prices. Online video may face threat \nAn even bigger threat will be posed to online video companies that don’t have the same negotiating power as Comcast, Kimmelman said. \n“I'm not worried about Comcast not getting Time Warner content,” Kimmelman said. “I'm worried about the online distribution… not being able to get exactly what it needs to be a player and a competitor.” \nWhile AT&T’s purchase of DirecTV helped the combined company offer better video and broadband bundles, the AT&T/Time Warner merger doesn’t seem to provide any similar efficiencies that benefit customers, Kimmelman said. Any improvements that AT&T can make by owning Time Warner could also be achieved by striking business deals while remaining separate companies, he said. \n“They could contract to do those same things without the risk of a merger,” Kimmelman said. \nThe merger’s fate will be decided by the Department of Justice and possibly the Federal Communications Commission. The purpose of the Senate hearing was to provide a public forum for evaluating the merger’s effects. \nThe merger's relation to net neutrality rules for Internet providers was raised by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). Noting that the rules could be overturned under President-elect Donald Trump, Leahy said, \"any weakening of these rules will cause serious harm to consumers—harm that will only be further exacerbated by mergers in this industry.\" \nIt wasn’t just Democratic senators who raised problems with the deal. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) discussed concerns about the merger’s implications for a “free and diverse media.” \n“This is something I recently experienced, because on weekends when I’m at the farm I always watch channel 349 on DirecTV,” Grassley said, referring to Newsmax, a channel recently dropped from DirecTV. \"I found out it wasn’t there anymore… I found out what is going on is an unfair contract negotiation.\" \nGrassley described several other points detailed by merger critics and said they should be carefully analyzed: \nThere’s concern that a combined company will give preferential treatment—for example, favorable channel placement and zero-rating pricing—to Time Warner’s premium entertainment programming to the disadvantage of other content producers, in particular small independent producers. There’s concern about AT&T/Time Warner’s ability to leverage their assets to negotiate better licensing arrangements or raise the price of their content to the detriment of other distributors. There’s concern about the merged company’s ability to employ “bullying” tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks. There’s concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate, resulting in higher prices and fewer programming options for consumers... \nThese are all serious concerns which should be scrutinized carefully by the antitrust regulators tasked with reviewing this transaction. AT&T has reason for optimism \nAlthough Trump once vowed to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger, AT&T executives were reportedly encouraged by recent meetings with Trump’s transition team. \nAT&T could benefit from regulators evaluating the merger against market power exerted by newer companies like Google and Facebook. Quoting the American Enterprise Institute , Grassley said that “with tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and others changing the way consumers access content, it’s legitimate to ask whether ‘what looks straightforwardly anti-competitive in the old industrial-merger models might not be so simple in the merger of modern media platforms.’” Jon Brodkin Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and broadband, telecommunications, wireless technology, and more.

      "text": "Good afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for stopping by this latest edition of Swerve to check out updates on AT&T Inc.’s T, +2.80% proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. TWX, +0.09% as well as the latest news and happenings around the media and entertainment industry. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media .\nHear me now? AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes — backed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban — appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel to answer questions and defend the two companies’ potential marriage. As MarketWatch’s media reporter, I joined Rob Schroeder of our Washington bureau to live blog the hearing. Here’s the recap . The subcommittee set out to look into whether the merger would suppress competition or provide consumers with benefits and whether conditions tacked on for approval would curb antitrust and competitive concerns.\nThe main take-away could be that Washington is concerned that in attempting to anticipate future demand, in this case in the area of mobile content consumption, a combined AT&T–Time Warner would stifle innovation, among other things.\nPEOTUS and POTY, to boot: Time magazine on Wednesday named President-elect Donald Trump its person of the year for 2016 . Public reaction, as might have been expected, was polarized, but Time’s managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, defended the magazine’s choice .\n“It’s hard to measure the scale of his disruption,” she wrote. “This real estate baron and casino owner turned reality-TV star and provocateur—never a day spent in public office, never a debt owed to any interest besides his own—now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties, pundits, donors, pollsters, all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously. Out of this reckoning, Trump is poised to preside, for better or worse.”\nBuy some Time: Hearst Corp. is reportedly interested in acquiring some assets of fellow magazine publisher Time Inc. TIME, +2.49% according to New York Post reporter Keith Kelly . The Post previously reported that Time had been approached with an $1.8 billion buyout bid. If the magazine empire were bought and broken up, Hearst might be expected to scoop up some of its titles.\nComments on a merger: When asked about the potential AT&T–Time Warner merger, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +2.03% Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told an investor conference that the deal “makes perfect sense for them,” writes the Hollywood Reporter’s Georg Szalai .\n“No. I respect the strategy,” McAdam told investors. “We want to skate to where the puck is going. We are more bullish on digital media, because the millennials don’t want a 300-channel bundle.”\nBack on top: Shari Redstone, the vice chairwoman of Viacom Inc.’s VIAB, +4.02% and CBS Corp.’s CBS, +4.05% boarsd of directors, was named Women in Entertainment executive of the year by the Hollywood Reporter . In a brutally public scuffle, Redstone wrestled control of Viacom away from former Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and, as Viacom has struggled of late, is pushing for a recombination of the two media companies.\nThe post-Huffington Post: Editorial director Lydia Polgreen of NYT NYT, +1.90% Global has been named editor-in-chief at the Huffington Post . Polgreen is the site’s second newsroom leader. Founder Arianna Huffington stepped down in August.\nBox-office busts: The tally is in, and Forbes has picked Johnny Depp as Hollywood’s most overpaid actor of 2016. This is an encore performance for Depp, who also was afforded to dubious honor a year ago. Check out the full list here .\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "Published December 07, 2016 Consumer Reports Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print When AT&T announced in October that it would spend $85 billion to acquire Time Warner, the plan was met with strong headwinds right out of the gate. A surprisingly broad array of lawmakers, from both sides of the political aisle, immediately voiced concerns. Among the concerned parties? The Senate Judiciary Committee, which today held a hearing examining the impact on competition, and potential antitrust concerns, the merger could raise.\nAs you would expect, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson thinks that letting his company snap up Time Warner will be great for everyone, especially AT&T. In his prepared testimony [PDF], Stephenson said that together, the two companies “will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models,” give consumers more options, increase competition for cable TV providers, and, somehow, speed up the development and deployment of 5G wireless networks.\nDisruption in the pay-TV industry is, of course, already happening—and AT&T is already a participant . Not only is premium content now available online through services like HBO Now and Netflix, but also with the rise of streaming bundles like DirecTV Now , Dish’s Sling TV, PlayStation Vue , and upcoming offerings from Hulu, “cable” has indeed begun to break open.\n“These changes to the old TV model unquestionably have been good for consumers,” Stephenson asserts. “But consumers want and deserve more options and better choices.”\nMore From Consumer Reports Top pick tires for 2016",

If the agency decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. \n ",

      "text": "show chapters Cuban: AT&T, Time Warner currently at disadvantage 4 Hours Ago | 04:59 Billionaire investor Mark Cuban said Wednesday it's probably best to wait until Donald Trump takes the Oval Office before judging him, calling the president-elect America's \"number one draft pick.\"\n\"He's who we put our hopes and dream with. Now it is easier because we haven't played a game yet,\" Cuban said on CNBC's \" Fast Money Halftime Report .\" \"No reason to rush to judgment or come to any conclusions now. Let's see what happens starting January 21st and we'll go from there. I hope he's a superstar.\"\nCuban, who was a supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton , previously said Trump had the potential to drag down the stock market and wasn't fit to be president. But when asked on Wednesday about Trump's recent Twitter complaint on airplane manufacturer Boeing , Cuban said it's really up to the media and others to decide how they want to react to Trump's tweets.\n\"The reality that — whether it is me tweeting or anybody is tweeting, it is a way to reach other celebs, other verified users, and reach the media,\" he said. \"So, the question isn't what the president-elect tweets or anybody tweets that's high profile. It's how the media handles that. We've kind of fallen into the literals and the serious nerves. And the literals will, you know, read about the tweets and the Times and elsewhere. And the serious-ers will read it in Breitbart and other places.\"\nCuban added that as much as people like to think Twitter reaches everybody, it doesn't.\n\"If I have 6 million followers, probably 40 percent of those are bots, probably another 20 percent are overseas, and another 80 percent aren't going to see any given tweet anyways.\"\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank,\" which features Mark Cuban as a judge.",

And bizarrely, AT&T and Time Warner seem to have unwittingly argued against their need to merge.\n\nTestimony from both companies was an unexpected vote for the value of an open internet and higher-quality services from ISPs across the board.

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nAT&T and Time Warner's chief executives were on Capitol Hill to make the case to the Senate antitrust committee that their $85.4 billion merger would increase innovation, help competition, and benefit consumers. Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes: (SOUNDBITE) JEFF BEWKES, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, TIME WARNER, INC., (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"In short, combining Time Warner's video content with AT&T's distribution will accelerate the development and delivery of the next generation of video services, providing consumers with greater choice, convenience, value, and, importantly, better affordability.\" Some committee members expressed concerns that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner content to competitors and favor the company's own movies and television shows over independent content. But AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson was quick to respond. (SOUNDBITE) RANDALL L. STEPHENSON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AT&T, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"Before the merger and after the merger, the competitive market looks identical, the distribution market looks identical, the content creation market looks identical. There are no overlaps.\" U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, said during the campaign that it should be blocked.

      "text": "Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- 4th Update December 07, 2016, 05:11:  Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- 4th Update By John D. McKinnon \nThe CEOs of AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday defended their proposed $85 billion merger to skeptical lawmakers, portraying the union as a bulwark against the dominance of tech giants while promising new digital media services that will benefit consumers. \nSenators from both parties expressed wide-ranging concerns about the blockbuster deal at a hearing on Capitol Hill, adding public pressure on two companies trying to navigate a shifting political landscape. But no new roadblocks were placed before the transaction. \nThe deal could lead to \"potential anticompetitive favoritism,\" warned Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), amid the grilling of the two CEOs during a hearing that lasted about three hours. The hearing was in front of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights. \nAntitrust enforcers in the Trump administration will ultimately decide whether to approve the deal or block it as anticompetitive. However, members of Congress can both reflect and contribute to the public mood regarding the merger of such large, high-impact businesses. \nCowen analyst Paul Gallant wrote in research note before the hearing that \"Congress's take on the deal could be more influential than normal\" in this deal review, given that enforcers will have to balance Mr. Trump's unusual opposition with Republicans' typically hands-off approach. \nShares of Time Warner, which have been trading at a sharp discount to AT&T's$107.50 per-share offer amid Wall Street skepticism, closed Wednesday up 8 cents at $93.98 while AT&T rose $1.10, or 2.8%, to $40.45. \nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn), the subcommittee's top Democrat, also expressed concerns about the deal resulting in higher prices and less competition. \nThe worries of the Republican lawmakers were notable. \nMr. Lee, the subcommittee's chairman, said the merger could lead to price and access problems for competitors seeking Time Warner's prized content, such as HBO. The senator has previously expressed skepticism of other deals ranging from Comcast Corp.'s failed attempt to buy Time Warner Cable and AT&T's nearly $50 billion acquisition of DirecTV last year. \nThe Republican also voiced concern about AT&T's practice of zero rating -- or exempting from data charges -- its new DirecTV streaming video service. Critics worry that the practice could turn AT&T into a powerful gatekeeper for consumers' content, he noted. \nThe issue came up multiple times in the hearing, including Sen. Al Franken (D., Minn) questioning how AT&T pays for the service. The company has defended the practice as legal and good for consumers, but the Federal Communications Commission has said it is worried that the practice is anticompetitive. \nAT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said the merger \"eliminates no competitor\" and that the company aims to \" get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices.\" \nThe deal would combine AT&T's pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner owns HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus cable networks including CNN and TNT. \nMr. Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes positioned the deal as a way to increase competition with entrenched cable-distribution companies, as well as the power of internet giants like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., which dominate the online advertising space and are pushing into video services. \nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official and president of public advocacy group Public Knowledge, stressed that those internet companies rely on the wireless and broadband networks controlled by huge telecommunications companies like AT&T. \nSen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) also noted questions about the merged company's ability to employ \"'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks.\" Mr. Grassley cited \"concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate,\" as well as \"concern about the merger's implications for a free and diverse press.\" \nThe comment echoed remarks from Mr. Trump in October that the deal puts \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "Posted on December 7, 2016 by Editor - Business News \nArticle Attribution and Read More at: Article Source \nAT&T Inc ( T.N ) Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that his company’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) would increase innovation, bring “better-priced options” to consumers \nand “reshape the competitive landscape.” \n“By owning Time Warner content, we will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response and bring consumers the options they seek,” Stephenson said at a Senate hearing. \nSenator Mike Lee, a Republican who chairs the panel that held the hearing, said the antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department would be “very fact-intensive.” \n“Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,” Lee said. \nThe Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. \nSenator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner content to competitors. She also said AT&T could favor its own movies and television shows over independent content. \nTime Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio. \nStephenson said at a New York conference on Tuesday that the Justice Department had begun reviewing the deal, which was announced in October. “This obviously will require extensive analysis,” he said. \nThe Federal Communications Commission would also review the deal if AT&T decides to assume any of Time Warner’s licenses, he added. \n“They own a number of licenses here and there, everything from walkie-talkie, wireless licenses to satellite licenses on bands for CNN,” he said. \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked. \nStephenson told Reuters before the hearing that he had no contact with Trump. \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create another competitor against large companies like Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Google ( GOOGL.O ), Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) and Facebook Inc ( FB.O ). \n“Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy,” he said in written testimony. “Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete.” \n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Diane Bartz; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) Share This:",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nJohnny Depp is most overpaid actor of 2016: Forbes\nGood afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for stopping by this latest edition of Swerve to check out updates on AT&T Inc.'s(T)proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc.(TWX)as well as the latest news and happenings around the media and entertainment industry. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media (https://marketwatch.typeform.com/to/YStdOx).\nHear me now? AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes -- backed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban -- appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel to answer questions and defend the two companies' potential marriage. As MarketWatch's media reporter, I joined Rob Schroeder of our Washington bureau to live blog the hearing. Here's the recap (http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2016/12/07/senate-antitrust-hearing-on-att-time-warner-deal-live-blog/). The subcommittee set out to look into whether the merger would suppress competition or provide consumers with benefits and whether conditions tacked on for approval would curb antitrust and competitive concerns.\nThe main take-away could be that Washington is concerned that in attempting to anticipate future demand, in this case in the area of mobile content consumption, a combined AT&T--Time Warner would stifle innovation, among other things.\nPEOTUS and POTY, to boot: Time magazine on Wednesday named President-elect Donald Trump its person of the year for 2016 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-is-time-person-of-the-year-whatever-happens-next-it-will-never-be-like-it-was-before-2016-12-07). Public reaction, as might have been expected, was polarized, but Time's managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, defended the magazine's choice (http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump-choice/?xid=homepage).\n\"It's hard to measure the scale of his disruption,\" she wrote. \"This real estate baron and casino owner turned reality-TV star and provocateur--never a day spent in public office, never a debt owed to any interest besides his own--now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties, pundits, donors, pollsters, all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously. Out of this reckoning, Trump is poised to preside, for better or worse.\"\nBuy some Time: Hearst Corp. is reportedly interested in acquiring some assets of fellow magazine publisher Time Inc.(TIME), according to New York Post reporter Keith Kelly (http://nypost.com/2016/12/06/hearst-starts-talks-to-buy-some-of-time-inc-magazines/). The Post previously reported that Time had been approached with an $1.8 billion buyout bid. If the magazine empire were bought and broken up, Hearst might be expected to scoop up some of its titles.\nComments on a merger: When asked about the potential AT&T--Time Warner merger, Verizon Communications Inc.(VZ)Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told an investor conference that the deal \"makes perfect sense for them,\" writes the Hollywood Reporter's Georg Szalai (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/verizon-ceo-talks-at-t-time-warner-content-strategy-953246).\n\"No. I respect the strategy,\" McAdam told investors. \"We want to skate to where the puck is going. We are more bullish on digital media, because the millennials don't want a 300-channel bundle.\"\nBack on top: Shari Redstone, the vice chairwoman of Viacom Inc.'s(VIA)and CBS Corp.'s(CBSA)boarsd of directors, was named Women in Entertainment executive of the year by the Hollywood Reporter (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shari-redstone-interview-cbs-viacom-future-lessons-dad-952457). In a brutally public scuffle, Redstone wrestled control of Viacom away from former Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and, as Viacom has struggled of late, is pushing for a recombination of the two media companies.\nThe post-Huffington Post: Editorial director Lydia Polgreen of NYT(NYT)Global has been named editor-in-chief at the Huffington Post (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lydia-polgreen-huffington-post_us_5846ef54e4b0fe5ab693122b). Polgreen is the site's second newsroom leader. Founder Arianna Huffington stepped down in August.\nBox-office busts: The tally is in, and Forbes has picked Johnny Depp as Hollywood's most overpaid actor (http://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/12/07/johnny-depp-is-hollywoods-most-overpaid-actor-for-the-second-year-in-a-row/#228732205091) of 2016. This is an encore performance for Depp, who also was afforded the dubious honor a year ago. Check out the full list here (http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emjl45efmhm/hollywoods-most-overpai/#3c87bbb460a6).\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nJohnny Depp is most overpaid actor of 2016: Forbes\nGood afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for stopping by this latest edition of Swerve to check out updates on AT&T Inc.'s(T)proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc.(TWX)as well as the latest news and happenings around the media and entertainment industry. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media (https://marketwatch.typeform.com/to/YStdOx).\nHear me now? AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes -- backed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban -- appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel to answer questions and defend the two companies' potential marriage. As MarketWatch's media reporter, I joined Rob Schroeder of our Washington bureau to live blog the hearing. Here's the recap (http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2016/12/07/senate-antitrust-hearing-on-att-time-warner-deal-live-blog/). The subcommittee set out to look into whether the merger would suppress competition or provide consumers with benefits and whether conditions tacked on for approval would curb antitrust and competitive concerns.\nThe main take-away could be that Washington is concerned that in attempting to anticipate future demand, in this case in the area of mobile content consumption, a combined AT&T--Time Warner would stifle innovation, among other things.\nPEOTUS and POTY, to boot: Time magazine on Wednesday named President-elect Donald Trump its person of the year for 2016 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-is-time-person-of-the-year-whatever-happens-next-it-will-never-be-like-it-was-before-2016-12-07). Public reaction, as might have been expected, was polarized, but Time's managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, defended the magazine's choice (http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump-choice/?xid=homepage).\n\"It's hard to measure the scale of his disruption,\" she wrote. \"This real estate baron and casino owner turned reality-TV star and provocateur--never a day spent in public office, never a debt owed to any interest besides his own--now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties, pundits, donors, pollsters, all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously. Out of this reckoning, Trump is poised to preside, for better or worse.\"\nBuy some Time: Hearst Corp. is reportedly interested in acquiring some assets of fellow magazine publisher Time Inc.(TIME), according to New York Post reporter Keith Kelly (http://nypost.com/2016/12/06/hearst-starts-talks-to-buy-some-of-time-inc-magazines/). The Post previously reported that Time had been approached with an $1.8 billion buyout bid. If the magazine empire were bought and broken up, Hearst might be expected to scoop up some of its titles.\nComments on a merger: When asked about the potential AT&T--Time Warner merger, Verizon Communications Inc.(VZ)Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told an investor conference that the deal \"makes perfect sense for them,\" writes the Hollywood Reporter's Georg Szalai (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/verizon-ceo-talks-at-t-time-warner-content-strategy-953246).\n\"No. I respect the strategy,\" McAdam told investors. \"We want to skate to where the puck is going. We are more bullish on digital media, because the millennials don't want a 300-channel bundle.\"\nBack on top: Shari Redstone, the vice chairwoman of Viacom Inc.'s(VIA)and CBS Corp.'s(CBSA)boarsd of directors, was named Women in Entertainment executive of the year by the Hollywood Reporter (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shari-redstone-interview-cbs-viacom-future-lessons-dad-952457). In a brutally public scuffle, Redstone wrestled control of Viacom away from former Chief Executive Philippe Dauman and, as Viacom has struggled of late, is pushing for a recombination of the two media companies.\nThe post-Huffington Post: Editorial director Lydia Polgreen of NYT(NYT)Global has been named editor-in-chief at the Huffington Post (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lydia-polgreen-huffington-post_us_5846ef54e4b0fe5ab693122b). Polgreen is the site's second newsroom leader. Founder Arianna Huffington stepped down in August.\nBox-office busts: The tally is in, and Forbes has picked Johnny Depp as Hollywood's most overpaid actor (http://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/12/07/johnny-depp-is-hollywoods-most-overpaid-actor-for-the-second-year-in-a-row/#228732205091) of 2016. This is an encore performance for Depp, who also was afforded to dubious honor a year ago. Check out the full list here (http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emjl45efmhm/hollywoods-most-overpai/#3c87bbb460a6).\nThanks for reading Swerve.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Innovation or monopoly? Senate panel looks at AT&T-Time Warner deal MARCY GORDON ASSOCIATED PRESS | December 7, 2016, 10:55AM | Updated 4 hours ago. WASHINGTON — Senators scrutinizing the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner homed in on brass tacks with the companies' CEOs. OK, you say this $85.4 billion mega-deal will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay? \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, \"We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.\" He said, though, that it wasn't possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company's DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services. \nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson testified. \nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever. \n\"I have yet to be convinced\" that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes. \nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns. \n\"There are too few players in these markets already. They are heavily concentrated,\" he told the panel. The concentration of market power could \"harm the democratic process\" as well as consumers' pocketbooks, Kimmelman warned. \nMark Cuban, the billionaire sports and media mogul who owns the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, played evangelist for the deal in a fast-moving world of media and entertainment content. Consider Facebook's mergers with WhatsApp, Snapchat and others, he testified: Those deals are driving innovation. Old media like Time Warner can't compete with the likes of Facebook if they can't merge. \nWhat about Trump's avowed opposition? \nStephenson says he's confident the merger will be approved despite the president-elect's objection. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under close scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. \nThe concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. That, critics say, could limit consumer choice.  ",

      "text": "Chairman and CEO of AT&T Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes, and Chairman of AXS TV and owner of the Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban are sworn in before a Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner on December 7, 2016. Joshua Roberts / Reuters ID: 10129316 The chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner pitched their proposed merger to a skeptical Senate antitrust panel Wednesday, selling the $85 billion deal, which some say will lead to fewer choices and escalating costs, as a boon to customers craving cheap content on the go. Rather than squashing competition, they say the merger will help dislodge the entrenched cable bundle, and lead to innovation in the nascent market for streaming video.\nSenators from both sides of the aisle needled the leaders of AT&T and Time Warner over the colossal merger in a nearly 3-hour long session, which also included Dallas Mavericks owner, Shark Tank investor, and media entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who spoke as an expert witness. Lawmakers raised the possibility of the deal leading to unfair price hikes, restrictions on prized content like HBO’s Game of Thrones , and incentives to stifle innovative streaming competitors like Netflix and Amazon.\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal reminded the CEOs that President-elect Donald Trump has already vowed to block the deal. “I take him at his word,” Sen. Blumenthal said. AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson has not met with Trump’s transition team, but he said he is confident that regulators will approve the deal, “once everyone hears the facts and has the appropriate competitive analysis.”\nWhile many Senators raised pointed questions and offered sustained criticism about the deal, Blumenthal was perhaps the most critical. “I have yet to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the harms to competition and possibly to consumers,” he said.\nAT&T’s Stephenson insisted the deal will help liberate unsatisfied cable customers from expensive contracts, cumbersome set-top boxes, and limitations on watching video through phones and tablets. Stephenson touted AT&T’s new service, DirecTV Now , which gives customers dozens of pay-TV streaming channels without the need for a traditional cable subscription, as a sign of innovation to come — so long as the merger is given the green light. “We want consumers to pay for their content once, and then watch it anywhere, anytime,” Stephenson said. He told Senators that the merger would allow AT&T to offer customers cheaper prices and more diverse programming, helping the company compete in the pay-TV market.\nBut Sens. Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar expressed concerns that the deal would incentivize AT&T to restrict Time Warner to its own network, or that the network would exploit its ownership of HBO to extract hefty fees from rivals like Comcast.\nBoth Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and Stephenson countered that their company’s successes depend on broad distribution. Time Warner’s value would suffer if AT&T chose to restrict its reach to only certain audiences, Stephenson said. “I don’t see the economic rationale nor do I see the customer rationale,” he said.\nLawmakers said the antitrust division of the Justice Department, the lead agency reviewing the merger, will need to examine zero rating, the practice in which internet providers exempt certain services from counting against the data limits of their customers. AT&T’s zero rating scheme with DirecTV has already drawn the scrutiny of the Federal Communications Commission, which found in a preliminary analysis that AT&T’s plan is anticompetitive. As the AT&T-Time Warner deal proceeds, regulators will determine if acquiring Time Warner’s library of content may also give AT&T incentives to engage in exclusive dealing and unfair pricing.\nBoth the FCC and lawmakers who oversee the industry say zero rating itself does not necessarily harm customers. It’s free data, after all. What’s key is whether exempting certain apps favors an internet provider’s in-house service over those offered by rivals. “The notion that a provider would offer to exempt content from monthly data caps strikes me as something consumers should applaud,” Sen. Orrin Hatch told BuzzFeed News. “Of course, we also need to be sure such exemptions are offered on equal terms so they aren’t used as a means to disadvantage competitors.”\nAT&T insisted that all content providers who want to participate in the wireless carrier’s zero rating program are charged the same. But Sen. Al Franken challenged Stephenson on that claim. Since AT&T owns DirecTV, Sen. Franken described any cost incurred by DirecTV to get on AT&T’s wireless network as merely shifting money from one pocket to another, a kind of accounting fiction that ultimately conceals AT&T’s gain to the detriment of rival mobile video services. “How do we know you’re not giving DirecTV a deal — because you own it?” he asked. Stephenson said he would make internal data available to the Justice Department, and told the Senate panel AT&T does not discriminate against other services.\nA big question left unanswered by AT&T’s chief is whether the two companies will structure the deal to avoid the regulatory of scrutiny of the FCC. Unlike the Justice Department, which can challenge a planned merger if it will harm competition, the FCC has a broader mandate; companies must show that their marriage serves the public interest to earn the FCC’s approval. At least according to this first round of Congressional scrutiny and the reactions of lawmakers, it’s not yet clear if the deal would meet that standard.",

      "title": "Innovation or monopoly? Panel looks at AT&T-Time Warner deal",
      "text": "Senators scrutinizing the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner homed in on brass tacks with the companies' CEOs. OK, you say this $85.4 billion mega-deal will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay?\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, \"We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.\" He said, though, that it wasn't possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company's DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services.\nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson testified.\nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever.\nHow the AT&T-Time Warner deal could escape deeper regulatory scrutiny Brian Fung AT&T's enormous, $85.4 billion purchase of one of America's top media conglomerates could radically reshape the digital economy, making the deal's next step — regulatory review — hugely important to the way consumers access their media. But missing from the process could be the Federal Communications...\nAT&T's enormous, $85.4 billion purchase of one of America's top media conglomerates could radically reshape the digital economy, making the deal's next step — regulatory review — hugely important to the way consumers access their media. But missing from the process could be the Federal Communications...\n(Brian Fung) \"I have yet to be convinced\" that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.\nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\"\nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it.\nAT&T's $85.4B deal for Time Warner: A new bet on synergy Tribune news services AT&T's $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner represents a new bet on synergy between companies that distribute information and entertainment to consumers and those that produce it.\nThe acquisition would combine a telecom giant that owns a leading cellphone business, DirecTV and an internet service...\nAT&T's $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner represents a new bet on synergy between companies that distribute information and entertainment to consumers and those that produce it.\nThe acquisition would combine a telecom giant that owns a leading cellphone business, DirecTV and an internet service...\n(Tribune news services) Critics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns.\n\"There are too few players in these markets already. They are heavily concentrated,\" he told the panel. The concentration of market power could \"harm the democratic process\" as well as consumers' pocketbooks, Kimmelman warned.\nMark Cuban, the billionaire sports and media mogul who owns the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, played evangelist for the deal in a fast-moving world of media and entertainment content. Consider Facebook's mergers with WhatsApp, Snapchat and others, he testified: Those deals are driving innovation. Old media like Time Warner can't compete with the likes of Facebook if they can't merge.\nWhat about Trump's avowed opposition?\nStephenson says he's confident the merger will be approved despite the president-elect's objection.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under close scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs.\nThe concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. That, critics say, could limit consumer choice.\nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition.\nAssociated Press",

They say the \"hiring, promotional and disciplinary policies and practices continue to have a disparate impact on African American employees.\" \nIn his lawsuit, Walker claims, \"The current workplace culture utilizes practices that discourages or prohibit minorities from exercising their rights under employment discrimination statutes.\" The use of overly broad waivers, releases and mandatory arbitration provisions impede EEOC investigations and retaliatory practices that dissuades and has a chilling effect on African Americans in the workplace from exercising their rights,\" he continued. \nCBS46 will have more as this story develops. \nCopyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

Up Next Don't let free Wi-Fi wreck the holidays Photo by Getty Images \nAT&T's plans to merge with media giant Time Warner in an $85 billion deal isn't going to skate by Capitol Hill. \nOn Wednesday, Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in a Senate antitrust subcommittee asked the companies tough questions about whether their planned merger would lower prices for consumers or stifle video competitors online. \nThe bipartisan grilling could be a sign that populist attitudes against big mergers may put political pressure on the deal. As a candidate, President-elect Donald Trump said he'd block the merger , arguing the tie-up would mean \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" But there have been signs his position may have softened as he's brought some pro-merger advisors onto his transition team. \nStill, it looks like politicians on both sides of the political aisle are concerned about what a merger of this size could mean. AT&T is the second-largest wireless phone provider in the country and has 25.3 million TV customers through its acquisition of satellite TV provider DirecTV. Are you a fan of \"Game of Thrones\" or \"Batman\"? Time Warner owns those properties through HBO and Warner Bros. \nThe final decision on whether the merger will be approved is up to antitrust enforcers in the new Trump administration and not the Senate. Stephenson said the company has already started the review process there, and he said he's confident that based on the facts of the case the government will approve the deal. \nThat didn't stop senators from lobbing questions at AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the chairman of the subcommittee, questioned whether the merger might lead AT&T to favor its own content over the competition's. Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, cited concerns that a merger of this size would concentrate too much power in the hands of one company and he worried that it might affect freedom of the press. \nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota questioned what the merger would mean for consumer pricing. And Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, who's been among the most vocal opponents of several big mergers over the past years, including the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, pressed Stephenson on whether today's net neutrality rules would be sufficient to protect consumers. \nStephenson and Bewkes tried to reassure the senators that the combined company wouldn't lead to price gouging and that innovation would flourish, which would lead to lower prices for consumers. Stephenson pointed to the $35 price tag on AT&T's new DirecTV Now service, which offers 100 channels of live streamed TV on mobile devices, as a good example of an innovative product. \n\"By owning Time Warner content, we will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response and bring consumers the options they seek,\" he said. \nHe added that the goal of the merger is to compete more aggressively with cable TV providers, which today dominate the pay-TV market. And he said a combined AT&T and Time Warner would \"bring the consumer better-priced options than they have today.\" \nWhen asked about concerns that the company's DirecTV Now service -- which offers its video to AT&T mobile customers without eating into their data -- might be anticompetitive, Stephenson likened it to toll-free long-distance calling. He said that just as toll-free calling helped lower prices for long-distance calling, \"sponsored data\" models like the one offered by DirecTV Now would also eventually lower prices. \nBewkes said the merger would allow his company to continue to innovate, such as by adding more interactive features to video. \nGene Kimmelman, the president of public interest group Public Knowledge, acknowledged that separately, AT&T and Time Warner have brought innovative services to the market. But he said his concern was \"what happens when you combine those assets.\" \nHe pointed to a review conducted by the Department of Justice that found Comcast-NBC Universal has created incentives to harm competition. He noted that the deal between AT&T and Time Warner is even bigger, because AT&T offers national television and wireless distribution. \nDaphna Ziman, president of Cinemoi North America, warned that more consolidation in the industry would be \"catastrophic for diversity.\" Her network, which competes with Turner Classic Movies, owned by Time Warner, has difficulty striking distribution deals with pay-TV networks because it doesn't have a big enough audience. She argued that if AT&T and Time Warner merge, they would have \"the means and incentive to discriminate against independents.\" Share your voice",

      "text": "REX/Shutterstock  27PM PT \nThere are five new players in the battle to win federal approval of the $85.4 billion merger of AT&T and Time Warner : Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. \nThe size, reach and balance sheets of the tech giants were cited as a primary impetus for the AT&T-Time Warner nuptials during a hearing on the merger Wednesday with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The nearly three-hour session marked the first real test of how the deal will play in the court of public opinion amid the populist uprising spurred by Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race. \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes faced expected questions about the deal’s impact on prices for consumers, the competitive landscape for Time Warner’s content rivals and whether the enlarged company would be able to squash independent programmers. The scope of the combined company is a bipartisan concern, judging by the questioning from committee members. That concern is especially acute as the incoming presidential administration has vowed to rescind the FCC’s existing net neutrality rules designed to police high-speed data providers like AT&T from erecting tollbooths on the Internet. Related AT&T, Time Warner Chiefs Face Questions About Merger in Senate Hearing \nIn that context, it’s no surprise that the CEOs would invoke the threat posed by the tech giants who, in varying degrees, are becoming increasingly focused on video. Stephenson positioned the enlarged company as angling to drive major changes to television’s status quo before they’re beaten to the punch by Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. \n“Our intent is to disrupt the existing pay TV model,” Stephenson assured. \nThe initial warning to the pols about the specter of Google et al hanging over old media came from a friendly witness, the maverick entrepreneur Mark Cuban. In sounding the alarm about the challenging marketplace that even the largest TV players are facing, Cuban cited evidence from his own household. \n“Punishment for my 7-year-old son is taking away his ‘Minecraft,’ ” Cuban said. “He could care less about TV.” \nAs the video business steady migrates to online platforms, the tech giants will have a gatekeeper status that will dwarf the power of an enlarged AT&T. Looking into the future, Cuban said, AT&T and DirecTV could easily find themselves at the mercy of Apple or Google or Facebook for distribution. “They really can’t control their own destiny,” Cuban argued. \nStephenson and Bewkes defended the merger as being good for consumers in allowing the enlarged company flexibility to innovate and to offer low-cost programming packages. There is no doubt that AT&T’s Nov. 30 introduction of its low-cost DirecTV Now streaming channel package was done in part to prove the company’s good intentions on the consumer-pricing front. AT&T is offering DirecTV Now service to its wireless subscribers free of data charges. That provision sounds consumer-friendly on the surface but it drew questions about whether AT&T could wield its data-free option in some way to discriminate against content or distribution rivals. \nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah and chairman of the committee that called the hearing, called it “the siren song of zero rating.” Stephenson explained that DirecTV pays AT&T a fee for the right to have its content excluded from a customer’s data cap. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., a vocal critic of Big Media mergers, seized on the prospect that AT&T could charge rivals more for the same data-free option. \nStephenson repeated the mantra of the merger that the combination of AT&T’s global wireless business and DirecTV with Time Warner’s blue-chip content would give subscribers more flexibility to watch shows across multiple devices. He boiled it down to the soundbite-friendly notion of allowing people to “pay for their content once, watch it anywhere at any time.” \nBewkes, meanwhile, is looking to turn an old defeat into victory while he’s on the stump. He cited the stalled rollout of TV Everywhere authenticated streaming as an example of why Time Warner needed a big distribution partner to drive change across the industry. Bewkes and Comcast’s Brian Roberts were the frontmen for TV Everywhere when Time Warner and Comcast teamed to introduce the concept in 2009 – just as Netflix was revving up its streaming business. \nAs many cable operators fiddled around with clunky authentication processes and clumsy navigational systems (if they embraced TV Everywhere at all), Netflix and Hulu took root as the better option for watching TV and fueled cord-cutting, to Bewkes’ dismay. TV Everywhere deals were held hostage to complicated affiliate negotiations, and also hampered by the unwillingness of other content providers to grant broad VOD and streaming access to programs, also to Bewkes’ dismay. \n“We need to deliver great consumer experiences and that’s what joining with AT&T will allow us to do,” he said. \nToward the end of the session, Stephenson sought to deconstruct the rationale for the move by major MVPDs to embrace a wider variety of bundling options, including OTT options like DirecTV Now. He cited the all-or-nothing approach to carriage deals taken by big programmers as the biggest menace for consumers’ cable bills. Finally, with skinny bundles like the options offered at DirecTV Now, distributors are drilling down to the channels consumers really want and jettisoning the ‘periphery” channels that only drive up prices. \n“The old system is just flat-out broken,” he said. \nAll in all, the hearing produced few fireworks, and the deal seemed to draw support from Republican members of the committee (a good sign, from AT&T-Time Warner’s perspective). The discussion did veer into surprising territory when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D.-Conn., elicited vows from Stephenson and Bewkes that CNN would not alter its coverage of Trump despite what Blumenthal described as threats from the president-elect to block the deal because of his disdain for CNN’s reporting. \nOn Tuesday, as Bewkes and Stephenson made the rounds of investor conferences in New York, the CEOs told the Wall Street crowd that they were optimistic that the incoming Trump administration would be good for the nation’s business climate. Bewkes raised eyebrows with his statement that he believed that Democrats poised a greater threat to free speech concerns than Trump, despite the president-elect’s vows to sue the New York Times and Washington Post, among others, for coverage he deemed biased. \nFor sure, Bewkes and Stephenson’s words on Trump had to have been carefully considered, just like every point the two made during Wednesday’s hearing. If there was one message they tried to convey, it was that the big-ness of the combined AT&T and Time Warner needs to be measured by a different yardstick than regulators have used for media mergers in the past. \n“We have to recalibrate what size means in this new world,” Stephenson said, once again calling out the influence of the tech behemoths. The market cap of AT&T-Time Warner, in the $350 billion range, is still “about half the size of the companies that present the real competitive threat.” \n(Pictured: Jeff Bewkes, Randall Stephenson) Filed Under:",

AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, left, and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes are sworn in on Capitol Hill prior to testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Meg James \nU.S. senators launched the government’s review of AT&T's proposed takeover of Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday, quizzing company executives on a host of concerns, including whether consumers’ monthly TV bills would continue to climb if the mega-media marriage is approved. \nThe merger review comes amid a charged atmosphere in Washington.   has said his administration would block the proposed $85.4-billion AT&T-Time Warner combination because it would mean “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Now, Trump’s Department of Justice will decide whether the government will approve the combination — or try to block it. \nAlthough lawmakers won't decide the outcome, the issues raised Wednesday on Capitol Hill will be central to the Justice Department ’s scrutiny of the deal. \nCritics worry that combining AT&T — the nation’s largest pay-TV company and second-largest cellphone service provider — with Time Warner — an entertainment colossus that owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film and TV studios — could hinder development of the online streaming market, which competes with traditional TV. \n“Speaking bluntly, what I think, what any of my colleagues thinks, may make no difference whatsoever because Donald Trump has said he’s going to block this merger, and I take him at his word,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said, eliciting snickers from the audience in the hearing room.

Stephenson labeled himself “a political novice,” and stopped short of criticizing Trump. \n“The Department of Justice will be the one reviewing this transaction and making a determination of whether it is competitive or not,” Stephenson said. “We actually believe the facts are going to be very compelling and very good, that this is pro-competitive and pro-consumer.” \nThe bulk of the 2 1/2-hour hearing delved into whether AT&T would have too much power if it swallowed Time Warner, which also owns TBS, TNT , Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies. \nWhile buying Time Warner would not wipe out a direct competitor, AT&T would become more influential because it would own both the programming and the delivery systems used by more than a quarter of Americans. \nThe Federal Communications Commission already has raised concerns about AT&T’s decision to enable its cell phone customers to stream DirecTV content without having it count against their monthly data caps, which leads to higher fees. AT&T bought DirecTV last year. \nCritics say the move by AT&T to keep DirecTV content exempt from data caps shows that AT&T would favor its own programming at the expense of content provided by a rival such as Netflix. \n“The solution for less competition is not even less competition,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said. \nSen. Michael S. Lee (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust issues, added: \"The potential antitrust favoritism the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well,” \nBut Stephenson said the Time Warner acquisition would ensure more vibrant competition — not less. \nThe AT&T chief was joined by an unexpected ally: billionaire Mark Cuban , who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Cuban, who struggled to get wide distribution for his cable-TV channels, argued that lawmakers should have a more expansive view of the competitive landscape. \n“The media world has changed,” Cuban said. “It used to be that TV was the best alternative to boredom.” adding that now millions of Americans turn to an app on their phone when they want to be entertained. \nFacebook, Google and Apple, which control many of the apps that consumers use, have become more influential than AT&T and Time Warner in determining what content consumers will watch, Cuban argued. \nConsumer group Public Knowledge’s Chief Executive Gene Kimmelman countered that consumers do not pay more than $200 a month to Google and Facebook as they do for their pay-TV and Internet service. \nAT&T and Time Warner executives maintain that they need to combine to better adapt to the dramatic changes in media consumption. \nStephenson said AT&T would become more innovative and design better offerings if it controls the rights to Time Warner’s content, rather having to engage in lengthy and complicated negotiations for those rights. \nHe pointed to DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service, which offers traditional TV channels for $35 a month. AT&T was able to create the service to watch TV on computers, tablets and phones because it bought DirecTV last year. \nThe CEOs also said their union would improve advertising for consumers. Because the company would have access to data about what products viewers would be inclined to buy, ads would be more relevant. \nBut there were dissident voices, including from independent programmers who struggle to get carriage on pay-TV systems, such as DirecTV. \n“Further consolidation would be catastrophic to diversity,” said filmmaker Daphna Edwards Ziman, president of independent movie channel Cinemoi. \nFor several of the lawmakers, the chief concern was the cost of pay-TV service — and unfulfilled promises from past mergers. \nA Consumer Federation of America study released Wednesday showed that households pay about $2,700 a year for phones, Internet and pay-TV service and are overcharged by about $45 a month for those services. \n“We have seen this plot before, like a tired movie franchise,” Klobuchar said. “We can predict the ending before it begins: the promise of thriving competition collapses, replaced by dominant firms with monopoly power.” \nBut Stephenson, the AT&T chief, promised: “This will drive consumer costs down.”",

      "text": "AT&T-Time Warner merger draws grilling from U.S. lawmakers WEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 2016, 3:48 P.M. Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Bewkes listens as right as AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) By Todd Shields and David Mclaughlin Bloomberg SMS \nU.S. lawmakers grilled chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner about whether their proposed tie-up would benefit consumers and called for antitrust officials to closely scrutinize potential competitive harm from the deal. \nRepublicans and Democrats questioned at a hearing Wednesday whether the merger will give AT&T the incentive to harm rival distributors of content that competes with its DirecTV business as well as entertainment producers that compete with Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN. \n“We have seen this plot before,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. “Like a tired movie franchise, we can predict the ending before it begins. The promise of thriving competition collapses, replaced by dominant firms with monopoly power.” \nLawmakers are scrutinizing the $85.4 billion deal that would create a telecommunications and media empire that will own much of the programming it provides to subscribers of its wireless, internet and pay-TV services. AT&T serves 133 million U.S. wireless customers and 25 million video subscribers. While Congress doesn’t decide whether the merger proceeds, it has oversight of the regulators that do. \nBecause AT&T is a distributor and Time Warner is a supplier to content, the deal doesn’t raise the traditional competitive problems that come with combining direct competitors. Still, there are risks AT&T will have an incentive to raise prices for Time Warner’s content or restrict access to make DirecTV more attractive to consumers, lawmakers said. \n“There’s concern about the merged company’s ability to employ bully tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks,” said Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican. “There’s concerns that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate resulting in higher prices and fewer programming options.” \nAT&T’s Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said the purchase of Time Warner would raise a challenge to cable companies. The deal also may hasten AT&T’s development of faster 5G wireless service to deliver its newly acquired video content, Stephenson said. Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes said in his submitted testimony that the combination will allow faster moves toward new channel packages delivered over the internet. \nThe transaction will be reviewed by the Justice Department and possibly by the Federal Communications Commission. President-elect Donald Trump said he would block the merger, arguing that such media combinations leave too much power concentrated among too few companies. \nUnder Bewkes, Time Warner has spent billions to create original programming and acquire sports rights to attract viewers and command higher fees from distributors to keep his media company afloat in a declining pay-TV industry. At the same time, he’s trying to win over the growing legions of cord-cutters who don’t pay for cable. \nAT&T’s plunge into media with the Time Warner deal is in part to relieve pressure facing its maturing wireless business and customer erosion in video. The Dallas-based company acquired satellite-TV operator DirecTV for $48.5 billion last year, and so far in 2016 it’s lost more than 106,000 TV customers. \nBewkes and Stephenson said it would make no business sense to restrict Time Warner content to competitors or favor that content on its own platforms. If consumers want certain content, AT&T wants to provide it to them, Stephenson said. \nSen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, rejected the argument that AT&T will want the widest distribution possible for Time Warner content. HBO is a success because it makes the content exclusive and charges consumers for it, Franken said. \n“Nothing is preventing the combined AT&T-Time Warner from going to any of its competitors in the pay-TV market and charging double for access to Game of Thrones and Veep,” Franken said. “Or the combined company could simply restrict access to the programming entirely and wait for competitors’ customers to flock to DirecTV or HBO streaming services. I don’t think these hypotheticals are outlandish at all. You have every reason to do this if you could.” \nThe deal needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly blocked because it poses a danger of harming competition, leading to higher costs and fewer choices for video services, said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust regulator who is president of the policy group Public Knowledge, in an interview before the hearing. \nThe hearing could be a “tea leaf for other mergers” as Washington asks whether the Trump administration could be receptive to mergers among wireless, cable and content companies, Paul Gallant, a Washington-based analyst with Cowen & Co., said in a note Tuesday. \nThe session “could provide clues about Congress’s attitude toward telecom/media consolidation more generally,” Gallant added. \nThe tie-up between AT&T and Time Warner deal has similarities to Comcast Corp.’s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal, which regulators in Washington cleared with conditions. In both instances, the deal didn’t remove a direct competitor. Published: Dec. 7, 2016, 3:48 p.m.",

      "text": "While AT&T ( T ) is going big with its planned purchase of Time Warner ( TWX ) for nearly $109 billion, including debt, Verizon ( VZ ) Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam says that the telecom is learning towards \"snackable\" content that appeals to millennials on its Go90 streaming service.\nMcAdam compared Verizon's \"patient money\" strategy in mobile video to Netflix 's ( NFLX ) transition from a DVD-by-mail shop to a global power in streaming on Tuesday. \"If you look at, for example, how long it took Netflix to really ramp up and hit their stride, that's sort of a model for us,\" McAdam said at the UBS telecom, media and technology conference in New York on Tuesday.\nNetflix launched its streaming service in 2007 and it wasn't until 2010 that the business surpassed DVD rentals. It has taken years of trial, and some error, for Reed Hasting's streaming company to build a base of 75 million members in 190 countries that watch 125 million hours of shows and other video each day. And while some of Netflix's maneuvers may not apply to Verizon, Hasting's investments in content and integration with other pay-TV systems may prove useful guides for McAdam.\n\"The first part of that strategy was to get the Netflix app on consumer electronics,\" Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi said.\nNetflix struck up partnerships to get into Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Xbox 360 and set-top boxes 2008. Deals with Sony ( SNE ) to get onto the Playstation PS3 and smart TV makers followed in 2009, and the following year Netflix's app appeared on Apple 's ( AAPL ) iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch and Nintendo 's ( NTDOY ) Wii.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Franken Expected to Be Loud Voice on AT&T-Time Warner Deal NEWS \nBloomberg BNA's Antitrust & Trade Regulation Resource Center is your comprehensive antitrust and trade regulation law resource designed specifically for the... \nBy \nDec. 6 — Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) is poised to take on AT&T Inc.’s planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc. in his latest battle against consolidation in the communications sector. \nFranken, a tough critic of the proposed $85.4 billion merger, will have an opportunity to grill company executives at a Dec. 7 Senate committee hearing on the competitive impact of the deal. \n“The hearing sort of sets the tone for the year-long review of the merger,” Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), told Bloomberg BNA. Franken “will most certainly” be a voice for consumers throughout the process, Cooper said. Skepticism \nA Franken spokesman said the senator plans to ask “pointed” questions at the hearing, but didn’t provide details. Franken has said that he’s skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices and worse service for consumers. \nIndustry analysts said the hearing by the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee could offer a preview of the kind of arguments that regulators will look at in their review of the merger, but will probably have very little impact on the final outcome. \n“The agencies have tests and standards” for reviewing mergers, Hal Singer, a principal at Economists Incorporated, a Washington-based consulting firm, told Bloomberg BNA. “This isn’t going to be a popularity contest.” \nFranken has said the AT&T-Time Warner deal deserves the “highest level of scrutiny” from the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission. The senator was also a leading opponent of an unsuccessful merger deal between Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable Inc. \n“It’s no secret that Sen. Franken has been an outspoken critic of mergers and acquisitions run amuck, especially in the communications space,” Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, a public interest group, told Bloomberg BNA. \nBoth AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes are set to testify at the upcoming hearing, which was called by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. The witness list also includes billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban as well as Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group that has objected to the merger. More ‘Game of Thrones.’ \nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), ranking member of the subcommittee, said she’s concerned the tie-up might undermine competition and drive up prices for consumers. \n“Game of Thrones on HBO, the Queen on Netflix, Mozart in the Jungle on Amazon--we want more content like this, and that’s why it’s critical to maintain competition that drives innovation and benefits consumers,” she said in an e-mailed statement. \nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the panel, told Bloomberg BNA he has “very strong qualms” about the merger. \nCFA plans to unveil a report on the day of the hearing that will highlight the risks of industry consolidation that has been taking place, Cooper said. The group is working closely with Public Knowledge on the effort, he said. \nAT&T and Time-Warner announced their deal in late October. The transaction would combine Time Warner’s vast library of entertainment programming with AT&T’s pay-TV, mobile phone and home internet services. Test For Trump? \nPresident-elect Donald Trump quickly slammed the deal after it was proposed, saying it would be rejected under his administration. But he hasn’t commented since the election on whether he intends to follow through on his campaign rhetoric. \n“This will be a big test for Trump,” Cooper said, adding that any flip-flopping by the incoming president will likely face push back. \nFranken warned in an Oct. 24 letter to DOJ and the FCC that combining AT&T and Time Warner would create a “mega media conglomerate with both the incentive and ability to use its platform to harm consumers and competitors alike.” The alum of NBC’s Saturday Night Live program said he had “serious doubts” about whether behavioral conditions can effectively address these concerns. \nHe was similarly skeptical about such conditions when Comcast acquired NBC Universal. \n“I have had this history where I have seen NBC and I have seen other networks promise something and then do the 180-degree turn on it,” Franken said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in 2011. “There is no question about that. People in my industry—or my former industry—they know that.” \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alexei Alexis in Washington at \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tiffany Friesen Milone at \nCopyright © 2016 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.

      "text": "4:17pm PT by Ashley Cullins Time Warner Facing Class Action Discrimination Suit Getty Images In addition to \"glass ceilings\" for advancement, the complaint also says there are \"glass walls\" that segregate the company into divisions in which black leadership is acceptable and divisions in which it is not. \nAn ex-CNN and current TBS employee are spearheading a class action lawsuit against Time Warner, claiming its companies have been mistreating black managers since the late '90s. \nCeleslie Henley and Ernest Colbert Jr. are suing CNN, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner, for according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Georgia federal court. \nHenley says she worked for CNN for seven years as an executive administrative assistant and was fired five days after she emailed human resources about discriminatory treatment. Colbert works for TBS and claims that he is underpaid compared to his white peers. \nTheir suit claims the internal policies ensure black employees aren't promoted as often or to positions as high as are white employees. \n\"As a result, jobs are filled without being posted, candidates are handpicked in advance, and supervisors who make hiring decisions have implemented 'preferred qualifications' to mask the prejudicial preference in their candidate selection,\" writes attorney Daniel Meachum in the complaint. \"Indeed, although African-Americans make up about 30-35 percent of the employees in the mid-level managerial and staffing positions, they are extremely under-represented at higher pay grades and senior positions.\" \nIn addition to \"glass ceilings\" for advancement, the complaint also says there are \"glass walls\" that segregate the company into divisions in which black leadership is acceptable and divisions in which it is not. \nHenley and Colbert also claim a lack of meaningful oversight in performance reviews allows managers to make evaluations and leads to African-Americans receiving lower scores. \n\"Upon information and belief, African-American employees have had to endure racial slurs and prejudicial biases from their superiors such as, 'it's hard to manage black people' and 'who would be worth more: black slaves from times past, or new slaves,\" writes Meachum. \nAccording to the complaint, high level officials at the company are aware of the problems but look the other way. \nTime Warner has not yet responded to a request for comment on the lawsuit. \nHenley and Colbert are asking the court for an injunction preventing the alleged discriminatory conduct, the award of lost wages and compensatory and punitive damages. \nThe proposed class is defined as: \"All African-American persons employed by Defendants in salaried positions and mid-level managerial positions (specifically, managerial positions inferior to the Director, Vice President, Senior Vice President positions) in the United States at any time from April of 1997, to the present, who are subject to Defendants' employment and human resources policies and practices, including, but not limited to, current or former salaried employees of Turner Broadcasting Systems, including Turner's subsidiaries, Time Warner, Inc., and Turner Services, Inc. and who have been, continue to be, or may in the future be, adversely affected by Defendants' racially discriminatory employment policies and practices.\"",

      "text": "Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- 5th Update  36:  Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- 5th Update \nBy John D. McKinnon, Thomas Gryta and Shalini Ramachandran \nThe CEOs of AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday defended their proposed $85 billion merger to lawmakers, trying to navigate a tricky political landscape in which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed hostility to the deal. \nSenators from both parties voiced wide-ranging concerns about the blockbuster deal at a hearing on Capitol Hill. The companies portrayed the union as a bulwark against the dominance of Silicon Valley giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., while promising new digital media services that will benefit consumers. \nMr. Trump hasn't commented on the merger since the election. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Wednesday they hadn't had direct communications with the Trump administration and believed the Justice Department would evaluate the merger fairly. \n\"We are anxious to put it in front of the DOJ and have the DOJ look at the facts,\" Mr. Stephenson said on the sidelines of the hearing. \nLawmakers focused their inquiries more on the complex policy questions involved in the media business than the fraught politics. Republican Senators shied away from Mr. Trump's hard-hitting populist tone and his willingness to take aim at specific businesses. Since winning the election, Mr. Trump interceded in Carrier Corp.'s plan to move an Indiana factory to Mexico and criticized the presumed price tag of Boeing Co.'s contract for presidential planes . \nThe AT&T-Time Warner combination -- putting together the country's largest pay-TV provider with one of biggest content producers -- became a political lightning rod when it was announced at the height of the presidential campaign in late October. Mr. Trump expressed opposition before the deal was even sealed. \nMessrs. Stephenson and Bewkes positioned the deal as a way to increase competition with entrenched cable- distribution companies, as well as the power of Google and Facebook, which dominate online advertising and are pushing into video services. \nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official and president of public advocacy group Public Knowledge, stressed that those internet companies rely on the wireless and broadband networks controlled by huge telecommunications companies like AT&T. \nThe deal could lead to \"potential anticompetitive favoritism,\" warned Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), amid the grilling of the two CEOs during a hearing that lasted about three hours. The hearing was in front of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights. \nAntitrust enforcers in the Trump administration will ultimately decide whether to approve the deal or try to block it. However, members of Congress can both reflect and contribute to the public mood regarding the merger of such large, high-impact businesses. \nCowen analyst Paul Gallant wrote in research note before the hearing that \"Congress's take on the deal could be more influential than normal\" in this deal review, given that enforcers will have to balance Mr. Trump's unusual opposition with Republicans' typically more hands-off approach. \nShares of Time Warner, which have been trading at a sharp discount to AT&T's$107.50 per-share offer amid Wall Street skepticism, closed Wednesday up 8 cents at $93.98 while AT&T rose $1.10, or 2.8%, to $40.45. \nThe merger's antitrust review is taking place against the backdrop of an election marked by populist surges in both parties, empowering Mr. Trump and, for a time in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nThat dynamic was noted Wednesday. The November election was an \"outrage moment\" for people who are \"sick of getting pushed around,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the top Democrat on the subcommittee, following the hearing. \"We need to respond to that.\" \nBut it isn't clear this populist sentiment will have a direct impact on lawmakers' actions, especially Republicans who are traditionally pro-business. At the hearing, GOP senators like Jeff Flake of Arizona, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and David Perdue of Georgia spoke positively about the deal. \nSeveral lawmakers on both right and left appeared uncomfortable with aspects of the deal. But they focused on well- established antitrust principles, such as whether a so-called vertical merger -- combining two companies that don't compete head-to-head -- would unduly reduce competition, rather than on the broad perils of concentrated power. \nMr. Lee, the subcommittee's chairman, said the merger could lead to price and access problems for competitors seeking Time Warner's prized content, such as HBO. The senator has previously expressed skepticism of other deals ranging from Comcast Corp.'s failed attempt to buy Time Warner Cable and AT&T's nearly $50 billion acquisition of DirecTV last year. \nThe Republican also voiced concern about AT&T's practice of zero-rating -- or exempting from data charges -- its new DirecTV streaming video service. Critics worry that the practice could turn AT&T into a powerful gatekeeper for consumers' content, he noted. \nThe deal would combine AT&T's pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner owns HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus cable networks including CNN and TNT. \nSen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) also noted questions about the merged company's ability to employ \"'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks.\" Mr. Grassley cited \"concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate,\" as well as \"concern about the merger's implications for a free and diverse press.\" \nThe comment echoed remarks from Mr. Trump in October that the deal puts \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "WASHINGTON — AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson vowed Wednesday not to restrict Time Warner’s television content from competitors once the two companies close their massive $85 billion merger. \n“We will not withhold content to disadvantage someone else,” Stephenson said at a Senate subcommittee hearing. \nThat promise could prove vitally important to thousands of TV viewers, small businesses and independent programmers that could be affected by a bigger AT&T. \nUnder the deal, which will see AT&T acquire a deep trove of content rights ranging from HBO’s TV shows to Warner Bros. films, the telecom giant could wield its expanded power as a cudgel against other businesses. That could raise costs to other TV companies or potentially allow AT&T to prioritize its own services, such as DirecTV, according to critics. \nIt could do this by forcing other companies to pay higher license fees to air its programming, for example, or by restricting other companies’ ability to show that content if they do not agree to AT&T’s terms. \n“There’s concern this acquisition will concentrate too much power in one conglomerate, resulting in higher prices and fewer programming options for consumers,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa. \nConsumer advocates argue that any discriminatory behavior on the part of AT&T would disproportionately hurt smaller TV companies. \n“I’m not worried about Comcast getting access to content,” said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. “I’m worried about the online distribution that would be competing with AT&T,” such as Netflix. \nThere is some precedent for these concerns. \nIn 1992, Congress passed a law that, among other things, required cable companies to make any content they owned available to competing technologies as well – specifically, satellite TV. The worry was that cable channels would find ways to cut satellite providers out of the content market and ultimately hurt the industry. \nDespite the rules, some content owners still found ways to discriminate by taking advantage of loopholes in the law, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge. \n“This led to Comcast and Time Warner actively buying up all local sports rights and creating ‘regional sports networks’ that they denied to [satellite] and other competitors,” said Feld. The Federal Communications Commission closed that loophole in 2010. \nAfter 20 years, federal regulators allowed those rules to expire in 2012. \nPay-TV providers such as satellite companies can still file a complaint if they believe a cable company is negotiating unfairly over content rights. But in general, the rules are a little looser than before. \nTime Warner chief executive Jeff Bewkes told lawmakers Wednesday that it would not be in the company’s interest to deny content to other companies – not when cord-cutting is forcing TV providers to distribute their programs on as many platforms as possible. \n“We would be cutting off meaningful revenue for our company,” he said. \n“There’s no incentive to do that … it would hurt our business.” Share",

      "text": "Print Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes (L) speaks with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson before a Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T ... and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts ( Reuters 2016 ) Expand \nA media outfit with ties to President-elect Donald Trump is making plans to disrupt the planned merger between AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ), charging that the combination will create a monopoly that could silence conservative commentary on the airwaves, the FOX Business Network has learned. \nContinue Reading Below \nNewsmax, a conservative news and opinion website with a growing television component, is looking to short circuit the $85.4 billion merger as it plans an all-out public affairs war to convince Congress and the President-elect to nix the deal, its chief executive Chris Ruddy said in an interview with FOX Business. \nRuddy is voicing some of the same concerns levied by Trump during his presidential campaign. “As an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said at a rally in October. \nDuring his successful yet contentious presidential campaign, Trump often feuded with CNN over its coverage. Since being elected president, Trump hasn’t voiced an opinion on the merger. \n“I hear AT&T and Time Warner have hired most of the meaningful lobbyists in Washington to get this deal done,” Ruddy told FOX Business. “But I know Trump has concerns and many in Congress will agree that AT&T has too much power to decide what content Americans can watch.” \nPart of the allure of the deal, of course, is the marriage of AT&T’s cable and wireless distribution services with content supplied by Time Warner, which owns cable news network CNN and HBO. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nBut Ruddy said given AT&T’s size and scope, it has the ability to squeeze out competing voices in favor of what he considers the liberalism of CNN, which will ultimately hurt consumers. \nHe pointed to his own negotiations with AT&T involving getting Newsmax television on AT&T’s DirectTV satellite distribution system. Ruddy said talks between the two sides to have Newsmax get back on the system recently became strained after AT&T announced the Time Warner deal in October. \nA spokesman for AT&T didn’t return a call for comment. \nOn Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust held a hearing on the proposed deal. The committee oversees various federal agencies such as the Federal Communications Committee and the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which will render a verdict on the transaction. \nLawmakers at times appeared skeptical about the deal’s merits; some appeared to see justification in the notion that the combination will give AT&T too much power as a monopoly to set higher prices for consumers and possibly limit the distribution of content to favor Time Warner’s programming. \nThat said, it was unclear whether lawmakers or even Trump, now that he’s been elected president, will expend political capital to kill the merger. At least one witness during the hearing, internet entrepreneur Mark Cuban, said cable companies like AT&T no longer have a monopoly on the distribution of information since consumers get so much of their content on websites like Facebook ( FB ) and Google ( GOOGL ). \nBut Ruddy believes he and his team will have Trump’s ear on the issue. The two met during Thanksgiving at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach estate as part of an informal gathering of people. \nRuddy says he will discuss the matter with Trump at some point soon and he will continue to press key lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee to kill the deal. \nA spokeswoman for Trump didn’t return calls for comment.

      "text": "Michael Reagan: Trump Right to Worry About AT&T, Time Warner Merger \nAT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson (AP Photo) By Michael Reagan | Wednesday, 07 Dec 2016 06:24 AM Close A A \nThe Senate Judiciary committee will hold a significant hearing Wednesday on the proposed $84 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner, which owns CNN. \nAT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson will be testifying, as well as others, who support or oppose this merger. \nThe senators should be prepared to ask Stephenson some tough questions – because allowing this merger will have important implications for a free press and American democracy for many years to come. \nDuring the recent election, presidential candidate Donald Trump said, \"AT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nSince then, a number of news reports – no doubt pushed by AT&T – are suggesting President Trump will have a laissez-faire approach and the deal will go through. \nKnowing of the grassroots concerns many conservative leaders share, I doubt President Trump or Congress will rubber stamp this deal. \nTrump was right when he warned of the massive concentration of media power in a few hands. \nConsider: 90 percent of cable television networks are currently owned by just six companies: Time Warner (CNN), Viacom, CBS, ABC (Disney), Comcast (NBC) and 21st Century Fox. \nOf these major conglomerates, only Fox gives conservatives a fair shake. New, independent networks like Newsmax TV are on the rise, but the big media still controls, dangerously, the flow of information to the public. Trump was their most recent victim. \nA combination of AT&T and Time Warner will be toxic, further constricting competition and press diversity. \nAT&T is a giant media company which also owns DirecTV. It was also a major corporate backer of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. It strongly opposed Trump's election. \nTime Warner's CNN was nothing short of the \"Clinton News Network\"– a 24-hour propaganda machine spewing out anti-Trump and anti-Republican venom. \nRight now, AT&T has 26.3 million pay TV subscribers through DirecTV and AT&T U-verse service – controlling about 25 percent of the U.S. cable market. It is the largest cable/satellite operator in the U.S., bar none. \nBy owning the largest chunk of cable home distribution, AT&T will obviously be in a position to favor their own channels like CNN, over other channels like Fox News, Newsmax and many others. \nThe ability for AT&T to discriminate against other cable networks that could compete against CNN or their other networks would be endless. \nAT&T, which controls a huge percent of the mobile telephone market, could exempt its mobile customers from data usage charges if they stream CNN content, but streaming independent news networks like Newsmax might continue to count against high-speed data caps. \nFrankly, I am usually in favor of government keeping its hands-off business activities. \nBut there are exceptions. \nWhen certain businesses act like monopolies or near monopolies, have unusual access to publicly owned or controlled distribution systems, and get preferential access to broadcast/satellite airwaves, then government has a compelling need to insure that such media companies act in a fair way to insure competition and the diversity of public opinion. \nWe already know vertical integration of cable operators undermines competition. \nFor example, when Comcast completed its merger of NBC back in 2011, it promised it would not favor its own channels over other channels. \nFor example, it agreed to a condition that would have put the Bloomberg financial news channel on equal footing with CNBC across its distribution platform. \nIt is well known Comcast never honored the condition. For this and other reasons, Comcast's recent effort to merge with Time Warner Cable was rejected. \nAT&T has not demonstrated, in my opinion, a real desire to support the public's interest in the areas of competition, diversity and fairness. \nRecently, the Department of Justice sued AT&T and its subsidiary DirecTV for price fixing and illegally colluding to harm consumers. \nThere are many reasons why the FCC and Congress need to handle this merger with intense scrutiny and remember this is not a business decision, but a matter that affects our democratic institutions. \nPresident-elect Trump knows this firsthand. \nMichael Reagan is the son of President Reagan and chairman of the Reagan Legacy Foundation. A New York Times best-selling author, he is a commentator for Newsmax. \n© 2016 Newsmax. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nA proposed $85.4 billion merger between Dallas-based AT&T and Time Warner drew the ire of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign, and the CEOs of both companies sparred with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday over the deal. \nAT&T, the largest telecommunications company in the world by revenue, announced in October its intention to buy Time Warner, the world’s third-largest entertainment company. \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, along with Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire Mark Cuban, defended the merger on Capitol Hill, arguing the merger allows AT&T to compete with tech behemoths such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. \nEach of the largest content companies present content algorithmically; at least with Time Warner and AT&T we get to pick the content we want. Mark Cuban, founder of broadcast.com \n“Neither is in any sort of dominant position by themselves,” Cuban testified. “We need more companies to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. \n“Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to compete with the companies I mentioned,” he continued. “Each of the largest content companies present content algorithmically; at least with Time Warner and AT&T we get to pick the content we want.” \nCuban was one of the pioneers of broadcasting content on the web, a key component of the potential merger between AT&T and Time Warner. He founded broadcast.com, a web-streaming service intended to broadcast Indiana Hoosier basketball and acquired by Yahoo in 1998 for $5.7 billion in stock. \nDemocratic Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar, both of Minnesota, and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut questioned the merger’s merits. They raised concerns that Time Warner’s content could be distributed exclusively to AT&T customers, which would limit options for consumers and potentially raise prices. \n“When you have these hearings, you get stuff on the record,” Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing. “They said on the record that Time Warner wouldn’t discriminate where the content went. They said on the record that they hoped prices would go down.” \nThe ultimate decision over whether to green-light the mega merger lies with the Department of Justice and potentially the Federal Communications Commission, which could choose to review the deal. \nThe ultimate decision over whether to green-light the mega merger lies with the Department of Justice and potentially the Federal Communications Commission, which could choose to review the deal. \n“It’s not a matter of what I prefer. It’s a matter of whether we assume the licenses or not,” Stephenson said as he left the hearing room. “It’s a matter of law.” \nIn 2015, Comcast called off a potential merger with Time Warner after the Department of Justice began to file an anti-trust lawsuit over the deal. \nFranken and Klobuchar are concerned with potential costs of the deal for consumers. \n“You can have deals that help consumers, deals that don’t and this one is very complicated in terms of where that outcome is,” Klobuchar said. \nBut Blumenthal went a step further, questioning President-elect Trump’s threats of blocking the merger based on CNN’s coverage of him. CNN is owned by Time Warner. \nYou can have deals that help consumers, deals that don’t and this one is very complicated in terms of where that outcome is. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. \n“To threaten more vigorous or adverse enforcement against a particular company because he doesn’t like the news coverage is a threat to the First Amendment,” Blumenthal said. He added that while he likes Trump’s interest in anti-trust issues, he is worried that the president-elect’s interest comes solely from wanting to control media coverage. \nBoth Stephenson and Bewkes said Trump’s statements will have no impact on CNN’s coverage. \nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE \n“I want to get back to the merger,” North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said after Blumenthal’s remarks, drawing laughter from his fellow Republicans. \nIn general, Republicans are less skeptical of the merger, although Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights Subcommittee chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked pointed questions about potential conditions that could be placed on the merger by the DOJ and FCC. \n“When Comcast and others put conditions in place to guarantee they would have access, shouldn’t we be concerned about the possibility that any conditions we put in place here might now be followed?” Lee asked. \nCuban was relatively subdued during the hearing, but when asked about the president-elect after the hearing he pulled out a typical rhetorical burst and likened Trump to a first-round NBA draft pick. \n“Donald Trump is our No. 1 draft pick,” Cuban said. “He’s the No. 1 pick, he’s who we put our hopes and dreams with and we’re going to believe in him. Right now it’s a little bit easier because we haven’t played a game yet. There’s no reason to rush to judgment or come to any conclusions.” \nCuban was a noted critic of Trump during the campaign, calling the president-elect “lazy” in July. \n“Let’s see what happens on Jan. 21 and then we’ll go from there,” Cuban said. “I hope he’s a superstar and I hope everything turns out the way we all hope it will.”",

CST December 07, 2016 Jeffrey Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner (Photo: Lionel Cironneau, AP) \nNEW YORK—AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and his Time Warner counterpart Jeffrey Bewkes did their best to convince a Senate subcommittee that their proposed $85.4 billion merger will ultimately be good for consumers. \nIt wasn't an easy sell. \nSeveral GOP and Democratic lawmakers have voiced antitrust concerns surrounding the proposed merger, as did candidate Donald Trump, who said the blockbuster deal would concentrate too much power in the hands of too few. \nBut AT&T has expressed optimism that regulators would ultimately decide in its favor. The Justice Dept. in a new Trump administration is expected to take the lead on the deal, though the Federal Communications Commission may also weigh in. \nThe billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban also appeared before the Senate subcommittee, as a proponent of the deal. \nTelecom giant AT&T is the nation’s second largest wireless carrier and also a major player in the pay-TV space as the owner of DirecTV. Time Warner has HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN among the assets in its entertainment and media portfolio. A potential concern is that AT&T might give preferential treatment to its own content, either by withholding access or raising the costs of such programming to rivals. \nHow Donald Trump as president might view big time mergers remains to be seen. The President-elect met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son on Tuesday, possibly raising the possiblity that the thwarted merger talks between T-Mobile, and Softbank-owned Sprint might be revived. \nStephenson says he has not spoken to the Trump transition team about the deal. \nMeantime, in responding to a question about criticism of CNN by Trump, Bewkes maintained that it would uphold journalistic independence. \nDuring his remarks to the Senate, Stephenson insisted that the deal will not eliminate any competitors from any market. \"What this merger is not about is consolidation either in media or telecom,\" Stephenson said, adding that competition would actually increase, particularly against cable companies. \n\"Our intent is to disrupt the existing pay-TV model. We want to get the most content to the most people at the lowest cost. And we want consumers to pay for their content once and then watch it anywhere at any time. Every episode, every season on whatever device they choose.\" \nBoth Stephenson and Bewkes said that their respective companies have a stellar track record in complying with any of the conditions attached to prior mergers, suggesting they would do the same if conditions are imposed on the deal that is now under scrutiny. \nCuban says that as separate companies, neither AT&T or Time Warner are in a dominant position. \"We need more companies with the ability to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook,\" which he thinks a combined AT&T-Time Warner would be better equipped to do. \nBut in speaking out against the deal, Gene Kimmelman, the CEO of Public Knowledge says, \"It is the diversity of programming owned by different people over different platforms that fuels our democracy. No one has said it better than the President-elect. It is in that environment we urge you look at this carefully and enforcers not to take risk with a transaction that could be harmful to that democractic process and consumer's pocketbooks.\" \nFollow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter ",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Senators scrutinizing the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner homed in on brass tacks with the companies’ CEOs. OK, you say this $85.4 billion mega-deal will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay?\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, “We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.” He said, though, that it wasn’t possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company’s DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services.\nRelated Articles Biz Break: DirecTV Now set to enter streaming television fray DirecTV wants to be the next online substitute for cable Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. “Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,” Stephenson testified.\nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever.\n“I have yet to be convinced” that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.\nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, “The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.”\nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it.\nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”\nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns.",

      "text": "Lawmakers grill AT&T, Time Warner execs on $85B merger By Ali Breland - 12/07/16 04:10 PM EST 0 © Getty Images \nLawmakers on Wednesday grilled the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner on their proposed $85.4 billion merger during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. \nDemocrats raised concerns about the merger's effect on consumers and expressed worries that it could result in higher prices and fewer options. ADVERTISEMENT AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, insisted the deal would help AT&T provide lower rates to consumers and said they had \"no incentive\" to create more restrictive pricing and packing plans.\nStephenson cited AT&T’s previous merger with DirecTV, which he said had clearly benefitted consumers. \n“We now offer 100 channels for $35 [on DirecTV],” the AT&T CEO said. “That is innovation that results in lower prices for consumers.” \nAT&T's proposed purchase of Time Warner, first announced in October, would link a telecommunications powerhouse with one of the country's largest players in the entertainment industry. Time Warner includes many of the most popular networks and studios in the country, including HBO, CNN and Warner Brothers. \nDemocrats pressed the executives on whether the merger would give the companies an unfair advantage over their competitors. \n“There would greater leverage in negotiation with content distributors as a result of this deal,” Sen. Al Franken Al Franken Overnight Tech: AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend merger before Congress | More tech execs join Trump team | Republican details path to undoing net neutrality Lawmakers grill AT&T, Time Warner execs on B merger Dems press Trump to keep Obama overtime rule MORE (D-Minn.) said to the executives. “Do you think AT&T would benefit from using this as leverage?” \nBut the executives insisted that the merger was needed to help the companies keep up with an already competitive marketplace. \n“We don’t have the market power to do that,” Bewkes responded. “The market is too competitive for that.” \nWhile Franken and Democrats expressed skepticism at the executives arguments in favor of the merger, Republicans appeared to be more sympathetic. \nSens. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Thom Tillis \n“It’s not a consolidation,” said Perdue. “We need to remember that as a committee. Vertical integration is nothing new.” \n“It’s capitalism,” he added. \nMany consumer groups have expressed concerns about the merger. \nGene Kimmelman, CEO of Public Knowledge, a public interest group dealing with market competition issues, said it would give AT&T an unfair advantage over content providers. \n“There has been a history of this kind of favoritism and discrimination,” he testified before the panel. \nKimmelman also dismissed comparisons of the AT&T-Time Warner proposal with AT&T's merger with DirecTV. \n“In the DirecTV deal, there were clear efficiencies,” Kimmelman told the panel. “I am extremely pleased to see ... companies take advantage of those efficiencies and offer lower prices. I don’t see that opportunity here.” \nAT&T and Time Warner also had some high-profile defenders at the hearing. \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban, who testified, said the merger was necessary for the companies to remain competitive in a changing media landscape. \n“This merger is not only one of survival and opportunity, but also needed for consumers. We need more companies that can compete with Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook,” Cuban said. \n“Alone, it would be very difficult if not impossible to compete with the companies I just mentioned.” \nLooming over the proposed merger is the election of Donald Trump Donald Trump Former Labor secretary to Trump: Stop being 'petty, thin-skinned and vindictive' Report: Trump eyes keeping a stake in business Congress to clear path for Mattis MORE . The president-elect on the campaign trail criticized the merger, saying that he wouldn't approve it if he was in office. Trump said such mergers tied up too much power in the hands of a few companies. \nDuring the hearing, Stephenson told the panel that he not been in contact with the president-elect. \nThe hearing was the first opportunity for lawmakers to weigh in on the merger proposal, which faces a long path and will come under tough scrutiny from regulators, including the Justice Department. \nThe Federal Communications Commission could also end up conducting its own review if AT&T decides to keep Time Warner's broadcasting licenses. \nStephenson said in the hearing that AT&T is currently reviewing the licenses to determine their plans.",

The lawsuit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia says there has been a pattern of discrimination against blacks, particularly black males, in evaluations, compensation and promotions, at CNN, its parent Turner and Time Warner. The lawsuit says African-Americans make up 30 to 35 percent of employees in mid-level managerial and staffing positions at Turner and CNN but are underrepresented at higher pay grades and in senior positions.\nThe plaintiffs are seeking lost wages and other damages.

WASHINGTON — AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner will increase innovation and bring “better-priced options” to consumers upset by high cable bills, AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told lawmakers Wednesday. “We want consumers to pay for their content once and watch it anywhere, any time,” he said at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner's movies and television shows to competitors. She said AT&T could favor its own shows over independent content. Time Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, a Democrat, expressed the same concern and pressed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes on whether the combined company would raise rates to others who would broadcast its content. “It would not have the incentive nor would it have the ability,” Bewkes responded. AT&T's Stephenson agreed. “It would make no sense ... to do that.” Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who chairs the antitrust panel, said the review by the Justice Department would be “very fact-intensive.” “Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,” Lee said. The Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a proposed transaction, it must persuade a judge to agree. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he has “serious concerns about this transaction. I have yet to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks.” But he was concerned that President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked. “What troubles me is that the president-elect has said that his Justice Department will enforce a different standard of law depending” on whether he is angered by news coverage, said Blumenthal, calling the notion “absolutely abhorrent.” Billionaire investor and Pittsburgh native Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create a new competitor against large companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Facebook.",

      "text": "AT&T and Time Warner chiefs appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to help sell their $85 billion merger — but a Democratic lawmaker put the two execs on the hot seat over whether CNN would preserve its independence.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he feared Time Warner’s cable news network would become a pro-Donald Trump outlet in order to win approval from the president-elect’s Department of Justice.\nThe Senate hearing was the first time government officials have heard from the chief executives directly about their rationale for a combination.\nThe merger would combine AT&T’s 100 million-plus subscribers with one of the world’s biggest media companies, whose lineup also includes the Warner Bros. movie studio and HBO.\nTrump, an outspoken critic of CNN due to what he has called its biased coverage of his presidential run, said on the campaign trail he was not in favor of the deal because it would result in “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”\nBlumenthal asked AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes for assurances that CNN’s independence wouldn’t be sacrificed for a regulatory rubber stamp.\nSEE ALSO \nAT&T/Time Warner could become nation's largest advertiser :0 The new AT&T/Time Warner won’t just be out in the... AT&T/Time Warner could become nation's largest advertiser They both confirmed it would not be.\n“For a public official to use the blunt, heavy instrument of law enforcement to try to silence and change news coverage by a news department is abhorrent, would you agree?” Blumenthal asked Bewkes.\n“The independence of our journalism, we have always vigorously defended that and we will continue to defend it,” Bewkes said.\nBlumenthal, a member of the subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights, questioned Bewkes and Stephenson at length about his concerns that the public interest be protected surrounding CNN’s news role.\nBoth executives said the deal could lead to lower costs, better service and innovation.",

Investors bought stocks that do well in times of faster economic growth, like technology and industrial companies, but they also snapped up stocks that pay large dividends. \nStocks moved steadily higher throughout the day after a mixed open. Phone and real estate companies made the largest gains, but the rally moved into high gear in the afternoon, as airlines, railroads and trucking companies soared. \nInvestors took the rally in transportation stocks as a sign of optimism about economic growth. Technology and consumer-focused companies also jumped. Biotech drug companies took steep losses after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants to reduce drug prices. \nThe transportation sector reached an all-time high for the first time in two years. Julian Emanuel , an equity strategist for UBS, said investors were pleased to see that record because they see it as a sign businesses will start spending more, which would bolster economic growth. \n\"The consumer has really been the engine of the economy,\" he said. \"The missing piece has been the corporate side, the industrial side.\" \nThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 297.84 points, or 1.5 percent, to 19,549.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 29.12 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,241.35. The Nasdaq composite recovered from an early loss to rise 60.76 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,393.76. That was about five points short of its all-time high. \nThe Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks also recovered from an early loss and set its own a record as it gained 11.84 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,364.51. \nU.S. government bond prices rose, sending yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.34 percent from 2.39 percent. Bond yields have risen sharply since the summer but have slipped in the last few days. \nThe lower bond yields have helped stocks that are seen as bond substitutes, like real estate investment trusts. Their big dividends are attractive to investors who want income, so when bond yields fall, investors often turn to those stocks. Industrial real estate company Prologis rose $1.62, or 3.2 percent, to $52.32 and Verizon picked up $1.02, or 2 percent, to $51.38. \nAT&T also jumped as a Senate antitrust panel scrutinized its planned $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, the parent of HBO. Legislators asked if the deal would improve competition and reduce prices for consumers, as the companies say it will. AT&T gained $1.10, or 2.8 percent, to $40.45 and Time Warner edged up 8 cents to $93.98. \nIBM led technology companies higher as it rose $4.44, or 2.8 percent, to $164.79. Today's Deals",
