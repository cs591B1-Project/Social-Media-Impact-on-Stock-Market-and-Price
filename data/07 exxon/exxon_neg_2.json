      "text": "Comments Sign up for our Energy newsletter \nCALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 23 (UPI) -- A division of Exxon Mobil announced Wednesday it started drilling its first well targeting reserves off the coast of Liberia. \nExxon's Liberian affiliate is working on developing the Mesurado-1 exploration well off the coast of Liberia alongside Canadian Overseas Petroleum Ltd. The Canadian company said in a statement the well is located about 50 miles off the coast of Liberia and \"is the first well operated by ExxonMobil offshore Liberia.\" \nA survey of the oil and gas potential off the coast of West Africa from the U.S. Geological Survey put the mean estimate of potential reserves at 3.2 billion barrels of oil and 23.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. \nEnergy companies are examining frontier basins off the West African coast. Australian energy company Woodside Petroleum recently moved into oil basins in the region that are considered some of the more lucrative prospects in West Africa. According to Africa-focused Far Ltd., the SNE basin off the coast of Senegal could potentially hold more than 100 million barrels of oil. The company in 2014 started a drilling program in the nearby FAN-1 reservoir in deep waters off the coast of Senegal, which FAR at the time said could be a game changer for the region. \nNew drilling in Liberia came on the same day as one of the pioneering energy companies in the region leaves the country behind. African Petroleum said Wednesday its production-sharing contracts expired and won't be extended. \nLast year, the company's CEO expressed delight with the results of a third-party assessment of reserves off the coast of Liberia, which raised the initial reserve potential by 33 percent. \nAfrican Petroleum said it's been working since June to amend the terms of its contract and bring in new industry partners for Liberia. \n\"The company has been seeking partners on these production-sharing contracts for some time; however, the company has received little industry interest as a result of the challenging market conditions for exploration activity and the lack of commercial discoveries in Liberia,\" it said in a statement .",

      "text": "Home > Energy & Commodities Update: Four critically injured in fire at Exxon’s giant Baton Rouge refinery A fire hit ExxonMobil Corp's refinery and chemical plant complex in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company said on Tuesday. PHOTO: AFP Nov 23, 2016 7:39 AM \n[HOUSTON] Four people were in critical condition after a fire hit a giant Exxon Mobil refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Tuesday, a local hospital said. \nThe incident was the fourth in two days to hit Gulf refineries, cutting fuel production in the region at plants with combined capacity of over 1 million barrels per day. January gasoline futures jumped as much as 0.75 per cent late on Tuesday. \nExxon said the fire was extinguished around 4pm (2200 GMT) and the company had accounted for all staff at the refinery. \nBaton Rouge General Hospital said four people in critical condition were admitted to the regional burn unit, a hospital spokeswoman said. \nThe fire broke out at an 18,750-bpd alyklation unit, which produces high-octane gasoline components, as five people prepared to restart it following repair work, sources familiar with the plant’s operations said. \nA compressor blew out during the restart attempt, the sources said, setting off the blaze. \nTwo operators and two contractors were injured, the sources said. The two operators are women. \nAn Exxon spokesman said details of the fire were under investigation. \nThe refinery is the fourth-largest in the United States, with capacity to refine 502,500 bpd in crude oil. \nThe Baton Rouge plant was hit by flooding in August, forcing Exxon to shut down one of the crude processing units and curtail output at another. The plant returned to normal output in September. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "  Four workers remain in critical condition after Exxon fire 2 hours 48 minutes 41   4:47   By: Share: \nBATON ROUGE- Four workers burned during a fire at Exxon refinery Tuesday remain in critical condition at the Baton Rouge General Burn Unit. Exxon is mum on what caused the fire. A watchdog group over the petro chemical industry is blasting Exxon tonight. That group is making bold claims saying Exxon isn't saying much because it doesn't want the public to really know what happened yesterday. Raford Varnado was inside his home when his house shook. \"I heard a big loud boom and it rattled the house,\" Varnado said. \"We decided to go out, and when we went out we heard a lot of ambulances coming in to go there.\"Getting those ambulances to area hospitals was a challenge for EMS. Paramedics had to use back roads to navigate through the rush hour and holiday traffic. \"We do rely on dispatchers a good bit to give us info on road closures, construction or just heavy traffic flow at different times of the day we rely on them to relay that info to crews on the street,\" Nick McDonner said.Tonight, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade is raising questions over the most recent fire. The organization says accidents are not uncommon at the Exxon refinery. Over a ten year period, the group logged 890 accidents, about one per week. We requested an interview from Exxon today. A spokeswoman said there would be no interviews, but did say their thoughts and prayers are with those affected. \"My heart goes out to Glenda and her family,\" A longtime retired Exxon employee said. \"I knew Glenda since she got hired in. I pray for her and a quick recovery for her. She was a good friend and a good worker.\"This longtime Exxon employee did not want to be identified, but is rallying behind those who were injured. She said workers there go through extensive safety training, but even that training can't get you ready for some accidents. \"The things that are in the pipes to allow us to have the life that we have, drive cars, and have plastics and things like that... some when they hit the atmosphere can flame,\" the employee said. \"You can prepare for just about anything but sometimes the uncalled for happens.\"We're told the fire yesterday involved Isobutane.

Obviously we didn't achieve that today, and that's what makes this a sad day,\" said Mark Northcutt, refinery plant manager. \nFour people were transported to the hospital with critical injuries. An unknown number of employees also suffered minor injuries. \nNorthcutt said plant officials are unsure how the fire started and will begin an investigation immediately. For now, he said their biggest focus is the injured workers. \n\"Right now what's important is, frankly, it's not the investigation, it's the individuals who were impacted and our hearts and prayers go out to them,\" said Northcutt. \nA spokeswoman with Baton Rouge General Hospital confirmed all four of the critical patients are being treated at its facility’s burn unit. The names of the injured people were not released. \nEarly reports from first responders suggested the victims may have been injured by isobutane, a flammable gas that is similar to propane, after a fire broke out at the plant around 4 p.m. \nEMS and the Baton Rouge Fire Department were among emergency crews who responded. BRFD's hazmat team was on hand to monitor any dangerous chemicals that may have been released by the blaze. Crews reported no threat to the public. \nAnytime there is an incident inside the facility, hazmat teams will respond and monitor to make sure the air quality stays safe for citizens living in the area. \n\"They did that in this instance and of course picked up no readings that we can tell at this time,\" said BRFD spokesman, Curt Monte. \nCopyright 2016 WAFB .

      "text": "By Erwin Seba HOUSTON (Reuters) - Four people were in critical condition after a fire hit a giant Exxon Mobil refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Tuesday, a local hospital said.\nThe incident was the fourth in two days to hit Gulf refineries, cutting fuel production in the region at plants with combined capacity of over 1 million barrels per day. January gasoline futures jumped as much as 0.75 percent late on Tuesday.\nExxon said the fire was extinguished around 4 p.m. and the company had accounted for all staff at the refinery.\nBaton Rouge General Hospital said four people in critical condition were admitted to the regional burn unit, a hospital spokeswoman said.\nThe fire broke out at an 18,750-bpd alyklation unit, which produces high-octane gasoline components, as five people prepared to restart it following repair work, sources familiar with the plant's operations said.\nA compressor blew out during the restart attempt, the sources said, setting off the blaze.\nTwo operators and two contractors were injured, the sources said. The two operators are women.\nAn Exxon spokesman said details of the fire were under investigation. The refinery is the fourth-largest in the United States, with capacity to refine 502,500 bpd in crude oil.\nThe Baton Rouge plant was hit by flooding in August, forcing Exxon to shut down one of the crude processing units and curtail output at another. The plant returned to normal output in September.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Catherine Ngai; Editing by Andrew Hay and Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "Exxon has been a first choice for institutional investors because of its stable performance over the decades—and of course, its dividend policy. But times are changing, and investors today are paying more attention to climate change and a company’s preparedness for the seemingly unavoidable transition to a lower-carbon economy in most parts of the world. The latest report from CDP should worry the top management of Exxon and that of its peer Chevron. It should worry them very much. One must adapt to survive— a fact that Old Spice,…",

This growth in demand is a result of increasing world population and an improvement in living standards in developing countries. Even though new and renewable energy sources are gaining popularity around the world, petroleum fuels still remain the major energy source the world over. This trend is expected to continue for the next few decades, and will have all sectors of the petroleum industry as its beneficiaries. \nThe oil that is extracted from the earth undergoes a number of processes that transforms the crude oil into various useful products such as petrol, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene etc. These processes are carried out by refineries having varying degrees of complexity. Refineries are classified as topping, hydroskimming, cracking and coking refineries based on their complexity. Refining forms a major activity of the downstream petroleum industry. \nThe refining industry has been affected by falling crude oil prices. Players in the Asian and European markets are seeing higher margins while the North American players are seeing a reduction in their margins. The transportation industry, which is the biggest consumer of oil worldwide is witnessing a growth, especially in developing countries like China and India. \nSome of the key players in this market are Exxon Mobil Corporation, Shell, Sinopec, BP and Saudi Aramco. \nReport Structure:",

Sweet Monday, November 28, 2016 Credit: Faith Ninivaggi ON THE GRILL: Attorney General Maura Healey, seen last Monday at a State House event, is investigating whether Exxon Mobil has been deceiving consumers about fossil fuel. Photo by Faith Ninivaggi. comments Attorney General Maura Healey is pushing back on a federal judge’s order that she be in Texas next month to be grilled by attorneys for Exxon Mobil, claiming it takes “exceptional circumstances” to demand an official of her stature be deposed.\n“Well-established prece- dent requires that depositions of high-ranking officials only occur in exceptional circumstances that are not present here,” Healey’s legal team argues in a motion to vacate Judge Ed Kinkeade’s ruling they filed Saturday in U.S. District Court in Dallas.\nKinkeade earlier this month ordered that Healey appear in his courtroom Dec. 13 to answer questions about her probe of the oil giant’s climate-change research so he can determine whether her motivation is politically based.\nBut as Healey’s lawyers note, her deposition would take place nearly a week after a Superior Court judge in Massachusetts is to hear Exxon Mobil’s Dec. 7 argument for dismissing the civil investigation demand she slapped on the company in April.\n“Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state government investigation to confound and effectively halt state law enforcement efforts by filing suit in the target’s favored federal forum and permitting the target to ‘investigate the investigator’ — even in the absence of personal jurisdiction,” Healey’s attorneys said.\nExxon Mobil, they claimed, already has shown the “contentious, even baiting” hand that will be in play at Healey’s deposition by asking her in a prior court-ordered discovery interrogatory, “State, identify, and describe the basis for Your belief that investigating a single company will help combat or limit climate change.”\nExxon Mobil, headquartered in Texas, has asked Kinkeade to stop Healey’s probe on First Amendment and other grounds. Healey, whose probe is looking at whether the company has been deceiving consumers and investors about the environmental hazards of fossil fuel for decades, wants Kinkeade to dismiss the company’s petition for injunction.\nKinkeade has given Exxon Mobil until tomorrow to file its response to Healey’s motion to stop her deposition from going forward.",

      "text": "What Next For Exxon's Takeover Of InterOil Nov.28.16 Shareholdersunite Summary \nExxon's takeover bid for InterOil was effectively blocked by a Yukon Appeals Court in a quite remarkable ruling. \nWe look at the implications and assess the likely roads ahead. \nWhile we still think the deal is on, we might have to wait until mid next year for more certainty though. After a take-over bid for InterOil (NYSE: IOC ) by OilSearch (OSH) was topped by Exxon (NYSE: XON ), even paying the $60M fine on behalf of InterOil to OilSearch. The InterOil board proposed shareholders to accept the Exxon offer, as they had done with the OilSearch offer. Shareholders approved with roughly 80% of the shares voted (the latter amounted to 72% of outstanding shares), with the notable exception of founder and former InterOil CEO Phil Mulacek and roughly 10% of the shares dissented with Mulacek. The Exxon deal $45 per InterOil share in shares Exxon. A Contingent Resource Payment (NYSE: CRP ) of $7.07 per share for every Tcfe of gas above 6.2Tcfe but capped at 10Tcfe and a maximum of $26.87 a share. Yukon Appeals Court While the deal was approved after a fairness hearing, Mulacek (after blasting the deal as vastly inadequate earlier) appealed and on November 4 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and effectively denied the approval of the Exxon takeover. You can read that appeal's verdict in its entirety here . The basis of that decision was twofold: Corporate governance: there was no board commission separate of management to conduct a separate review (as there had been with the OilSearch takeover bid). More seriously, management board members stand to make substantial gains through their change of ownership clauses in their employment contracts. The written fairness opinion by Morgan Stanley was basically empty, it contained no analysis and did not make any effort to value the CRP. What's more, a substantial part of Morgan Stanley (undisclosed) compensation was contingent on the successful conclusion of the Exxon takeover. The low court which initially approved the deal argued that approving shareholders was a sufficient condition for the deal to go ahead (judges are no business people). However, the appeals court argued that shareholders were not able to make an informed choice as the information provided by InterOil and the fairness opinion by Morgan Stanley was not adequate, objective and it was riddled with conflicts of interest (as was management, with the CEO standing to gain a huge $39 change of ownership bonus). This is quite remarkable, for at least two reasons: It's rare that a takeover bid by the likes of Exxon, having achieved the backing of the full board of the target company and its shareholders, is blocked in a court on other grounds than those of competition concerns. This remarkable fact reflects the extraordinary sloppiness and conflicts of interests by InterOil's management and board. What happens next? Is the deal still on? Well, here are some possibilities: IOC/XON try to salvage the deal by remedying the deficiencies. They commission a new fairness report, commissioning a new expert with a flat fee, organize a proper meeting of the independent board members and issue a new shareholder vote. XON sweetens its offer or goes for a hostile takeover. The deal is off. It doesn't help that IOC management is extremely sparse with communication, but the indications are that they consider the deal still on. In the MD&A of the latest quarterly filing they qualify the deal as 'pending.' That should imply we get a new independent report, a fairness opinion and proper board action. One immediate complication is the new fairness opinion, based on a newly issued independent report. What are the requirements for such report? The wording of the ruling suggest an asset approach, rather than a market value approach. The wording of the ruling (point 34): \nIn my view, a board engaged in a proper and robust review and consideration of a proposed transformative transaction should have obtained independent advice on the value of the CRP, the Elk-Antelope asset, and the 10 CFE's impact on the CRP. Moreover, those estimates of value should have been disclosed to shareholders so that shareholders could decide whether the US$45 plus the capped CRP adequately reflected the value of the company. In the absence of this guidance, shareholders would not know the value of the Elk-Antelope asset, what they gave up by agreeing to capped the CRP at 10 CFE, and whether the terms of the Transaction fairly reflected the value of the Elk-Antelope asset. A market value approach was the basis for InterOil to recommend the deal as the Exxon bid exceeded the market value of the company at the time. An asset value approach complicates things. This suggests the need for an independent appraisal report. There are independent appraisal reports, most notably those from GLJ, which is InterOil's official resource appraisal firm. According to the latest (2015 year-end) GLJ assessment there is 10.2Tcfe (2C contingent gas) in Elk/Antelope (up from 9.9Tcfe at the end of 2014). But there is also a report commissioned by OilSearch in order to settle a contingent payment to Civelli for the takeover of the 22.3% of its stake in PRL15, the license under which the Elk/Antelope field falls (from OilSearch ): \nOil Search said on Friday that Gaffney Cline & Associates and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, have concluded their independent certification of the Elk-Antelope fields, located in PRL 15, in Papua New Guinea. The two certifiers noted the average 2C resource is 6.43 tcf of raw gas and is consistent with the 6.5 tcf of raw gas calculated by Oil Search as part of its recent assessment of the fields, the company said in its statement... \"Importantly, the high level of 1C resource, of approximately 6 tcf, should facilitate project financing and LNG marketing,\" the company said... \"The key next step is to commence drilling the Antelope 7 well in the third quarter, which is targeting an additional 1-2 tcf of gas in the western flank of the field,\" Botten said. You'll notice quite a difference between the GLJ and the Gaffney Cline/Netherland Sewell report. Whether the field is a pressure depletion drive or a water drive could be one item that could explain this difference. A pressure depletion drive has a much higher recovery factor. We know that GLJ assumes little water drive as they point out that the Elk/Antelope aquifer pressure is 460 psi higher than the regional aquifer pressure. This is mentioned in the 2009 GLJ Report and is proof that the Antelope fault block is sealed off from the regional aquifer. Then there is the independent report by Paradigm commissioned by Mulacek (we've heard it values InterOil at $92 per share but can't provide you with a link to the report), and by mid next year we'll have the resource appraisal commissioned by Total (NYSE: TOT ) and InterOil to determine the size of the Total resource payments. These reports differ quite substantially. Instead of arguing for or against one or the other (a pretty difficult task only an older version of the GJL report is public), we'll argue that the most relevant report is the one yet to be produced. Total interim resource evaluation This is the upcoming resource evaluation provided by the framework of Total's purchase of 40.1% stake in PRL15. This is actually the average of two independent certifications (yet to be commissioned). Why is this the most relevant report? Well, first of all, it is scheduled anyway and will commence right after the drilling and testing of the Antelope 7 appraisal well has been terminated (this is presently ongoing). Second, it determines the size of the interim resource payment from Total to InterOil (or to Exxon, if they manage to resuscitate the deal). Click to enlarge As such, it sheds light on the value of the CRP, or could even eliminate it altogether should the party deem this desirable. After all, the main rationale behind the CRP was that the outcome of this resource evaluation was not yet known at the time of the deal. Mulacek argues that this isn't good enough because the Exxon bid has done away with a final resource evaluation (a leftover from the Total deal), a couple of years into the production phase, when a much more accurate picture emerges about the size of the Elk/Antelope field. He also wants the cap of 10Tcfe out of the picture. Per the MD&A of InterOil's Q3 earnings filings, they expect the Total interim resource payment at the end of April, that's five months from now. Even in case that turns out to be optimistic (it depends on the ongoing drilling and appraisal at Antelope 7 to be finished), it seems hardly worth anyone's while to commission another independent assessment when the one that really matters is half a year away. So we assume we're waiting for that for the deal to be back on the table. Could there be other ways in the meantime for the deal to speed up? Given the Appeals Court decision, is for Exxon to sweeten it's bid. But even then they will have to abide by the requirements of the Appeals Court, commission a new fairness opinion based on an independent assessment, etc. Simply waiting for the Total resource evaluation seems much more rational to us. It's the opinion that really matters, not only determining the size of the field, but also the interim resource payment from Total. Exxon could go for a hostile takeover. For this to work, Exxon needs 90% of the shares before they can do a binding offer to acquire the remaining 10%, but 80% of the shareholders declared that they are willing to sell below $72/share already. While we can't rule this out, we think it's more likely for Exxon to wait for the interim resource evaluation, which gives them more certainty. Another bidder? Exxon is the best place because the gas is worth most to them because of their existing LNG plant. To a lesser extent this also holds for OilSearch, which did bid, but was topped by Exxon and indicated it's not going to go over that. Other's that have shown at least some interest in the past are Shell and Woodside, but so far we've not seen indications that they are considering entering the ring. We have wondered at times why Total doesn't try to take over the whole company as they are liable for substantial resource payments anyway (which any successful bidder would receive), but they haven't indicated that they are seriously considering this. Risk So far the market has taken this largely in its stride. The view seems to be that the deal isn't off (confirmed by both Exxon and InterOil) and while InterOil's cash position is rather dire (and they'll have to fund their part of Antelope7 drilling and appraisal), they can probably hang on to the Total interim resource payment mid next year. The deal also makes sense for Exxon due to the substantial (in the order of $3B) synergies with its existing LNG plant and infrastructure already operating on PNG. If anything, there seems to be at least some chance of a better deal. But most of this will depend on the Total interim resource evaluation, and with that, on the outcome of Antelope 7. Antelope 7 Drilling is already underway and (as is usual, the last couple of years) one learns more from going over to OilSearch for information. In this case it's quite interesting : \nContingent on the Antelope 7 results, the well may be deepened to test the Antelope Deep carbonate exploration target. It isn't very big, but it is a different prospect than Antelope South (to clear up some confusion) and the rock quality could be excellent, according to our contributing petroleum engineer . Apart from the excitement over a possible new discovery (which brought us to InterOil in the first place), we mention it because it could be in line for the Total discovery bonus of US$65.4 million per Tcf for volumes over 1 Tcf of another field in PRL15. We also note that Antelope Deep isn't in pressure communication with Antelope, so if there is any gas there it won't add to the Antelope resource and its resource payments from Total, apart from a possible discovery bonus. We have to wait and see whether they will drill this deep, whether there is gas there (and what the rock quality is exactly). Even then the Total discovery bonus, should the discovery be big enough, could befall Exxon rather than InterOil if the takeover is still on. Some stuff IOC shareholders will miss out on Simply as a reminder $73.3M at FID $65.4M at first LNG cargo Final certification (you might want to read the section on that in our earlier article why this could mean billions) Discovery bonus of US$65.4 million per Tcf for volumes over 1 Tcf of another field in PRL15 (not Elk/Antelope) Then there are those that set out, in considerable detail, why the Exxon offer is basically only for a part of Elk/Antelope and allocates zero value for the rest of the company (you can find that assessment here , and some additions here .) For instance, discoveries have been independently certified at year end 2015: 3.6 Tcfe for Raptor, 2.4 Tcfe for Bobcat, 0.4 Tcfe for Triceratops. You might also want to take a look at this picture of InterOil's prospects and leads: Conclusion No market panic broke out after the Yukon Appeals Court effectively torpedoed the Exxon takeover of InterOil. Exxon and InterOil maintain that the deal is still on, but they will have to remedy the parts that the Appeals Court found wanting. In our view, the most likely outcome is that the parties wait for the appraisal of Antelope 7 and the Antelope resource is completed, by mid next year (drilling info will arrive much sooner), but we don't discount the possibility that the parties manage to arrive at a workable solution beforehand. While not discounting the possibility that the deal will fall through, we don't think that's very likely, considering the fact that there are substantial (in the order of $3B) synergy benefits for Exxon in play.

Sweet Monday, November 28, 2016 Credit: Faith Ninivaggi ON THE GRILL:   Healey, seen last Monday at a State House event, is investigating whether Exxon Mobil has been deceiving consumers about fossil fuel. Photo by Faith Ninivaggi. comments   Healey is pushing back on a federal judge’s order that she be in Texas next month to be grilled by attorneys for Exxon Mobil, claiming it takes “exceptional circumstances” to demand an official of her stature be deposed.\n“Well-established prece- dent requires that depositions of high-ranking officials only occur in exceptional circumstances that are not present here,” Healey’s legal team argues in a motion to vacate Judge Ed Kinkeade’s ruling they filed Saturday in U.S. District Court in Dallas.\nKinkeade earlier this month ordered that Healey appear in his courtroom Dec. 13 to answer questions about her probe of the oil giant’s climate-change research so he can determine whether her motivation is politically based.\nBut as Healey’s lawyers note, her deposition would take place nearly a week after a Superior Court judge in Massachusetts is to hear Exxon Mobil’s Dec. 7 argument for dismissing the civil investigation demand she slapped on the company in April.\n“Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state government investigation to confound and effectively halt state law enforcement efforts by filing suit in the target’s favored federal forum and permitting the target to ‘investigate the investigator’ — even in the absence of personal jurisdiction,” Healey’s attorneys said.\nExxon Mobil, they claimed, already has shown the “contentious, even baiting” hand that will be in play at Healey’s deposition by asking her in a prior court-ordered discovery interrogatory, “State, identify, and describe the basis for Your belief that investigating a single company will help combat or limit climate change.”\nExxon Mobil, headquartered in Texas, has asked Kinkeade to stop Healey’s probe on First Amendment and other grounds. Healey, whose probe is looking at whether the company has been deceiving consumers and investors about the environmental hazards of fossil fuel for decades, wants Kinkeade to dismiss the company’s petition for injunction.\nKinkeade has given Exxon Mobil until tomorrow to file its response to Healey’s motion to stop her deposition from going forward.",

The regulator didn’t specify which bids were for the joint venture or for the other areas. \nTotal SA has joined forces with BP Plc and Norway’s Statoil in one group, and with Exxon Mobil Corp. in another. Eni SpA and Lukoil have also joined up, and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc formed another group. Start your day with what’s moving markets. Get our markets daily newsletter.

Landing a major producer as a partner will signal the beginning of a new era for Mexico’s reeling oil giant. Burdened with nearly $100 billion in financial debt and a 12-year slump in crude output, Pemex has pointed to partnerships as the road to its salvation since the government ended the company’s 76-year production monopoly in 2014.\n\"We think the offer and opportunity are good enough for Trion to be awarded,\" Pablo Medina, an oil and energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in a phone interview. \"The key to Trion being awarded was the willingness to change the JOA and the conditions of the contract. Becoming Pemex’s first partner could create goodwill down the road as the industry continues to open.\" \nMexican upstart Sierra Oil & Gas, which has backing from private equity firms Riverstone Holdings and BlackRock Inc, and Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd, or Petronas, have joined forces in one group as well as another that includes Murphy Oil Corp. and Ophir Energy Plc. BHP Billiton Ltd and China’s CNOOC Ltd will participate individually. \n\"Many of the companies that are participating in this bidding have been in Mexico with a permanent office in Mexico for decades waiting for this moment,\" Juan Carlos Zepeda, National Hydrocarbons Commissioner, said in a Nov. 22 interview in Mexico City. \"We have very serious players and there is great expectation.\" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nA federal judge in Texas was accused by Massachusetts of abusing his discretion to help Exxon Mobil in a fight over whether the company misled investors about the financial impact of climate change. \nU.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade set a “troubling precedent” by ordering Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to be questioned under oath by Exxon’s lawyers, allowing the target of a state probe to “investigate the investigator,” her lawyer said in a court filing in Dallas. \nIrving-based Exxon sued Healey in its home state in June to block the Massachusetts probe, claiming it was politically motivated. Kinkeade, before ruling on Healey’s request to dismiss the lawsuit, ordered her to appear in Dallas on Dec. 13 for the questioning, even though Exxon proposed it could be done in Boston. \nMassachusetts is one of several states investigating whether Exxon misled investors for years about the projected long-term impact of climate change on its businesses, as well as whether Exxon has properly written down the value of its reserves following a global collapse in oil prices. \n“The court has made errors of law and abused its discretion,” Healey’s Texas lawyer, Douglas Cawley, said in the filing. “Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state-government investigation to confound and effectively halt” state enforcement efforts. \nHealey issued the subpoena in April, based on her “belief that Exxon has engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices that have harmed Massachusetts investors and consumers,” according to the filing. Her views are based “principally Exxon’s own documents and statements,” she said. \nExxon said on Oct. 28 that it “anticipates it will need to make the largest ever write down of the valuation of its fossil fuel reserves in the history of the company,” according to Healey’s filing. Exxon shareholders sued the company in response. \nKinkeade said he was concerned by Healey’s meeting with an environmental activist and attorneys general from other states a day before New York announced a joint plan to pursue Exxon. Her actions raised questions about whether she prejudged the investigation, Kinkeade said. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is running a parallel investigation into Exxon, was added to the company’s lawsuit in Dallas and is fighting to avoid being deposed. \nKinkeade, in an earlier ruling, advised Schneiderman also to appear in Dallas on Dec. 13.

      "text": "Massachusetts’ top cop is probing Exxon’s climate change data Company sued to halt probe, saying it’s politically motivated Share on Facebook \nA federal judge in Texas was accused by Massachusetts of abusing his discretion to help Exxon Mobil Corp. in a fight over whether it misled investors about the financial impact of climate change. \nU.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade set a \"troubling precedent\" by ordering Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to be questioned under oath by Exxon’s lawyers, allowing the target of a state probe to “investigate the investigator,” her lawyer said in a filing in federal court in Dallas. \nExxon, based in Irving, Texas, sued Healey in its home state in June to block the probe, claiming it was politically motivated. Kinkeade, before ruling on Healey’s request to dismiss the lawsuit, ordered her to appear in Dallas on Dec. 13 for the questioning, even though Exxon proposed the deposition be carried out in Boston, where she’s based. \nMassachusetts is one of several states investigating whether Exxon misled investors for years about the projected long-term impact of climate change on its businesses, as well as whether Exxon has properly written down the value of its reserves following a global collapse in prices. \n\"The court has made errors of law and abused its discretion,\" Healey’s Texas lawyer, Douglas Cawley, said in the filing. \"Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state-government investigation to confound and effectively halt\" the probe. Deceptive Acts \nHealey issued the subpoena in April, based on her \"belief that Exxon has engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices that have harmed Massachusetts investors and consumers,\" according to the filing. Her views are based \"principally Exxon’s own documents and statements,\" she said. \nExxon said on Oct. 28 that it \"anticipates it will need to make the largest ever write down of the valuation of its fossil fuel reserves in the history of the company,\" according to Healey’s filing. Exxon shareholders sued the company in response. \nHealey compared the dispute with Google Inc.’s lawsuit to block a subpoena by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood in a probe over illegal online content. A federal appeals court in April rejected Google’s challenge, ruling it was premature because Hood hadn’t yet asked a state court to enforce the subpoena. \n\"We still, in response to our civil investigation demand, have not received one document from Exxon, and yet Exxon is going after the attorney general’s entire thought process,\" Healey’s lawyers have said. Healey Meeting \nKinkeade said in an earlier ruling that he was concerned by Healey’s meeting with an environmental activist and attorneys general from other states a day before New York announced a joint plan to pursue Exxon. Her actions raised questions about whether she prejudged the investigation, Kinkeade said. \nThe court-ordered deposition of Healey is a result of Kinkead’s finding that the probe may have been initiated in bad faith, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said Monday in a statement. \n\"We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit,\" Jeffers said. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is running a parallel investigation into Exxon, was added to the company’s lawsuit in Dallas and is fighting to avoid being deposed. Kinkeade, in an earlier ruling, advised Schneiderman also to appear in Dallas on Dec. 13. \nThe states are investigating whether Exxon violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding from investors information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate and may impact its businesses. Exxon has denied the allegations, saying the valuation of its assets meets all legal standards. \nThe case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 16-cv-00469, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE",

      "text": "Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Exxon's Liberia Drilling, BP's Egyptian Deal and More November 29, 2016, 04:47:00 PM EDT By Nilanjan Choudhury,   \nIt was a week where both oil and gas prices ended with gains. \nOn the news front, ExxonMobil Corp. XOM started drilling a deepwater exploration well offshore of Liberia, while BP plc BP has agreed to buy a 10% interest in Egypt's Shorouk concession. \nOverall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.5% to close at $45.93 per barrel, while natural gas prices rallied 8.5% to $3.085 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last 'Oil & Gas Stock Roundup' here: Acquisition News from Sunoco Logistics, Tesoro and More .) \nOil prices inched up marginally as traders adopted a \"wait and see\" attitude ahead of OPEC's Vienna meeting on Nov 30 with mixed signals on whether the cartel members will agree to rein in output as part of the plan reached in Sep. The commodity was also bolstered by the U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release, which showed an unexpected decline in crude stockpiles. \nHowever, to a large extent, the bullish sentiment was offset by data from Baker Hughes showing another rise in the domestic oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities. \nOils-Energy Sector Price Index \nMeanwhile, natural gas also turned sharply higher following the season's first withdrawal and forecasts of colder weather that translates into strong demand for the heating fuel. \nRecap of the Week's Most Important Stories \n1. World's largest publicly traded oil company ExxonMobil Corp. recently announced that it has commenced drilling operations on the Mesurado-1 exploration well, offshore Liberia. \nOriginally, the drilling operations were scheduled for 2014. However, the Ebola outbreak compelled the international oil & gas exploration and development company to defer its drilling plans. Now that the disease has been contained, ExxonMobil declared its intention to continue with its drilling plans off Liberia in October this year. \nThe well is the first one to be operated by ExxonMobil offshore Liberia and targets oil in Late Cretacous sands. Located about 50 miles offshore Liberia on Block LB-13, the well lies in about 2500 meters of water. The well will also provide calibration for seismic response, which can be used to appraise other leads on the block. (Read more: ExxonMobil Sets Foot in Liberia, Drills First Well .) \n2. British energy giant BP plc recently announced its decision to acquire 10% stake from Eni SpA in the Shorouk concession, offshore Egypt, for a total consideration of $375 million. \nThe Shorouk concession offshore Egypt also contains the super-giant Zohr gas field. On completion, BP will compensate Eni for BP's share of past expenditure. Per the agreement, BP has an option to buy another 5% interest in the concession under the same terms, before the next year ends. \nDiscovered by Eni in Aug 2015, the Zohr field is located in the Mediterranean Sea, about 190 kilometers north of Port Said in water depth of about 1,500 meters. To date, six wells have been drilled successfully. It is considered to be the largest gas discovery in the Mediterranean. Eni estimates the Zohr field to hold total gas resources of about 30 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. The first phase of development of Zohr is being sped up and first gas is anticipated in late 2017. (Read more: BP to Purchase 10% Stake in Shorouk Concession from Eni .) \n3. Offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd. RIG and its partnership Transocean Partners LLC RIGP jointly announced the increase of shareholding by the former to 1.2 shares from 1.1427 shares - the consideration for its pending merger of each common unit of the latter that it does not already own. \nTransocean made this announcement post the failure to receive 50.1% shareholder votes necessary for the merger to close. The company aims to issue around 23.8 million shares for the deal to complete. \nFor the merger to take place, approval from the holders of Transocean Partners` common units is required. Shareholders of Transocean have voted for roughly 21.3 million common units in support of the transaction. However, a vote in favor of the deal by nearly 9.9 million of 19.7 million common units not held by Transocean is still needed for the deal to close. The transaction is expected to close by next month, subject to customary closing conditions. (Read more: Transocean Raises Acquisition Offer for Transocean Partners .) \n4. Canada's largest energy firm, Suncor Energy Inc. SU recently provided the production outlook and capital expenditure guidance for 2017. The company expects capital spending between C$4.8 billion and C$5.2 billion and average production in the range of 680,000-720,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). This means that the company expects production to rise by more than 13% next year and spending to fall by more than C$1 billion. Suncor Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . \nOf the total capital expenditure, the company will use C$4.1-C$4.5 billion for the upstream segment, C$625-C$675 million for the downstream segment and the remaining for corporate purposes. About 40% of next year's capital spending has been allocated for growth projects, mostly in the upstream segment \nRegarding production, 420-450 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) are expected to be contributed by the Oil Sands segment. About 150-165 thousand bbl/d will likely be derived from the Syncrude segment, while the remaining will come from the company's exploration and production activities. (Read more: Suncor Energy Provides 2017 Capex, Production Outlook .) \n5. Offshore contract driller SeaDrill Ltd. SDRL reported strong third-quarter 2016 earnings owing to a decrease in operating expenses. Earnings per share - excluding one-time items − came in at 28 cents. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents per share and also increased from the year-ago adjusted figure of 21 cents. \nSeaDrill incurred operating expenses of $501 million in the reported quarter. This reflects a significant decline from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,213 million. Like other offshore contract drillers, SeaDrill too has decided to focus on controlling costs amid plummeting crude prices. As part of the initiative, SeaDrill has trimmed its headcount by 23% since the end of 2015 to 5,500 \nThe company projects fourth-quarter operating income of approximately $146 million. This is substantially lower than the third-quarter level of $247 million.

( XOM - Free Report ) started drilling a deepwater exploration well offshore of Liberia, while BP plc ( BP - Free Report ) has agreed to buy a 10% interest in Egypt's Shorouk concession.\nOverall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.5% to close at $45.93 per barrel, while natural gas prices rallied 8.5% to $3.085 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Acquisition News from Sunoco Logistics, Tesoro and More .)\nOil prices inched up marginally as traders adopted a \"wait and see\" attitude ahead of OPEC’s Vienna meeting on Nov 30 with mixed signals on whether the cartel members will agree to rein in output as part of the plan reached in Sep. The commodity was also bolstered by the U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release, which showed an unexpected decline in crude stockpiles.\nHowever, to a large extent, the bullish sentiment was offset by data from Baker Hughes showing another rise in the domestic oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities.\nOils-Energy Sector Price Index\nOils-Energy Sector Price Index\nMeanwhile, natural gas also turned sharply higher following the season’s first withdrawal and forecasts of colder weather that translates into strong demand for the heating fuel.\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\n1. World’s largest publicly traded oil company ExxonMobil Corp. recently announced that it has commenced drilling operations on the Mesurado-1 exploration well, offshore Liberia.\nOriginally, the drilling operations were scheduled for 2014. However, the Ebola outbreak compelled the international oil & gas exploration and development company to defer its drilling plans. Now that the disease has been contained, ExxonMobil declared its intention to continue with its drilling plans off Liberia in October this year.\nThe well is the first one to be operated by ExxonMobil offshore Liberia and targets oil in Late Cretacous sands. Located about 50 miles offshore Liberia on Block LB-13, the well lies in about 2500 meters of water. The well will also provide calibration for seismic response, which can be used to appraise other leads on the block. (Read more: ExxonMobil Sets Foot in Liberia, Drills First Well .)\n2. British energy giant BP plc recently announced its decision to acquire 10% stake from Eni SpA in the Shorouk concession, offshore Egypt, for a total consideration of $375 million.\nThe Shorouk concession offshore Egypt also contains the super-giant Zohr gas field. On completion, BP will compensate Eni for BP’s share of past expenditure. Per the agreement, BP has an option to buy another 5% interest in the concession under the same terms, before the next year ends.\nDiscovered by Eni in Aug 2015, the Zohr field is located in the Mediterranean Sea, about 190 kilometers north of Port Said in water depth of about 1,500 meters. To date, six wells have been drilled successfully. It is considered to be the largest gas discovery in the Mediterranean. Eni estimates the Zohr field to hold total gas resources of about 30 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. The first phase of development of Zohr is being sped up and first gas is anticipated in late 2017. (Read more: BP to Purchase 10% Stake in Shorouk Concession from Eni .)\n3. Offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd. ( RIG - Free Report ) and its partnership Transocean Partners LLC ( RIGP - Free Report ) jointly announced the increase of shareholding by the former to 1.2 shares from 1.1427 shares – the consideration for its pending merger of each common unit of the latter that it does not already own.\nTransocean made this announcement post the failure to receive 50.1% shareholder votes necessary for the merger to close. The company aims to issue around 23.8 million shares for the deal to complete.\nFor the merger to take place, approval from the holders of Transocean Partners` common units is required. Shareholders of Transocean have voted for roughly 21.3 million common units in support of the transaction. However, a vote in favor of the deal by nearly 9.9 million of 19.7 million common units not held by Transocean is still needed for the deal to close. The transaction is expected to close by next month, subject to customary closing conditions. (Read more: Transocean Raises Acquisition Offer for Transocean Partners .)\n4. Canada’s largest energy firm, Suncor Energy Inc. ( SU - Free Report ) recently provided the production outlook and capital expenditure guidance for 2017. The company expects capital spending between C$4.8 billion and C$5.2 billion and average production in the range of 680,000–720,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). This means that the company expects production to rise by more than 13% next year and spending to fall by more than C$1 billion. Suncor Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nOf the total capital expenditure, the company will use C$4.1–C$4.5 billion for the upstream segment, C$625–C$675 million for the downstream segment and the remaining for corporate purposes. About 40% of next year’s capital spending has been allocated for growth projects, mostly in the upstream segment\nRegarding production, 420–450 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) are expected to be contributed by the Oil Sands segment. About 150–165 thousand bbl/d will likely be derived from the Syncrude segment, while the remaining will come from the company’s exploration and production activities.

( SDRL - Free Report ) reported strong third-quarter 2016 earnings owing to a decrease in operating expenses. Earnings per share – excluding one-time items − came in at 28 cents. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents per share and also increased from the year-ago adjusted figure of 21 cents.\nSeaDrill incurred operating expenses of $501 million in the reported quarter. This reflects a significant decline from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,213 million. Like other offshore contract drillers, SeaDrill too has decided to focus on controlling costs amid plummeting crude prices. As part of the initiative, SeaDrill has trimmed its headcount by 23% since the end of 2015 to 5,500\nThe company projects fourth-quarter operating income of approximately $146 million. This is substantially lower than the third-quarter level of $247 million.

The commodity was also bolstered by the U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release, which showed an unexpected decline in crude stockpiles. \nHowever, to a large extent, the bullish sentiment was offset by data from Baker Hughes showing another rise in the domestic oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities. \nOils-Energy Sector Price Index \nMeanwhile, natural gas also turned sharply higher following the season’s first withdrawal and forecasts of colder weather that translates into strong demand for the heating fuel. \nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories 1. World’s largest publicly traded oil company ExxonMobil Corp. recently announced that it has commenced drilling operations on the Mesurado-1 exploration well, offshore Liberia. Originally, the drilling operations were scheduled for 2014. However, the Ebola outbreak compelled the international oil & gas exploration and development company to defer its drilling plans. Now that the disease has been contained, ExxonMobil declared its intention to continue with its drilling plans off Liberia in October this year. The well is the first one to be operated by ExxonMobil offshore Liberia and targets oil in Late Cretacous sands. Located about 50 miles offshore Liberia on Block LB-13, the well lies in about 2500 meters of water. The well will also provide calibration for seismic response, which can be used to appraise other leads on the block. (Read more: ExxonMobil Sets Foot in Liberia, Drills First Well .) 2. British energy giant BP plc recently announced its decision to acquire 10% stake from Eni SpA in the Shorouk concession, offshore Egypt, for a total consideration of $375 million. The Shorouk concession offshore Egypt also contains the super-giant Zohr gas field. On completion, BP will compensate Eni for BP’s share of past expenditure. Per the agreement, BP has an option to buy another 5% interest in the concession under the same terms, before the next year ends. Discovered by Eni in Aug 2015, the Zohr field is located in the Mediterranean Sea, about 190 kilometers north of Port Said in water depth of about 1,500 meters. To date, six wells have been drilled successfully. It is considered to be the largest gas discovery in the Mediterranean. Eni estimates the Zohr field to hold total gas resources of about 30 trillion cubic feet of gas in place. The first phase of development of Zohr is being sped up and first gas is anticipated in late 2017. (Read more: BP to Purchase 10% Stake in Shorouk Concession from Eni .) 3. Offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd. ( RIG - Free Report ) and its partnership Transocean Partners LLC ( RIGP - Free Report ) jointly announced the increase of shareholding by the former to 1.2 shares from 1.1427 shares – the consideration for its pending merger of each common unit of the latter that it does not already own. Transocean made this announcement post the failure to receive 50.1% shareholder votes necessary for the merger to close. The company aims to issue around 23.8 million shares for the deal to complete. For the merger to take place, approval from the holders of Transocean Partners` common units is required. Shareholders of Transocean have voted for roughly 21.3 million common units in support of the transaction. However, a vote in favor of the deal by nearly 9.9 million of 19.7 million common units not held by Transocean is still needed for the deal to close. The transaction is expected to close by next month, subject to customary closing conditions. (Read more: Transocean Raises Acquisition Offer for Transocean Partners .) 4. Canada’s largest energy firm, Suncor Energy Inc. ( SU - Free Report ) recently provided the production outlook and capital expenditure guidance for 2017. The company expects capital spending between C$4.8 billion and C$5.2 billion and average production in the range of 680,000–720,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). This means that the company expects production to rise by more than 13% next year and spending to fall by more than C$1 billion. Suncor Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Of the total capital expenditure, the company will use C$4.1–C$4.5 billion for the upstream segment, C$625–C$675 million for the downstream segment and the remaining for corporate purposes. About 40% of next year’s capital spending has been allocated for growth projects, mostly in the upstream segment Regarding production, 420–450 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) are expected to be contributed by the Oil Sands segment. About 150–165 thousand bbl/d will likely be derived from the Syncrude segment, while the remaining will come from the company’s exploration and production activities.

( SDRL - Free Report ) reported strong third-quarter 2016 earnings owing to a decrease in operating expenses. Earnings per share – excluding one-time items − came in at 28 cents. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents per share and also increased from the year-ago adjusted figure of 21 cents. SeaDrill incurred operating expenses of $501 million in the reported quarter. This reflects a significant decline from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,213 million. Like other offshore contract drillers, SeaDrill too has decided to focus on controlling costs amid plummeting crude prices. As part of the initiative, SeaDrill has trimmed its headcount by 23% since the end of 2015 to 5,500 The company projects fourth-quarter operating income of approximately $146 million. This is substantially lower than the third-quarter level of $247 million.

      "text": "Markets Today Exxon Mobil Is Poised for a Breakout Exxon has been a laggard for months, that may soon change as the stock begins to gain traction. Gary Morrow Nov30,20162:17PMEST \nExxon Mobil ( XOM ) appears to be on the verge of a breakout. The stock is up over 2.25% on accelerating trade, putting it in the No. 3 spot on the Dow Jones Industrials . \nThis powerful OPEC-inspired rally is taking out a key trendline that links the stock's September, October and early November highs. A follow-through move could be quite powerful. \nSince early October, Exxon has been trading in a narrowing range while straddling its 200-day moving average. During this process, the stock has been working off a major support zone near the $82.50 area. Exxon's muted post-election rally began at this area but has been unable to move past the 200-day moving average. That appears to be changing on Wednesday. \nIn the near term, Exxon investors should take a more positive view of the stock. Exxon is a low-risk buy near current levels. \nA new support zone is taking shape between $87.25 and $86. If the stock can hold this area during periods of weakness in the short term, it will prove shares are on solid footing. \nOn the downside, a close back below $86 would take out this week's low, signaling more sideways trading is ahead. On the upside, Exxon still has key levels to work through, including the August, September and October highs. A convincing takeout of the $89.50 level would clear an important hurdle.

      "text": "\nof Order No. 370 and for leave to file a Supplemental Answer to NME's complaint. 13 Exxon sought to amend its answer to include a claim for reformation of the Settlement Agreement. This court denied the motion for reconsideration and the motion for leave to supplement. 14 \nAfter Exxon's motions for reconsideration and leave to supplement were denied, this court entered a Final Judgment. 15 On August 17, 2007, Exxon appealed Order No. 370 and the Final Judgment. \nOn October 17, 2007, Exxon filed a complaint in state court which alleged a single cause of action for reformation of the Settlement Agreement. On November 2, 2007, NME and CIP removed the reformation case to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441. Exxon moved to remand, arguing that there was no jurisdictional basis for removal. On April 22, 2008, this court denied the motion to remand. 16 NME and CIP then moved to dismiss Exxon's complaint. On November 18, 2008, this court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that Exxon's reformation claim was barred by res judicata, 17 and a final judgment dismissing the reformation case was entered. 18 \nExxon appealed. However, before the parties had begun briefing the appeal, on March 10, 2009, the Ninth Circuit ruled on Exxon's appeal of Order No. 370 and the Final Judgment in the interpretation case. The Ninth Circuit held that this court \"erred in failing to consider extrinsic evidence regarding whether the parties agreed to compound interest.\" In re Exxon Valdez , Case No. 07-35715, 2009 WL 605900, at *2 (9th Cir. March 10, 2009). The court of appeals also held that this court \"did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to supplement the answer to add a counterclaim for reformation.\" Id. Thus, the court of appeals reversed in part and remanded the interpretation case to this court. Upon remand, this court vacated the Final Judgment, Order No. 370, and the portion of its July 23, 2007 order that addressed Exxon's motion for reconsideration. 19 \nOn May 14, 2009, the Ninth Circuit vacated the judgment in the reformation case because it was based upon the Final Judgment in the interpretation case, which had been reversed in part. 20 The reformation case was remanded to this court for further proceedings. \nOn June 5, 2009, Exxon filed a second complaint in Alaska state court seeking a declaratory judgment interpreting the parties' rights and obligations under the Settlement Agreement, or, in the alternative, for reformation of the Settlement Agreement. NME and CIP removed the 2009 case to this court. 21 Exxon moved to remand both the original reformation case and the 2009 case to state court. 22 The court granted both motions to remand 23 and stayed the interpretation case pending the outcome of the state court cases. 24 \nThe state court cases were consolidated and trial was scheduled for November 2010. Shortly before the trial, CIP and Exxon reached a settlement. \nNME and Exxon proceeded to trial. On March 17, 2011, the state court judge entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. 25 The state court judge [a]fter reviewing the written exchange of offers and counter-offers, the Letter Agreement, as well as the testimony of Mr. Daum and Mr. Weidner [the two attorneys who negotiated the Settlement Agreement], . . . f[ound] there is no evidence that the parties discussed and reached agreement that only compound interest would apply regardless of whether state or federal law controlled.[ 26 ] \nIn short, the state court judge concluded that \"[a]ll of the extrinsic evidence demonstrates that the parties never agreed that interest would be compounded\" and \"that the proposed judgment . . . was intended to provide a form of judgment that [this court] could use to implement the parties' agreement\" but that \"[t]he proposed judgment was not intended to include or be an agreement to pay compound interest.\" 27 \nJudgment was entered in the consolidated state court case in Exxon's favor and Exxon was awarded attorney's fees. NME appealed the trial court's conclusion that the parties had not agreed that interest would be compound. On July 19, 2013, the Alaska Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision. Nautilus Marine Enterprises, Inc. v. Exxon Mobil Corp. , 305 P.3d 309 , 312 (Alaska 2013). NME also appealed the award of attorney's fees to Exxon. On August 22, 2014, the Alaska Supreme Court \"reverse[ed] the awards of attorney fees and costs and remand[ed] for a recalculation of the fees award based on local rates and for the apportionment of fees and costs\" but affirmed as to \"all other issues.\" Nautilus Marine Enterprises, Inc. v. Exxon Mobil Corp. , 332 P.3d 554 , 565 (Alaska 2014). \nAfter the attorney's fees were re-calculated, on October 8, 2015, the state trial court entered a second revised final judgment. 28 The second revised final judgment provided: 1. The September 2006 settlement between Exxon . . . and NME did not require Exxon to pay compound interest regardless of the applicable law. The parties intended that Judge Holland of the U.S. District Court determine both the correct rate of interest and the method of computing that interest under federal or state law. 2. Plaintiff Exxon's request for reformation is denied. 3. It is for Judge Holland to decide the appropriate law that applies, the proper interest rate, and the method of calculating that interest rate. 4. Exxon is awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of $340,211, expert costs in the amount of $67,500 and costs of $89,013.26 for a total award of $496,724.26.[ 29 ] \nThe state court proceedings having been completed, Exxon now moves to lift the stay of this case (the interpretation case) and for entry of judgment in NME's favor. NME does not oppose lifting the stay nor does NME oppose entry of judgment in its favor. However, the parties disagree as to the amount of the judgment to be entered. Discussion \nThere being no disagreement between the parties, the stay is lifted. \nWith the stay lifted, what remains is for the court to enter judgment. In order to enter judgment, the court must determine the amount that is still owed to NME under the Settlement Agreement. \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, Exxon paid NME and CIP an initial settlement amount of $8,500,000. 30 This amount represented $824,601.09 for CIP's 1992 and 1993 damages and $3,726,556.16 for NME's 1992 and 1993 damages plus prejudgment interest on both of those amounts calculated at the applicable federal rate. 31 NME received $5 million of the initial settlement amount and CIP received $3.5 million. 32 Exxon also agreed to pay a Supplemental Settlement Amount, which would be \"the amount, if any, that may become payable pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 3.1, 3.2 and/or 3.3\" of the Settlement Agreement. 33 \nParagraph 3.1 requires Exxon to pay the difference between prejudgment interest calculated at the federal rate and prejudgment interest calculated at whatever rate the court finds is the correct rate. 34 There is now no dispute the correct rate of prejudgment interest is the state rate of 10.5% simple. The parties agree that the difference between prejudgment interest calculated at the federal rate up to November 1, 2006 and the state rate of 10.5% simple is $3,470,716.32. 35 \nThe $3,470,716.32 number is based on the report of Exxon's expert, Bruce Budge. Budge reached this number by calculating prejudgment interest at a rate of 10.5% simple on CIP's and NME's combined 1992 damages ($3,778.584.56) and on CIP's and NME's combined 1993 damages ($2,862,112.94). 36 Adding these two numbers together results in the total prejudgment interest on CIP's and NME's 1992 and 1993 damages through November 1, 2006, when calculated at 10.5% simple, being $6,640,697.50. 37 In the initial settlement amount, Exxon paid CIP and NME $3,169,981.19 in prejudgment interest. 38 The difference between $6,640,697.50 and $3,169,981.19 is $3,470,761.13. \nDespite the $3,470,761.13 being based on both CIP's and NME's 1992 and 1993 damages, NME argues that it is entitled to the entire $3,470,716.32. NME argues that paragraph 3.1 is not ambiguous and that it does not provide for any allocation of any additional prejudgment interest that might become payable. NME argues that if there were confusion over how the additional prejudgment interest was to be paid, then Exxon should have moved to reform paragraph 3.1, which it did not do. NME contends that Exxon has never claimed that the language of paragraph 3.1 is vague or ambiguous. NME argues that Exxon is relying on a subrogation theory to attempt to modify its obligations under the Settlement Agreement and that such an attempt should fail. NME contends that Exxon's status in this case is that of a debtor which had an obligation to pay NME and CIP and thus any monies that Exxon paid to CIP were in payment of Exxon's own obligations to CIP and not payments of NME debts. 39 NME insists that any claim of allocation is between NME and CIP, not NME and Exxon. NME insists that there is simply no contract provision that would allow modification of Exxon's liability under paragraph 3.1 due to a settlement with one party to the Agreement. \nNME is not entitled to the entire $3,470,716.32. Paragraph 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides that \"[a]ny Supplemental Settlement Amount shall be paid pursuant to further written instructions from Seafood Processors Counsel, Counsel for NMI, Tom Waterer, and Mike Shupe [CIP's president].\" 40 That both CIP and NME had to provide payment instructions as to any Supplemental Settlement Amount is a clear indication that any Supplemental Settlement Amount was to be allocated between CIP and NME. \nThe Settlement Agreement is silent, however, as to how such an allocation should be made. When faced with such a situation, the Alaska Supreme Court looks to Section 204 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts . \"Under section 204 . . ., `[w]hen the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.'\" Disotell v. Stiltner , 100 P.3d 890 , 896 (Alaska 2004). \nExxon argues that it would be reasonable for the court to apply the same allocation formula the parties agreed to at the time of the settlement, which was that NME received 58.82% of the initial settlement amount and CIP received 41.18%. Under that allocation scenario, NME would be entitled to recover $2,041,475.34 in additional prejudgment interest. \nBut, NME has offered evidence that the payment instructions for the initial settlement amount were \"based on other business relations between [CIP and NME], including loans and joint fish processing agreements, and also a joint prosecution agreement which included sharing the initial settlement proceeds\" 41 and that \"[t]he joint prosecution agreement and sharing obligations between CIP and the other parties were terminated shortly after the settlement.\" 42 In light of this evidence, it would not be reasonable to allocate the Supplemen-tal Settlement Amount based on how the initial settlement amount was allocated. \nIt would, however, be reasonable to allocate the additional prejudgment interest based on NME's actual damages. During the negotiations that led to the Settlement Agreement, the parties' lawyers signed what became known as the \"Letter Agreement\" which \"[t]hey intended . . . to `constitute an agreement' to settle the case\" and which the state court judge found was \"binding between NME and Exxon.\" 43 In the Letter Agreement, Exxon expressly agree[d] to pay CIP . . . $710,750.06 on account of damages accrued in 1992 and NMI . . . $1,797,859.50 on account of damages accrued in 1992, and to pay CIP $113,851.03 on account of damages accrued in 1993, and NMI $1,928,969.65 on account of damages accrued in 1993, together with pre-judg-ment interest on those sums as provided by law [. 44 ] \nIn short, Exxon agreed to pay NME prejudgment interest on the damages that NME actually incurred. Exxon's expert has calculated that NME is entitled to $2,864,009.24 45 in additional prejudgment interest based on its 1992 and 1993 damages. Thus, the court finds that NME is entitled to recover $2,864,009.24 of the $3,470,716.32 in additional prejudgment interest that has become payable pursuant to paragraph 3.1 of the Settlement Agreement. \nNME argues, however, that this is not the only amount that has become payable. NME argues that it is also entitled to interest from November 1, 2006 to the present on whatever portion of the $3,470,716.32 is allocated to it. NME argues that the $3,470,716.32 represents the \"balance\" of NME's economic damages arising from the oil spill and thus it is entitled to prejudgment interest on these damages. NME contends that interest is a consequential economic damage and that under the Settlement Agreement, Exxon still owes NME its unpaid economic damages. NME argues that it is entitled to prejudgment interest on its portion of the $3,470,716.32 in order to be made \"whole\". NME points out that prejudgment interest is intended to compensate for the \"loss of use of money\" that a plaintiff \"actually suffers . . . between accrual of his claim and judgment[.]\" State v. Phillips , 470 P.2d 266 , 273 n.27 (Alaska 1970). Here, NME argues that it has lost the use of its portion of the $3,470,716.32 for almost ten years and thus it insists that it is entitled to prejudgment interest on whatever additional prejudgment interest Exxon owes under paragraph 3.1. NME points out that under Alaska law \"[i]t is only when . . . an award\" of prejudgment interest \"would do an injustice that it should be denied\" and that \"[t]he only ground for denial [the Alaska Supreme Court has] so far recognized has been double recovery.\" Farnsworth v. Steiner , 638 P.2d 181 , 184 (Alaska 1981). As the court in Farnsworth noted, \"[t]he real question in awarding interest to a judgment creditor is whether the debtor has had use of money for a period of time when the creditor was actually entitled to it.\" Id. Here, NME argues that there can be no dispute that Exxon had the use of the $3,470,716.32 from November 1, 2006 until now, a period of time during which NME was actually entitled to a portion of that money. NME contends that Exxon could have paid the additional money after the Sea Hawk decision made it clear that state law would govern the interest issue and thus avoided having to pay prejudgment interest from November 1, 2006 to the present, as Exxon's counsel recom-mended. 46 But because Exxon made a business decision to further delay payment and continue to use the money until now, NME argues that Exxon must live with that choice now and pay post-November 1, 2006 prejudgment interest. \nNME's argument ignores the express terms of the Settlement Agreement. Paragraph 3.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides: The period for which interest shall be payable on the sum of $2,508,609.56 shall commence on July 1, 1992, and continue through November 1, 2006, or the date the Court enters judg-ment, whichever is earlier. The period for which interest shall be payable on the sum of $2,042,547.68 shall commence on July 1, 1993, and continue through November 1, 2006, or the date on which the Court enters judgment, whichever is earlier.[ 47 ] \nThere is nothing ambiguous about this provision. It plainly provides that the accrual of prejudgment interest stops on November 1, 2006. NME has long been aware that this is what the Settlement Agreement provided. During oral argument before this court in July 2007, NME's attorney, Mr. Weidner, stated that Exxon \"bargained for and got an agreement that the interest would stop last November, that's about seven months ago, because under state law the interest goes all the way until the judgment.\" 48 Mr. Weidner further stated that we're not asking for any more prejudgment interest than we agreed to in the settlement. We're not saying, hey, wait a minute, go back and start the accrual a couple months extra or it's been seven months because we thought the judge was going to rule by then, give us the seven months. A deal's a deal and we're sticking with it.[ 49 ] \nIn addition, in the proposed final judgment that NME submitted to the court on July 20, 2007, NME calculated prejudgment interest as accruing only through November 1, 2006. 50 NME's contention that the parties to the Settlement Agreement did not intend there to be a \"gap\" period is unavailing. While the parties may not have foreseen that it would take almost ten years to resolve their prejudgment interest dispute, the parties expressly agreed that prejudgment interest would stop accruing on November 1, 2006. NME is not entitled to post-November 1, 2006 prejudgment interest. \nAs set out above, the Supplemental Settlement Amount is also to include any amounts that became payable under paragraph 3.2, which governs the issue of attorney's fees. The parties agree that NME is entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of 10% of whatever the court ultimately decides NME is owed under paragraph 3.1. NME is entitled to $2,864,009.24 in additional interest pursuant to paragraph 3.1, which means that NME is entitled to $286,400.92 in attorney's fees pursuant to paragraph 3.2. \nFinally, Exxon argues that it is entitled to an off-set of $496,724.26 in fees and costs awarded in the state court action plus post-judgment interest on that amount. NME, however, argues that an off-set would not be appropriate because Exxon's obligations are to Nautilus Marine Enterprises, Mr. Waterer, and Waterkist Corporation but only Nautilus Marine Enterprises owes Exxon money pursuant to the state court judgment. \nThe court finds that an off-set would be appropriate here. Exxon has no obligation to Waterkist Corporation because as noted above, Waterkist Corporation is not now and never has been a party to this lawsuit. As for Mr. Waterer, Exxon has submitted evidence that Mr. Waterer is the president and general manager of Nautilus Marine, that his job responsibilities were \"everything relating to the operations, financing and sales of the corporation\", that he owns 100% of the shares of Nautilus Marine, that he and his wife are Nautilus Marine's officers and directors but that his wife is not very involved in the business, that he was Nautilus Marine's only live witness in the state court trial, that he attended seven depositions that were taken in that matter, and that he telephonically attended four of the state court hearings. 51 Given this unrefuted evidence, the court finds that Mr. Waterer is in privity with Nautilus Marine such that an off-set would be appropriate even though Mr. Waterer was not a party to the state court action. Conclusion \nThe motion to lift the stay and for entry of judgment is granted. Judgment shall be entered in favor of Nautilus Marine Enterprises and M. Thomas Waterer in the amount of $3,150,410.16 ($2,864,009.24 in additional prejudgment interest plus $286,400.92 in attorney's fees) with an off-set $496,724.26. FootNotes 1. Docket No. 9804. 2. Docket No. 9812. 3. The cross-motion indicates that it is also being brought by Waterkist Corporation. However, Waterkist is not and never has been a party to this lawsuit. 4. Docket No. 9820. 5.

      "text": "TOP Meg Bell (R) holds a banner during a protest before the start of the Exxon Mobil Corporation Shareholders Meeting in Dallas, Texas, May 28, 2008. REUTERS/Mike Stone 5356856 \nAn heiress with the Rockefeller fortune said her family’s attacks against Exxon Mobil’s climate research are “deeply misguided” and only tarnishes her oil-rich family’s legacy. \nAriana Rockefeller, one of the wealthy scions of the billionaire Rockefeller family, told CBS Friday morning that she disapproves of the crusade against Exxon, as well as other anti-fossil fuel efforts. \n“These family funds do not speak on behalf of all 200 family members,” Ariana said about the myriad Rockefeller funds targeting Exxon, a descendant of the John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company. “I don’t think denouncing a family legacy is the best way to go about,” about protecting the environment. \nThe Rockefellers are the 23rd richest family in the U.S., with a fortune of $11 billion, according to Forbes. Most of the family’s wealth goes toward bankrolling groups like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) and the Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF), both of which are funding attacks against Exxon. \nWATCH: \nAriana was responding to criticisms lobbed at the oil company by fellow family members, Valerie Rockefeller Wayne and David Kaiser, the president of the RFF. \n“If I was talking to the board of ExxonMobil, I would say that right now, their company seems to be morally bankrupt,” Kaiser told CBS reporters. \nKaiser said that his family feels “an enormous moral responsibility for our children” because of Rockefellers’ history producing fossil fuels they think are contributing to man-made global warming. \nThe Rockefellers were initially cagey about whether they specifically targeted Exxon but later admitted to going after the company. \nKaiser and Lee Wasserman, the head of RFF, admitted several months ago in The New York Review of Books that the family intended all along to bring down Exxon because of its supposed anti-global warming positions. \n“[W]e paid for a team of independent reporters from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism to try to determine what Exxon and other US oil companies had really known about climate science, and when,” Kaiser and Wasserman wrote in December. \nThe family used its wealth to fund media reports showing Exxon had hid nearly four decades’ worth of climate change records. \nThe Columbia School of Journalism, which published reports alleging the oil company buried internal research showing rising sea levels were due to man-made global warming, continues to insist the contributions it received from the RFF, as well as the RBF, are independent from its research on climate change. \nThe riff comes as attorneys general-led investigations into Exxon have started to falter. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began investigating the oil giant in November 2015 because of the Rockefeller-funded reports. Massachusetts AG Maura Healey eventually joined the Democrat in his inquisition. \nTexas federal judge Ed Kinkeade issued an amendment giving Exxon the legal authority to probe Schneiderman’s communications. Healey was roped into the amendment as well. \nFollow Chris on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Dana Rohrabacher. In an unscientific online poll , Breitbart readers respectively ranked Giuliani, Bolton, Petraeus, Romney, then Rohrabacher as a preferred choice.

      "text": "21 min ago LARRY MAYER/Gazette Staff \nA large flame and black smoke on the eastern horizon in January was caused by a power outage at the ExxonMobil refinery, a company spokesman said. \nMontana is taking another look at the hazardous waste permit issued to Exxon refinery east of Billings. \nThe Department of Environmental Quality announced Thursday it would take public comment before reissuing Exxon’s hazardous materials permit. The permit is up for review every 10 years. \nThe 700-acre Exxon property includes a hazardous materials “land farm” where petroleum wastes are blended into tilled soil and allowed to break down over time. \nExxon also has an area where contaminated groundwater is being captured for cleanup, and two other areas where hazardous materials are washed from vehicles, or where barrels of hazardous materials are stored. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox   Daily Headlines   \nThe draft hazardous waste permit, a draft environmental assessment, and a fact sheet are available for review at the DEQ Billings office at 1371 Rimtop Drive in Billings, and the DEQ Metcalf Building at 1520 E. Sixth Ave. in Helena. The documents are also available on DEQ’s website at deq.mt.gov/Public/publiccomment . Tags",

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas\nWASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn't sold on who he wants as the nation's top diplomat.\nThough Mr. Trump's transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., one transition adviser said.\nA final decision by Mr. Trump could come by week's end, the adviser said.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates \"might grow a little bit.\"\nKellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday at Trump Tower in New York: \"It is true that he's broadened the search...He's very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president- elect's America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.\"\nSecretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced that he has selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his n ational security adviser.\nNormally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out with an unusual dose of drama.\nJohn Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is in the running for the post, arrived at Trump Tower Friday afternoon for a private meeting with the president-elect.\nAnother top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.\nSetting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with supporters of Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was \"impressed\" with the transition effort.\nOther candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration.\nGen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, \"I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\"\nOne of the questions facing Mr. Trump is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he were to pick Mr. Petraeus.\nComing to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors.\nSo far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department's scripted guidance for such conversations.\nMr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing's efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China's coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation.\nChoosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon's Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve those government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols.\nMr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy approach or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement.\nDuring the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing \"nation- building\" and \"regime-change.\" Yet he has also vowed to intensify military action against the Islamic State terrorist network.\n\"The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It's one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,\" said Phil Carter, the director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a center- left think tank.\n\"They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table, and that's it,\" Mr. Carter said. \"Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.\"\nMr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries from Canada to Papua New Guinea that often exerts itself abroad with the sweeping force of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor.\nAs Exxon's CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had close dealings for more than a decade .\nHis close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to Mr. Tillerson in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself, for instance, from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets its products.\nMr. Tillerson's corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice for chief diplomat, foreign policy analysts said.\nJon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but had also served in government.\n\"Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,\" Mr. Alterman said. \"I can't think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.\"\nAs head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders.\nAs Exxon's chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a $3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach $500 billion in investments.\n\"We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,\" Mr. Tillerson said at the company's annual meeting in May 2014.\nMr. Tillerson has some of the closest CEO ties to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin's resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country's Order of Friendship on the American businessman.\nMr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum $2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another $5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn't make a contribution to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving.\nBradley Olson and James V.

A final decision by Trump could come by week’s end, the adviser said.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates “might grow a little bit.”\nAn expanded version of this report appears on wsj.com.\nWrite to Carol E.

      "title": "Managing Business Process Performance.",
      "text": "Previous | Next \nThe trigger for this article was a recent chat with an ex- colleague from Exxon and sort of a past mentor on Performance Management for Processes. We talked about how we both have seen -over and over again- people having either various (and often conflicting) views and perception on how you measure the performance of a process or even thinking tat performance management is something relating to employ performance and nothing more. \nWhat \"is\" a Process (whether a business one or not) \nBesides any definition you want to give to what a process is (let's please accept this one for the moment: \"a process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end\"), a process has \n1. at least one input per step/ action2. at least one output per step/ action3. an environment where it takes place4. decisions /'criteria met' as to whether the next step will be executed or whether the previous step was successful \n5. (usually) a feedback- loop mechanism to manipulate/adjust the input per step/ action based on the criteria above \n6. possibly time- variable behavior; i.e. the 'behavior' of the process changes in time \n7. a time 'element' from begin to end of a full successful process cycle \n8. resources, yes resources; people do get assigned to processes \nBy the way, every process should have at least one Business Owner. \nSo, how do you manage process- performance? \nAgain please keep in mind that these concepts are generic ones and yes, they can and do apply to Employee Performance Management as well. \nWe manage processes so we can increase their output levels and/or improve (or even simply ensure) their quality deliverables, within a reasonable timeline; who would want to improve production or quality over a hundred years? Obviously we need to put both output /productivity and quality targets for every process. Sometime sit make sense to define both proactive and reactive 'activities' so tat we can achieve great process- outcomes. \nKeep all your senior management and relevant process 'leaders' or other key- executives, involved in day-to-day decisions relating to (re)defining and evaluating performance targets for the processes they own. \nAnd you must track performance/ 'progress' of a progress in order to control it/ manage it and optimize it. It all starts by defining what to measure and setting up a 'time shot' of these data- your 'zero- measurement' or 'zero- benchmark data'. \nIf you have enough historical data, when you can define a more appropriate set of benchmark points. \nSo simply put, create KPIs for all 8 'areas' mentioned above. \nWhat should Process Performance Management be: \nFormal: A clearly defined process, one that everybody understands and accepts \nRelevant & Reliable: All process- information should be relevant and reliable. \nFrequent & Timely Reports : Simply put, often and consistent information dissemination. \nAccountable: Everybody should be held accountable for the performance of the processes they own; but they should also be given the right authority and tools to reach the set performance targets. \nFeedback/ Continuous Process Improvement. \nOperational: Your employees should ideally work together on 'variable' / changing processes, so they came take day-to-day operational decisions. \nMost Common Pitfalls 1. Time- variable behavior. In business, we usually tend to measure averages instead of real-time values in a time-series manner; and this does work fine for any business process not containing variability in time . But, averages will hide any critical business process behavior. If you were able to photograph a process, what can you conclude about it if you no idea what happened immediately before or after the click of the shutter? In 2016, you can definitely 'see'/ 'audit' all time variances of your critical business processes and that might give rise to new solutions that mitigated the extreme variability. \n2. Metrics without Management This is so common and it happens to organizations of all sizes: process metrics and KPIs tat ...nobody asked for them, nobody is accountable, nobody is in charge of process performance so nobody in particular wants to see these metrics or the data. \n3. Wrongly defined KPIs. Unfortunately, defining KPIs is an art of its own and one should also make sure that even the well- defined KPIs are not outdated and irrelevant in any sense. \nAnd you need to have the right benchmark points in order to define great KPIs. \nTip: Avoid sinking in a irksome chaotic sea of too many KPIs \n4. Eternal Perfect Process & High-Efficiency obsession. \nI have seen it over and over and over again: people getting obsessed with optimizing a process been completely blind that no results are achieved besides waste of time and resources. \nSimple Advice: Amplify the positive behaviors of your process and minimize the negative ones. Just minimize- don't get obsessed with eliminating them. \n5. Quality vs Customer desires! Yes, of course, no one will even agree against quality of your product of services. But are your products or services derived from a relevant process, meet the customer expectations and needs. You need to have 'meet the customer expectations' KPIs for almost all your business processes. \n6. Improper Deployment of Process Management tools & methodologies. \nSometimes, the deployment is not done properly, or it is done without taking into account the maturity level of an organization. \n7. No Process Architecture & Process Framework. \n\"Process architecture is the structural design of general process systems and applies to business processes (enterprise architecture, policy and procedures, logistics, project management, etc.), and any other process system of varying degrees of complexity\". \nA Process Management Framework approach will make sure that you measure an as comprehensive set of metrics as possible and will also enable you to have metrics that are complementary to each other as well those that are in conflict with each other. \n8. Underestimating Costs. Measurements need tools, people to perform them, and take time. Make sure you have a budget for it. The right one so your Process Performance Management effort does not put on hold for centuries or turns into a fiasco. \n9. There are other pitfalls of course.... \nAre there tools for it? Yes, plenty of methodologies and even software tools out there. Kindly start by googling SixSigma, TQM, BPM (Business Process Management is a 'huge area') Modeling, CPM (Corporate Performance Management), Balanced Scorecard (BSC), EFQM model, Value Based Management etc \nThey all have one dominating principle/ belief in common: If it cannot be measured, it cannot be controlled\" . \nI am not making any profit from it and I am not endorsing it in any way, but I personally love and have been using ARIS for Performance Management. And of course that is very subjective. \nAnd some things from my 6Sigma Black Belt days, which I kindly suggest that you might want to google -please: Cp= Process Capability. A simple and straightforward indicator of process capability. Cpk= Process Capability Index. Ppk= Process Performance Index. \nIn Conclusion. Make sure that you start by properly defining your business processes, understand their environment, carefully set the relevant benchmark points and the correct KPIs. Also assign Business Owners for every single process. \nProvide workshops to facilitate discussion, acceptable, communication and improvement- work from all business owners. \nMeasure, measure, measure! But make sure please that your targets, KPIs and collected data are relevant and that they contain an equal number of Efficiency and Effectiveness Metrics . This is why a Process Management Framework approach will almost guarantee that you measure an as comprehensive set of metrics as possible. \nThis will also enable someone to include metrics that are complementary to each other as well those that are in conflict with each other. \nAll that aside, use your brain, exercise critical thinking in your Process Performance Management. I trust that you all understand that the electric light did not come from the human race's continuous improvement on candles. \n.

(Source: Shreveport Police Department) Shreveport police search for suspect accused of robbing Exxon gas station in west Shreveport. (Source: Shreveport Police Department) SHREVEPORT, LA (KSLA) - \nShreveport Police have released several images to the public in hopes that it will help them identify the suspect who robbed a west Shreveport service station early Sunday morning. \nIt happened just after 10:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 4 at the Exxon gas station located in the 900 block of Mansfield Road. \nAccording to an employee, the gunman entered the business armed with a hand gun, before demanding the clerk to hand over the cash drawer from the register. \nAfter stealing an unknown amount of cash, the suspect fled and was seen getting into what is believed to be a black Chevrolet Impala sedan. \nNo injuries were reported. \nThe suspect was described by witnesses as a male, dressed in a dark hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, with a white bandana covering a portion of his face. \nPolice are asking anyone with information about the crime to contact Crimestoppers at (318) 673-7373 or visit their website at www.lockemup.org . \nCopyright 2016 KSLA .

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas\nWASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn't sold on who he wants as the nation's top diplomat.\nThough Mr. Trump's transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., one transition adviser said.\nAlan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment.\nA final decision by Mr. Trump could come by week's end, the adviser said.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates \"might grow a little bit.\"\nKellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday at Trump Tower in New York: \"It is true that he's broadened the search...He's very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect's America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.\"\nSecretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced that he has selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his n ational security adviser.\nNormally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out with an unusual dose of drama.\nJohn Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is in the running for the post, arrived at Trump Tower Friday afternoon for a private meeting with the president-elect.\nAnother top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.\nSetting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with supporters of Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was \"impressed\" with the transition effort.\nOther candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration.\nGen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, \"I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\"\nOne of the questions facing Mr. Trump is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he were to pick Mr. Petraeus.\nComing to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors.\nSo far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department's scripted guidance for such conversations.\nMr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing's efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China's coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation.\nChoosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon's Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve those government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols.\nMr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy approach or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement.\nDuring the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing \"nation-building\" and \"regime-change.\" Yet he has also vowed to intensify military action against the Islamic State terrorist network.\n\"The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It's one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,\" said Phil Carter, the director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a center-left think tank.\n\"They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table, and that's it,\" Mr. Carter said. \"Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.\"\nMr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries from Canada to Papua New Guinea that often exerts itself abroad with the sweeping force of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor.\nAs Exxon's CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had close dealings for more than a decade .\nHis close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to Mr. Tillerson in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself, for instance, from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets its products.\nMr. Tillerson's corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice for chief diplomat, foreign policy analysts said.\nJon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but had also served in government.\n\"Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,\" Mr. Alterman said. \"I can't think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.\"\nAs head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders.\nAs Exxon's chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a $3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach $500 billion in investments.\n\"We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,\" Mr. Tillerson said at the company's annual meeting in May 2014.\nMr. Tillerson has some of the closest CEO ties to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin's resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country's Order of Friendship on the American businessman.\nMr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum $2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another $5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn't make a contribution to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving.\nBradley Olson and James V.

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas\nWASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn't sold on who he wants as the nation's top diplomat.\nThough Mr. Trump's transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., one transition adviser said.\nAlan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment.\nA final decision by Mr. Trump could come by week's end, the adviser said.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates \"might grow a little bit.\"\nKellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday at Trump Tower in New York: \"It is true that he's broadened the search...He's very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect's America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.\"\nSecretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced that he has selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his n ational security adviser.\nNormally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out with an unusual dose of drama.\nJohn Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is in the running for the post, arrived at Trump Tower Friday afternoon for a private meeting with the president-elect.\nAnother top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.\nSetting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with supporters of Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was \"impressed\" with the transition effort.\nOther candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration.\nGen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, \"I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\"\nOne of the questions facing Mr. Trump is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he were to pick Mr. Petraeus.\nComing to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors.\nSo far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department's scripted guidance for such conversations.\nMr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing's efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China's coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation.\nChoosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon's Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve those government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols.\nMr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy approach or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement.\nDuring the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing \"nation-building\" and \"regime-change.\" Yet he has also vowed to intensify military action against the Islamic State terrorist network.\n\"The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It's one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,\" said Phil Carter, the director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a center-left think tank.\n\"They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table, and that's it,\" Mr. Carter said. \"Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.\"\nMr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries from Canada to Papua New Guinea that often exerts itself abroad with the sweeping force of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor.\nAs Exxon's CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had close dealings for more than a decade .\nHis close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to Mr. Tillerson in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself, for instance, from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets its products.\nMr. Tillerson's corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice for chief diplomat, foreign policy analysts said.\nJon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but had also served in government.\n\"Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,\" Mr. Alterman said. \"I can't think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.\"\nAs head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders.\nAs Exxon's chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a $3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach $500 billion in investments.\n\"We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,\" Mr. Tillerson said at the company's annual meeting in May 2014.\nMr. Tillerson has some of the closest CEO ties to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin's resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country's Order of Friendship on the American businessman.\nMr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum $2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another $5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn't make a contribution to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving.\nBradley Olson and James V.

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas\nWASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn't sold on who he wants as the nation's top diplomat.\nThough Mr. Trump's transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., one transition adviser said.\nAlan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment.\nA final decision by Mr. Trump could come by week's end, the adviser said.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates \"might grow a little bit.\"\nKellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday at Trump Tower in New York: \"It is true that he's broadened the search...He's very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect's America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.\"\nSecretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced that he has selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his n ational security adviser.\nNormally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out with an unusual dose of drama.\nJohn Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is in the running for the post, arrived at Trump Tower Friday afternoon for a private meeting with the president-elect.\nAnother top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.\nSetting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with supporters of Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was \"impressed\" with the transition effort.\nOther candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration.\nGen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, \"I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\"\nOne of the questions facing Mr. Trump is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he were to pick Mr. Petraeus.\nComing to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors.\nSo far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department's scripted guidance for such conversations.\nMr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing's efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China's coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation.\nChoosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon's Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve those government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols.\nMr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy approach or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement.\nDuring the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing \"nation-building\" and \"regime-change.\" Yet he has also vowed to intensify military action against the Islamic State terrorist network.\n\"The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It's one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,\" said Phil Carter, the director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a center-left think tank.\n\"They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table, and that's it,\" Mr. Carter said. \"Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.\"\nMr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries from Canada to Papua New Guinea that often exerts itself abroad with the sweeping force of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor.\nAs Exxon's CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had close dealings for more than a decade .\nHis close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to Mr. Tillerson in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself, for instance, from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets its products.\nMr. Tillerson's corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice for chief diplomat, foreign policy analysts said.\nJon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but had also served in government.\n\"Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,\" Mr. Alterman said. \"I can't think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.\"\nAs head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders.\nAs Exxon's chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a $3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach $500 billion in investments.\n\"We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,\" Mr. Tillerson said at the company's annual meeting in May 2014.\nMr. Tillerson has some of the closest CEO ties to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin's resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country's Order of Friendship on the American businessman.\nMr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum $2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another $5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn't make a contribution to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving.\nBradley Olson and James V. Grimaldi contributed to this article.\nWrite to Carol E. Lee at carol.lee@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nDecember 04, 2016 14:21 ET (19:21 ",

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas\nWASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn't sold on who he wants as the nation's top diplomat.\nThough Mr. Trump's transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp., one transition adviser said.\nAlan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment.\nA final decision by Mr. Trump could come by week's end, the adviser said.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates \"might grow a little bit.\"\nKellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday at Trump Tower in New York: \"It is true that he's broadened the search...He's very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect's America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.\"\nSecretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced that he has selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his n ational security adviser.\nNormally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out with an unusual dose of drama.\nJohn Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is in the running for the post, arrived at Trump Tower Friday afternoon for a private meeting with the president-elect.\nAnother top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.\nSetting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with supporters of Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was \"impressed\" with the transition effort.\nOther candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration.\nGen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, \"I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\"\nOne of the questions facing Mr. Trump is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he were to pick Mr. Petraeus.\nComing to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors.\nSo far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department's scripted guidance for such conversations.\nMr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing's efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China's coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation.\nChoosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon's Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve those government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols.\nMr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy approach or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement.\nDuring the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing \"nation-building\" and \"regime-change.\" Yet he has also vowed to intensify military action against the Islamic State terrorist network.\n\"The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It's one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,\" said Phil Carter, the director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a center-left think tank.\n\"They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table, and that's it,\" Mr. Carter said. \"Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.\"\nMr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries from Canada to Papua New Guinea that often exerts itself abroad with the sweeping force of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor.\nAs Exxon's CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had close dealings for more than a decade .\nHis close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to Mr. Tillerson in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself, for instance, from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets its products.\nMr. Tillerson's corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice for chief diplomat, foreign policy analysts said.\nJon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but had also served in government.\n\"Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,\" Mr. Alterman said. \"I can't think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.\"\nAs head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders.\nAs Exxon's chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a $3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach $500 billion in investments.\n\"We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,\" Mr. Tillerson said at the company's annual meeting in May 2014.\nMr. Tillerson has some of the closest CEO ties to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin's resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country's Order of Friendship on the American businessman.\nMr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum $2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another $5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn't make a contribution to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving.\nBradley Olson and James V.

Tillerson’s interview comes after Trump aides said the President-elect had settled on four finalists. But Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that “there's not a finite list of candidates,” adding that there’s “more than four.”\nMost notably, Trump is considering 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani . He is also considering West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, the Journal reports.\nNeither Exxon nor a Trump spokesperson could be immediately reached for comment.\n ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson Is Now Interviewing to Be Donald Trump’s Secretary of State \nRex Tillerson, Exxon Mobile’s xom CEO, is in the running for a new job: Donald Trump’s Secretary of State. \nThe Wall Street Journal , citing an unnamed transition adviser, reports that the energy executive is set to set to meet with Trump for an interview this week. Tillerson’s interview comes after Trump aides said the President-elect had settled on four finalists. But Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that “there’s not a finite list of candidates,” adding that there’s “more than four.” \nMost notably, Trump is considering 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani . He is also considering West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, the Journal reports. \nNeither Exxon nor a Trump spokesperson could be immediately reached for comment. \n",

      "text": "By Teresa Rivas Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) is the integrated oil firm to beat, but that still doesn’t mean you should buy the stock, according to BMO Capital Markets’ Brendan Warn .\nGetty Images Warn initiated coverage of the stock with a Market Perform rating Monday, but his $78 price target is 10% below where the stock is trading today. He writes that while Exxon is “the gold standard major due to its quality chemicals business, balance sheet, and project delivery capabilities” he thinks the company lacks growth, making its price premium difficult to justify.\nDetails from his note:\nXOM benefits from greater downstream/ chemical contributions and from a more robust balance sheet. What XOM lacks, however, is upstream growth (flat ~4.0-4.2 mmboepd), and lower margin production makes it difficult for us to rank it ahead of its improving peers. \nWe forecast XOM to regain its premium return on average capital employed (ROACE) position relative to its peers, supported by its chemicals business and advantaged upstream portfolio; however, the competition, including Total ( TOT ) and Chevron ( CVX ), are closing the gap. \nThat’s not to say it’s all bad news for Exxon: Warn thinks it will reap benefits from its short-cycle Permian and Bakken investment and that it has discovered a valuable new production hub in Liza, Guyana.\nNonetheless he sees the company’s higher valuation, along with slower growth and a dividend payout than peers as sticking points going forward.\nThe shares were up 0.4% to $87.37 in recent trading.",

      "text": "December 05, 2016 at 17:28 PM EST My Watchlist for Tuesday, December 06 ( click to enlarge ) Exxon Mobil Corporation ( NYSE:XOM ) Still on my swing long list. Setting nicely for a breakout. ( click to enlarge ) Dynavax Technologies Corporation ( NASDAQ:DVAX ) made a strong move to the upside, closing near the highs. The stock is setting up to break out and has one more level to go, which is $5.30. A considerable short covering rally could be seen. ( click to enlarge ) Lipocine Inc ( NASDAQ:LPCN ) may finallybe ready to break higher above the 3.90 resistance level after a strong close today. Looking at the chart, indicators are flashing bullish signals. The MACD indicator is slightly negative but is rising above its signal line, while RSI is also rising. Nearest resistance for the stock is at $3.90. If this level is crossed and the stock is able to sustain above this level, then it might go to $5.75. ( click to enlarge ) ProNAi Therapeutics Inc ( NASDAQ:DNAI ) displayed some impressive relative strength today on volume with a 8% gain. On the technical side, MACD and RSI all point to upward trend. The stock broke and closed above the EMA20 for the first time in weeks and should continue to move. DNAI has a lot of upside potential, so watch it closely on Tuesday. ( click to enlarge ) Sarepta Therapeutics Inc ( NASDAQ:SRPT ) bounced nicely off the EMA200 and the shares look like they have some momentum. In my opinion, further upside potential exists to about 37.27, but today's reversal could be a significant turn. ( click to enlarge ) CoLucid Pharmaceuticals Inc ( NASDAQ:CLCD ) Looking for a breakout here. ( click to enlarge ) Geospace Technologies Corporation ( NASDAQ:GEOS ) is still trading around the $20 level, which has been a strong resistance over the past several weeks. I plan to buy the stock if it can break the 22.54 resistance level. The trend is still up.

These days the embassy isn’t going to stick its neck out for you, you have to figure it out. Your oil exec probably has more national presidents on his rolodex than any ambassador. And he probably knows their wives and kids. \nI dare say the average oil company guy has a better understanding about how the world works than the typical State Department dweeb. So this may not be a bid idea. 10 posted on 12/05/2016 5:21:42 PM PST by marron [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: springwater13 Although I have extensive experience as an SOS, I will not accept the position of SOS in President Trump's administration.\nThat is not to say I don't love SOS for breakfast... 11 posted on 12/05/2016 5:22:41 PM PST by SuperLuminal (Where is another agitator for republicanism like Sam Adams when we need him?)",

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo \nExxon Mobil has pulled out of half of the six exploration blocks it operated in the Kurdistan region, the Iraq Oil Report reported. \nThe oil company has walked away from its operations in the Qara Hanjeer, Arbat East, and Betwata blocks, the magazine reported, citing Kurdistan's Minister of Natural Resources Ashti Hawrami and Exxon spokeswoman Lauren Kerr. bit.ly/2h1FYWo \n\"Some companies didn't meet contractual deadlines and according to the contract had to relinquish their areas,\" the minister was quoted as saying. \nChevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company after Exxon Mobil, relinquished its interest in the Rovi block north of Erbil at the end of 2015 but continued to test wells in the Sarta area. \nSince 2014, international oil companies have renounced a total of 19 exploration blocks in Kurdistan, according to an analysis by the Iraq Oil Report. \nIn August, Iraqi state oil firm SOMO blacklisted three tankers involved in shipping crude from Kurdistan, swelling the dispute over oil revenue-sharing between Baghdad and the Kurdistan regional government. \n(Reporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) Next In Commodities Ahead of deal to cut, OPEC oil output hits record high: Reuters survey \nLONDON OPEC's oil output set another record high in November ahead of a deal to cut production, a Reuters survey found on Monday, helped by higher Iraqi exports and extra barrels from two nations exempted from cutting supply - Nigeria and Libya.",

      "text": "Fed judge rules AG Healey must appear in Texas for Exxon deposition Laurel J. Sweet Tuesday, December 06, 2016 Credit: Angela Rowlings (file) Attorney General Maura Healey comments A federal judge has rebuffed an attempt by Attorney General Maura Healey to avoid being questioned in Texas by attorneys for Exxon Mobil, setting the state for an extraordinarily rare deposition by a sitting AG.\nU.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade for the Northern District of Texas issued a brief order yesterday simply stating he was denying Healey's request \"after careful consideration.\"\nHe did not elaborate.\nIn April, Healey launched her probe into whether the $171-billion Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. has deceived consumers and investors about the potential environmental hazards of fossil fuel. If Healey prevails, Exxon Mobil would be forced to disclose records dating back to 1976 on what it knew about global warming and climate change.\nKinkeade last month ordered Healey to appear in Dallas Dec. 13 to answer questions about the probe, citing his \"concern\" about whether she launched her investigation \"with bias or prejudgment about what the investigation of Exxon would discover.\"\nLawyers for Healey had argued unsuccessfully to vacate that decision, contending in a court filing, \"Well-established precedent requires that depositions of high-ranking officials only occur in exceptional circumstances that are not present here. ... Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state government investigation to confound and effectively halt state law enforcement efforts by filing suit in the target's favored federal forum and permitting the target to ‘investigate the investigator.' \"\n“Our position in this ligation is that the authorities in Texas, and specifically the federal court down there, has no jurisdiction over state attorneys general and the work of their offices,\" Healey told the Herald last month. “It's been disappointing to see Exxon fight the request for basic information. Our job as attorneys general is to be able to ask questions.\"\nKinkeade, noting that Exxon Mobil suspects Healey was attempting “to satisfy a political agenda,\" issued a written ruling last month saying he needed to know more about what was behind her civil investigation demand before he finds for either side. He noted that Healey, along with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and former Vice President Al Gore, took part in an “AGs United For Clean Power\" press conference three weeks earlier, where Healey announced her plan to hold Exxon Mobil accountable.\nTomorrow, Exxon Mobil attorneys are expected to be in Boston for a hearing at Suffolk Superior Court, at which they will try to get Healey's investigation dismissed on First Amendment grounds.\nDeveloping ...",

      "text": "Schneiderman moves to dismiss Exxon lawsuit over climate investigation By Matthew Hamilton on December 6, 2016 at 11:35 AM \nState Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Exxon that seeks to put the brakes on his office’s investigation into what the company knew about its effects on climate change. \nThe motion was filed with a Texas federal court. \nA judge in November allowed New York to be added to a suit Exxon filed against the Massachusetts attorney general seeking to stop the enforcement of subpoenas for myriad documents related to a multi-state probe of the energy giant. Exxon already has produced more than 1 million pages of documents in response to New York’s subpoena, and a New York state court ordered in October that Exxon comply with the subpoena. \nThe Schneiderman motion argues that the Texas court lacks personal jurisdiction over the New York attorney general, thus must dismiss the Exxon complaint. \nIn addition to his motion to dismiss the the suit, Schneiderman also has filed a motion to quash Exxon’s motion for discovery, which includes a request for depositions by senior AG staff. \nMeanwhile, a Texas judge has ordered that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a lead AG in the investigation along with Schneiderman, must appear in Texas to be deposed by Exxon attorneys. \nExxon has claimed that the investigations are politically motivated, while the attorneys general have denied such a charge. \nThe documents are below:",

      "text": "Russia ties complicate Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson's prospects for Trump secretary of state gig Filed under Politics at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up   Texas oilman Rex Tillerson was set to meet today with Donald Trump -- a late entrant into the high stakes jockeying for secretary of state, and one whose close ties to Russia have raised eyebrows. \nAs head of Exxon Mobil, the world's 8 th largest company, Tillerson has plenty of negotiating experience and face time with world leaders -- though limited experience when it comes to the gamut of issues the nation's chief diplomat deals with. \nHe's under pressure for ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, especially given questions about the president-elect's outspoken admiration for the Russian strongman. \nEnvironmentalists and Democrats say they relish the prospect of confirmation hearings that put the head of an oil giant under oath. \n\"There are plenty of other candidates for secretary of State who don't bring that kind of baggage to the table and would not engender that kind of firestorm at confirmation hearings,\" Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Politico. \"Of the candidates I've seen, none would fare worse than Rex Tillerson.\" \nSenate Democrats see a Tillerson nomination as an opening to grill him over allegations that Exxon suppressed internal research about climate change and, in particular, the impact of fossil fuels on climate. \nJust over a year ago, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched a probe into whether Exxon misled investors, regulators, and the public about its climate research since the late 1970s. Massachusetts and the Virgin Islands also opened investigations. \n\"Covering up climate science and deceiving investors qualifies you for federal investigation, not federal office,\" said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, an environmental group. \"An oil baron as Secretary of State would do enormous damage. Tillerson could deeply disrupt international efforts towards climate action, take retribution against countries that defy the oil industry, and help write more international trade deals that put profit ahead of people and planet.\" \nTillerson apparently entered and left Trump Tower without passing journalists camped out in the main lobby. Trump aides said his appointment was in the morning. \nTrump had focused on four candidates for secretary of state: Mitt Romney; former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee; and retired Gen. David Petraeus. \nRomney, the party's 2012 nominee, was among Trump's harshest critics during the primaries. They met twice in recent weeks and apparently hit it off -- triggering backlash from Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and other loyalists who view the post as too big a prize for someone who tried to block Trump's ascent.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) AP Outgoing U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman at the White House on Jan. 19, 2011. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) \nAmid the squabbling, reports surfaced this weekend that Trump broadened the search to include John Bolton, a United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush; former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., a Republican who speaks some Mandarin and served as ambassador to China under President Barack Obama; West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat; and Tillerson. \nHuntsman called on Trump to drop off the ticket in October, after the revelation of a vulgar \"Access Hollywood\" tape on which Trump bragged about groping women. Over the weekend, he defended Trump's precedent-breaking phone call with the president of Taiwan, which angered mainland China. \nIrving-based Exxon, with operations in 50 countries and on six continents, is the largest company with headquarters in Texas, and the eighth largest in the world by revenue. Tillerson joined the company as an engineer in 1975 after graduating from the University of Texas, and he's led the company since 2006. \nTillerson faces mandatory retirement when he turns 65 in March. \nHe reportedly owns $151 million worth of Exxon shares. Ethics laws likely would force him to sell to avoid conflicts of interest. But like other wealthy cabinet picks, he would enjoy a huge windfall because of an obscure law that eliminates the tax bite when federal appointees are forced to divest holdings. \nTrump's election could lead to a dramatic pivot in U.S.-Russian relations, which soured after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. U.S. intelligence officials blame Russia for hacking into Democratic Party emails to interfere with the presidential election. \nFew Americans are closer with Putin than Tillerson , who has long represented Exxon's interests in Russia. \n\"He has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably any other American with the exception of Henry Kissinger,\" John Hamre, a deputy defense secretary during the Clinton administration and president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank where Tillerson is a board member, told the Wall St. Journal. \nIn 2011 Exxon beat out BP and other competitors in a historic deal giving it access to Arctic and other deposits in Russia , while allowing state-owned Rosneft its first-ever access to energy projects in the United States. The next year, \"the Kremlin bestowed the country's Order of Friendship decoration\" on Tillerson, the Journal reported. \nBut as Bloomberg recounted, \"shortly after the venture discovered a billion-barrel crude field in the Kara Sea, the U.S. and European Union imposed sanctions\" after Russia's invasion of Crimea. Lifting those sanctions would hit Exxon's bottom line. View Comments",

      "text": "Common Dreams Dems Plan to Grill Tillerson on Exxon's Climate Fraud \nIf Rex Tillerson is nominated for Secretary of State, progressives plan to use confirmation hearing to finally force Exxon CEO to testify under oath about what #ExxonKnew by 0 Comments \n\"Everything is on the table when it comes to [Tillerson] testifying under oath,\" a Senate Democratic aide told Politico . (Photo: Getty Images) \nIf President-elect Donald Trump nominates ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State , Democrats and progressives see a glimmer of a silver lining. Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearing would give environmentalists the chance to finally see Tillerson testify under oath about ExxonMobil's climate fraud . \nTillerson, who was paid $33 million in 2014 , has led Exxon as it engages in an aggressive campaign to attack journalists and activists who have tried to highlight the company's misinformation campaign surrounding climate change—and he's also been in charge while the company continues to fund climate change deniers . \n\"Everything is on the table when it comes to [Tillerson] testifying under oath,\" a Senate Democratic aide told Politico . The aide said that Tillerson would \"absolutely get those questions. The fact that they're not cognizant of that being an issue [...] shows a kind of tone deafness to what they're facing here.\" \nProgressives also see a chance to galvanize the public about Tillerson's and Exxon's record. \"[Trump] is handing us campaign opportunities,\" Jamie Henn, 350.org co-founder, told Politico. \nDespite Democratic opposition, without a majority in the Senate Tillerson's appointment would likely be approved—and the empowered oil baron would pose a stark danger to the climate. As 350.org executive director May Boeve argued in a statement: \nCovering up climate science and deceiving investors qualifies you for federal investigation, not federal office. An oil baron as Secretary of State would do enormous damage. Tillerson could deeply disrupt international efforts towards climate action, take retribution against countries that defy the oil industry, and help write more international trade deals that put profit ahead of people and planet. \nThe dangers of a Tillerson appointment are stark, Beove said: \"Rex Tillerson made millions off of Exxon's strategy of denial and doubt, and would have every incentive to continue the deception while Secretary of State.\" This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License Share This Article",

      "text": "TOP Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (C) speaks at a news conference with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (R) and other U.S. State Attorney's General to announce a state-based effort to combat climate change in the Manhattan borough of New York City, March 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar 5363126 \nOne of the attorneys general behind the Exxon Mobil investigations has shifted the justification for the probes as pressure mounts for the Democrat to explain her role in the crusade. \nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has months told reporters that Exxon must be held to account for supposedly hiding climate research for decades from the public. \nThe Democrat is now vacating that position, moving instead to one where the investigations were merely meant to determine whether Exxon acted against the law. \n“The goal of this investigation is to get to the bottom of what happened, whether or not it’s true that Exxon knew certain information and made misrepresentations to consumers and investors,” Healey told reporters Monday . “It’s as simple as that.” \nThe Exxon-crusader’s new justification stands in stark contrast to her previously held position. \n“We can all see today the troubling disconnect between what Exxon knew, what industry folks knew, and what the company and industry chose to share with investors and with the American public,” Healey said in March at a press conference attended by former President Al Gore. \nHealey’s crusade was part of a multi-state effort among liberal attorneys general, lawmakers, and celebrities to probe Exxon for allegedly trying to cover up decades of global warming science. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, also launched an investigation into Exxon in November for similar reasons. His investigation has also come under intense scrutiny. \nTexas federal judge Ed Kinkeade said in November that Healey was probably acting in “bad faith” when she issued a subpoena to the oil company for 30-years’ worth of documents related to the company’s information about climate change. \nExxon wants Kinkeade to prohibit Healey from continuing her investigation, arguing the probe violates the company’s First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. It also refutes the idea it violated the law and claims it promotes carbon taxes to fight man-made global warming. \nHealey has refused to comply with Kinkeade’s order to hash out specifics about her investigation into whether the oil company knowingly shelved research showing the effects fossil fuels have on the climate. \nFollow Chris on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Sweet Tuesday, December 06, 2016 Credit: Angela Rowlings (file) Attorney General Maura Healey comments A federal judge has rebuffed an attempt by Attorney General Maura Healey to avoid being questioned in Texas by attorneys for Exxon Mobil, setting the stage for an extraordinarily rare deposition of a sitting AG.\nU.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade for the Northern District of Texas issued a brief order yesterday simply stating he was denying Healey's request \"after careful consideration.\"\nHe did not elaborate.\nIn April, Healey launched her probe into whether the $171-billion Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. has deceived consumers and investors about the potential environmental hazards of fossil fuel. If Healey prevails, Exxon Mobil would be forced to disclose records dating back to 1976 on what it knew about global warming and climate change.\nKinkeade last month ordered Healey to appear in Dallas Dec. 13 to answer questions about the probe, citing his \"concern\" about whether she launched her investigation \"with bias or prejudgment about what the investigation of Exxon would discover.\"\nLawyers for Healey had argued unsuccessfully to vacate that decision, contending in a court filing, \"Well-established precedent requires that depositions of high-ranking officials only occur in exceptional circumstances that are not present here. ... Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state government investigation to confound and effectively halt state law enforcement efforts by filing suit in the target's favored federal forum and permitting the target to ‘investigate the investigator.' \"\n“Our position in this ligation is that the authorities in Texas, and specifically the federal court down there, has no jurisdiction over state attorneys general and the work of their offices,\" Healey told the Herald last month. “It's been disappointing to see Exxon fight the request for basic information. Our job as attorneys general is to be able to ask questions.\"\nKinkeade, noting that Exxon Mobil suspects Healey was attempting “to satisfy a political agenda,\" issued a written ruling last month saying he needed to know more about what was behind her civil investigation demand before he finds for either side. He noted that Healey, along with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and former Vice President Al Gore, took part in an “AGs United For Clean Power\" press conference three weeks earlier, where Healey announced her plan to hold Exxon Mobil accountable.\nTomorrow, Exxon Mobil attorneys are expected to be in Boston for a hearing at Suffolk Superior Court, at which they will try to get Healey's investigation dismissed on First Amendment grounds.\nDeveloping ...",

The filing said any issue with his office’s 2015 subpoena seeking documents on the company’s history of climate change research and whether they made misstatements should take place in New York.

      "text": "Climate Change Exxon's Failing PR Strategy Kara Alaimo is an assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University and author of “Pitch, Tweet, or Engage on the Street: How to Practice Global Public Relations and Strategic Communication.” She previously served in the Obama administration. Kara Alaimo \nThis Thursday’s issue of the New York Review of Books features a remarkable accusation against ExxonMobil: that the company has engaged in a decades-long effort to cover up what it knows about climate change. The charge, leveled in a 6,000-word essay by David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman of the Rockefeller Family Fund, is the latest salvo in a high-profile campaign funded by the heirs of John D. Rockefeller against the largest successor to the company he founded. It began when the Rockefeller Family Fund announced it would divest from ExxonMobil in March, arguing there was “no sane rationale” to invest in fossil fuels as the world warms. And the push is far from over: In a follow-up essay , Kaiser and Wasserman warn investors that unless the company addresses climate concerns, its share price will “probably decline substantially.” \nAddressing this public relations crisis has become critical for Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, who is interviewing with Donald Trump this week to be the next U.S. secretary of state. But so far, Exxon is epically mismanaging the problem. Back in March, an Exxon spokesperson responded to the Rockefeller Fund’s concerns by accusing the nonprofit of “ funding a conspiracy against us .” If a student proposed this response in my PR 101 class, I’d fail him. \nHere’s how the company should handle the Rockefellers. \nFirst, Tillerson needs to set the company’s priorities straight.   Exxon’s most valuable asset isn’t its booked reserves. It’s the company’s reputation. According to research by Weber Shandwick, one of the world’s largest PR firms, 63 percent of a company’s market value is attributable to its reputation. Leslie Gaines-Ross, the firm’s chief reputation strategist, says CEOs believe reputation risks are the very gravest threat to their companies -- greater than the hazards posed by regulation, political uncertainty, security breaches, natural disasters and a host of other dangers. \nThis means that Exxon’s top priority must be protecting its reputation at any cost. That can’t be done without making peace with the Rockefellers. By accusing the Rockefellers of a conspiracy, Exxon is wagering that it can convince shareholders, law enforcement officials and the larger public that the company is right and the Rockefellers are wrong. But it can’t. \nExxon is a company that burns fossil fuels, which scientists have proven threatens the continuation of human life on earth. The Rockefeller Family Fund is a philanthropic organization funded by a venerated American family that backs efforts to help elderly people vote and moms take time off work when their kids are sick. In a battle for public opinion, the Rockefellers will win every time. \nTherefore, the only way for Exxon to effectively address this problem is to satisfy the Rockefellers. Specifically, in their follow-up story, Kaiser and Wasserman call for Exxon to publicly release all of the documents requested by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in his investigation of the company for consumer and securities fraud. Exxon should do so today. \nWithholding information requested by journalists only deepens reputational damage because it prolongs a PR disaster. The truth always emerges eventually. That’s why I teach my PR students that, when they experience a crisis, the best thing to do is to lay out all the facts immediately for the media. They’re going to face a slew of negative press in the short term regardless of their response. But if they come completely clean, afterwards, journalists and investigators will be left with nothing new to report. \nIf Exxon has covered up information, as Kaiser and Wasserman allege, it’s in the company’s interests to admit to any past wrongdoing on its own terms and make amends now, rather than waiting for law enforcement officials to force them to do so. Perhaps the only thing worse for the company’s reputation than causing catastrophic environmental degradation is being perceived as doing so deliberately and deceptively. \nAnother tenet of reputation management is to never let a good crisis go to waste. Helio Fred Garcia, who as president of the crisis management firm the Logos Consulting Group has counseled dozens of Fortune 500 CEOs facing critical challenges, is fond of reminding clients that the ancient Greek roots of the English word “crisis” refer to the moment in a tragedy when the protagonist makes a choice that determines his or her destiny. The same is true for companies. \nTo be sure, if Exxon has and discloses information that the fossil fuels it is burning will have catastrophic effects on the environment, the company will be forced to make some very painful changes. However, they could serve Exxon well in the long run. At the turn of the 20th century, horse and buggy companies would have benefited if they saw themselves as transportation companies rather than horse companies. Likewise, if Exxon makes a greater push away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy -- the business of the future -- it will be better-positioned to survive over the longer term. \nThat’s why effectively managing crises can actually make a company stronger. In fact, the researchers Rory Knight and Deborah Petty have found that the stock prices of companies that handle crises well actually increase . \nOnce Exxon is set on this course, it needs to make public amends with Kaiser and Wasserman. One of the Rockefeller Family Fund’s major priorities is addressing the climate crisis. It is not unthinkable that Exxon and the family might partner on such initiatives, which would be an enormous boon for the company’s reputation. \nOf course, Exxon’s alternative is to keep claiming the Rockefellers are wrong. The current U.S. secretary of state speculated about that possibility in 2015. “It’s tobacco -- it’s R.J. Reynolds all over again,” John Kerry told Rolling Stone last December. “Exxon Mobil stands potentially to lose billions of dollars in what I would imagine would be one of the largest class-action lawsuits in history.” \nTo try to head this off, ExxonMobil’s best bet is to disclose what it knows and any past wrongdoing now. The company must forcefully work to rebuild its reputation and long-term viability by making greater investments in the energy of the future. Its current strategy just isn’t good enough.

      "text": "Contact: \nLindsay Meiman, 350.org Responds to Exxon Subpoena: “Exxon is Trying to Distract the Public by Directly Attacking Us” \nNew York, N.Y. - 350.org objected to all grounds of a subpoena received directly from ExxonMobil. In response, Jamie Henn, 350.org Communications Director issued the following statement: \n\"We must be doing something right to get subpoenaed by the world's largest oil company. Clearly the revelations about Exxon's climate cover up have hit a nerve. Rather than admitting the truth, Exxon is trying to distract the public by directly attacking us. Instead they're just proving our point: when faced with an opportunity to come clean, Exxon is falling back on its long history of deceit, denial and delay. We of course will continue to shine a spotlight on Exxon's climate crimes.\" ### \n350 is the red line for human beings, the most important number on the planet. The most recent science tells us that unless we can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million, we will cause huge and irreversible damage to the earth. But solutions exist. All around the world, a movement is building to take on the climate crisis, to get humanity out of the danger zone and below 350. This movement is massive, it is diverse, and it is visionary. We are activists, scholars, and scientists. We are leaders in our businesses, our churches, our governments, and our schools. We are clean energy advocates, forward-thinking politicians, and fearless revolutionaries. And we are united around the world, driven to make our planet livable for all who come after us.

      "text": "TOP Meg Bell (R) holds a banner during a protest before the start of the Exxon Mobil Corporation Shareholders Meeting in Dallas, Texas, May 28, 2008. REUTERS/Mike Stone 5365648 \nOil rich Rockefeller family came clean about directing various U.S. attorneys general to target Exxon Mobil over the company supposedly hiding decades worth of climate research. \nThe only way to target Exxon for hiding climate change research was to request the New York AGs office to open an investigation into the company, David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman, directors of the Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF), wrote Wednesday in an editorial for New York Books. \n“It is up to government officials, not public interest advocates, to determine whether ExxonMobil’s conduct” violated state law, so the RFF “informed state attorneys general of our concern that ExxonMobil seemed to have failed” to make public the risks climate change poses to investors, they wrote. \nThe two RFF executives impressed upon New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman the importance of using a little-known law called the Martin Act to take down Exxon. \nThe New York Democrat began his investigation in 2015, which, according to a New York Times report at the time, was “demanding extensive financial records, emails and other documents” from the oil producer dating all the way back to the 1970s. \nThe law can be invoked only in the likelihood that a reasonable investor would have avoided buying or selling stock in a company if it omitted information deemed important by the investor. \nLegal expert Merritt Fox believes Exxon is unlikely to be charged with any criminal conspiracy under the Martin Act. \nSince “the market was well supplied with information about climate change,” Fox said in June, “… I’d be kind of amazed if what the Exxon scientists knew was so different from what other scientists outside Exxon knew and were publicly available that it would change that total mix in a significant way.” \nKaiser and Wasserman admitted in an earlier version of the article that the family intended all along to bring down Exxon because of its supposed anti-global warming positions. \n“[W]e paid for a team of independent reporters from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism to try to determine what Exxon and other US oil companies had really known about climate science, and when,” Kaiser and Wesserman wrote in November. \nWasserman’s admission runs contrary to previous comments suggesting Exxon was never singled out when it donated $25,000 to InsideClimate News, an environmental news outfit that published similar reports in September. \nFollow Chris on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Common Dreams Green Groups Subpoenaed by Exxon Say They 'Must Be Doing Something Right' \n'Clearly ExxonMobil is feeling the heat from legal, financial, and public scrutiny into its ongoing climate deception and will stop at nothing to distract and delay' by 0 Comments \n\"No matter how much money and lawyering ExxonMobil throw at us, we will continue to stand strong for scientific integrity,\" says Union of Concerned Scientists director of science and policy Peter Frumhoff. (Photo: AP) \nAt least two major U.S. environmental organizations have been subpoenaed directly by ExxonMobil, as the fight heats up over what the fossil fuel behemoth knew, and hid, about climate change. \nBoth 350.org and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS)—plus one individual UCS employee—received subpoenas from the oil giant on November 9 demanding documents and communications related to the ExxonKnew probe. Exxon is trying to quash investigations by state attorneys general into whether the company improperly deceived consumers, investors, and the public about climate change long after it knew the dangers. \"Clearly ExxonMobil is feeling the heat from legal, financial and public scrutiny into its ongoing climate deception and will stop at nothing to distract and delay investigations.\"—Peter Frumhoff, Union of Concerned Scientists \nBut for both groups, the subpoenas are a sign they are on the right track. \n\"We must be doing something right to get subpoenaed by the world's largest oil company,\" said 350.org co-founder Jamie Henn on Wednesday. \n\"Clearly the revelations about Exxon's climate cover up have hit a nerve,\" he said. \"Rather than admitting the truth, Exxon is trying to distract the public by directly attacking us. Instead they're just proving our point: when faced with an opportunity to come clean, Exxon is falling back on its long history of deceit, denial, and delay. We of course will continue to shine a spotlight on Exxon's climate crimes.\" In a statement provided to Common Dreams , Peter Frumhoff, the UCS employee who was subpoenaed, added: \"Clearly ExxonMobil is feeling the heat from legal, financial, and public scrutiny into its ongoing climate deception and will stop at nothing to distract and delay investigations. So we're not surprised the company chose to drag me and UCS into its court battle. No matter how much money and lawyering ExxonMobil throw at us, we will continue to stand strong for scientific integrity and ensure that policies and actions by public officials, including state attorneys general, are grounded in the best available science.\" \nPrevious subpoenas to these and other groups from the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee were rebuffed , and the latest demands from Exxon are likely to be met with similar refusal. \nIndeed, a memo (pdf) from 350.org attorney Abbe David Lowell dated November 23 outlined the group's objections to each of the subpoena's 12 requests and said as a result of the stated objections, 350.org \"will not produce any documents.\" \nIn addition to infringing on the group's First Amendment rights, the memo suggests the subpoena's scope is \"overly broad\" and \"unduly burdensome.\" \nReporting in November indicated that Exxon had sent letters to \"a variety of non-governmental organizations to preserve all communications regarding climate change investigations with a sweeping array of other groups and individuals—including members of the press,\" according to the Washington Post . The Post named UCS and the Rockefeller Family Fund as among the groups who received such letters. \nGreenpeace, one of the major organizations included in the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's round of subpoenas, told Common Dreams on Wednesday it has not been subpoenaed by Exxon.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The Total SA-led Papua LNG project in Papua New Guinea may export gas via Exxon Mobil Corp.’s existing PNG LNG facility to avoid the expense of building a new plant, Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said. While the cost of developing the country’s natural gas resources are about half those of neighboring Australia, building a multi-billion dollar unit to export the fuel may not be viable in an era of low oil prices, he said in an interview in Sydney on Wednesday.\n“We need to continue to maintain a competitive edge in our country by maintaining cost levels that will ensure the project gets off the ground,” O’Neill said. “If there are areas where we can save costs including sharing the infrastructure there already in the current LNG project, we are quite happy to go along with that.” \nA global supply glut has pushed prices down by more than 60 percent in the past three years, raising questions over how quickly a next wave of LNG supplies will be developed. Buyers have shied away from signing long-term agreements that have historically helped fund new projects, which can take six or seven years to develop. \nThe world will need an estimated 175 million metric tons of additional LNG annually by 2030 even after including all the plants that are under construction or have been approved for investment, Richard Guerrant, a vice president with the Exxon’s gas, power and marketing arm, said Tuesday. That would be more than two-thirds of all the LNG produced globally last year. \nThe PNG LNG project, operated by Exxon, began production in 2014 from a two-train production unit with a capacity of 6.9 million tons of LNG per year. Exxon is also set to become a major shareholder in the Total-run group planning Papua LNG, the country’s next major gas venture, due to its impending takeover of InterOil Corp. \nLNG in PNG, including development, operational and shipping costs is the world’s cheapest and less expensive than in the U.S., Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Neil Beveridge said in Sept. 7 note. \nA Total spokeswoman in Paris didn’t immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment. An Exxon spokeswoman for PNG didn’t immediately respond to a phone call. \nParis-based Total, which operates the Papua LNG venture, hasn’t ruled out a separate greenfield LNG development and needs to explore the economics of supplying gas to an expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant, the company’s PNG Managing Director Philippe Blanchard said Monday. Realistic Outlook \nO’Neill said it was vital the Papua LNG project gets off the ground but the government needs to be realistic about the best method of commercializing its gas resources. It hopes to take discussions forward with companies including Exxon and Total in early 2017. \n“I understand there is good demand for our gas because it is much cleaner than many of the others on the market,” he said. “I do not see a problem in which we will be shut out of the market. In Japan cleaner gas is much preferred to what is being sold by some of our competitors.” \nThe PNG government confirmed it will hold talks with resource owners including PNG LNG about diverting some gas supplies to the domestic market, while also tweaking the fiscal terms covering future expansions. \nA sovereign wealth fund is also likely to be introduced in 2017 from energy and mining revenues although O’Neill declined to specify any targets.
