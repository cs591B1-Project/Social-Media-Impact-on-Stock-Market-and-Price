      "text": "Tweet Shares 0 Is anyone as thrilled as I am about the new Gilmore Girls season coming to Netflix on November 25th? My husband is shaking his head at this very moment. The Gilmore Girls is a mother-daughter television series that aired the on The WB back in 2000. My college roommates would binge-watch it for hours, often being late for a class or missing it altogether because they just couldn’t break away. I fell in love with Lorelei Gilmore, and her daughter Rory, about two years ago on Netflix. I had just brought home my little guy from the hospital and was faced with hours and hours of breastfeeding. The Gilmore Girls was my breastfeeding jam! I watched the entire 7 seasons in a rocking chair while my little fella chugged away. (Side note: it’s crazy you can spend that much time breastfeeding!) Now our favorite characters are back in a new Netflix Gilmore Girls revival called “ A Year in the Life.” I’m titillated, to say the least. If you haven’t jumped on the Gilmore Girls train yet, do it. It offers you hours and even months of warm fuzzies, LOL moments, and all around top-notch girly-girl binge watching. Here are 9 valuable life lessons we can learn from the Gilmore Girls. 9 Cool Lessons We Can Learn from the ‘Gilmore Girls’ 1. Single moms rock. If you’re a single mom, rockstar hand in the air to you. Like Lorelei Gilmore, single moms have to bear the brunt of the tough stuff that is usually split by two in a relationship. There’s working to pay the bills, cooking, cleaning, fixing, nurturing, and doing all of these things while still being there for your child. Single mamas, you are amazing. 2. Mother/daughter relationships can be complicated. Not every mother/daughter relationship is all roses and Saks Fifth Avenue shopping. Rory and Lorelei have one of the closest mother/daughter relationships out there (they hang out together on Friday nights!). But Lorelei and her wound-tight mother Emily have a very strained relationship. It just goes to show that we all love our mommies, but sometimes the road can be rocky. 3. You work through your problems. From the roof caving in, to figuring out how to get money for college tuition, the Gilmore Girls always find a way to work through their problems without curling up in the fetal position. Tackle those problems head on, ladies! There’s nothing that a YouTube tutorial or a little creativity can’t fix! 4. Family is everything. Whether you get along 24-7 or not, family is and always will be the most important entity in life. Family is everything and don’t you ever forget it. 5. Every woman needs a best friend, especially one who can bake. How can you not love Lorelei’s BFF Sookie (played by Melissa McCarthy)? She’s the jovial, devoted best friend that also happens to be an amazing chef and baker. Every gal deserves a bestie who will come over at the drop of a hat with brownies in tow. 6. Grandparents play an important role, even if they’re different than you. In the show, Rory’s grandparents Richard and Emily are stuffy, wealthy socialites whom Lorelei would rather not be in Rory’s life. But inevitably, their paths converge and we find that every kid deserves to have grandparents in her life. Whether they ride in a motorcycle club or eat their cucumber sandwiches with the utmost care, your kids deserve to know their grandma or grandpa. 7. The path your kid chooses might be different than what you want for them. Kids aren’t like remote controls—they don’t always go the direction we point them in. When Rory chooses to go to her grandparent’s alma mater, Lorelei is 100% sure she’s made a terrible decision. We might not always agree with our kids’ chosen paths, but we walk by them every step of the way. 8. Guys will come and guys will go. One of the most maddening things about The Gilmore Girls is the influx of males. Both Lorelei and Rory have chronic indigestion when it comes to dating. There’s always some pain, discomfort, and difficulty committing. It just goes to show that guys will come and guys will come and guys will go, but in the end, you’re a confident woman who can stand on her own. 9. Even adult kids need their parents. There will be times in life that we all need our mommies and daddies, no matter how old we are. No matter how tough or independent you think you are, even adult kids need their parents. Now if you haven’t watched Gilmore Girls, you’ve got a lot of binge-watching ahead to be ready for the new season on Netflix!",

      "text": "Apple News Entertainment News Television Top News TV/Radio/Film/Theater Urban Films 0 Comments 0 views \n*Bounce TV is joining the subscription streaming service world by launching a new app called Brown Sugar — available on mobile phones, tablets and online for $4 per month. \nThe service is home to iconic movies that defined the blaxploitation genre, including: The Mack, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Super Fly, Dolemite, Cotton Comes to Harlem, Uptown Saturday Night, Cooley High, Three The Hard Way, Coffy, Black Caesar, Five on the Black Hand Side, Cleopatra Jones, Mandingo, Willie Dynamite, Which Way is Up?, Car Wash, and The Original Gangstas . \n“I’m really excited to share what we’re doing. This is so broad,” actress Pam Grier told Vibe magazine . “When we look at such a collection that is so large, it transcends and encompasses so many films that I have done that reflect pop culture, but so many artists like Shaft (Richard Roundtree), he’s the real James Bond to me. You have Ron O’Neal, Eddie Murphy, [just] so many films, that you have can stream to see what our pop culture was.” \nREAD RELATED STORY: ‘Extreme Makeover: Home Edition’ Family Accused Of Ditching Foster Kids After Show \nGrier became known in the early 1970s for starring in a string of successful women in prison and blaxploitation films like The Big Bird Cage , Coffy , Foxy Brown and Sheba Baby . She starred in Quentin Tarantino’s film Jackie Brown , for which she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. \nPam Grier and actor Fred “The Hammer” Williamson are the ambassadors of the app, alongside producer and fan of the blaxploitation genre Rick Ross. The trio appear in a new commercial for the streaming service, check it out below. \n“You can see the influence of these movies in every aspect of rap and hip-hop; in the music, the lyrics, the fashion and overall style,” Ross said in a statement. “The Blaxploitation genre is where it all began.” \n“Brown Sugar is just like Netflix, only blacker,” Grier said. To those unfamiliar these films, Pam describes ’em like this: “Kids today are a reflection of who they are and where they’re going and how they’re responding to what’s going on in the world. They’ve learned inclusion and we’re having issues of exclusion. The kids today are what I was 40 years ago, standing up and making an identity and fighting for it.” \nShe continued: “It is education and revisiting a time where they could sit with their parents and grandparents about what we wrote and danced to. That’s what was happening then and every generation will have it. Whether it’s SXSW or Burning Man. You see artists interchanging and sharing their music and passion. It comes from the heart and sometimes it comes from the sword. The African American soul is not monolithic, it’s liberal, moderate, fundamental and conservative. The music is based off plain old church gospel.” \nRead Pam’s full Vibe interview HERE \nYou can also get your free trial of Brown Sugar HERE .",

      "text": "8:00am PT by Kate Stanhope 'Gilmore Girls': Will Netflix's Revival Lead to More Episodes? Netflix Now that the Netflix four-part installment has been released, the question turns to whether there will be more to come. \n[Warning: This story contains spoilers from all four parts of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .] \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life brought everything full circle. And no, we're not just talking about the explosive, knock-down fight between Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) on the day of Richard's funeral in \"Winter.\" The final four words, as God and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino intended them, brought the entire franchise exactly to where it began when Rory (Alexis Bledel) dropped the bombshell on her newly betrothed mother that she was, in fact, pregnant. \nOn one level, the final four words brought closure. The show's die-hard fans spent nearly a decade agonizing over how Sherman-Palladino had envisioned to wrap up the original WB series before she and husband and executive producer Dan Palladino unexpectedly left over a contract dispute at the end of season six, and the Netflix revival helped answer that question once and for all. \nOn the other hand, the circumstances surrounding Rory's surprising news seems to leave things open for yet another batch of new episodes. The father of Rory's unborn baby was unconfirmed as the final credits rolled. Even if it is Logan (Matt Czuchry), as their ongoing affair through the revival seems to suggest, his engagement to a French heiress and their complicated relationships with each other's family opens up a whole new slew of issues. Sure, Rory never seemed particularly in need of a father, as Christopher's (David Sutcliffe) brief return in the revival also seemed to imply, but the audience's investment in Rory's love life over the years (#TeamDean, #TeamJess and #TeamLogan, anyone?) makes the lack of confirmation all that more difficult to swallow. \nThe question about the possibility of more episodes also comes in the midst of revival frenzy, brought upon at least in part by Gilmore Girls . When the show originally went off the air in 2007, such reunions and revivals were extremely few and far between. But in 2016, streamers like Netflix have given much more weight to revival hopes (see: NBC's Heroes Reborn , Fox's The X Files and even Netflix's Fuller House ). But the bigger question is about the intentions of Sherman-Palladino, the woman without whom the show struggled for a year before coming to an unceremonious end and the woman who then brought the world of Stars Hollow back to life nine years later. When she originally thought of the final four words, there was a very slim chance of doing a revival or a sequel of any sorts, so does she want to forge ahead and explore Rory's life as a mom-to-be/new mom sometime down the road? Or is she ready to walk away from Stars Hollow now that she did what she set out to do? \nWhen asked about the possibility of producing more episodes, Sherman-Palladino said she was waiting to see just how A Year in the Life was received. \n\"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more – this has to go out into the universe now. We've got to put this to bed,\" she told THR . \"And then whatever happens, happens.\" \nA big part of the equation would be the availability of the actors and executive producers. Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Kelly Bishop have yet to sign up for their first post- Gilmore Girls revival projects, as has presumed baby daddy Matt Czuchry. Scott Patterson has several movies in pre-production for release next year in addition to his music career leading the band Smith Radio, which released its first single, \"Haha\" Wednesday. However, even Patterson sounded open to more installments of the series when asked by THR earlier this year. \n\"It's be nice to do it every year. Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.\" \nSherman-Palladino and Palladino, on the other hand, have both been hard at work on their Amazon pilot, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , about a housewife who becomes a stand-up comic. Because of Sherman-Palladino's heavy hand in all of her series, it's unclear whether she would be able or willing to split her time between two shows. However, judging by the public interest going into Friday's launch of a Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , it seems safe to assume Netflix would potentially be open to further installments. As the theme song goes, where you lead, I will follow. \nDo you think there should be more episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ?",

      "title": "Gilmore Girls: 15 Burning Questions We Have After Watching the Revival",
      "text": "After what feels like years of waiting, Netflix 's highly anticipated Gilmore Girls revival arrived on the streaming service over the weekend. After loading up on coffee and Red Vines and mac and cheese, we binged all four 90-minute episodes in one sitting. [...] with Emily's (Kelly Bishop) relocation from Hartford to the house in Nantucket, we were left wondering if she was going to be in attendance at the larger, daytime wedding the next day. Maybe he's lifting really, really heavy books in his spare time? After misplacing her unmentionables in her move (when you ship boxes to Stars Hollow, Hartford, New York and London that's bound to happen), she refused to let Jess give her money to buy new underwear (he's so thoughtful). Is Rory just one breezy day away from flashing the entire town of Stars Hollow? Look, we don't mean to be jerks, but Patterson's hair at the end of \"Fall\" looked about as real as the London backdrop for Logan's (Matt Czuchry) apartment balcony. What we do know is that his hair (and hairline) looked relatively normal when Luke was trying on his suit for the wedding and then a few scenes later, at the actual ceremony, it looked like one of Babette's favorite cats decided to take up residence on his head. If it was always the intention that Rory would follow her mother into single motherhood, then it makes sense she was involved in a relationship of sorts with Logan, who was always her version of Christopher. [...] the fact that Logan was engaged to a faceless woman, regardless of whether he loved her or if it was arranged by their families for business reasons, made the entire storyline uncomfortable to watch. Based on the way the scene was edited and the characters' stilted conversation and interactions, we have to wonder whether Bledel's and David Sutcliffe's filming schedules didn't properly align to allow for filming at the same time. Far be it from us to complain about spending so",

      "text": "brazilian production Share this article \nOn this November 25th, Netflix conquered to make Friday such an even more expected day of the week: this was the when the first Brazilian series on the streamimg website debuted, 3% . \nThe first season of the production counts with eight episodes and the scenario happens to be in a chaotic future. Brazil is a place where inequality between social classes is more than a structural issue, but a way of living. Moreover, meritocracy, the merit taken by the ones to are able to succed in some tasks, is seen as the salvation of the population. Although it does not look so different from the reality we live in, in the show only 3% of the population can acquire the right of living without any social concerns, such as hunger and lack of drinkable water. \nIn a dystopian future, Brazilians are divided between the \"Continent\" (where they live with all the devastation and lack of basic necessities) and the \"Maralto\" (where progress is, life is perfect and no one is wronged). To get out of the first and reach the second, however, it is necessary to overcome the Process, a rigorous selection, based on physical and psychological evidence, which can only be passed at the age of 20. All kids that are 20 years old need to fight to win the chance to construct a life in the \"Maralto\", a place with perfect conditions for a good life. The big question is that only 3% of these young people will succeed. \nWe listed 3 reasons why you should check it out now! 1. It all started in the YouTube! \nPedro Aguilera, creator of the story, said that the project was born in college as a web series, and was inspired by works such as Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. If you are curious, the four episodes are originally published on YouTube in 2009 . After years, with support from Netflix, the production really took shape and went beyond. 2. 100% Brazilian \nThis is the first all Brazilian production on Netflix: idea, script, direction, acting and scenery. The recordings were made in São Paulo and it took the use of computer graphics to reach the final result. 3. Team for all \nThe team of protagonists is great and has Ezequiel (João Miguel), Michele (Bianca Comparato), Rafael (Rodolfo Valente), Joana (Vaneza Oliveira), Fernando (Michel Gomes) and Aline (Viviane Porto). This production involves actors with different ethnicity and characteristics and pictures powerful women in the main roles. The main male character is a black boy in a wheelchair.

      "text": "GIF Tumblr And that's it. Fade to black, the end (unless Netflix and the Sherman-Palladinos decide to go for more, of course). Obviously, this is meant to be a full circle moment, and since Rory is 32 in A Year in the Life (the age Lorelai was at the beginning of the original series), it kind of works. But let's not forget that Amy Sherman-Palladino didn't intend for Rory for be 32 when she spoke these words; she intended for Rory to be 21 or 22 when she spoke them. This would have, obviously, drastically altered the ending of the original series. It's unlikely Rory would have been setting off to cover the Obama campaign, for example, if she had just found out she was pregnant. Obviously, it's going to take a while for Gilmore fans to process this ending and what it would have meant for the characters back in 2007, but now at least we finally know.

      "text": "Gilmore Girls Revival: The 28 Best Quotes From Netflix's A Year in the Life Dave Nemetz Pin it Share Warning: The following gallery contains dialogue from all four episodes of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Proceed at your own peril. For those of us who have plowed through the whole thing already (show of hands?), Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival gave us a bunch of unexpected cameos and four little words . But it also gave us a treasure trove of snappy dialogue that we’ll be quoting for years to come. PHOTOS Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : Michael Ausiello’s 10 Favorite Moments Ranked Witty banter, of course, is a Gilmore Girls trademark, and A Year in the Life delivered in a big way with plenty of funny one-liners from Lorelai and company, including up-to-the-minute references to Marvel movies and the Kardashians. Then of course, there was the triumphant return of Paris Geller; we could fill an entire gallery with her quotes alone. But A Year in the Life also had more than a few heartwarming moments, and those touching bits of dialogue are captured here, too. So click on the gallery to the right to check out our favorite quotes from the Gilmore Girls revival, then come back to tell us about all the great ones we missed in the comments.",

Also: Daft Punk, Touring Or Trolling Directed by longtime Weeknd collaborator, Grant Singer, t he 12-minute film doubles as an epic video music compilation (or vice versa) for the R&B crooner’s highly-anticipated album, Starboy , which was released on Black Friday. Mania features a day in the lifestyle of the notorious “Party Monster” as he sings, dances and broods his way to some of the album’s surefire hits, including collaborations with Future “All I Know”, Kendrick Lamar “Sidewalks”, and Daft Punk “I Feel It Coming” (my favorite track) for the film’s credit scene.",

      "text": "53 minutes ago indy_kid : Adolf Oliver Nipples: Riche: Netflix may have actually won here. I think it's only a matter of time until Clarkson says or tweets something colossally stupid and destroy the new series.Now that he's not being dictated to by the Beeb he's free to say anything he wants as long as it's not too incendiary for Amazon to handle. They signed him knowing this, and probably because of it.Actually, the three are prevented by UK copyright laws from using catchphrases from Top Gear; even innocent, common-place phrases.IIRC, the Grand Tour had them going thru India and they had to say they \"hated\" it because their Top Gear episode had them saying they \"loved\" it. Petty stuff like that being done by the BBC . There's not even a hint of the BBC doing that. It was Amazon's lawyers, and even that's only according to Clarkson who clearly makes up lots of stuff. For a start there is no way the BBC could claim copyright on saying a country looks nice.Things like not being able to use The Stig, that's genuine. But that's the same with any number of projects where they move channel or studio.",

      "text": "TWEET When Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits Netflix Nov. 25, fans of the series will have a serious question on their hands: How should they watch the four new 90-minute specials? Netflix has built its business model on the value of the binge-watch — so it's natural to assume many a Gilmore Girls fan who has been waiting nearly a decade for these new episodes to tear through them once they hit the streaming service. But in reviews of the series published so far, opinions seem to vary. Source: YouTube For example, Variety 's TV critic Maureen Ryan writes in her overall positive review that watching too much A Year in the Life in one sitting is unadvised: The 'Gilmore Girls' we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times — and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised — but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring. ... Here's a recipe for enjoying this new edition of 'Gilmore Girls': Get a blanket and a mug of cocoa, and watch 30 or maybe 40 minutes at a time. It'll still be there, waiting for you, next time you need a distinctive and idiosyncratic blast from the past, one that makes the transition to the present fairly seamlessly. In other words, don't binge on this comfort food. Her argument for a slow consumption, she continues, is that A Year in the Life can be a healing salve. \"In these difficult and uncertain times , why not make it last?\" she asks. But in her review for Vulture , Jen Chaney says the series is uniquely suited for bingeing: Fans of Stars Hollow, the Connecticut town where 'Gilmore Girls' is set, proved they're just as voracious as fans of 'Star Wars.' They have been counting the hours until Nov. 25, the post-Thanksgiving date that Netflix set for the 'Year in the Life' premiere, enabling viewers to settle in for a binge-watch the same way that Rory and Lorelai would: with a mountain of leftovers spread out in front of them. (Also, probably a couple of pizzas and at least one box of Chinese food.) This tracks with USA Today 's own watch guide, which assumes viewers are bingeing and instructs them on the best Gilmore -related foods and entertainments to bring along. So the answer to the question seems to come down to a difference in preference. Is the more comforting thing to immerse yourself in the world of Stars Hollow for six straight hours, or to come back to it over and over again over the course of time? Different viewers are going to answer that question in different ways, and the personal response is the key. One last thought to consider: Gilmore Girls is an immensely rewatchable series. The first watch of A Year in the Life will almost certainly not be the last; creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is an expert at layering the show's world so that repeat visits feel welcoming and warm. So a binge-watch is not the end of one's journey with A Year in the Life — in fact, it's just the beginning. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET If there's any episode of Gilmore Girls you should watch before sitting down to binge Netflix's revival on Fridayit's the appropriately-titled series finale , \"Bon Voyage.\" It's been nearly 10 years since it first aired, but soon, fans will learn what the Stars Hollow residents have been up to since we last saw them. Four 90-minute episodes will be available for streaming as part of the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life reboot. While you'll likely remember the larger plot lines, like Luke and Lorelai sharing a kiss and Rory landing a job reporting on Senator Barack Obama's campaign trail, here are 12 things you might've forgotten from the season seven finale. Because, who knows, one of these moments might just be a key plot point in the revival. 1. One of Rory's favorite journalists, Christiane Amanpour, showed up at the Dragonfly Inn Christiane Amanpour at the Dragonfly Source: Netflix Amanpour, who randomly was staying at Lorelai's inn, gives Rory journalism advice, her card and tells her to stay in touch. 2. Rory moves back home and plans a rollercoaster trip with Lorelai After Rory doesn't get the fellowship she wanted with the New York Times , she and her mom make summer plans to travel the east coast riding rollercoasters. 3. Lorelai says she's over Luke and believes they are finally done Lorelai comforts Rory about her breakup with Logan, telling her she will eventually feel better. This prompts Rory to ask her, \"do you feel better about Luke?\" \"I need someone who can show me how he feels,\" Lorelai responds. \"He can't do that ... We're better off as friends.\" 4. Rory lands a last-minute job on Senator Obama's campaign trail Rory got a job! Source: Giphy After meeting the person who runs the online magazine she had been writing pieces for, Rory tells her mom and grandparents she has to leave in three days because she was offered, and quickly accepted, a position. 5. Lorelai has to cancel Rory's graduation reenactment Many residents of Stars Hollow (think: Babette, Miss Patty, Kirk, etc.) were upset that there weren't enough tickets for them to attend Rory's graduation from Yale. To make up for it, Lorelai had planned a reenactment party that due to Rory's new job had to be cancelled. 6. Rory doesn't understand why her mom is calm about her leaving After being confused by Lorelai's seemingly relaxed attitude, Rory asks her why she is OK with her leaving. \"It's too soon,\" Lorelai responds. \"If I stop to think about you leaving now, I'm going to fall apart. We still have time left.\" 7. Luke works with Sookie to plan a surprise going away party for Rory Luke sewing a tent Source: Netflix At dark, the town sets up the square for the party before Babette tells Luke it is going to pour the next day. Instead of canceling the entire event, Luke spends the entire night sewing together tarps and table cloths to make a tent. 8. Richard tells Lorelai he is proud of her. In perhaps one of the more tearjerking moments of the finale, Richard tells Lorelai that the party isn't entirely for Rory, but a testament to her and the home she has created for Rory. \"It takes a remarkable person to inspire all of this,\" he tells her. 9. Taylor gives one hell of a speech Or a \"unique tribute\" as Rory called it: \"We are gathered here on this glorious spring day, pregnant with pride and anticipation, preparing to birth you from our collective womb, fully gestated and nourished. And so we breathe deep, and, with these last, painful contractions, we push you out into the world, spank your bottom, and wipe the amniotic fluid from your eyes as you issue your first independent breath.\" 10. Emily wants to loan Lorelai money for a spa to continue Friday night dinners Emily thinks since Rory is gone, Lorelai is going to stop coming for their weekly dinners. \"Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner,\" Lorelai responds. \"Oh, so our Friday night dinners are going to continue then?\" Emily asks. \"Well, we might as well,\" Lorelai says. \"I've kind of gotten used to it. 11. Lorelai finds out Luke was responsible for the party Lorelai and Luke kiss Source: Netflix She thanks him and he says, \"I just like to see you happy.\" And then they kiss. 12. The series ends at Luke's True Gilmore Girls fans will realize the show ended and started with the girls drinking coffee at the exact same table at Luke's Diner. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET After an unbearably long hiatus from stand-up specials and his acclaimed sketch series, Dave Chappelle is making a much-needed return to comedy. Netflix announced Monday that the comedian is going to have three stand-up specials that will air in 2017. Interestingly, the specials will be released simultaneously on the streaming service — and two are coming from his \"personal comedy vault\" — though their release date remains TBD. \"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's vice president of original documentary and comedy told the Hollywood Reporter . \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" \nNews: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxzSMt3VIAAEjjz.jpg:large Chappelle has mostly avoided the spotlight since Chappelle's Show ended in 2006, stepping out of the public eye to live quietly with his family in South Africa. However, we're seeing a bit of a resurgence of the comedian since his widely praised Saturday Night Live hosting debut following Donald Trump's election win. Chappelle's opening monologue addressed the forthcoming Trump presidency by vowing to give the real estate mogul a shot, with the very important distinction that he does the same for marginalized groups. \"In that spirit, I'm wishing Donald Trump luck, and I'm gonna give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too,\" he said. Source: Saturday Night Live/YouTube This is the type of social commentary we've come to expect from Chappelle: sometimes controversial — like when he criticized Black Lives Matter as a slogan — but consistently hilarious and topical in his subject matter. But in the early age of Trump, come 2017, we certainly welcome more of his comedic input. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers about a certain character in Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Don’t read on if you don’t want to know.\nOne of the most shocking revelations contained within Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival: Emily Gilmore actually found a maid she likes!\nRELATED Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : What Did You Think of the Final Four Words?\nOn the original series, Emily ran through maids faster than Murphy Brown ran through secretaries. But in A Year in the Life , she keeps the cheerful, ever-smiling Berta in her employ for an entire year — even bringing her along when she moved to Nantucket. (This, despite the fact that Berta doesn’t seem to speak a word of English. Or any other known language, for that matter.)\nBut did you notice who played Berta? We didn’t give it a thought on our first viewing, but sources confirm to TVLine that the role of Berta was actually played by… Rose Abdoo, who plays surly car mechanic Gypsy!\nGilmore Girls Berta Gypsy Rose Abdoo More Abdoo (also seen on Bunheads and Parenthood ) has played Gypsy since Season 2, so her double role here is a great little Easter egg for die-hard Gilmore fans. And it brings a nice sense of connection between Stars Hollow and Emily’s Hartford home. We know Emily doesn’t like setting foot in Stars Hollow… but in a strange way, Stars Hollow came to her.\nSeries star Lauren Graham has since chimed in about how Abdoo landed the part:\nRose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up! https://t.co/tnfAhHOZIp\n— Lauren Graham (@thelaurengraham) November 26, 2016\nDid you know that was Rose Abdoo underneath the Berta wig and accent? Hit the comments and tell us how surprised you were to find out.\nRelated stories\nGilmore Girls Revival: The 28 Best Quote: s From Netflix's A Year in the Life\nPerformer of the Week: Lauren Graham\nGilmore Girls Revival: The Scoop on Those 2 Top-Secret 'Fall' Cameos\nGet more from TVLine : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "title": "Netflix 4K streaming finally hits the PC, but there’s a big, annoying, Edge-shaped catch",
      "text": "By now, most of you have probably already seen the magical and jaw-dropping video quality that 4K content provides. Clearly representing the future of where TV is headed, the sad reality is that we’re still not living in a world overflowing with 4K content just yet. Still, progress is being made slowly but surely.\nDON’T MISS: Verizon has an incredible Black Friday Google Pixel deal\nWhile Netflix hasn’t issued an official comment on the matter, it appears that Netflix is at long last bringing 4K video to PC users. Of course, there is a gnarly catch you should be aware of. As it stands now, Netflix users who want to take advantage of the streaming giant’s 4K content will need to use Microsoft’s Edge browser on a Windows 10 PC.\nSounds great, right? Yes, but unfortunately there’s another catch to be aware of: 4K streaming via Netflix is only supported on Windows 10 machines running Intel’s next-gen Kaby Lake processors.\nAs Ars Technica points out, this effectively makes 4K PC streaming available only to a small subset of users:\n4K streaming only works in Microsoft Edge, because it’s the only browser that supports PlayReady DRM. Basically, streaming 4K Netflix on a PC requires a CPU that’s in barely any devices right now (desktop chips aren’t expected until sometime in 2017), the latest version of Windows 10, and using an unpopular browser, making it a largely useless feature.\nIf you’re in the market for a new Windows PC that can handle 4K streaming from Netflix, Microsoft keeps a running tally of 4K-capable devices over here. Note, though, that you’ll still need to take a look at the specs and make sure that the machine you have your eye on has a Kaby Lake processor on the inside before pulling the trigger.\nTrending right now:\nGalaxy S8 will supposedly steal another big feature from the iPhone 7 If you only buy one smart home device on Black Friday, this should be it Apple’s Black Friday sale is awful, so here are all the best iPhone deals See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Nick Yarris, 55, from Pennsylvania spent 23 years waiting for electric chair After being wrongly convicted of rape and murder he constantly appealed Until DNA evidence finally cleared him but his life will never be the same \nBy Jessica Duncan For Mailonline \nPublished: 15:58 EST, 26 November 2016 | Updated: 16:48 EST, 26 November 2016 e-mail \nView comments \nA former inmate who spent more than 20 years on death row in the US after being wrongly convicted or rape and murder has shared his incredible life story which is now being made into a Netflix drama. \nCleared Nick Yarris, 55, faced the electric chair after being framed in 1982 for the rape and murder of a woman in his native Pennsylvania. \nHe spent 8,057 days behind bars - much of it in solitary confinement - before DNA evidence finally cleared him and he was released in 2004. \nScroll down for video \nNick Yarris (pictured) faced the electric chair after being framed in 1982 for the rape and murder of a woman in his native Pennsylvania \nThe father-of-four who now lives in Yeovil, Somerset, has written a compelling book about the twenty-three years he waited to die, a harrowing experience that has shaped the rest of his life, despite now having his freedom. \n‘The Fear OF 13: Countdown to Execution: My Fight for Survival on Death Row’ is to not only be made into a movie but Netflix also has plans to make a drama based on his experiences on death row. \nDuring his time inside, Mr Yarris was sharing his space with serial killers, psychopaths and cannibals. \nNick Yarris (pictured at the time) spent 8,057 days behind bars - much of it in solitary confinement - before DNA evidence finally cleared him and he was released in 2004 \nSimilar to the plot of The Shawshank Redemption he took to studying and inspired loyalty from some his fellow inmates but was attacked by others. \nSpeaking to The Mirror he said: ‘If you torture a man as I was tortured he will learn more about love than you could ever ­imagine, and that has left me ­vulnerable.' \nIn 1981 Mr Yarris, then a 19-year-old drug addict and alcoholic, was arrested in a stolen car when he jumped a red light. \nMr Yarris, then a 19-year-old drug addict and alcoholic, was arrested in a stolen car when he jumped a red light \nIn the scuffle with police the officer's gun went off and he was charged with attempted murder. \nWhile in custody he read a newspaper report about the rape and murder of a young mum and decided to make up information about it in a bid to bargain his way out of jail. \nHe accused a man, who he believed to be dead, of beating, stabbing and raping 32-year-old Linda Craig in a churchyard on the borders of Pennsylvania. \nBut his plan backfired when he found himself accused of the crime and then tried and convicted on flimsy evidence and sentenced to death in 1982. \nMr Yarris spent the next 23 years fighting his conviction and suffered brutal beatings at the hands of cellmates. \nHe even contemplated suicide but then decided to turn his mind to education. \nHe devoured books and took distance learning courses in an attempt to 'make my mind beautiful'. \nDuring his time inside, Mr Yarris was sharing his space with serial killers, psychopaths and cannibals and did consider taking his own life \nAnd although he still suffers from physical pain Mr Yarris has said that the survivor's guilt is harder to bear. \nPreviously he said: 'For more than 20 years my identity was bonded with those people on death row, I cared about them. I believe life imprisonment is far worse than the death penalty. \n'But as long as I have love I have hope.' \nThe car he was stopped in by police: Although he still suffers from physical pain Mr Yarris has said that the survivor's guilt is harder to bear \nDespite his horrific experiences on death row, Mr Yarris told The Mirror: ‘Prison was the best thing that happened to me. I have a ­photograph of the street gang I was in when I was a teenager. There were 27 of us, 26 are dead now. \n‘Death row saved my life. \n‘It taught me everything is a luxury to be treasured.’ \nMr Yarris was given a reported $4million (£3million) for his wrongful incarceration.

      "text": "By Ned Ehrbar \n(CBS) – If you have a favorite “Gilmore Girls” character, chances are they will pop up in the series’ Netflix revival. Watch the preview above.\nAfter quite a bit of build-up, Netflix released the four-part miniseries called “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” on Friday. Mother and daughter/best friends Lorelai and Rory Gilmore (Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel) return after ending their network run on The CW in 2007.\nBut Graham and Bledel aren’t the only ones on hand. Audiences will also see series stars Kelly Bishop, Melissa McCarthy, Sean Gunn and Scott Patterson, among others. Rory’s ex-boyfriends Dean Forester, played by Jared Padalecki, Jess Mariano, played by Milo Ventimiglia and Logan Huntzberger, played by Matt Czuchry also make cameos.\nA central character of the series is obviously missing from the group. Edward Hermann who passed away in 2014, played Gilmore family patriarch, Richard Gilmore. In his honor, a massive portrait of his character became part of an episode, as a touching tribute.\nAll episodes of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” will be available to stream in Netflix starting November 25.\n \n© 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "[Warning: This story contains spoilers from all four parts of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.]\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life brought everything full circle. And no, we're not just talking about the explosive, knock-down fight between Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) on the day of Richard's funeral in \"Winter.\" The final four words, as God and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino intended them, brought the entire franchise exactly to where it began when Rory (Alexis Bledel) dropped the bombshell on her newly betrothed mother that she was, in fact, pregnant.\nOn one level, the final four words brought closure. The show's die-hard fans spent nearly a decade agonizing over how Sherman-Palladino had envisioned to wrap up the original WB series before she and husband and executive producer Dan Palladino unexpectedly left over a contract dispute at the end of season six, and the Netflix revival helped answer that question once and for all.\nOn the other hand, the circumstances surrounding Rory's surprising news seems to leave things open for yet another batch of new episodes. The father of Rory's unborn baby was unconfirmed as the final credits rolled. Even if it is Logan (Matt Czuchry), as their ongoing affair through the revival seems to suggest, his engagement to a French heiress and their complicated relationships with each other's family opens up a whole new slew of issues. Sure, Rory never seemed particularly in need of a father, as Christopher's (David Sutcliffe) brief return in the revival also seemed to imply, but the audience's investment in Rory's love life over the years (#TeamDean, #TeamJess and #TeamLogan, anyone?) makes the lack of confirmation all that more difficult to swallow.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' Creator and Stars Discuss Final Four Words: \"It Made Complete Sense\"\nThe question about the possibility of more episodes also comes in the midst of revival frenzy, brought upon at least in part by Gilmore Girls. When the show originally went off the air in 2007, such reunions and revivals were extremely few and far between. But in 2016, streamers like Netflix have given much more weight to revival hopes (see: NBC's Heroes Reborn, Fox's The X Files and even Netflix's Fuller House). But the bigger question is about the intentions of Sherman-Palladino, the woman without whom the show struggled for a year before coming to an unceremonious end and the woman who then brought the world of Stars Hollow back to life nine years later. When she originally thought of the final four words, there was a very slim chance of doing a revival or a sequel of any sorts, so does she want to forge ahead and explore Rory's life as a mom-to-be/new mom sometime down the road? Or is she ready to walk away from Stars Hollow now that she did what she set out to do?\nWhen asked about the possibility of producing more episodes, Sherman-Palladino said she was waiting to see just how A Year in the Life was received.\n\"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more - this has to go out into the universe now. We've got to put this to bed,\" she told THR. \"And then whatever happens, happens.\"\nRead more: Critic's Notebook: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Spoiler Talk — The Last 4 Words and More\nA big part of the equation would be the availability of the actors and executive producers. Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Kelly Bishop have yet to sign up for their first post-Gilmore Girls revival projects, as has presumed baby daddy Matt Czuchry. Scott Patterson has several movies in pre-production for release next year in addition to his music career leading the band Smith Radio, which released its first single, \"Haha\" Wednesday. However, even Patterson sounded open to more installments of the series when asked by THR earlier this year.\n\"It's be nice to do it every year. Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.\"\nSherman-Palladino and Palladino, on the other hand, have both been hard at work on their Amazon pilot, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, about a housewife who becomes a stand-up comic. Because of Sherman-Palladino's heavy hand in all of her series, it's unclear whether she would be able or willing to split her time between two shows. However, judging by the public interest going into Friday's launch of a Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, it seems safe to assume Netflix would potentially be open to further installments. As the theme song goes, where you lead, I will follow.\nDo you think there should be more episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life?",

      "text": "Courtesy of Vimeo\nThe very title of Netflix’s new series, “The Crown,” suggests the importance of the institution of the monarchy to the Queen as it is. Crowns are primarily interpreted as the physical object the ruler wears, although in her case not without difficulties. The first season of “The Crown” explores the private life of Queen Elizabeth II during the first few years of her reign. Created by Peter Morgan, the writer of 2006 film “The Queen” (which also focuses on the second Queen Elizabeth, albeit in the context of Princess Diana’s death), the sumptuously shot drama humanizes the monarch and paints a psychological portrait of the royal family that seems to capture its essence but is not exactly compelling.\n“The Crown” boasts, for the most part, strong performances, an important aspect of a show that focuses largely on personal relationships and beliefs among the Windsors. Claire Foy’s young Elizabeth, played with restraint but less distance than Helen Mirren in her Academy-award winning turn in the same role, is outstanding. On the other hand, John Lithgow ’67 as Winston Churchill and Alex Jennings as Edward VIII both offer performances that fall on the campy side of the spectrum. There have been many good cinematic (or televised) renderings of the former British PM; Lithgow, in comparison, initially overemphasizes the mannerisms of the flamboyant politician, perhaps the most important character on the show beside the young Queen and arguably also the most interesting one. However, the cranky cartoonishness eventually develops into a truly complex figure, to which the penultimate episode, “The Assassin,” greatly contributes. Jennings plays the abdicated King Edward with enjoyable malice. Matt Smith of Doctor Who fame also delivers a good performance as the slightly laddish Prince Philip, whose relationship with his (higher-ranking) wife becomes increasingly strained as she takes on more responsibilities in her role as Queen. The gender dynamic between Queen Elizabeth and her powerful male contemporaries is one of the recurring themes of the show, and its treatment of the issue is laudable. “The Crown” seems aware of the tension, but it remains true to the Queen’s rather stoic character by mostly avoiding that tension’s verbal expression.\nThe royal family is a potentially fascinating subject, and “The Crown” is obsessed with the machinery of the monarchy. The show pays very cinematic, almost excessive attention to social machinery at the micro-level: It abounds in shots of countless operators involved in the flow of information travelling between dignitaries or their subordinates’ behavior. Perhaps the most telling such detail takes place off-screen, when removing a bit of fluff from someone’s jacket reveals the affair Princess Margaret is having with a divorced man (scandalous!). The extremely high production value contributes to such moments, which produce the same kind of pleasure as some Wes Anderson films, rather than rendering them tiring. Given the show’s enormous $100 million budget, the show’s aesthetic expectedly looks lavish, but the hazy blue tones through which the luxurious locations are shot reinforce the cold atmosphere of the royal family’s life.\n“The Crown” also succeeds in exposing the human side of the often glamorized and still mysterious family. This grounding happens early on through shots of King George, Queen Elizabeth’s father, being operated on, in a scene reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh’s “The Knick.” The bodily aspects break up the antiseptic early atmosphere, but the show also focuses on Elizabeth’s deep dedication to tradition and her role as an impartial monarch who simply upholds the constitution under all circumstances. However, this impartiality to politics means that potentially more interesting subjects, such as issues of colonization and the Cold War, are mentioned just in passing—they were never something she actively got involved in. Although her decision not to intervene in almost any way results in less interesting television, it is historically accurate.\nUnfortunately, the show is unconvincing and at times almost ridiculous when it tries to suggest that the importance of the Queen is ever much more than symbolic. It’s probably not entirely true that Churchill only stayed in power because of her request—the dedication to tradition in his case seems like a false claim.\nOne of the show’s episodes focuses on the issue of televising Queen Elizabeth’s coronation ceremony—Prince Philip correctly assumes the general public wants to know who the family is. Several decades later, however, much of their enigma seems to be gone. “The Crown” occasionally fails to convince the audience to care about the outcomes of crises beyond the personal that the Queen faced, since her influence did not seem to extend far beyond that.",

'Parenthood' Lauren Graham stars in this NBC hit as Sarah Braverman, a single mother. Sound familiar? It may take some time getting used to seeing her with Hank (Ray Romano) instead of Luke or Christopher, but you'll surely fall in love with the Braverman family -- perhaps more so than the Gilmores.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \nBy James Gill and Tim Glanfield \nCan't work out what to watch on Netflix UK? Not sure what's new to the service or where to find the best box sets on Netflix? \nWell, hopefully this updated guide to the best TV shows available right now should be a good start. \nFrom top Netflix original series like Stranger Things and House of Cards, great British dramas like Sherlock, Doctor Who and Peaky Blinders to brilliant US and UK comedy, here are the best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now. \nAnd if you still can't work out what to watch, why not check out our guide to the Top 50 Netflix movies available now ? Stranger Things \nThere's a reason why everyone's talking about it; this brilliantly scary horror series following four normal 1980s kids and one telekinetic super-girl is packed with heart. And an inter-dimensional monster that walks through walls. Oh, and an unmissable soundtrack too. Just watch it. Peaky Blinders \nThis Cillian Murphy-starring crime epic has won acclaim all over the world, with everyone from Tom Cruise to the late David Bowie singing its praises. That's quite a broad fanbase, but the Brummie-based 1920s gang series really does have something for everyone. Sharp suits, sharper razor blades, and performances that cut through all the usual bingewatching dross.",

      "text": "“Gilmore Girls” Creator Talks More Episodes By - Sunday, November 27th 2016 3:01 am \nNetflix’s four-part “Gilmore Girls” installment has been released and is already being absorbed by fans. All too quickly, the understandable question has arisen – will there be more? \nOn the one hand, “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” effectively brings the entire series full circle and closes things off. On the other the big revelation in the final moments leaves things open for yet another batch of new episodes. \nIt all comes down to creator Amy Sherman-Palladino’s intentions, is she ready to walk away from Stars Hollow? Asked about the possibility recently by THR , she said she was waiting to see just how the Netflix specials were received: \n“We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more – this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.” \nA lot would also depend upon the availability of the actors and executive producers – Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Kelly Bishop and Matt Czuchry have yet to sign up for their first post-revival projects, while Scott Patterson indicates he’s open to more episodes of the series saying: \n“It’s be nice to do it every year. Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.” \nSherman-Palladino is currently working on the Amazon pilot “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” about a housewife who becomes a stand-up comic.

      "text": "Netflix presents Marvel's Iron Fist at New York Comic-Con 2016. (Photo : Getty Images/Craig Barritt) Advertisement \n\"Luke Cage\" proved to be a big hit alongside the other Marvel superhero shows in Netflix. Here is some of what the fans should expect when Season 2 will be released. \nBy the end of \"Luke Cage\" Season 1, Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) kisses Luke Cage (Mike Colter) before he is taken back to Seagate Prison. Claire then promises Luke that she knows a lawyer who can help him. A lot of fans have speculated that this lawyer will be Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) or Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson). \nWith that, GameNGuide said that this could mean that \"Luke Cage\" Season 2 will feature the beginning of the crossover between the other Marvel shows like \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Iron Fist.\" It was reported that this will be a new crossover series titled \"The Defenders.\" There are also reports that claim that Dawson was seen shooting for the upcoming new series. \nDawson has already appeared not only in \"Luke Cage\" but also in \"Daredevil\" and \"Jessica Jones\" in the past. With that, it can be expected that in the new series, fans will see the love triangle between Luke, Claire and Jessica (Krysten Ritter). \nAccording to Vine Report , \"Luke Cage\" Season 2 will also bring Iron Fist and Luke Cage together as they work as Heroes for Hire as revealed during the Los Angeles Comic-Con last Oct. 28. Aside from that, it was also speculated that Misty Knight (Simone Missick) will be making her return in \"Luke Cage\" Season 2. \nMisty is a detective and Luke's ex-lover. During the Season 1 finale, she was severely injured after being shot during a hostage incident. Rumors claim that Iron Man will make a bionic arm for her, however, there are still no confirmation regarding this claim. \nAs of writing, Netflix is yet to confirm the release date for \"Luke Cage\" Season 2. However, with the release of the other Marvel superheroes series, it is most likely that \"Luke Cage\" Season 2 will be released by 2018 or 2019. \n ",

      "title": "‘Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life’ Review: ‘Summer’ Time And The Livin’ Ain’t Easy",
      "text": "Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Netflix has posted all four new episodes of Gilmore Girls , collectively known as Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life . I’ve already written a spoiler-free, overall review of the quartet of Stars Hollow specials here, but now I’m writing one review per day of each individual episode. Yesterday’s review was of “ Spring .” Today is a review of the third episode, “Summer.” You are hereby and loudly warned: WALL-TO-WALL SPOILERS OF GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE follow. Grab a mug of coffee and some Hot Pockets. It is amazing how much can be packed into these 90-minute Gilmore Girls episodes, and this one features a big chunk of a new musical about the history of Stars Hollow, a new job for Rory as a newspaper editor, the return of Rory’s ex-boyfriend Jess (Milo Ventimiglia, wearing his This Is Us moustache), a break-up with Logan, the introduction of the irritating Thirtysomething Gang, the announcement of Rory’s next big career move and Lorelai’s next big life-change. Oh, and also Michel ’s big life-move. And yet it’s also perhaps the weakest of the four episodes, relying too heavily on running gags that exhaust themselves too quickly, such as the follow-through on the previous episode’s conclusion: Rory moving back to Stars Hollow. “I’m not back,” she keeps saying defensively when seemingly every person she encounters says, “Welcome back!” or “I knew she’d come back!” Christian Borle and Sutton Foster (Credit: Netflix) More Two big town events occur. One is Stars Hollow: The Musical , a co-production by Taylor and his morose collaborator, Nat Compton, starring Sutton Foster (star, I probably don’t need to tell you, of Amy Sherman-Palladino’s short-lived but well-loved Bunheads ) and Christian Borle, who some TV viewers treasure from that hate-watch-classic on NBC, Smash , which wasn’t. This episode — written and directed by Daniel Palladino — recognizes the polarizing effects of musicals on any given audience and tries to acknowledge both sides. While all around Lorelai are held rapt by the cleverly written numbers performed by Foster and Borle, Lorelai is the hold-out who thinks the whole thing is a botch and a bore. I certainly admire the pluck of F and B, but I side with Lorelai: the second time I watched “Summer” and came to the songs, I admit I scanned through most of them. There’s also a running-gag about Kinky Boots that gets old super -fast. But can I also just say that the latter-day Sally Struthers, forever bellowing hoarsely as Babette, is a national treasure? Liz Torres, Sally Struthers (Credit: Netflix) More The second biggish event is Rory taking over as editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette , which was on the verge of folding. Lots of jokes about the antiquity of print culture, Rory hangs a portrait of the late, great New York Times media columnist David Carr on the wall, and Jess returns to chat and give her the idea for… …THE BOOK. It is a project worthy of capitalization. It will be Rory’s version of her relationship with her mother. A memoir. (I know this is sacrilege, but I disagree with Lorelai’s “note”: I’ve always thought the show title should be The Gilmore Girls ; dropping the definite article implies a bunch of Gilmore females, and only Emily could possibly be added as the show was originally conceived.) At this time in Rory’s life, when the frustrated writer is at a crossroads in her career, Jess’s suggestion of a memoir is far better than any advice she received from the real/not-real Jim Nelson at GQ in the last episode. Lorelai, predictably, is not in favor of this. She withholds her permission. They quarrel; it’s a very good, heartrending quarrel. Yet why is this delightfully predictable? Because in crucial moments like this, Lorelai reveals the traits she shares with the person she wants least to resemble: her mother. Read More Speaking of Emily, she’s now sleeping until noon, is bored by her Daughters of the American Revolution meetings, and is allowing herself to be sweet-talked by Ray Wise’s not- Twin Peaks character. The episode climaxes with the revelation that, in the months that have passed since Spring and Summer, Luke has not told Lorelai about looking at franchise properties, while Lorelai has never told Luke that she’s continued to have solo therapy sessions after Emily gave up on Claudia (who turns out to be a closet theater geek). I should add that the scene here in which Luke has to simply cook burgers for one day for the guests in the mere 10 rooms of the Dragonfly Inn clearly proves he cannot possibly become a franchise owner. More seriously, this withholding-information notion drives a wedge between Lorelai and Luke, and spurs Lorelai to announce that the book she’s been reading, Cheryl Strayed’s Wild , has inspired her next adventure, which will conclude A Year In The Life . Overall, “Summer” repeats the themes of betrayal and insecurity for all three core Gilmore women while providing some warm laughs and entirely too many flat, repetitious jokes. Related: ‘Gilmore Girls’: A Journey Through Lorelai’s Love Life Extra Gilmore Gifts: Luke’s daughter April returns only to reestablish why she was a dull character: She’s so aware of her dullness, she admits she recently “bought a joke book.” No one has bought a joke book since the heyday of Joey Adams . I know, I know: that’s the joke. Still ain’t funny. Allusions, especially wide-ranging this time, are made to Game of Thrones , Noam Chomsky , Kanye West, Paul Thomas Anderson, Dave Eggers, Michael Bay, and Perry White. Michel breaks the news that he’s leaving the Dragonfly Inn to take a job at a Manhattan W Hotel. He does this over drinks with Lorelai at The Secret Bar, a running gag that gets old super- duper -fast. My wife wonders whether Jess giving Rory the idea for THE BOOK is a nod to the Anne of Green Gables books, specifically when Gilbert tells Anne she should write about what she knows best: life in Avonlea, a rural place only slightly less idyllic than Stars Hollow. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is now streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "Last Updated November 27, 2016 , 2:45 PM Photo courtesy of Netflix. Sam Phillips is the genius behind one of our favorite scores on television — and below, she talks about how that came to be. She also happens to be an incredible singer-songwriter with 15 albums under her belt, and you can buy her latest album, Push Any Button, on Amazon or iTunes . Recently someone asked me if I could perform anywhere in the world, where would it be? I said I had played on a street corner in Stars Hollow once, and that remained at the top of my list. Advertisement In 2000, I was surprised to get a phone call asking if I would be interested in doing music for a new TV show called Gilmore Girls . I had spent more than a decade writing songs, making records, and touring, but had never considered such a thing. I drove to the Warner Brothers lot to meet with the show's creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, on a hot July afternoon, not sure what to expect. I assumed TV people would be on the conservative side, unlike the denizens of the music business. But, when Amy, a former professional dancer, and former writer for the Roseanne show, walked in looking cool wearing a minidress and ankle boots — lighting up the room with her wit — I felt I had met a friend and comrade. I also figured this was not going to be a normal TV show. When I walked into Amy's office for our first day of working on music, it was like stepping out of a black-and-white (and very corporate) Kansas world into the Technicolor creative haven of Oz. All the things in the room — the walls, the phone, the lamps, the pens, the desks, and even the mannequin — were pink. I want to say there was also a giant martini glass you could sit in and a bubble machine blowing bubbles into the air, but perhaps I made that part up. Amy did not seem to mind my lack of TV scoring experience because she didn't want a typical soundtrack for Gilmore Girls . She wanted the music to be one of the characters in the story — as though it were the music inside the mother and daughter's heads. And so, I wrote and sang little melodies with \"La's\" and background vocal parts instead of lyrics, to create that sonic character without stepping on the great, rapid-fire dialogue. Photo: Courtesy of Warner Brothers. When Gilmore Girls went on the air, it was different from most other shows on TV. We were surrounded by big slick hits, mean teenage dramas, and sitcoms. But, Gilmore Girls was funny and smart and also deeply touching. And, because it wasn't typical, it took its own time to find an audience, but once people found the show, they seemed to really connect with it. I began to get e-mails and comments from viewers who called my score the \"La La's.\" A mother wrote and said though she and her daughter lived in different cities, they made a phone date to watch the show together every week. My friend's sister had just gone through a rough divorce and told him to tell me (the lowly composer) how much the show meant to her…and that she liked the \"La La's.\" I also met a single dad who watched the show with his teenage daughter. Advertisement Some of the music was done in a recording studio, but for the most part, I recorded in a home studio that my husband and I shared. One morning, I walked downstairs, still in my pajamas, and typed in the code to turn off our home security system. I was so sleepy that I typed in the wrong code — the one that said \"Help! I am being held hostage in my own home.\" A few minutes later, as I was starting to make breakfast for my little girl, two extremely handsome police officers (who looked like they were from Central Casting) were knocking at my door. After they searched my house and I explained my mistake, one of them noticed my recording equipment and asked what kind of music I made. I told him I was doing music for a new show called Gilmore Girls . I was shocked when he lit up and said \"Tuesday nights at 8 o'clock on the WB — I love that show!\" Photo: Courtesy of Warner Brothers. There were great broads (female characters, non-pejorative, to be clear) on the show — Miss Patty, Sookie, Gypsy, Lane, and Paris, as well as the three Gilmore ladies — and there were a few funny broads behind the scenes as well. Our weekly music meetings often felt like a girls' night out when Amy and our beloved producer Helen Pai were in attendance. We rivaled Rory and Lorelai with our snacks: There were breakfast burritos, cartons of Chinese food, doughnuts, cupcakes, cookies, and my favorite, the giant coffee-bot that appeared in the writers' kitchen one season. Even today, I would rather own this machine than a fancy car. With the push of a button it would grind the coffee beans, make the espresso, and foam the milk for a very tasty cappuccino or any other hot coffee drink you wanted. I called it Luke. Halfway through our seven-year run, my marriage ended and I became a single mom. I understand art imitating life, but the opposite is still a mystery to me. And, to Amy and her writers' credit, during that painful time, I felt as if they were reading my e-mails. I laughed and cried with Lorelai and the rest of the characters, feeling as though they were speaking directly to me. This is one of the many reasons why it meant so much to me to sing on that street corner in Stars Hollow. It was the last night of filming for the last episode Amy wrote and directed before leaving the show. Sonic Youth, Grant-Lee Phillips, and Sparks had already filmed their performances. Luke and Lorelai were arguing in the coffee shop, and as she walked out, brokenhearted, and passed me on the street, Amy cued me to play my song \"Taking Pictures.\" Instead of \"La La's\" I sang \"Nostalgia isn't what it used to be…\" Advertisement After we wrapped, and as the cast and crew were going home, someone, in classic Lorelai fashion, opened a bottle of liquor they had smuggled onto the set. A few of us raised our plastic cups to Amy...and to all the broads. Travel Farther Down The TV Nostalgia Road With These Goodies:",

      "text": "Netflix does a gender-flip on Lost in Space, plus Logie Awards voting opens Michael Idato 28 Nov 2016, midnight Parker Posey will play the role made famous by Jonathan Harris in the iconic 1960s sci-fi series. \nGender flip for sci-fi classic \nNetflix's reboot of Lost in Space will gender-flip the iconic character of Dr Smith, the saboteur-turned-complainer whose misbehaviour on board the Jupiter II in the show's pilot sends the ship hurtling off course. The streaming platform has confirmed actress Parker Posey will take on the role made iconic by actor Jonathan Harris in the original 1960s version of the show. The role was later played by actor Gary Oldman in the 1998 film adaptation. It isn't the first time a reboot has done a gender-flip, the most notably example being Battlestar: Galactica 's Starbuck, originally played by Dirk Benedict but recast with actress Katee Sackhoff. Netflix has already announced Toby Stephens as Professor John Robinson and Molly Parker as Dr Maureen Robinson. The reboot will air in 2018. \nLogie voting opens \nVoting for the annual TV Week Logie Awards has opened, with viewers urged to lodge their vote online before the voting window closes on Sunday, December 18. The window in which viewers can vote has been slimmed down for the upcoming awards, from roughly two months to one. A total of 27 Logie statues will be handed out on the night, including one in the reinstated category of outstanding factual or documentary program. The outstanding awards are voted by industry peers while the \"best\" (translation: popular) categories are voted by viewers by clicking onto tvweeklogieawards.com.au . The 59th annual TV Week Week Logie Awards will be held on Sunday, April 23, in Melbourne and aired on the Nine Network. \nCorden wins Grammy gig \nHaving all those music stars in the passenger seat of his car has paid off for talk show host James Corden. The 38-year-old London born comedian and actor will host the annual Grammy Awards . Corden replaces NCIS: Los Angeles actor (and hip-hop artist) LL Cool J, who has hosted the event for the past five years. Corden, whose credits include Gavin & Stacey and The History Boys , took over hosting duties on The Late Late Show in 2015. The show's Carpool Karaoke segment has notched up nearly 2 billion views on YouTube. (A television spin-off is in the works.) Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich said Corden's musical background, personal charm and comedic instincts made him an ideal host. The 59th annual Grammy Awards will be held in Los Angeles on Sunday, Feburary 12. \nMidwife still on call \nGood news for fans of Call the Midwife ; the BBC has commissioned three additional seasons of the series from the British production company Neal Street Productions. Six seasons of the show have already been produced, with the most recent about to air in Britain. The BBC's order covers eight one-hour episodes and a standalone Christmas special for each of the three seasons. Since its launch, Call the Midwife has been one of the highest rating programs in Britain, drawing about 10 million viewers an episode. Series creator Heidi Thomas confirmed the new seasons would take the series storylines into the 1960s, an era she described as \"fizzing with change and challenge\". The series airs in Australia on the ABC. ",

      "text": "Netflix Thinks “The Big Short” Is a Comedy Steve Carell and Hamish Linklater in “The Big Short” I saw “The Big Short” in movie theaters when it was first released. Like Steve Carell’s character did throughout the movie, I felt my anger, disillusionment and grief rise to almost unbearable levels by the time the final credits rolled. Just before they did, Ryan Gosling’s character summarized the impact and consequences of the big banks’ irresponsible and abusive behavior like this:\n“When the dust settled from the collapse, 5 trillion dollars in pension money, real estate value, 401k, savings, and bonds had disappeared. 8 million people lost their jobs, six million lost their homes. And that was just in the USA.” Needless to say, no one was laughing coming out of the theater. I remember very clearly telling the usher who was standing outside the door, “People are going to be angry coming out of this movie. Oh my god.”\nThe film is an inside look (and an extremely accurate one) at the bankers who discovered how the shady mortgage practices of the too-big-to-fail banks toppled the economy in 2008. Laughing yet? That was in December of 2015, just as the presidential primaries were getting ready to start. At the time I couldn’t imagine why anyone who had seen the film wouldn’t be outraged at any candidates who had close connections to Wall Street. Maybe they were, but clearly not enough: Hillary Clinton and her secret quarter-million dollar speeches to Goldman Sachs, et al, nonetheless managed to win against an opponent who seemed like he had seen “The Big Short” sixty years ago and was still pissed off about it.\nAnd shit has gone downhill from there.\nBut this isn’t about that. This is about intellectual and ethical disconnect from reality. This is about that “privilege” that Clinton’s trolls so ubiquitously accused everyone of who didn’t have “I’m with Her” tattooed on their foreheads.\nLike I said, Netflix has “The Big Short” tagged and categorized as a comedy. It is most definitely not a comedy. Are there some occasional laughs? Yeah, but they are of the gallows humor variety, not the oh my god, slap my knee, that’s hilarious variety. The film is an inside look (and an extremely accurate one) at the bankers who discovered how the shady mortgage practices of the too-big-to-fail banks toppled the economy in 2008. It’s also about how they made bets that the economy was going to fail, which makes them anti-heroes of the most amoral kind (some more than others). Laughing yet?\nThe film is remarkably well written and directed, because otherwise no one would have been able to sit through it. McKay and his co-screenwriter Charles Randolph find clever ways to explain the mind-numbing terms the bankers use for their duplicitous “products” and practices. That helps viewers understand “credit default swaps” and “collateralized debt obligations,” etc., without making them tune out. Nonetheless, no matter how clever, the explanations just make the simmering pot of fury rise to a boil as the entirety of the criminality is revealed.\nSo why the hell is Netflix tagging this as a comedy?\nI have no fucking idea. I was personally ready to punch a banker in the face as I exited the theater.\nUsing recently abused accusations of Hillary Clinton’s desperate supporters, I can offer some thoughts. Let’s start with disconnect from reality.\nOnly the financially privileged can afford to laugh uproariously at “The Big Short.” Those people are also the ones who, after this catastrophic election, will go about their lives with little change. As a Bernie Sanders supporter during the primaries, I was told endlessly that I needed to be “realistic” and “you don’t live in the real world.” Well, let me tell you, I got an extensive look at the real world in “The Big Short” and it has sparked an anger in me that is still burning hot. Pragmatism and incrementalism were the catchwords of the Hillary cronies and paid trolls. In the face of the monumental crimes against American working people that I learned about from this movie, I wanted to pragmatically break up the big banks immediately and without remorse. Honestly, if we had known exactly how the 2008 crash had happened most of us would have demanded nothing incremental; we would have demanded that these fuckers go to prison and the mortgage industry be radically overhauled.\nWhat is evident is that anyone who could overlook a candidate’s close ties with Wall Street was clearly not living “in reality.” Anyone who believes that Wall Street has the good of its customers and the American economy as its priority is living in a fantasy land. End of story.\nAnother standard attack of the Clintonites was that anyone who voted third party was exercising “white privilege,” “male privilege,” or just some general middle class “privilege.” Well, after watching “The Big Short,” I know what privilege looks like. The real privilege we should be rioting in the streets about is “financial privilege.” This movie was populated almost entirely by white male characters, sure, but the heart of the movie was about all the unseen Americans who were so brutally effected by the near-total collapse of the mortgage industry. At one point, Brad Pitt’s character chastises two hedge fund managers for celebrating that their credit default swaps are going to make them ungodly wealthy:\n“You just bet against the American economy,” he tells them. “If we’re right it means people lose homes, jobs, retirement savings, pensions. These aren’t just numbers. For everyone point unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die.” Only a shallow and short-sighted person would assume the real villain was anything but unrepentant greed and criminal misconduct by the banking industry.\nTo put it more succinctly, only the financially privileged can afford to laugh uproariously at “The Big Short.” Those people are also the ones who, after this catastrophic election, will go about their lives with little change. They stand to see their taxes cut, their insurance unaffected, their private schools unscathed, their gated communities undisturbed, their investments less regulated, and their families safely inoculated from exposure to the world of poverty, stress and injustice that surrounds them on all sides.\nThat the category managers at Netflix think this is anything to laugh at is unfathomably cold-hearted. Then again, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was a huge donor to the Clinton campaign, raising over $100,000 for her campaign ; and corporations generally reflect the values of their CEOs. “The Big Short” casts a very poor light on corporate-funded neoliberals such as Clinton, particularly now that their tepid efforts at courting working class voters ended so disastrously.\nIt’s worth noting that Netflix’s tagging system that determines categories for films and t.v. shows is done by outside contractors supervised by in-house management. It’s not a high-paying job to tag their programs. In this case, however, you have to wonder just who got the assignment for categorizing “The Big Short.” Maybe, recognizing the political influence the film would so obviously have, Mr. Hastings had his friends and neighbors do the task this time. I can’t imagine any other scenario in which anyone would find anything but occasional gallows humor in the film.\nYet, someone somewhere got a laugh.\nI can’t. I just can’t.",

      "text": "E-mail \nSome cash strapped cities in the US have begun introducing a “NetFlix” tax on online streaming services, angering many netizens who see the move by the government as a desperate cash grab. Some politicians would not disagree and categorize it exactly as that. The steady decrease of cable TV and home phone subscribers in 2016 has taken a chunk out of lost tax revenue for some cities and many see that the number of users that subscribe to these services will just continue to decrease further. \nIn 2008, the citizens voted to update an existing law to tax mobile phones like landlines but that law is now being applied by the government to video streaming devices delivering media content in to their homes. This law was first passed in Pasadena, California but is now also on the books of 40 other cities in the state of California. \nThe residents in those cities are fighting back however, voicing their anger to politicians and even threatening a lawsuit if the government decides to collect the taxes. Chicago has done a similar move in a bid to close a budget gap, spearheaded by their Mayor and City comptroller. Chicago is charging a 9% tax on video streaming is currently in the middle of such lawsuit . Opponents of the tax hike cite that taxation of such services is a violation of a federal Internet Freedom Tax which bans cities and states from imposing discriminatory internet-only taxes. \nThe result of these lawsuits will most likely define how pricing is going to be for online services in the next few years, so needless to say, both sides are fighting aggressively with the government even pushing to “clarify” existing definition in the law books to buttress their argument when it comes to taxing online streaming services.",

      "text": "(Netflix)\nAnd so, the final episode of the Gilmore Girls revival begins. Lorelai is shown in a motel room, calling up Luke, feeling all ready “nuts.” She can’t fit all her belongings that she brought into her backpack, but she makes it work. Upon leaving her motel room, she sees several others embarking on a backpacking trip as well. They all seem to have the same Wild idea as Lorelai, but, before embarking on the hike, they are told that there will be harsh weather coming in. \nMeanwhile, back in Stars Hollow, Rory heads into the Gazette office when Kirk’s pig runs by the window with a message. Jess enters the diner looking for his Uncle Luke and he finds that a bunch of people officially have the wifi password for the diner and are consumed by their computers and technology. Jess and Luke had plans to free Liz and TJ from the vegetable cult they were involved in. Fortunately, Jess lets Luke know that the cult through TJ and Liz were too weird, so they kicked THEM out. Luke then tells Jess about Lorelai’s Wild journey for self-discovery. Jess and Luke worry that Lorelai may be headed towards breaking off their relationship. On his way out, Jess unplugs the modem and all the customers leave while moaning in disapproval. \nBack in the motel at night, Lorelai is watching TV and then decides to venture outside the room, chatting with some of the other hikers about her issues. \nAt night, Rory decides to go back into the office, where she is surprised by the former Life and Death Brigade (Colin, Finn and Robert) from college. Logan and his friends show up in gorilla masks to take out Rory on the town. They end up raiding Dosey’s market, but leaving behind money, playing golf from rooftops and watching Kirk’s film. They then head to a secret Tango dance club.\n(Netflix)\nAt the club, Logan and Rory agree that they did not like how they left things with each other. Logan presents Rory with a key to his family’s house in Maine and he tells her the house is hers to use when she writes her book. Rory then asks Logan if he’s really going to marry his fiancee, to which he replies, “That’s the dynastic plan.” \nAfter the club, the group ends up at a hotel in New Hampshire that Logan rented out for them. When morning hits, Rory asks Logan about when he has to leave to go back to London. Rory returns the key to Logan, saying she knows where she is going to write and that he needs to get home. They head downstairs and Rory bids adieu to the Life & Death Brigade, saying she has to get back. They worry that Rory will never see them again and they each become upset, putting on a very theatrical farewell. It looks like Rory is leaving Colin, Finn and Robert behind.\nRory and Logan engage in one final kiss goodbye.\nLorelai again tries to go hiking, but she cannot find her permit and the park ranger says she needs to find it and try again “tomorrow.” Lorelai ends up being able to take in some amazing views anyway and she decides to call her mother, telling her a story that when she was 13 years old, on her birthday, she stole one of her mother’s precious tops from her closet. Lorelai was humiliated by her boyfriend at the time, who said she was cheap, weird and that there was a rumor she wasn’t even a Gilmore, that she was the gardeners’ daughter. She said she fled to the mall and was crying when she looked up to see her father. She said that Richard never went to the mall, but there he was. She said she waited to be punished as she cried and when she finally looked up, he had a pretzel with mustard for her. He then took her to the movies to see Grease and lied to Emily about what went on that day. They never spoke of it again and Lorelai said it was the best birthday she ever had. She tells Emily that she thought she should know. Emily thanked her emotional daughter for the story. \nSuddenly, Lorelai walks in the kitchen door of her house and Luke is surprised to see her. She tells Luke not to go near her because she smells. As Lorelai goes into a story of what she’s discovered, Luke stops her, believing she’s going to break up with him. He pleads with her to not run away from him and it’s clear that this is not what she intends. Luke insists he will never leave and he will always be there for her no matter what. \nFinally, Lorelai interrupts Luke and tells him she thinks they should get married and that she’s already booked a date that month. Luke is surprised and so happy. He then fetches the original engagement ring he had given Lorelai and slips it on her finger. \n(Netflix)\nEmily is shown hanging out with Jack and he tells her that he wishes his first three wives had been as understanding as she. Emily decides to explore Nantucket. She tells Rory that she can stay at her home while she is away in Nantucket, so that’s where Rory is able to clear her head and write. As Rory walks through the house, memories fill her head and we hear dialogue between Rory, her mother and her grandparents from the original series. Rory ends up making herself comfortable in her grandfather’s office to begin her book. \nBack at the Dragonfly Inn, Lorelai and Michel are interviewing possible candidates to take over for Michel. Both are dissatisfied with the turn out and both agree that the don’t like the idea of someone else working at the Inn. \nOn a walk, Lorelai spots a large building that was an “old folks home” that is being vacated quickly and she feels the building has a lot of potential. Several nuns will be moving out and tell her that if the price is right, they’d sell it to her, but that she needs to move quickly. \nIn the middle of the night, Lorelai wakes up to find Rory in the kitchen. They start off in silence, sitting down with coffee, ice cream, red vines pop tarts, and left-over Chinese food. Lorelai and Rory begin to discuss the wedding, which will be the opening day of the Stars Hollow Harvest Festival. Rory then presents her mother with the first three chapters of her book, “The Gilmore Girls.” Rory asks her mother to read the book and says that she promises to throw it away if Lorelai does not like it.\n(Netflix)\nEmily is sitting at a D.A.R. meeting, interviewing a possible new member. At unimpressed Emily gets up and gets a refreshment in the middle of the questioning, which doesn’t sit well with her fellow D.A.R. ladies. Emily shouts out that the interview is “bullshit” and that it was a courtesy meeting because the girl is just a trophy wife. The girl, Serena, is wife number 4 of their associate Renford and Emily tells her about how they all saw her prenup, laughing at the agreement. When Serena leaves, Emily tells the women that she is tired of it all, using the word “bullshit” over and over again. The ladies encourage Emily to rest and regroup, which is basically kicking her out of the organization. Emily leaves after she says, “this whole thing is dead to me anyway. It was dead with Richard.”\nMiss Celine returns to dress Lorelai and Luke for their wedding. Yes, Miss Celine is still around. When putting together the guest list, Luke’s side is very tiny. He then reveals that he’s an old baseball camp buddy of actor Kiefer Sutherland’s, with whom he still goes fishing. \nRory heads to her father’s office as he is working in the family business and is doing very well. His daughter Gigi is turning into a Parisian girl and he says he’s still sort of dating his girlfriend Lana. Christopher looks better than ever and Rory asks that he not show up at the wedding. He assures her that he won’t, but asks if Lorelai is registered. Rory tells her dad about the book she’s writing and her career status. She then asks her father how he felt about Lorelai raising her alone. Christopher tells her that Lorelai always did what she wanted to do and that it was in the cards for them – to be a mother-daughter duo. Rory continues to push for a solid answer, asking why he never fought to raise her, and he responds by saying he thinks it’s the way it was supposed to happen. \nAs Rory leaves awkwardly, Christopher insists that they should meet for dinner the next week. \nWhen Lorelai shows up at Emily’s house, she finds that her mother is selling her childhood home. Emily says the house isn’t home anymore and that it hasn’t been since Richard’s death. Emily says she has decided to live in Nantucket and Lorelai becomes alarmed. Emily then reveals that she bought the house she and Richard used to rent in Nantucket and that it was a thrilling purchase. \nLorelai tells Emily about the old folks home she wishes to purchase as an annex and Emily is happy to help. Emily agrees to give her the money from Luke’s franchise fund. The strings attached are that Lorelai and Luke visit Nantucket two weeks each summer and one week during Christmas time. \nRory heads into Dosey’s market on some errands for her mother when she runs into Dean. He is married to a pregnant wife named Jenny and they already have three children. As for Dean’s little sister Clara, she’s living with a bad influence of a boyfriend. Rory tells Dean that she’d like to put him in her book, saying that he was the best boyfriend in the world and that he taught her what safe feels like, saying that he made her who she is today. Rory then jokes, reaching for the corn starch, which she shoplifted by accident in the beginning of their courtship in high school. \n(Netflix)\nLorelai gets to the Inn and finds a ton of wedding cakes in the kitchen … along with beloved BFF and Dragonfly Inn chef Sookie. When Michel sees Sookie, he calls her a bitch for deserting them for two years on her upstate journey. He then complains that when she left, she took her fat-free “magic granola” with her. Sookie then says she brought a bunch of it back and Michel is instantly happy. Sookie apologizes for not being around and says she misses the Inn. After a sweet moment with her best friend Lorelai, Sookie starts to spazz out about all the cooks who have been inside her kitchen since she’s been away.\nWhile in Nantucket, Emily gets a job at a local museum as a hobby … and she’s wearing sneakers. \nWith Jess, Luke is showing him his wedding suit for approval the day before the big event. Kirk storms in, exclaiming, “Everything is under control.” He says that he’s destroyed their wedding because he went over board with the decor. Lorelai and Rory walk in and Luke shouts at them that it’s bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. \nLorelai hands Rory back her three chapters and says she’s not going to read it until it’s done. She does say that Rory should drop the “the” and just call the book “Gilmore Girls.” Excited, Rory shows Jess that she started writing the book and Luke questions Jess about it. Luke asks if Jess is “over that” and he says “long over.” But, Jess appears to still be longing for Rory when he peeks back inside to get a glimpse at Rory. \nAfter Rory and Kirk pass out in the living room, Lorelai reveals to Luke that she has organized a flash mob for the wedding. Suddenly, the two have an idea, to get married in the middle of the night in order to take the pressure off the wedding the next day. Lorelai wakes up Rory and they venture to see Reverend Skinner. They head to the town square and see that Kirk’s decorations are beyond perfect. Lane, Michel and Rory all witness the ceremony.\nMeanwhile, out in Nantucket, Emily tucks in her maid and the maid’s family after blowing a kiss to Richard’s portrait. She then drinks a glass of wine by herself.\nIn the morning, Rory and Lorelai are sitting at the gazebo in the square and Lorelai says the whole thing with Luke just “feels right.” While sitting together, Rory gets a text from her forgettable boyfriend, breaking up with her and Lorelai tells her that one day she will find love.\nThen, the last four words we have all been waiting for. Rory turns to her mother and says, “Mom, I’m pregnant.”\nSo, does this mean that Logan is the father?\nAnd that’s the end of the revival series … Can we take a vote for a Rory & Jess spin-off show?\nCheck out the other episode recaps below:\n‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix Revival: Episode 1 Recap & Spoilers – ‘Winter’ The premiere episode of \"Gilmore Girls\", the Netflix revival has premiered.

      "text": "Netflix's '3%' Turns the Google Job Interview into a Dystopian Nightmare Written by 27 November 2016 // 04:00 PM CET Copy This URL \nThe applicants have three minutes to make nine perfect cubes. There’s nine of them in the room standing around a circular table with a massive tray in the middle filled with the blocks they’ll use to complete the process. Those who finish the puzzle will move on to the next round of the interview. Those who don’t are out of the street, literally. \nThis isn’t an unorthodox job interview for a new San Francisco tech company, but a harrowing scene from Netflix’s 3% , a new Brazilian science fiction series that hits close to home. It’s a world of extreme income inequality where techno-fascists rule with an iron fist. Imagine an immortal Peter Thiel lording over the Bay Area and you’ll have some idea. \n3% has a simple but brilliant setup: In the near future the planet has gone to shit and the world is divided between the haves and have nots. About three percent of the population lives in opulent splendor on an island wonderland in the Atlantic Ocean. It’s called The Offshore. The other 97 percent live in poverty on a continent devastated by some unexplained disaster. \nEvery year, the 97 percent sends its 20-year-olds to undergo The Process, the method by which the elites replenish their numbers. The young men and women undergo psychological, emotional, and physical tests to earn a spot on The Offshore. Only three percent make it through every year and the competition is cutthroat. \nOn the surface, 3% sounds like another bad Hunger Games knockoff—a young adult dystopian story where kids learn they’re chosen and rebel against a tyrannical adult-run system of control. It’s not. 3% is a brutal commentary on the world’s rising income inequality and the lengths we’re all willing to go to to improve our lot. \nFamed Brazilian cinematographer César Charlone directed eight of the show’s episodes and his unique vision gives 3% a surreal and horrible feel not seen in lesser dystopias. This is the guy who controlled the camera for City of God and The Constant Gardner . \nIt’s also an incredibly Brazilian show, which is perfect. Brazil has some of the highest income disparity on the planet . São Paulo is a megacity where the ultra-rich travel the skies in rented helicopters and cruise the streets in bulletproof cars. It’s a city where the poor live in makeshift favelas that resemble something from William Gibson’s nightmares. It’s a city where plastic surgeons do a brisk trade in reconstructive ear surgery because kidnapping is common and the easiest way to prove you’ve got a mark is to send their ear. \nIn 3% , the Offshore has used the Process to control the population for more than 100 years and looking at modern Brazil , it’s not a huge leap. \nIt’s unclear what, exactly, The Process tests for. It begins with a job interview where three percenters grill the newcomers to an emotional breaking point to see how they’ll react. Then the kids move on to complicated cognition tests such as putting together the nine cubes. \n“You each create your own merit,” Ezequiel, the man running the process, tells the kids as they file into the dorms. “No matter what happens … you deserve this.” He’s implying that only those who deserve to move Offshore will make the cut. This is a meritocracy taken to the extreme. \nLosers who don’t make it Offshore will spend their entire lives in poverty. The stress is so high that one confident kid who doesn’t make the cut immediately commits suicide by throwing himself off a balcony in the testing center. \nIt’s not so far from our own world, where the competition to get into a good school and land a good job drives many to self harm. In the 3% , as in our own world, society looks down on those who don’t achieve and there’s a certain kind of person who believes that life’s losers earned their place at the bottom. \nIn 3% , there is—of course—a resistance against The Offshore. Ezequiel says this group operates “in the name of a false or hypocritical equality.” The divide is so baked into society that not even the have-nots question it. Everyone wants to get what they believe they deserve. \nJohn Steinbeck argued socialism would never take off in America because the poor see themselves as “ temporarily embarrassed capitalists .” 3% — like Black Mirror —hits so hard because it seems bizarre and distant, but as the show unwinds and reveals its mysteries, audiences will come to realize that we're already part of The Process.

      "title": "Fidel Castro and the Netflix kids",
      "text": "6 mins ago Fidel Castro and the Netflix kids I first came across the name Fidel Castro in January (or February, I don’t exactly remember) 2010, when I was 12 years old. It happened because I went to Kolkata International Book Fair and bought 2 books on the Cuban revolution — one of them being The Bolivian Diary by Che Guevara. Not that I understood everything I read, but whatever I comprehended was enough to picture Fidel Castro as one of the good guys fighting the bad guys. Years later, around 2014, I would move away from mainstream communism. I would no longer worship Fidel Castro as a hero, would only look at him only as one of the once-major players in the international political arena. But in the winter of 2010, that is still a future I am not aware of. I modified original art works by iabo world and Tim Hodge to create this picture. The first few months of 2010 was politically significant in the city I grew up — Kolkata. It was still the reign of the longest running elected communist government in the world — the penultimate year of what would be a 34-year rule of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led alliance in West Bengal. Growing up in a left-leaning family, I was indoctrinated to the ideology of the ‘great Fidel Castro’ in casual family dinners. But the year 2010 was also significant for a number of other reasons. I created my first Facebook account in 2010. The same year Mark Zuckerberg became Time magazine’s Person of the Year. And THAT has a lot to tell about the world that would shape up in the the next 6 years to the 26th of November 2016 when Fidel Castro would die. Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz, better known as Fidel Castro, was born in 1926 in a small Cuban village named Birán. He was born a time when the world has witnessed only one World War, India is still a British colony, and the device called television is yet to be invented. When died on 2016, his news reached most people (including me) through a new ‘thing’ called Facebook, which people access using devices called ‘computers’. ‘Hashtags’ emerged to celebrate and mourn his death. World leaders ‘tweeted’ their responses. This is a drastically different world of today, which a person living in sugarcane plantation in 1926’s Birán could not have imagined even in their wildest dreams. And yet Fidel Castro’s death became trending on Facebook with more than 1 million people talking about him. How will I remember this towering figure of world politics ? A revolutionary hero and a liberator of the oppressed, or a mass murdering tyrant and a ruthless homophobic dictator, or “I don’t care”. But as I introspect, it is more important to ask, whether I will remember him at all? ‘ I’ - the individual ‘I’, myself; and the collective ‘I’, millions of people of my generation across the globe. The answer, surprisingly or unsurprisingly, is tilted towards the negative. How did I react to Fidel Castro’s death? I wrote a couple of posts on Facebook, shared a couple of memes. Then I went back to my usual routine. But then again, THIS IS my usual routine, so I did not actually go back to anything. I remained in the loop I exist - surviving, posting on social-media, surviving again. My response to Fidel Castro’s death was not anything different than my response to David Bowie’s death, or Alan Rickman’s death or Harambe’s death. A couple of posts, a couple of memes. The loop. My loop. Our loop. Then a few hours later I went back to the Netflix TV show Black Mirror. “Oh man, the last episode was fucking awesome.” I mean, Fidel Castro is cool, but I am not going to sacrifice the safe nest I have in the middle of this nice little consumer-culture world. US imperialism? Common man, nobody talks about that kind of stuff anymore except Sassy Socialist Memes and articles on The Economist whose headlines are the only part I read when they appear on my newsfeed. But you should totally listen to this awesome meme I came across about Fidel Castro: After 638 assassination attempts, CIA finally finds a weapon that killed Castro —OLD AGE . From tomorrow, Fidel Castro will move down the trending chart. On Facebook, on Twitter. By the end of this week, he will disappear. The internet will move on to other things. In other words, the internet will continue to become the internet. Kim Kardashian’s boob size. Taylor Swift’s breakup. Donald’s Trump’s new rant. New robot that can behave like humans. New hashtag challenge. Fidel Castro will continue to live in mentions in the comments section wars. The ‘Fidel Castro regime’ will be talked about in op-eds and political analysis articles. College activists and campus hipsters will continue mentioning him sometimes. Not much beyond that. But the Fidel Castro-esque idea of revolution will fade away into a different notion of revolution. I will not stream a new TV show. My revolution would be to illegally download it from a torrent sharing site. I will not seek to radically destroy the world order. My revolution would be to create a new successful startup and proclaim a great résumé is not necessary the change the world. I will not stop participating in a conference sponsored by a company that fuels the war in Middle East. My revolution would be to share posts of empathy for Syrian refugees and “ISIS have lost, humanity have won”. Every once in a while I will break free from this loop to write article like this. Maybe more than just once in a while. But that is a part of a greater loop. I will not become a part of Fidel’s plan for liberating the globe. I will not pose any significant threat to the authority. I will only pose a minor threat. Not even a threat. Common man, I too love Netflix and chill. I will watch Netflix. I will watch Christopher Nolan. I will watch a porn every two days maybe. I will Sometimes argue with friends and parents on the need for greater individual liberty. By that I actually mean how to get laid in an easier way. I will need to check my notifications everyday, because I sometimes preach nihilism but goddammit I gotta check my notifications. AND the memes. That is life. Don’t try to destroy that sense of well being by texting me Game of Thrones spoilers.",

      "text": "TV\nBIG EVENTS: Incorporated (Wednesday, 9 p.m., Showcase), Pacific Heat (Netflix, Friday, 2:01 a.m.)\nEVAN AGOSTINI / INVISION FILES\nThe Rolling Stones — Ronnie Wood (from left), Keith Richards, Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts — in New York earlier this month.\nBEN MARK HOLZBERG / SYFY\nSean Teale stars in Incorporated, which debuts Wednesday on Showcase.\nBIG PICTURE: Incorporated is yet another dystopian drama. It’s Mr. Robot meets George Orwell’s Big Brother plus The Firm. Essentially, corporations own the future. They control the world, make their own laws and torture and kill with impunity — even their own employees. Case in point, the protagonist’s employer: \"Spiga Biotech is a generous mother. It will feed you. Dress you. Protect you.\" It’s as if Monsanto, Nike and Halliburton all merged with Luthor Corp. Ben Larson (Sean Teale) goes undercover to bring the company down from the inside and save the woman he loves — a goal within his reach after being promoted to the mysterious \"executive floor.\" Dennis Haysbert plays the intimidating head of security (he’s like Darth Vader in a suit and tie) in a world where one per cent of the population lives in an extravagant Green Zone and the impoverished masses lives in a Red Zone. Meanwhile, the CSI and Criminal Minds of the TV world get the satire treatment Down Under. Pacific Heat is an adult cartoon about an \"elite\" team of Aussie cops who are short on intelligence and ethics but long on bravado. Somebody needs to make a Mountie version.\nFORECAST: Incorporated will give Canada’s Naomi Klein nightmares. No Logo? How about Everything and Everyone Logo. It’s also a safe bet Hollywood screenwriters are already quietly changing gear and penning utopian dramas. Post-Trumpocalypse, once we’re all living in an actual dystopian world, people are going to want to be entertained by future visions of paradise, not societal collapse ruin. Maybe a drama about a unicorn being elected U.S. president, or global warming causing storm clouds that rain candy and puppies on parachutes?\nMusic\nBIG RELEASES FRIDAY: The Rolling Stones (Blue & Lonesome), Pete Doherty (Hamburg Demonstrations)\nBIG PICTURE: The Stones get back to what they do best: feeling the blues. The venerable rockers are releasing their first studio album in more than a decade (too much time spent writing competing biographies, playing bingo and binging on Viagra?), a blues cover album featuring classics such as Just Your Fool, Blue and Lonesome and Hoo Doo Blues. The band is at its best when embracing its blues influences (for example, Exile on Main Street). Eric Clapton joins them in studio for covers of Everybody Knows About My Good Thing and I Can’t Quit You Baby. Meanwhile, Libertines frontman Pete Doherty returns with another solo effort, including a track written after the Paris terror attacks called Hell to Pay at the Gates of Heaven, and a tribute to ex-girlfriend Amy Winehouse called Flags of the Old Regime. If Winehouse was still with us, I would have loved to see her and the Stones join forces for an album. Back to Blues could have been legendary.\nFORECAST: I see a red door, and I want to paint it blue. Who says you can’t always get what you want? Blue & Lonesome is what every Stones fan needs.\nHONOURABLE MENTION: John Legend (Darkness and Light). The R&B legend’s fifth album focuses on social issues and progressive politics — not surprising given his well-documented support of Hillary Clinton’s U.S. presidential run. (At this point, he might just want to go ahead and rename the album Darkness.)\nMovies\nBIG RELEASES THIS WEEK: Zero. Zip. There are no major releases this week.\nTwitter: @chrislackner79\n‘You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,’ but these days, a guide through the seemingly endless flurry of pop culture offerings is just what we need. With that in mind, here is what’s on the radar in TV, music and film this week.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund",

      "text": "Netflix's '3%' Turns the Google Job Interview into a Dystopian Nightmare Written by November 27, 2016 // 04:00 PM EST Copy This URL \nThe applicants have three minutes to make nine perfect cubes. There’s nine of them in the room standing around a circular table with a massive tray in the middle filled with the blocks they’ll use to complete the process. Those who finish the puzzle will move on to the next round of the interview. Those who don’t are out of the street, literally. \nThis isn’t an unorthodox job interview for a new San Francisco tech company, but a harrowing scene from Netflix’s 3% , a new Brazilian science fiction series that hits close to home. It’s a world of extreme income inequality where techno-fascists rule with an iron fist. Imagine an immortal Peter Thiel lording over the Bay Area and you’ll have some idea. \n3% has a simple but brilliant setup: In the near future the planet has gone to shit and the world is divided between the haves and have nots. About three percent of the population lives in opulent splendor on an island wonderland in the Atlantic Ocean. It’s called The Offshore. The other 97 percent live in poverty on a continent devastated by some unexplained disaster. \nEvery year, the 97 percent sends its 20-year-olds to undergo The Process, the method by which the elites replenish their numbers. The young men and women undergo psychological, emotional, and physical tests to earn a spot on The Offshore. Only three percent make it through every year and the competition is cutthroat. \nOn the surface, 3% sounds like another bad Hunger Games knockoff—a young adult dystopian story where kids learn they’re chosen and rebel against a tyrannical adult-run system of control. It’s not. 3% is a brutal commentary on the world’s rising income inequality and the lengths we’re all willing to go to to improve our lot. \nFamed Brazilian cinematographer César Charlone directed eight of the show’s episodes and his unique vision gives 3% a surreal and horrible feel not seen in lesser dystopias. This is the guy who controlled the camera for City of God and The Constant Gardner . \nIt’s also an incredibly Brazilian show, which is perfect. Brazil has some of the highest income disparity on the planet . São Paulo is a megacity where the ultra-rich travel the skies in rented helicopters and cruise the streets in bulletproof cars. It’s a city where the poor live in makeshift favelas that resemble something from William Gibson’s nightmares. It’s a city where plastic surgeons do a brisk trade in reconstructive ear surgery because kidnapping is common and the easiest way to prove you’ve got a mark is to send their ear. \nIn 3% , the Offshore has used the Process to control the population for more than 100 years and looking at modern Brazil , it’s not a huge leap. \nIt’s unclear what, exactly, The Process tests for. It begins with a job interview where three percenters grill the newcomers to an emotional breaking point to see how they’ll react. Then the kids move on to complicated cognition tests such as putting together the nine cubes. \n“You each create your own merit,” Ezequiel, the man running the process, tells the kids as they file into the dorms. “No matter what happens … you deserve this.” He’s implying that only those who deserve to move Offshore will make the cut. This is a meritocracy taken to the extreme. \nLosers who don’t make it Offshore will spend their entire lives in poverty. The stress is so high that one confident kid who doesn’t make the cut immediately commits suicide by throwing himself off a balcony in the testing center. \nIt’s not so far from our own world, where the competition to get into a good school and land a good job drives many to self harm. In the 3% , as in our own world, society looks down on those who don’t achieve and there’s a certain kind of person who believes that life’s losers earned their place at the bottom. \nIn 3% , there is—of course—a resistance against The Offshore. Ezequiel says this group operates “in the name of a false or hypocritical equality.” The divide is so baked into society that not even the have-nots question it. Everyone wants to get what they believe they deserve. \nJohn Steinbeck argued socialism would never take off in America because the poor see themselves as “ temporarily embarrassed capitalists .” 3% — like Black Mirror —hits so hard because it seems bizarre and distant, but as the show unwinds and reveals its mysteries, audiences will come to realize that we're already part of The Process.

      "text": "WATCH 'Gilmore Girls' Mini-Series Lands on Netflix to Excitement of Show's Fans 0 Shares Email In \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" viewers got the ending they should have received in 2007. Show creator Amy Sherman-Palladino left before the final season, and the return was her chance to see her vision for this story through. She, along with her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino, cleaned up the unsatisfied mess season 7 left with many fans. The show incorporated every bit of Stars Hollow nostalgia a \"Gilmore\" fan could want, while still moving the narrative forward. Every nod to the past seven seasons fits seamlessly in the now-present lives of these characters and fictional town. Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP (L-R) Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel appear in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \"Gilmore Girls\" fans have quoted, \"Oy, with the poodles\" for years, while women successfully pitched the series to their boyfriends as a clever, pop-culture referencing comedy. But watching the four-episode revival, which premiered on Netflix Friday, knowing now how the story was always meant to be told, it arguably all comes together as a beautifully clever tragedy. Don’t get me wrong, it is funny. If you have any sense of humor or care for these characters at all, you will laugh. But hidden beneath the fast gabs of comedy is honesty as they navigate some of their toughest moments. The bits of comedy exist as relief -- consistent, well-written relief -- as life continues to happen to the Gilmores. The Death of Richard Gilmore IMDb/Warner Bros. Television Edward Herrmann is seen in a still from television series \"Gilmore Girls.\" Stakes are raised often on television by killing off of a beloved main character, but for this show the death of Richard Gilmore was very real as actor Edward Herman, who portrayed him onscreen, died in 2014. Unlike many shows today, we weren't tortured with heartbreak. There was no long funeral service of anguish; no one fell into deep depression or spent long amounts of time in mourning. Instead, grief came in and out throughout the entire year. We first see pain in his late onscreen wife Emily's struggle with being a widow. She began trying to figure out her purpose in life after years of being a dedicated wife, by going through all of her things and throwing out what doesn't \"bring her joy.\" Her daughter Lorelei entered the home, seeing an anxious Emily in jeans. Yes, jeans -- a departure from the glamorous matriarch's normal attire. As Lorelai gave her the usual hard-time, Emily said, \"I don't know what to do or where to go. I forgot which side of the bed to sleep on. I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.” And just like that, \"Gilmore\" girls everywhere teared up. Richard Gilmore is actually the greatest character on #GilmoreGirls and we’ll forever love him https://t.co/WMtIVMQfBC pic.twitter.com/rfD9wBbq6i — HelloGiggles.com (@hellogiggles) November 26, 2016 The women mourned Richard's death in the moments that matter. Subtlety throughout the show, we saw them tap the \"it's the whole wall\" portrait of him with a kiss. The grief built over time, as real grief does. When Lorelei found herself uncertain of her decisions, past and future, that's when the punch really came and kept coming. After her search for coffee ended on the top of a mountain, she picked up her cell phone, called her mother to tell her the story of her favorite birthday. \"He asked, 'Tell me right now, Lorelai, why aren't you in school?' and I tried to think of something. Some lie that would make sense, but I couldn't. All I could think was that yesterday I had a boyfriend who loved me and today I didn't, and I started to cry,\" she said. \"I waited for him to yell at me, to punish me, to ground me forever. To tell me how disappointed he was in me, and nothing came. And finally I got up enough courage to look up at him,\" Lorelai told Emily with tears streaming down her face. “And he was standing there with a pretzel. A giant pretzel, covered with mustard. And he handed it to me and he said, ‘Let’s go.’ And he took me to the movies.\" It's at this moment that viewers realize Richard Gilmore isn't dead. His legacy of kindness, stubbornness and caring is very much apart of Lorelai, Rory and Emily -- and it lives on in them. Luke and Lorelai Lorelai's habit of relationship sabotage finally came to an end. From the first moment Lorelai and Luke were onscreen together, viewers knew they belonged. The ultimate \"will they, won’t they\" couple finally tied the knot. The show picked up with the two living together, revealing they have been partners ever since the series ended, but still not married. While there are many contributors to the decision to get married, it may have been the death of Richard, her father, that gave it the biggest push. The state of their relationship became a big frustration for her mother, Emily. With the passing of her father, Lorelai was able to get the clearest picture of her parents' partnership. Seeing how her much of a team her parents were, Lorelai began to long for something similar in Luke as she started to feel her mortality. 17 YEARS LATER AND LUKE STILL WEARS THE BLUE HAT LORELAI GAVE HIM #gilmoregirls pic.twitter.com/caLslnYsNi — taylor (@sawyerxcomet) November 26, 2016 While Luke believed her internal questioning was leading Lorelai to break up with him, he gave a speech her father would be proud of. \"This, right here, is all I will ever need,\" he began. \"I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would happen. That you and me, that we would happen. But we did.\" Lorelai responded by telling Luke they should get married. He had the ring ready. As the stress of the wedding got their feelings out of whack, the two decided to marry the night before and party with the town the next day in the town square decorated to perfection by Kirk. Yes, Kirk the irrational, uncontrolled townie known for badly performing at a string of random jobs. The Circle of Life Rory is having a baby. I hope that was as weird to read as it was for me to write. When I first heard, the campaign from Lauren Graham (Lorelai) and Alexis Bledel (Rory) to all the binge watchers not to ruin the last four words, I admit I was confused. \"Gilmore Girls\" has never been a show fueled by cliff hangers. Our Gilmore girls have a very very imporant message for you. (Hint: It's about the last four words.) https://t.co/ZBgcW7Xf9U pic.twitter.com/F0734nDTDf — Gilmore Girls (@GilmoreGirls) November 18, 2016 The season ended somewhat where it began with Lorelai borrowing money from Emily to continue her life dreams and making a commitment to Friday night dinners. In the final act, we see the Rory and Lorelai sitting together after the secret wedding. Then, we hear this: Rory : Mom Lorelai : Yeah? Rory : I'm pregnant. Saeed Adyani/Netflix Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham star in Netflix's Gilmore Girl's: A Year in the Life. While each woman -- Rory, Lorelai and Emily -- is in a new stage life, this is the point where we see so clearly that they have become one another. We saw early signs of it as Rory and Lorelai fought over Rory’s upcoming project, writing a book about their life story. Defending herself, Lorelai used an Emily tactic against Rory. Rory told her mother in response, \"No, that's not how you and I work. We don't do the passive aggressive thing, that's how you and your mother work. You're supposed to to be on my side.\" Lorelai replied, \"It's my life, Rory. I went through all this effort for many, many years making sure people only knew what I wanted them to know, and now you're going to lay it all out in a book?\" The season's ending is what solidifies the circle of life, as it's not clear who the father is. but it's more than likely Rory's ex-boyfrind Logan, based off previous episodes. Amy Sherman-Palladino has said Rory’s relationship with Logan is symbolic of Lorelai's relationship with Christopher, Rory's father. By that comparison, Rory's other ex, Jess, fills in the role of Luke as he is last seen staring at her through a window. May you all find someone who looks at you the same way Jess creepily looks at Rory through the porch window #GilmoreGirls pic.twitter.com/ZjuVNCFtWo — Rachel Paige (@rachmeetsworld) November 27, 2016 Many think this ending means there are more seasons in store for this revival. But if this ending has taught viewers anything it's to never think you know Sherman-Palladino’s next move. 0 Shares",

      "text": "Spoiler alert: Do not read if you haven’t watched “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” on Netflix. \n \nDear Rory,\nWhat happened? You were going to be the next Christiane Amanpour and spar with Norman Mailer and have Madeleine Albright as your mentor. Hopes were high for you, Rory, especially after you graduated from Yale and set off on the Obama campaign trail to be a political reporter.\nNine years later, we find you couch-surfing and freelancing, and girl, there’s no shame in that. (Well, at 32 years old, maybe there’s a little shame. But you’re trying at least!)\nYour relationships with Paul and Logan, though? Unforgiveable! Didn’t you learn anything from breaking up Dean and Lindsay’s marriage? Such as: Don’t keep sleeping with someone you know you can’t have. You deserve better than a rich, two-timing daddy’s boy who lives on the other side of the ocean and will never put a ring on it — not on your finger, anyway. Not to mention those Life-and-Death-Brigade bros of Logan’s, the one-percenters who think nothing of drunk-buying a nightclub or a bed and breakfast. While they are obnoxious over-30 Lost Boys, you are not Wendy.\nAnd Paul, as utterly forgettable as he is, never merited being strung along by you for two-plus years. Lorelai raised you better than this! You never treated anyone this carelessly. Emily, yes, but not you.\nSpeaking of your grandmother, the politically incorrect treatment of her staff isn’t funny. Such behavior may have been more easily dismissed a decade ago, but not any more. She seems to genuinely care for Berta and her extended family; why wouldn’t she do them the simple courtesy of finding out what language they speak, let alone learning a few words?\nEmily’s astounding insensitivity is one of the reasons Lorelai left your grandparents’ home at 16 when she was pregnant with you. She raised you by herself while she worked full-time, went to college part-time and, with her best friend, eventually opened her own successful inn. Your mom was the model of independence and female empowerment. Except for that time when she asked your grandparents to help pay for your education. Even then, she did it on her own terms. Oh, and that time she married your father. (We can write that one off, though, to the subpar Season 7, when your creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, was no longer with the show.) The point is, she forged her own path and didn’t take any guff. So what happened to you, Rory?\nListen, kid, not everybody can write for The New York Times or Vanity Fair. That doesn’t mean you give up your dream. Newspaper and magazine staffs are shrinking, and college grads and journalism veterans are competing for fewer and fewer jobs. Finish that piece for Jim at Conde Nast, and stick with The Stars Hollow Gazette while writing your book. Launch an online edition with your trust fund and build a local empire that can crush that ol’ media mogul Mitchum Huntzberger. You cannot let him win, Rory! Christ, you went to Yale . Are you seriously telling me that none of your college contacts could help you out, i.e., Dr. Paris Geller, M.D., J.D.? Surely someone other than Mitchum can put in a good word for you! Maybe Jess needs an editor at Truncheon Books, or Taylor would pay you to write a book about the screwed-up history of Stars Hollow. At the very least, Doyle might be able to get you a writing gig in Hollywood.\nDon’t just have Logan’s love child, raise the baby by yourself and live off your trust fund. We’ve already seen that series. We loved it and we’re ready to move on. Aren’t you?\n  Madeleine Albright",

      "text": "Gilmore Girls fans have been obsessing over the show's Netflix revival since the moment it was announced, looking for closure about things like who Rory ended up with and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's infamously mysterious Final Four Words .\nYou might thinks fans would be satisfied now, but since A Year in the Life raised as many questions as it answered , the internet is already calling for more. Is that in the cards though? Sherman-Palladino says yeah, it's possible...maybe...IDK...¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n \"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility. \"So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more — this has to go out into the universe now. We've got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.\"\nSo, Sherman-Palladino is remaining deliberately vague about Gilmore Girls future, but at least one cast member hasn't been afraid to publicly support the idea of bringing the Stars Hollow band back together (yet) again.\n\"It's been nice to do it every year,\" Scott Patterson (aka Luke Danes) told The Hollywood Reporter . \"Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.\"\nSo if Netflix says no to more Gilmore Girls , maybe fans can switch gears and petition for a Luke Danes spin-off (but only if Kiefer Sutherland will agree to guest star, of course).\nFrom: ELLE\n Share Tweet Email",

The beloved BBC hit The Great British Bake Off. \nNext season, the television series is transitioning from the BBC to Channel 4. Netflix already has two popular British offerings: Charlie Brooker's dystopian anthology Black Mirror and Peter Morgan's The Crown. \n\"I wish we’d had a shot at Bake Off,\" Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said in an interview with The Telegraph last week . \"It moved very quickly, and we didn’t. The show’s very, very popular on Netflix, all over the place, so we would’ve definitely been interested.”\n\"I wish we’d had a shot at Bake Off\" \nBake Off is moving because its production company (Love Productions) was unable to reach an agreement with the BBC on money. Channel 4 reportedly paid around $31.2 million per year for the series.\nSEE ALSO: How accurate is Netflix's 'The Crown'? \nIn addition to leaving its original broadcasting home, the cooking show will also lose judge Mary Berry and TV presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. The only star remaining on the show is judge Paul Hollywood.\n\nWith 15.9 million viewers, the show's seventh season finale — its last episode on BBC — was the most watched TV program in the UK since 2012.\nBONUS: This is what happens when you binge-watch Black Mirror",

      "text": "Ted Sarandos: ‘Netflix is the Home of Kickass Women’ By - Nov 27, 2016 \nLast week, Ted Sarandos gave a speech at a panel discussion hosted by Visionary Women at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, stating that he believes Hollywood is moving towards greater diversity and Netflix is one of the companies at the helm of that change. \nAs Sarandos said more succinctly, “Netflix is the home of kickass women”. \nThe Netflix CEO went on to say that the streaming service has “filled [its] executive suites with women. It starts with female executives, who hire female story-tellers, who hire female directors.” \nPopular Netflix shows like Jessica Jones have signed on all-female directors for the second season. \n“We are working as hard as we can to make sure that television is diverse in front of and behind the camera,” said Sarandos. \nOscar-winning producer Brian Grazer was also on hand to commend the rise of women in Hollywood, though both Sarandos and Grazer pointed out that a lot of progress still needed to be made towards true equality and diversity in the industry. \n\n\nThe lack of women behind the scenes of Hollywood productions, as well as the relatively limited number of complex characters and leading roles for women as compared to men has been a problem in Hollywood for decades. Forward-thinking companies like Netflix are making great moves to include more women behind the scenes and in shows, thus harnessing the true talent and potential of females all across Hollywood.

Who knew? Check out the video of Millie belting out her coffee order set to Adele’s ‘Hello’ right here. \nStranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown said “Hi” from the Upside Down on a trip through a Starbucks drive-thru with her dad when she sang out her order in a parody of of Adele ’s “Hello.” In the clip she posted to Twitter on Nov. 25, Millie is seen leaning over from the passenger seat to serenade the drive-thru attendant with her order, “Can I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh please!” OMG Millie, how we love you. \nThe 12-year-old actress is best known for playing Eleven, a psychokinetic preteen on the hit Netflix series . But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t take every opportunity she gets to prove she’s got some musical chops too! In fact she’s posted several videos of herself performing hits by Adele and Beyoncé . She even epically rapped Nicki Minaj ‘s “Monster” verse on The Tonight Show. ‘Stranger Things’ Season 1 Pics \nAnd Millie isn’t the only Stranger Things kid who knows how to rock a rhyme. Gatten Matarazzo , 14, starred in a recent Old Navy video that was a parody of a Technotronic’s 1989 music video for “Pump Up The Jam.” In the retro-style video, Gaten was seen getting down to the song and rapping in front of an animated backdrop. It was seriously hilarious and we absolutely love that all of these kids know how to have fun and get down to the beat. Though, with the seriousness of the show, we doubt we’re gonna see them singing in the series any time soon. But you never know! \nHollywoodLifers , did you love Millie’s rendition of “Hello”? Are you a huge Millie fan? Let us know below! More 'Stranger Things' News:",

      "text": "Comments The 12-year-old actress, who plays Eleven on the hit Netflix series, also had fun impersonating Negan of 'The Walking Dead' in some other videos she posted over the weekend. \nHere's another reason to adore Millie Bobby Brown . The 12-year-old actress, who rose to fame for starring as Eleven on Netflix's \" Stranger Things \", recently posted on her Twitter page a video of her goofing around and showing off her vocal chops as she said \"Hello from the Upside Down\" to a Starbucks worker. In the clip, Millie was seen leaning over from the passenger seat of her car while pranking a Starbucks drive-thru attendant with her parody of Adele 's smash hit \"Hello\". \"Can I have a venti latte/ And a caramel frappuccino?/ Oh, please!\" she sang before her dad stopped her. Millie then covered her mouth with her hands in front of the camera before she continued singing from the backseat, \"Hello from the Upside Down,\" in reference to her hit Netflix series. — Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) November 26, 2016 This is hardly Millie's first time to parody other artists. After posting her own version of \"Hello\", she shared on Twitter a couple of clips of her impersonating Negan, the villainous character Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays on \" The Walking Dead \". \"Little pig, little pig. Let me in!\" she was seen yelling in the first video taken in an open field.

      "text": "Spoiler alert: Do not read if you haven’t watched “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” on Netflix.\nDear Rory,\nWhat happened? You were going to be the next Christiane Amanpour and spar with Norman Mailer and have Madeleine Albright as your mentor. Hopes were high for you, Rory, especially after you graduated from Yale and set off on the Obama campaign trail to be a political reporter.\nNine years later, we find you couch-surfing and freelancing, and girl, there’s no shame in that. (Well, at 32 years old, maybe there’s a little shame. But you’re trying at least!)\nYour relationships with Paul and Logan, though? Unforgiveable! Didn’t you learn anything from breaking up Dean and Lindsay’s marriage? Such as: Don’t keep sleeping with someone you know you can’t have. You deserve better than a rich, two-timing daddy’s boy who lives on the other side of the ocean and will never put a ring on it — not on your finger, anyway. Not to mention those Life-and-Death-Brigade bros of Logan’s, the one-percenters who think nothing of drunk-buying a nightclub or a bed and breakfast. While they are obnoxious over-30 Lost Boys, you are not Wendy.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nAnd Paul, as utterly forgettable as he is, never merited being strung along by you for two-plus years. Lorelai raised you better than this! You never treated anyone this carelessly. Emily, yes, but not you.\nSpeaking of your grandmother, the politically incorrect treatment of her staff isn’t funny. Such behavior may have been more easily dismissed a decade ago, but not any more. She seems to genuinely care for Berta and her extended family; why wouldn’t she do them the simple courtesy of finding out what language they speak, let alone learning a few words?\nEmily’s astounding insensitivity is one of the reasons Lorelai left your grandparents’ home at 16 when she was pregnant with you. She raised you by herself while she worked full-time, went to college part-time and, with her best friend, eventually opened her own successful inn. Your mom was the model of independence and female empowerment. Except for that time when she asked your grandparents to help pay for your education. Even then, she did it on her own terms. Oh, and that time she married your father. (We can write that one off, though, to the subpar Season 7, when your creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, was no longer with the show.) The point is, she forged her own path and didn’t take any guff. So what happened to you, Rory?\nListen, kid, not everybody can write for The New York Times or Vanity Fair. That doesn’t mean you give up your dream. Newspaper and magazine staffs are shrinking, and college grads and journalism veterans are competing for fewer and fewer jobs. Finish that piece for Jim at Conde Nast, and stick with The Stars Hollow Gazette while writing your book. Launch an online edition with your trust fund and build a local empire that can crush that ol’ media mogul Mitchum Huntzberger. You cannot let him win, Rory! Christ, you went to Yale . Are you seriously telling me that none of your college contacts could help you out, i.e., Dr. Paris Geller, M.D., J.D.? Surely someone other than Mitchum can put in a good word for you! Maybe Jess needs an editor at Truncheon Books, or Taylor would pay you to write a book about the screwed-up history of Stars Hollow. At the very least, Doyle might be able to get you a writing gig in Hollywood.\nDon’t just have Logan’s love child, raise the baby by yourself and live off your trust fund. We’ve already seen that series. We loved it and we’re ready to move on. Aren’t you?\nRELATED STORIES:\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy\n'Gilmore Girls': 7 must-watch episodes of the original series\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Madeleine Albright",

      "text": "Lauren Graham, Kelly Bishop (Credit: Netflix) More Warning: This recap for the “Spring” episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life contains spoilers.\nIn which the eldest Gilmore girls begin joint therapy, but it’s the youngest one who’s most in need of some serious time on a life coach couch.\nLorelai\nLorelai and Emily meet up at new therapist Claudia’s office, and things get off to a rocky start when Lorelai issues a blanket apology. Emily’s offended, and when Lorelai apologizes for the blanket apology, and then apologizes for apologizing for the blanket apology, she quickly spirals downward into a vicious circle of sorrys. Mother and daughter both want to know what notes Claudia is jotting into her book, but that’s all they agree on, except that they’ll return again next week at the same time for round two. In their second session, they share a mutual laugh about the voice of someone nicknamed “Trombone Sam,” but then the session devolves again into Emily bringing up old hurts about 16-year-old Lorelai running off with Rory, keeping her parents out of her life until she wanted to borrow money, etc. etc. Emily also accuses Lorelai of writing her a nasty letter years ago on her birthday, though Lorelai insists she never wrote such a letter. In what turns out to be their final session together, Emily goes off on Lorelai’s relationship with Luke, insisting that they’re just roommates who are unwilling to make the permanent commitment of marriage. It’s become clear that the joint therapy that began as a way to help Emily deal with her grief has become more about Lorelai’s life, and Emily seals that when she quits the joint sessions. She neglects to tell Lorelai or Claudia that, though, until Lorelai arrives for the next appointment. Since she’s there, she chats with Claudia herself, revealing more about how Richard died — it was quick, after a trip to the ICU, from which he never left. She also reveals the reason she and Luke have never married: she doesn’t do things the way her mother does.\nLorelai’s other big angst inducer: she’s worried Michel has become so frustrated with the lack of growth at the Dragonfly Inn that he’s going to leave soon.\nRelated: Ken Tucker Reviews “Spring”\nRory\nRory is back in London, where her book subject, Naomi Shropshire, is getting more difficult. Fretting over the need to tell “truth” in a biography, Naomi suggest she and Rory write her story as a children’s book instead. After a frantic phone call in which she’s freaking out about some guy who won’t return her calls and she accuses Rory of being unable to see humor or nuances, Rory’s next communication regarding Naomi comes from Naomi’s lawyer, who informs her their book deal is off, and that Naomi wants all the notes she took during their meetings (which mostly consist of Rory’s doodles of martini glasses and Hangman games).\nAnother buzzkill in London: she and Logan are eating at a fancy restaurant when Mitchum Huntzberger pops up at their table. He was unaware Logan and Rory are still in touch (let alone how in touch they are), which panics Rory that he sees them together, even though he offers to put in a call to someone at Conde Nast and make sure her oft-postponed meeting there finally goes through.\nAlexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More During an alumni event at Chilton, Rory talks to a class of current students and tells them how inspired she was by a music composition class she took at Chilton (Paris shares how she was inspired by Stalin). Afterwards, Headmaster Charleston has a catch-up chat with Rory and offers her a position on the Chilton faculty if she’ll get a Master’s degree. She declines, and he hints that he’s offering her the opportunity because she seems to be drifting.\nAnd he is correct. She finally gets that meeting with Conde Nast, and she clicks with GQ editor Jim Nelson. But when Naomi nixes the book project, a desperate Rory offers to write a story on spec for GQ . When she actually delves into it — a story on why people are willing to wait in line for anything in New York — she realizes she has no good take on the topic. Also: she bonds with a group of people waiting in line at a comic book store, which includes a guy in a Wookiee suit with whom she has a one-night stand, prompting her to tell Lorelai about said Wookiee guy and about her affair with Logan.\nRead More (Credit: Netflix) More On the heels of all that, Rory deigns to call Sandee Martin, the editor of website Sandee Says, who’s been asking her for months to come work for her. Rory, somewhat understandably after Sandee’s aggressive pursuit, assumes she already has the job, so she shows up with no ideas and very obviously without have really studied the site. Sandee, meanwhile, is in interview mode, and when the only idea Rory can muster up is a story on women who have regretful one-night stands with guys they meet at Comic Con-type events, Sandee fakes an emergency meeting request and blows Rory off. Rory reacts ungraciously to being rejected for a job she thought was beneath her.\n“I’m flailing. I don’t have a plan or a list or a clue,” she tells Lorelai. “I’m just a big fat Wookiee-humping loser with no future.”\nLorelai offers a reality check: “Life has been pretty good to you so far… it was time for a few curveballs.”\nOf course, that was before Sandee Says said, “No, thanks” to Rory. She ends the episode by storming into Lorelai’s house, and announcing she’s moving back home.\nGraham, Scott Patterson filming at Emily’s (Credit: Netflix) More Luke\nHe gets a call from his sister, Liz, and her husband T.J., who are still together, but who have accidentally joined a “vegetable cult” to which they are committed for six million years. They thought they were signing on for a veggie co-op.\nHe’s also got Gilmore family issues. Emily invites him to dinner, where she reveals that Richard willed him money to finally franchise Luke’s Diner, as Richard had encouraged him to do years earlier. Luke’s taken aback, of course. Emily says the gesture was to help ensure Lorelai’s future, but Luke has never wanted to franchise the diner. That doesn’t stop Emily and her real estate agent from showing up at Luke’s a few days later, ready to take him on a tour of buildings that might be suitable for the next Luke’s outpost. It’s during the tour that Emily mentions she quit her joint therapy with Lorelai, something Luke was not aware of. When he asks Lorelai later how her therapy session with Emily went that day, she lies and tells him it was the same as usual.\nEmily\nShe’s still grieving, of course, but not so much that her entire “Spring” isn’t spent stirring the stew of Luke and Lorelai’s lives (see above).\nElsewhere in Stars Hollow (and beyond):\n* One of the longest ongoing mysteries of the series – where has Mr. Kim been all these years? – is solved: we see Mr. Kim for the first time! He waves at Lane and Rory at the town food festival… and then that’s the last we see of him or hear about him.\n“Hi, Mr. Kim!” (Credit: Netflix) More * Mrs. Kim is grooming a group of young Koreans to form a choir, but their musical skills are thus far sorely lacking.\n* Lorelai runs into Jackson at the food festival, where he’s manning his farm market booth. She asks him about Sookie, and he says she was going to come home, but is still busy with Dan Barber at Blue Hill Farm.\n(Credit: Netflix) More * A town meeting agenda includes Taylor’s plan to paint the fire hydrants different colors, according to the aesthetic of the street corner they’re on. He’s also in a tizzy that a movie is filming in Woodbury, which is where the A-listers (including Daniel Radcliffe, Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Jessica Chastain, and Jack Black) are staying, while Stars Hollow is getting the film’s B-list performers staying at the Dragonfly. Finally, Taylor really wants to host the town’s first gay pride parade, but there are only three gay citizens in town, and Hank from Woodbury — Taylor’s longtime nemesis — won’t lend Stars Hollow any of his town’s gay citizenry. “We lent them our riding mowers one year, why can’t they lend us their gays?” book store owner Andrew asks.\nGypsy, meanwhile asks Taylor if there’s anyone, anyone at all, he might be leaving off the list of gay Stars Hollow residents. As several townsfolk lean forward to hear his answer, he says no. “Well, there you go,” Gypsy says, answering, apparently, another of the ongoing questions in the series.\nAnd Babette reveals the town has a secret bar.\n* Lorelai likes her sammie, but she fires Rachael Ray, the latest famous chef to attempt to run a pop-up eatery in Sookie’s Dragonfly kitchen.\n* At the Black and White and Read Bookstore, Lulu and Kirk are hosting movie night, which includes the debut of A Second Film by Kirk, a short film about Petal the pig getting run over by a car. It’s his follow-up to I Love Your Daughter , which won the Good Try Award at the Lake Chappaqua Film Festival.\n* If there was any doubt about how well Paris is doing financially, it’s cleared up here when she mentions having donated $100,000 to Chilton’s capital improvement plan. She also lives in a five-story Manhattan townhouse (which doesn’t have an elevator, causing she and Doyle to lose a nanny because of that wicked stair climb).\nMae Whitman cameos (Credit: Netflix) More * Sweet crossover: Lauren Graham’s Parenthood daughter, Mae Whitman, plays Marcie, a young woman waiting in line for crodough cakes with Lorelai and Rory. “Hey kid,” Lorelai calls out to Marcie to give her one of the crodough cakes she has secretly procured.\nQuestions: We Got a Few\n* Why did Lorelai lie to Luke about the therapy session?\n* Do we believe that Mitchum Huntzberger really doesn’t know Rory and Logan are having an affair? They seem to go out to restaurants a lot, so they’re not being too covert. Also, he was pretty stealth in the way he snuck up on them at their table… who else thinks he might totally know, and is offering to help Rory get into Conde Nast in the hopes of keeping her in the States and away from Logan (and his French heiress fiancé, Odette) in London?\n* Claudia the therapist just started smoking again… not a coincidence that it happened right after her sessions with Lorelai and Emily began, right?\nDakin Matthews (Credit: Netflix) More * Has Headmaster Charleston rewritten history? During his chat with Rory, he tells her, “I’ve always though the world of you… all of us here have.” Puh-huh! Remember when the Chilton busybodies forced Rory to interact socially with her classmates more, lest, as Charleston and his cohorts threatened, Rory not get a recommendation for Harvard? Remember how that ended: with Lorelai being called to pick up Rory in the middle of the night in Charleston’s office after her pals had broken in as part of a secret society initiation?\nAnd while we’re picking nits, Charleston also tells Rory, “You were always internally stronger than everyone else.” What?! Does he not remember her freakout when the deer hit her car and she was too late to take the Shakespeare test? And he must not have heard about how she melted like Jell-O salad on an Arizona sidewalk in college, blowing up her whole future and dropping out of Yale because of one review by Mitchum.\nIt all begs the bigger question: are we supposed to just sum it up as Charleston being clueless, or is this really how the writers see Rory, as this wonderful, admirable, strong character? Because we’d argue she hasn’t been that for a long time, certainly not at the point we catch up with her in A Year in the Life .\n* “Crodough cakes,” what Rory and Lorelai were waiting in line for at the Monique Aswell Bakery, really just looked like giant glazed doughnuts, right? Kinda like the ones from Randy’s Donuts in Los Angeles?\nGilmore Gift of Gab\n“My big bazookas are intruding on you?” — Emily, to Lorelai, after Lorelai says Emily has pulled out the big bazookas (her grief over Richard’s death) to guilt Lorelai into continuing therapy.\n“Do you want to take this inside? We’re outside, so we can only take this inside.” — Petal the pig owner Kirk, confronting the perpetrator of “pig genocide,” the roaster of a hog on a spit at the town food festival.\n“Develop a creamy filling, and I’m all yours.” — Lorelai sounding unintentionally dirty while responding to Taylor’s accusation that she’s not paying attention to him at the town meeting because she’s enjoying her bag of profiteroles.\n“What’s the point of living if we’re never going to bag Jennifer Lawrence?” — Michel, explaining to Lorelai that their lack of amenities is going to continue to prevent them from drawing A-list celebs to the Dragonfly.\n“Michel is for me what Paris is for you… my angry friend.” — Lorelai to Rory.\n“What’s up his ass?” — Paris to Rory when Mr. Sanders, her old AP Physics teacher at Chilton, runs when he sees her at the school.\n“Booty buddies.” — Emily’s attempt at putting a slang term on Lorelai and Luke’s relationship, because, as she says, “anything more permanent would terrify” Lorelai.\n“Liz Taylor just rose from her grave to say, ‘Whuuuut?'” — Lorelai, when Emily says marriage is permanent.\n“Sorry, did I accidentally step into 2003?” — Francie, upon witnessing Paris’s epic meltdown about Doyle, Tristan, her children, her career, her general insecurities, and Francie, in the Chilton bathroom. P.S. If anyone deserves any sort of awards recognition for A Year in the Life , it is Liza Weil as Paris. She, even more than the titular girls, hasn’t lost a step in dishing out that signature GG rapid-fire dialogue, and her physical comedy is on point. Best overall moment of the miniseries so far: Paris keeping others out of the Chilton bathroom door with her stiletto-ed foot.\nLiza Weil (Credit: Netflix) More “Blow my colon!” — Paris’s version of a curse word/phrase.\n“Get the hell away from me!” — Lorelai says those were Richard’s last words, to the nurses in the ICU.\n“Call her ‘Mom.’” — Ida the real estate agent, to Luke, about Emily. Luke and Emily both shake their heads.\n“Mom at 16… hot in Outlander , but elsewhere…” — Lorelai, offering one reason for why she’s never had a one-night stand.\n“Did he leave the outfit on?” — Lorelai, to Rory, about her fling with the dude in the Wookiee costume.\nRemember When…\n* Kirk was frequently Taylor’s assistant in organizing town events in the original series, be it the Winter Carnival or the ill-fated Easter egg hunt, and the duo are partnered up again for the Spring International Food Festival. Sadly, Kirk has not been able to insure participation by all 195 countries around the globe, for various reasons. “Guam had a last-minute parent-teacher conference, Kazakhstan had car trouble… Bangladesh’s kid has an earache, Chad has acid reflux, Brazil’s niece had a soccer game, Turks and Caicos got foot fungus, and Singapore’s just being a d–k,” he reports to Taylor.\n* Luke bought Lorelai’s basket and Jess bought Rory’s basket at the Bid on a Basket auction in the original series. In honor of that moment in their pre-romance, Lorelai outbids herself to spend $30 on the picnic basket of Stars Hollow resident Cassie. She tells Cassie the basket was good, even though she knows Cassie hoped someone else would bid on her treats.\nBledel and Matt Czuchry (Credit: Netflix) More * Rory is having an affair with the engaged-to-someone else Logan after she dumped him when he proposed to her… just like how she had an affair with then-married Dean after she dumped him to be with Jess. Just sayin’…\n* Michel is upset that the Dragonfly is behind the times in terms of amenities, including the fact that there’s no spa. If only Lorelai had listened to Emily: in the series finale, Emily tried to talk Lorelai into adding a spa to the Inn, as “destination spas” were all the rage.\n* Lorelai has a dream in which Paul Anka the dog appears to her as Paul Anka the singer, who makes a cameo appearance, just as he did in the “He’s Slippin’ ‘Em Bread… Dig?” episode of the original series.\n* Remember Kirk’s topical T-shirt biz, the ones where “Babette Ate Oatmeal” and “Rory’s Going to Yale” were printed in white text on black tees? During the Black and White and Read Bookstore movie night, Morey is wearing one that says “A Film by Kirk.”\n* During their Chilton return, we learn Paris is still sweating Tristan Dugray after all these years, and she still has a grudge against Francie, who tried to destroy Paris and her friendship with Rory back in high school. Paris is still paranoid, in fact, that Rory and Francie may be in cahoots (and later asks if Rory is sleeping with Doyle), despite that fact, as Francie points out, that Paris’s many accomplishments include being an MD, an attorney, an expert on neoclassical architecture, and a certified dental technician.\nYou’ve Been Gilmore -d:\n* Guest stars in “Spring”: Broadway star Kerry Butler as therapist Claudia; The Affair and Bunheads star Julia Goldani Telles as Sandee Says editor Sandee Martin; funny guy and Gilmore Girls superfan Jason Mantzoukas as lawyer Robert Castellanos; Rachael Ray as herself; Scandal ’s Dan Bucatinsky as GQ editor Jim Nelson; Emily Bergl as Francie; Anton Narinskiy — not Chad Michael Murray — as Tristan Degray; and TVLine editor Michael Ausiello as a guy eating a salad while others wait in a line without knowing what they’re waiting for.\n* Music in “Spring”: “Pick Yourself Up” by Fred Astaire and Johnny Green.\n* Pop culture references in “Spring”: Penn and Teller, Alanis Morissette, “Ironic,” Kofi Annan, Harrods, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Willy Loman, Escalus, Liza Minnelli, Liza With a Z , Blue Bloods , Law & Order , Vine, Jennifer Lawrence, Brexit, Thompson Twins, Skrillex, Lena Dunham, Rachael Ray, 92nd Street Y, Mickey Rourke, Color Me Mine, Edith Wharton, Winston Churchill, the “zombie” McDonald’s in NYC, Millennium Falcon, The Ivy, Fiddler on the Roof, Microsoft Surface, Huffington Post, Bazooka comics, Eraserhead , Slate, The Atlantic , David Foster Wallace, Consider the Lobster , Nick Cave, Radiohead, Stalin, The Art of War , Blake Shelton, cronuts, Dominique Ansel Bakery (changed to Monique Aswell), Get Shorty , LinkedIn, Confucius, Dorothy Parker, Tribeca, Fiji water, Queen Latifah, A History of Violence , Viggo Mortensen, Taco Terrie, Poppy Corn, Shopkins, Cloud Atlas , NY1, Pat Kiernan, Scarface , Donut Pub, Peter Pan donuts, Vesuvio, The Washington Post , and Red Bull.\n* The food they ate in “Spring”: Swedish meatballs, Peruvian salted papas, Indonesian rice porridge, profiteroles, a Rachael Ray sammie, chicken scaloppini, linguine with meatballs, hangar steak (for Paul Anka), French fries, crodough cakes, and PJ Clarke’s burgers.\nEmily Kuroda, Keiko Agena, and Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More * Stars Hollow celebrations in “Spring”: The Stars Hollow Spring International Food Festival, a town meeting at Miss Patty’s, and Taylor’s failed attempt to organize a gay pride parade.\n* Gilmore creator Amy Sherman-Palladino’s husband, Dan Palladino, is the writer and director of “Spring.”\n* Jim Nelson, as not played by Dan Bucatinsky, is really the editor of GQ .\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming on Netflix.",

Proceed at your own peril.\nFor those of us who have plowed through the whole thing already (show of hands?), Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival gave us a bunch of unexpected cameos and four little words . But it also gave us a treasure trove of snappy dialogue that we’ll be quoting for years to come.\nPHOTOS Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : Michael Ausiello’s 10 Favorite Moments Ranked\nWitty banter, of course, is a Gilmore Girls trademark, and A Year in the Life delivered in a big way with plenty of funny one-liners from Lorelai and company, including up-to-the-minute references to Marvel movies and the Kardashians. Then of course, there was the triumphant return of Paris Geller; we could fill an entire gallery with her Quote: s alone.\nBut A Year in the Life also had more than a few heartwarming moments, and those touching bits of dialogue are captured here, too.

      "title": "'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Totally Replaced Chad Michael Murray With Another Actor and Hoped Nobody Would Notice!",
      "text": "Well this is awkward…\nNetflix's highly anticipated four-part event, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , has finally graced our screens and it was jam-packed with many delightful and downright life-changing moments. (Read the full recap here!)\nBut there was one moment in the series' second episode, \"Spring,\" that slammed our jaws onto the floor of Chilton's perfectly marbled hallways: Gilmore Girls replaced 2000s WB heartthrob Chad Michael Murray with another actor and hoped that nobody would notice. Yes, we're serious.\nMORE: 'Gilmore Girls' Each Season's Biggest Moments and Those Last 4 Words Finally Revealed!\nNetflix\nWhen Rory returns to her old private school to speak to the students at Chilton's alumni day, she is shocked when Paris stares off into the distance while simultaneously screaming, \"Oh my god!\" For a split second, the camera cuts to a tall, handsome, blonde man confidently hitting on a gorgeous girl in the hallways of Chilton.\n\"Tristan?\" Rory ponders out loud to herself while Paris frantically kicks a gaggle of preteens out of the nearest ladies' room.\nNot so fast!\nUpon closer inspection, it's clear the actor portraying the casual smugness of Chilton badboy Tristan Dugray is not being played by Murray, who starred in the role for the first two seasons before being sent off to military school (AKA One Tree Hill ). Instead, according to the credits, (and our own eyes,) the \"Tristan Double\" is played Days of Our Lives actor Anton Narinskiy . Gasp !\nWe have SO many questions: Why couldn't they get Murray to return to the Gilmore Girls revival? Did they really think we wouldn't notice that this is a completely different actor? Whose not-so-bright idea was this? And why the heck would Tristan even be at an alumni event in the first place, considering the fact that he never actually graduated from Chilton?!\nGilmore Girls further rubbed salt in our CMM-loving wounds by weaving their on-set deceit into the storyline. \"Was that Tristan out there?\" a doe-eyed Rory asks.\n\"Of course it was Tristan! That pouty mouth, those liquid eyes, who else?!\" Paris snaps. Yes, we're currently asking \"Who else?\" that man is too.\nPHOTOS: 'Gilmore Girls': Looking Back at the Now-Famous Faces Who Once Graced Stars Hollow\nET recently caught up with star Liza Weil on the red carpet of Gilmore Girls ' world premiere event, and got the exclusive scoop on this confusing schoolboy switch-a-roo.\nRead More \"I mean, it would've been nice [to have him in the revival], but he's busy,\" Weil spilled of Murray's M.I.A. status. \"He's doing a lot of things and he's doing very well for himself, Chad Michael Murray, so I think in all, I think it plays.\"\nSeeing Tristan \"macking on the slutty biznatch,\" combined with the fact that she and Doyle are getting a divorce leads Paris into a full-fledged, not-getting-into-Harvard-level freak out.\n\"There was a lot going on in alumni day, but I was so glad that we were able to revisit Chilton,\" the How to Get Away With Murder star continued. \"And it really did make so much sense to me, psychologically, and I could see how [seeing Tristan] would be a very big trigger for Paris.\"\nBut Trickster Dugray is not the only Chilton ghost to haunt the halls of Paris' high school nightmares. Former queen bee and leader of The Puffs, Francie Jarvis, also makes an appearance in the ladies' room right in the middle of Paris' downward spiral.\nMORE: Behind the Scenes of the 'Gilmore Girls' Revival -- See All the Pics!\n\"Fine sure, we'll just catch up at the reunion of The Puffs next month,\" Francie says coyly after Paris kicks her out of the bathroom. \"Oops! No we won't, because you never got puffed!\"\nWhen asked if Paris regrets never getting initiated into the secret society, Weil joked with ET that the snub \"stings still.\" The 39-year-old actress added, \"I don't know if regret is the right word. I think it hurts. It left a mark.\"\nWell, we can certainly empathize, because the fact that Gilmore Girls replaced Tristan Dugray with another actor is definitely going to leave a mark on our Murray-loving hearts for many years to come.\nCan you believe that the powers-that-be at Gilmore Girls recast Tristan? Are you outraged or over it?

      "text": "Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham. (Photo: Netflix) More Netflix has posted all four new episodes of Gilmore Girls , collectively known as Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . I’ve already written a spoiler-free, overall review of the quartet of Stars Hollow specials here, but now I’m writing one review per day of each individual episode. Yesterday’s review was of “ Spring .” Today is a review of the third episode, “Summer.” You are hereby and loudly warned: WALL-TO-WALL SPOILERS OF GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE follow. Grab a mug of coffee and some Hot Pockets.\nIt is amazing how much can be packed into these 90-minute Gilmore Girls episodes, and this one features a big chunk of a new musical about the history of Stars Hollow, a new job for Rory as a newspaper editor, the return of Rory’s ex-boyfriend Jess (Milo Ventimiglia, wearing his This Is Us mustache), a breakup with Logan, the introduction of the irritating 30-something gang, the announcement of Rory’s next big career move and Lorelai’s next big life change. Oh, and also Michel’s big life move. And yet it’s also perhaps the weakest of the four episodes, relying too heavily on running gags that exhaust themselves too quickly, such as the follow-through on the previous episode’s conclusion: Rory moving back to Stars Hollow. “I’m not back,” she keeps saying defensively when seemingly every person she encounters says, “Welcome back!” or, “I knew she’d come back!”\nChristian Borle and Sutton Foster. (Photo: Netflix) More Two big town events occur. One is Stars Hollow: The Musical, a co-production by Taylor and his morose collaborator, Nat Compton, starring Sutton Foster (star, I probably don’t need to tell you, of Amy Sherman-Palladino’s short-lived but well-loved Bunheads ) and Christian Borle, who some TV viewers treasure from that hate-watch-classic on NBC, Smash, which wasn’t. This episode — written and directed by Daniel Palladino — recognizes the polarizing effects of musicals on any given audience and tries to acknowledge both sides. While all around Lorelai are held rapt by the cleverly written numbers performed by Foster and Borle, Lorelai is the holdout who thinks the whole thing is a botch and a bore. I certainly admire the pluck of F and B, but I side with Lorelai. The second time I watched “Summer” and came to the songs, I admit I scanned through most of them. There’s also a running gag about Kinky Boots that gets old super -fast. But can I also just say that the latter-day Sally Struthers, forever bellowing hoarsely as Babette, is a national treasure?\nLiz Torres, Sally Struthers. (Photo: Netflix) More The second biggish event is Rory’s taking over as editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette, which was on the verge of folding. Lots of jokes about the antiquity of print culture; Rory hangs a portrait of the late, great New York Times media columnist David Carr on the wall; and Jess returns to chat and give her the idea for…\n…THE BOOK. It is a project worthy of capitalization. It will be Rory’s version of her relationship with her mother. A memoir. (I know this is sacrilege, but I disagree with Lorelai’s “note”: I’ve always thought the show title should be The Gilmore Girls. Dropping the definite article implies a bunch of Gilmore females, and only Emily could possibly be added as the show was originally conceived.) At this time in Rory’s life, when the frustrated writer is at a crossroads in her career, Jess’s suggestion of a memoir is far better than any advice she received from the real/not-real Jim Nelson at GQ in the last episode. Lorelai, predictably, is not in favor of this. She withholds her permission. They quarrel; it’s a very good, heart-rending quarrel. Yet why is this delightfully predictable? Because in crucial moments like this, Lorelai reveals the traits she shares with the person she wants least to resemble: her mother.\nRead More Speaking of Emily, she’s now sleeping till noon, is bored by her Daughters of the American Revolution meetings, and is allowing herself to be sweet-talked by Ray Wise’s not- Twin Peaks character.\nThe episode climaxes with the revelation that in the months that have passed since spring, Luke has not told Lorelai about looking at franchise properties, while Lorelai has never told Luke that she’s continued to have solo therapy sessions after Emily gave up on Claudia (who turns out to be a closet theater geek). I should add that the scene in which Luke has to cook burgers for one day for the guests in the mere 10 rooms of the Dragonfly Inn clearly proves he cannot possibly become a franchise owner. More seriously, this withholding-information notion drives a wedge between Lorelai and Luke and spurs Lorelai to announce that the book she’s been reading, Cheryl Strayed’s Wild, has inspired her next adventure, which will conclude A Year in the Life .\nOverall, “Summer” repeats the themes of betrayal and insecurity for all three core Gilmore women while providing some warm laughs and entirely too many flat, repetitious jokes.\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls’: A Journey Through Lorelai’s Love Life\nExtra Gilmore Gifts:\nLuke’s daughter April returns only to reestablish why she was a dull character: She’s so aware of her dullness, she admits she recently “bought a joke book.” No one has bought a joke book since the heyday of Joey Adams . I know, I know: that’s the joke. Still ain’t funny. Allusions, especially wide-ranging this time, are made to Game of Thrones, Noam Chomsky , Kanye West, Paul Thomas Anderson, Dave Eggers, Michael Bay, and Perry White. Michel breaks the news that he’s leaving the Dragonfly Inn to take a job at a Manhattan W Hotel. He does this over drinks with Lorelai at the Secret Bar, a running gag that gets old super- duper -fast. My wife wonders whether Jess giving Rory the idea for THE BOOK is a nod to the Anne of Green Gables books, specifically when Gilbert tells Anne she should write about what she knows best: life in Avonlea, a rural place only slightly less idyllic than Stars Hollow. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is now streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "Video Transcript Transcript for 'Gilmore Girls' Mini-Series Lands on Netflix to Excitement of Show's Fans \"Good morning America\" is brought to you by PetSmart. Time for \"Pop news.\" Diane Macedo, ABC news reporter, what's popping? Thanks Dan. We start off with the Gilmore girls. Fans are at a loss for words over the series, last four words. For years it was eteased there were four specific words she wanted to tends series with. Gilmore girl as year in the life. Some are satisfied. Some are angry. Just about everyone is shocked. It was such an emotional moment that only the chaos that comes from working on a TV set kept it from being a sob fest. What were the final four words. I can't spoil it for you. You have to watch for yourself. It's publicly available. You'll have to go on Netflix and watch it. I don't make the rules. Just playing by them. I'm not paying 9 bucks a month. \"Star wars\" fans were treated to a Thanksgiving weekend surprise. A brand new \"Rogue one\" trailer. Take a look. I'll be there for you. The captain said I had to. Gentlemen. You are dealing with here is immeasruable. Racking up more than 800,000 F views on YouTube. Advanced ticket sales begin at midnight in most areas and rogue one \"Star wars\" story hits theaters December 16th. If it's not just because it produced by Disney our parent company which writes our paychecks, I think it's going to be a good movie. They're focusing on Normal people as opposed to the jedi. Jedis are Normal. They have emotions. Rob is still waiting for \"The chew\" bacca series. And Tom Hanks settling a debate burning up the internet when this photo was posted to the group reasons my son is crying. The photo has since resurfaced with viewers divided over the question, is this a photo of Tom Hanks or Bill Murray. Tom Hanks. You might want to look at it for a while and come up with your answer. Definitely Tom Hanks. Now we have the answer on the graham Morton show he said it's definitely not him. Because he's Tom Hanks and awesome he made his own hilarious version with two other guests, check it out. There you go. There you go. Squeeze in. Squeeze in. Like that. Like that, smiling.

      "text": "[Warning: This story contains spoilers from all four parts of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.]\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life brought everything full circle. And no, we're not just talking about the explosive, knock-down fight between Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) on the day of Richard's funeral in \"Winter.\" The final four words, as God and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino intended them, brought the entire franchise exactly to where it began when Rory (Alexis Bledel) dropped the bombshell on her newly betrothed mother that she was, in fact, pregnant.\nOn one level, the final four words brought closure. The show's die-hard fans spent nearly a decade agonizing over how Sherman-Palladino had envisioned to wrap up the original WB series before she and husband and executive producer Dan Palladino unexpectedly left over a contract dispute at the end of season six, and the Netflix revival helped answer that question once and for all.\nOn the other hand, the circumstances surrounding Rory's surprising news seems to leave things open for yet another batch of new episodes. The father of Rory's unborn baby was unconfirmed as the final credits rolled. Even if it is Logan (Matt Czuchry), as their ongoing affair through the revival seems to suggest, his engagement to a French heiress and their complicated relationships with each other's family opens up a whole new slew of issues. Sure, Rory never seemed particularly in need of a father, as Christopher's (David Sutcliffe) brief return in the revival also seemed to imply, but the audience's investment in Rory's love life over the years (#TeamDean, #TeamJess and #TeamLogan, anyone?) makes the lack of confirmation all that more difficult to swallow.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' Creator and Stars Discuss Final Four Words: \"It Made Complete Sense\"\nThe question about the possibility of more episodes also comes in the midst of revival frenzy, brought upon at least in part by Gilmore Girls. When the show originally went off the air in 2007, such reunions and revivals were extremely few and far between. But in 2016, streamers like Netflix have given much more weight to revival hopes (see: NBC's Heroes Reborn, Fox's The X Files and even Netflix's Fuller House). But the bigger question is about the intentions of Sherman-Palladino, the woman without whom the show struggled for a year before coming to an unceremonious end and the woman who then brought the world of Stars Hollow back to life nine years later. When she originally thought of the final four words, there was a very slim chance of doing a revival or a sequel of any sorts, so does she want to forge ahead and explore Rory's life as a mom-to-be/new mom sometime down the road? Or is she ready to walk away from Stars Hollow now that she did what she set out to do?\nWhen asked about the possibility of producing more episodes, Sherman-Palladino said she was waiting to see just how A Year in the Life was received.\n\"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, 'Is there more, is there more, is there more?' - this has to go out into the universe now. We've got to put this to bed,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter. \"And then whatever happens, happens.\"\nRead more: Critic's Notebook: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Spoiler Talk — The Last 4 Words and More\nA big part of the equation would be the availability of the actors and executive producers. Graham, Bledel and Bishop have yet to sign up for their first post-Gilmore Girls revival projects, as has presumed baby daddy Czuchry. Scott Patterson has several movies in preproduction for release next year in addition to his music career leading the band Smith Radio, which released its first single, \"Haha,\" on Wednesday. However, even Patterson sounded open to more installments of the series when asked by THR earlier this year.\n\"It's be nice to do it every year,\" he said. \"Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.\"\nSherman-Palladino and Palladino, on the other hand, have both been hard at work on their Amazon pilot, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, about a housewife who becomes a stand-up comic. Because of Sherman-Palladino's heavy hand in all of her series, it's unclear whether she would be able or willing to split her time between two shows. However, judging by the public interest going into Friday's launch of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, it seems safe to assume Netflix would potentially be open to further installments. As the theme song goes, \"where you lead, I will follow.\"\nDo you think there should be more episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life?",

      "title": "Hulu: What’s Leaving After November? What’s New In December? Marvel’s ‘Iron Man’ To Be Added",
      "text": "\nAs every streaming service tries to compete with industry-leader Netflix, the ever-growing catalog at Hulu will be losing about 30 films as November comes to an end, helping to make room for even more content to be added for the holiday season throughout the month of December. From Bridget Jones to North Dallas Forty to American Psycho (and the sequel), there are only a few days left to watch these gems on Hulu. But the Christmas month will mean all sorts of new movies for Hulugans, from eight Friday the 13th flicks and Indecent Proposal to Bridges of Madison County and All Dogs Go to Heaven .\nLeaving Hulu in November If you like a little humor in your films about sex, there are still a few days to watch Woody Allen classics like A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (the first Allen film to star Mia Farrow) and Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (Burt Reynolds, Gene Wilder), not to mention Bananas , Love and Death , and Alice . If you prefer a more traditional romantic comedy, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason or Married to the Mob are available until the end of November. A few classics from the horror genre are on their way out, including The Blair Witch Project and Stigmata , while horror spoofs Scary Movie 2 and 3 join them.\nHere is a complete list of films that will be leaving Hulu at the end of November:\nAlice (1999) American Psycho (2000) American Psycho 2 (2002) Bananas (1971) The Blair Witch Project (1999) Bowling for Columbine (2002) Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004) Class (1983) The Dogs of War (1981) Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid To Ask) (1972) The Falcon and the Snowman (1985) From Dusk till Dawn (1996) Lost and Delirious (2001) Love and Death (1975) Married to the Mob (1988) The Messengers (2007) A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982) North Dallas Forty (1979) Scary Movie 2 (2001) Scary Movie 3 (2003) Spanish Judges (2001) Stage Beauty (2004) Stigmata (1999) Throw Momma from the Train (1987) Troll (1988) Troll 2 (1991) Under Fire (1983) W. (2008) Coming to Hulu in December As soon as those films leave Hulu, there will be an abundance to replace them on December 1. The epic Apocalypse Now will be available, along with the Redux version that includes almost an hour of bonus footage. The ever-popular All Dogs Go to Heaven is added to the list, as well as its considerably less-popular sequel. In two very different aspects of American culture from the 1980s, Desperately Seeking Susan will be added along with the first eight installments of Friday the 13th . Fans of Jackie Chan will be excited to see Legend of the Drunken Master and Jackie Chan’s Project A added in December as well.\nHere is a complete list of films and shows that will be added to Hulu throughout December:\nAvailable December 1\nApocalypse Now (1979) Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) All Dogs go to Heaven (1989) All Dogs go to Heaven 2 (1996) Antitrust (2001) Autumn in New York (2000) American Beauty (1989) Black Rain (1962) Black Water (2008) The Bridges of Madison County (1995) Born Romantic (2001) Cats & Dogs (2001) Carnival of Souls (1998) The Counterfeit Traitor (1996) Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) Devil’s Rejects (2005) Don’t Answer the Phone (1980) Doc Hollywood (1991) Driving Miss Daisy (1989) Escape From LA (1997) Fluke (1987) The Foot Fist Way (2006) Friday the 13th (1980) Friday the 13th Part II (1981) Friday the 13th Part III (1982) Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter (1984) #mondays moods be like #jasonvoorhees #fridaythe13th \nA photo posted by casey (@horrorshopstore) on Nov 28, 2016 at 3:14am PST \n\nFriday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985) Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986) Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) Friday the 13th Part VIII: Manhattan (1989) A Guy Thing (2003) Hard Rain (1998) The Hearse (1980) House of 1,000 Corpses (2003) Indecent Proposal (1993) Jackie Chan’s Project A (1983) Jim Norton: Please Be Offended (2012) Legend of the Drunken Master (1994) Moonstruck (1987) Never Back Down (2008) No Country for Old Men (2007) One from the Heart (1982) Private Parts (1997) Pulp Fiction (1994) Rain Man (1988) Reservoir Dogs (1992) Ronin (1998) Rosemary’s Baby (1968) Rumble in the Bronx (1996) Shivers (1975) The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) Sling Blade (1996) Space Cowboys (2000) The Silence of the Lambs (1991) This is Spinal Tap (1984) The Truman Show (1998) Uncle Grandpa : Complete Season 3 (Cartoon Network) The Usual Suspects (1995) Vampires Kiss (1989) Would You Rather (2013) Available later in December\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016) Anomalisa (2015) At the Devil’s Door (2014) Barbarians Rising : Complete Season 1 (History) The Bay (2012) Beyond the Hills (2014) Daddy’s Home (2015) Hairspray Live!: Special (NBC) Iron Man (2008) Last Weekend (2014) The Love Guru (2008) Mars: Complete Season 1 (Nat Geo) On the Road (2013) The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2013) Shut Eye : Complete Season 1 (Hulu Original) Spiderman 3 (2007) Star: Season 1 Premiere (FOX) Stories We Tell (2013) Teen Mom 2 : Complete Season 6 (MTV) The Thundermans : Complete Season 3 (Nickelodeon) The Trip to Italy (2014) Venture Bros : Complete Season 6 (Adult Swim) Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016) Zoolander 2 (2016) For more information about a Hulu subscription, visit Hulu’s official site .\n[Featured Image by John Minihan/Evening Standard/Getty Images, Kevin Winter/Getty Images and Koichi Kamoshida/Getty Images]\nHulu: What’s Leaving After November?

      "text": "Home > Android > How to Play Netflix HD on any Android Device with Widevine Level 1 DRM How to Play Netflix HD on any Android Device with Widevine Level 1 DRM Tweet \nA while ago I wrote an article entitled “ Why Doesn’t your Android TV Box Play Full HD or 4K Videos in Netflix? ” basically explaining that most TV boxes running Android could only play SD quality, because HD and higher quality requires both Widevine Level 1 DRM, and Netflix certification, and the second part is the most difficult since Netflix need to spend time testing a given product, and may not agree to do so for smaller manufacturers. The end result is that only a small subset of devices can play Netflix HD. \nSamsung Tab S2 is one of the device with Widevine Level 1, but is not certified by Netflix, and by default can only play SD quality. But XDA Forum user chenxiaolong apparently found a workaround and as the photo above shows is now able to reach HD resolutions (e.g. 1920×1080) with Netflix using his tablet. After analyzing packets between the server and his two Samsung tablets, he noticed that he could set “enableWidevineL1” from the JSON response to true, and provided a method showing how to change the app without uploaded a modded apk. But others followed his instructions and released a modified Netflix HD apk . \nAlthough it might or might not breach Netflix TOS, please note that this has nothing to do with piracy at all, nor does it skip DRM, as it still requires both a Netflix HD subscription and a device supporting Widevine Level 1 DRM. Sadly that also means the trick will still not work on most cheap Android TV boxes that are limited to Level 3 security. It’s also quite possible Netflix eventually notices and changes the code to prevent this little hack. \nThanks to Theguyuk for the tip.",

      "title": "How 'Gilmore Girls' Revival Gives Fans the Ending They Always Wanted",
      "text": "All Stories \nNow that Netflix's latest nostalgia-fueled reboot, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, is here – and if you're reading this, you've presumably binged all six hours of the new series over the holiday weekend – we have just one thing to say: Oy, enough with the poodles already. Related 10 Things You Need to Know About Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' Revival From who's coming back to why this is such a big deal, your complete guide to the long-awaited cult show's return \nJust kidding. But the revival of the beloved early-aughts dramedy is destined to be discussed, dissected and debated for the foreseeable future, especially when you consider that it ends on one hell of a cliffhanger. (If you haven't seen the whole thing, stop reading now; here there be spoilers, and plenty of them.) At the end of it all, daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) reveals to her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) that, via those highly hyped, endlessly teased final four words, that more Gilmores may be on the way: \"Mom?\"\"Yeah?\"\"I'm pregnant.\" Then the screen cuts to black. While the other characters get satisfying endings – Lorelai and Luke finally tie the knot, matriarch Emily (Kelly Bishop) finds her independence after her husband Richard's death – Rory's next act is left tantalizingly open-ended. \nPart of the reason that this new series exists at all is because the Gilmore Girls creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino left the show before its seventh and final season, leaving fans clamoring for the ending that she truly intended. Those final four words have achieved near-mythic status among fans, inspiring breathless thinkpieces (both before and after the revival started streaming) about what they might be, what it said about the series as a whole and What It All Means. Now we've got the ending the showrunner had envisioned since the series' early days. \nThe question now is: Was it worth it? \nThe Netflix reboot picks up right where the series left off, even though eight years have passed. Lorelai and her longtime boyfriend Luke (Scott Patterson) are still together; he's got his diner, she's got the Dragonfly Inn, they're still living in Stars Hollow. Rory is working as a journalist, albeit one who seems to have absolutely no idea how to actually be a journalist. Emily is still Emily, attending DAR meetings she and still has no idea how to have a healthy relationship with her offpsring – a two-way street of mother-daughter dysfunctionality that leads to one of the reboot's best moments, a fight with Lorelai in the first installment, \"Winter.\" \nBut one key component is missing: family patriarch Richard, who passed away suddenly four months before the events of A Year in the Life. (In reality, Edward Herrmann, who played Lorelai's father, died of cancer in 2014.) His death hangs over the series like a dark cloud, and to the creative team's credit, it's not merely brushed off as a thing that happened, now everyone has moved on, etc. Richard's absence, and the three Gilmore ladies' processing of it, is the catalyst for much of the revival's drama, which takes place over the course of a year (see subtitle) and devotes one 90-minute mini-movie to each of the four seasons. \nIn the service of fan service – and, perhaps, to fill out those super-sized episodes – Sherman-Palladino devotes too much time to bits and characters that maybe didn't need it. For instance: The Stars Hollow musical, a ridiculous diversion concocted and ably performed by Sutton Foster and Christian Borle, is very, very funny ... and goes on way, way longer than necessary. Kirk's Ooo-ber business – a rip-off of the ride-sharing service, in which customers call the town misfit's mom and he picks them up in a beat-up jalopy with holes in the floor – showcases the character's oddball charm, but it grows stale quickly. ( A Second Film by Kirk, however, is a call-back to the original series that is extremely welcome.) \nEven worse is the appearance of the the Life and Death Brigade, a secret society that's basically a more privileged, often-soused version of Yale's Skull & Bones. In \"Fall,\" the group's chief rabble-rousers appear, along with ringleader and former Rory paramour Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry), to take her on a masked, drunken journey for … some reason. Something about grand gestures? Who knows; it's an illogical diversion, and perhaps the worst Gilmore bit across either series, and yes, we are counting Season Seven. Emily Kuroda, Keiko Agena and Alexis Bledel in 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nThat bit also speaks to a larger frustration: Rory has become a shining example of how privilege and constantly being told how special you are can turn a precocious teen into an insufferable adult. She botches an interview with a gossipy blog because she thinks she's too good for it; she's ditched her apartment in favor of crashing on friends and family members' couches, living a \"rootless\" existence; she's sleeping with her ex-boyfriend Logan, who's soon to be married to a different woman. Yes, plenty of thirtysomethings are going through similar bouts of immaturity and entitlement – those millions of thinkpieces about millennials didn't come out of nowhere. (The series even acknowledges this with The Thirty-Something Club, a group of Stars Hollow kids who're all grown up and living with their parents again – causing the older generation to form a support group that wants Lorelai as a member.) But all of this would've been seemed like necessary, messy growing pains if we were talking about 22-year-old Rory. With 32-year-old Rory, it just seems, frankly, a little sad. \nStill, while Rory's storyline was at times downright painful to watch (seriously, girl, take a how-to Mediabistro class on journalism), Lorelai and Emily's journeys are far more satisfying. The former finally sees a therapist and embarks on a Wild -inspired trek to the California woods — it's one of the revival's funnier bits, as a bevy of other women are doing the same exact thing — before finally finding peace with her relationship and her career. Her mother, meanwhile, has the most shocking transformation: Without her husband of 50 years in her life, she fully embraces her independence, ditching her well-heeled, stuffy Connecticut digs for freedom and a seaside compound in Nantucket. \"I can't spend any more time on artifice and bullshit,\" she exclaims at a DAR meeting. For longtime fans, it's scenes like these that justify the existence of Netflix's Gilmore resurrection in the first place. \nPlus, given the way the show has always built out Stars Hollow as a densely staffed way station of quirk — a key part of the appeal of the Gilmore verse — there is a lot of peripheral business that works like gangbusters. Every moment that Paris Geller (Liza Weil) is on screen is a gift, showing us how the over-achieving, hyper-competitive character has grown into adulthood. Melissa McCarthy's all-too-brief appearance as clumsy but brilliant chef Sookie St. James is a reminder that she was always a gifted actor and comedian, long before her rise to superstardom. And Michel (Yanic Truesdale), the long-suffering concierge of the Dragonfly, is as snide and bitchy as ever – and, finally, out and proud. (The series' lack of diversity is still, alas, a glaring issue, even as times have gotten increasingly progressive.) Related Watch 'Gilmore Girls' Talk Amy Schumer in Netflix Revival Teaser Streaming service will premiere four 90-minute episodes in November \nAnd then there's that ending. In the final episode, Lorelai and Emily toast \"to the circle of life.\" Rory's pregnancy, unexpected and shocking as it may be, is part of that. Throughout the original series, much of the conflict was driven by Lorelai's rejection of her privileged background, and Rory's embracing of it (the coming-out party, the Yale education). Now, with this new Gilmore bun in the oven – the father, presumably, is Logan, who comes from the same privileged background as she – things have indeed come full circle. \nSherman-Palladino never really was a fan of wrapping things up with a neat little bow, even when the original Gilmore Girls was on the air. This isn't even the first time a season has ended on a serious emotional cliffhanger, though it may be the first time that the stakes are so high. It remains to be seen if we'll ever find out what happens with Rory, Lorelai, and the possible next generation of Gilmore girls. But the show lead, and we followed. For now, at least, fans have gotten the ending they always wanted. More News",

      "text": "The Best Holiday Movies on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and HBO Now November 28, 2016 @ 10:48 AM By Heidi Patalano \nGet into the spirit of the season with movies that are best watched between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve. While you can always just put a video of a burning log on your TV for the sake of atmosphere, these films — which are free once you subscribe to each service — will get you into the holiday mood. \nLove Actually — Netflix \nThe British film that single-handedly revived Mariah Carey ’s classic Christmas song, All I Want For Christmas Is You , is worth a fresh viewing every year. There’s Hugh Grant playing the prime minister falling for his assistant, a pre- Hobbit -and- Sherlock -fame Martin Freeman playing a stand-in on a porn set and a pre- The Walking Dead fame Andrew Lincoln playing a man hopelessly in love with his best friend’s fiancée ( Keira Knightley ). 2003 was a simpler time. PHOTOS: Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Unique Presents for Women \nScrooged — Netflix \nWhile Bill Murray released A Very Murray Christmas special on Netflix last year (and it’s still available now), check out the 1988-vintage of this Chicagoan, who stars as a narcissistic TV executive who gets visits from three spirits, Christmas Carol- style. \nBad Santa — HBO Now \nThis 2003 dark comedy took everyone surprise for being … incredibly funny! Billy Bob Thornton plays an alcoholic con man whose favorite time for finding a mark is the holiday season. Playing a mall Santa affords him plenty of time to rip off nearby stores, but it’s his repulsion toward children that really endangers his enterprise. Bad Santa 2 is in theaters now!

Dimension/Courtesy Everett Collection \nWhite Christmas — Netflix \nThis Bing Crosby musical, costarring Rosemary Clooney (George’s aunt), is the perfect movie to put on while guests circulate at your Christmas soiree. While the titular song originally appeared in 1942 musical Holiday Inn (and earned an Oscar for Best Original Song), this 1954 film about two military entertainers (Crosby and Danny Kaye) and the ladies they fall for in Pine Tree, Vermont, offers a fresh rendition and some snappy non-holiday songs. PHOTOS: Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Cute Presents for Kids \nMiracle on 34th Street — HBO Now, Amazon Prime \nThis perennial favorite from 1947 (and its 1994 remake starring Mara Wilson , available on Netflix) centers on Kris Kringle’s employment as a Macy’s department store Santa Claus and the trial he stands in order to prove he’s the real deal. Natalie Wood and Edmund Gwenn in 'Miracle On 34th Street.' Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images \nGremlins — Amazon Prime \nDo the holidays change you from a soft, lovable human to a scaly beast who’s gorging on snacks past midnight? Perhaps the tale of the Mogwai will feel familiar. This 1984 horror comedy will make any Christmas present you give look infinitely better by comparison. PHOTOS: Holiday 2016's Must-Have Hair Accessory Is Golden (Literally) \nThe Muppet Christmas Carol — HBO Now \nCharles Dickens’ classic tale about Ebenezer Scrooge ( Michael Caine ) gets the loveliest retelling in this musical take costarring the felt and furry friends of Jim Henson. Macaulay Culkin in 'Home Alone.' Courtesy Everett Collection \nHome Alone — HBO Now \nAccidentally left on his own for Christmas, precocious 8-year-old Kevin McAllister ( Macaulay Culkin ) fights off two home-invading thieves ( Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern ) with an arsenal ingenious booby traps. The 1990 film written by John Hughes guarantees you’ll never doubt the usefulness of pet tarantulas again. \nLethal Weapon — Hulu \nNo one’s too old for this s--t. If you’re done with the heartfelt expressions of love and compassion in most holiday movies, try this 1987 action comedy about a pair of cops ( Danny Glover and Mel Gibson ) who butt heads with each other and the drug lords they’re tracking down, while Christmas looms in the Los Angeles backdrop.",

The streaming service has just announced the premiere date for Santa Clarita Diet, a new black comedy from veteran TV producer Victor Fresco. The series will premiere February 3, 2017, just a day after Groundhog Day, for those keeping track of marmot-related holidays. \nAnnounced back in March, Santa Clarita Diet stars Timothy Olyphant and Drew Barrymore as Joel and Sheila Hammond, a pair of “vaguely discontented” marrieds and parents in Santa Clarita, California. Their nagging though negligible dissatisfaction with life will be kicked off or perhaps resolved by the “dramatic change” that Sheila goes through, which will lead them on “a road of death and destruction.” We hope the show will eventually provide a food pyramid-like chart to let viewers know exactly how much death, destruction, and midlife crisis they should consume per day. In the meantime, here’s a set photo of Olyphant-as-Joel, who looks really surprised to see his wife near a park. Photo: Amy Rivera/Netflix",

      "text": "By jessica rawden 13 minutes ago \nNetflix has done a lot of work to build a lineup of original programs over the past couple of years. Those programs have included original dramas and comedies, as well as kids programs, stand-up specials and much, much more. Some of these have been pick-ups of already-popular shows, as well. While Netflix has done well with these pick-ups, there's at least one series that Netflix's Ted Sarandos really wishes the streaming service had been able to nab. It would have meant new episodes of a British classic would have gone to Netflix. The answer? The Great British Bake Off . Here's what Ted Sarandos had to say: \nI wish we'd had a shot at Bake Off . It moved very quickly, and we didn't. The show's very, very popular on Netflix, all over the place, so we would've definitely been interested. \nIf you've been keeping tabs on The Great British Bake Off , otherwise known as the The Great British Baking Show when it airs on PBS, you may know that the series has been in flux for quite some time. We learned a few months back that the production company that owns The Great British Bake Off was hoping to strike a deal that would earn them more money. Unfortunately the BBC, which formerly owned the rights to air the show, couldn't afford the new price. Thus, the series struck a new deal with Channel 4 , losing hosts Sue and Mel and judge Mary Berry in the process. \nThe show moving channels was a big mess at the time and is still being talked about, especially in the UK. I have no idea what the reaction would have been if the show had moved from traditional television to a streaming platform like Netflix. In an interview with the Telegraph , Ted Sarandos revealed that he would have made a play for it had it been an option, but it seems as if the series moving to streaming was never considered. \nThe Great British Bake Off has been extremely popular and will likely continue to be popular in the future. However, it will certainly look different when the new amalgamation hits the airwaves on Channel 4. While Paul Hollywood is staying, the show is getting a new host and likely at least one other judge. \nNetflix may have missed out on The Great British Bake Off , but the streaming service has been able to nab other shows, including the revitalized version of Gilmore Girls and the sequel to Full House , Fuller House . There's more coming down the pipeline in the future, and I wouldn't be shocked if that included a baking competition at some point. We'll keep you posted either way.

      "text": "We cannot wait for Drew Barrymore’s new Netflix series! We love basically everything Netflix has ever done, and when you add Drew Barrymore to a new Netflix series , we already know it’s going to be good. The comedy TV show will air solely on the streaming service, hopefully continuing the awesome run they’ve had with their original content. It’s also been a little while since we’ve seen Drew Barrymore in front of the camera (she’s been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work lately), but she is comedy gold and we’re excited!\nSanta Clarita Diet , starring Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, will hit Netflix on Friday, February 3rd and it sounds like a comedy we can absolutely get behind. Netflix This is what we know about the show so far: The story follows husband and wife, Joel (Olyphant) and Sheila (Barrymore), who are realtors living in the LA suburb of Santa Clarita. It’s hard to say if they’re really happy or not, and then a big dramatic change (yet to be revealed) comes through Sheila and well…their lives are changed forever.\nTheir life is turned upside down and “down a road of death and destruction…but in a good way,” Netflix said in a release. Netflix Both Barrymore and Olyphant serve as executive producers on the show and we’re counting down the days until we can binge on this Netflix original!\nThe post We cannot wait for Drew Barrymore’s new Netflix series! appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "MORE >> \nThe Gilmore Girls creator said that more episodes of the Netflix revival could be on the way. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life may have come and gone, but Amy Sherman-Palladino revealed that more episodes of the show are definitely a possibility. Especially after that bombshell ending that left viewers wanting so much more. \n“We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey,” said Sherman-Palladino to The Hollywood Reporter . “So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more — this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed and then whatever happens, happens.” 10 Photos » \nScott Patterson , who plays the lovable Luke Danes , also had a few things to say on the matter.”It’d be nice to do it every year. Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.” \nFor those of you that watched the revival, we can all agree that there is both closure and opportunity in the ending. However, who doesn’t want to see what Rory’s baby looks like.",

      "text": "Spoiler alert: Do not read if you haven’t watched “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” on Netflix. \nNetflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival (theoretically) had one major purpose: to provide closure to fans who wanted to see how creator Amy Sherman-Palladino envisioned the end of the series, given that she exited the original show before the final season in 2006.\nNow that we've watched the revival, which was released Friday, we only have one response to the idea of \"closure\": LOL. We have even more questions now - and not only because of that bombshell final scene.\n1) Why did Rory and Logan start that ridiculous affair?\nApparently at some point in the last 10 years, Logan forgave Rory for turning down his proposal before college graduation, and she forgave him for proposing in front of her entire family. Then they started a torrid affair, even though Logan is engaged to a French heiress named Odette, and Rory is dating a lame guy named Paul.\nRory and Logan always had great chemistry, but why would they adopt a \"when we're together, we're together, and when we're not, we're not\" policy? It didn't work when they tried to be \"no strings attached\" at Yale, and there's no way it would work while Logan is engaged and Rory has a boyfriend. And, honestly, they both acted a little too casual about the fact that they were cheating on their significant others.\n2) Who is the father of Rory's baby?\nWhen you end a show with a main character saying \"I'm pregnant,\" this is a pretty obvious question. So is the father Logan? Paul? The guy in the Wookiee costume? (Probably not, based on timing.) The audience will always wonder, which we suppose is the whole point of such a maddening ending.\n3) Why did Rory think her mother would be excited about the \"Gilmore Girls\" book?\nIn the midst of a career crisis, Rory decides to write a book based on her and Lorelai's unique life and relationship. Great idea, except Rory had to know that her mother would be upset by this plan. Why would Lorelai want her story, one filled with a lot of deeply personal situations (teenage pregnancy, estrangement from parents, etc.) on display for the whole world?\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \nNaturally, Lorelai refuses to give her blessing for the book. Rory is furious. She vents to her best friend, Lane, and is completely flummoxed by Lorelai's reaction. \"She totally freaked out over a book,\" Rory complains. \"She knows I'm a writer, she knows everything is fodder.\"\nDoes Rory actually believe that nonsense? It seemed out of character for her to not even consider Lorelai's perspective - which, by the way, is completely understandable.\n4) What's going to happen with the book?\nOf course, Lorelai ultimately (reluctantly) gives her blessing anyway, and jokes that she'll just sue Rory if she doesn't like the finished product. So is \"The Gilmore Girls\" going to become a best-seller? Oh, sorry, just \"Gilmore Girls\" - as Lorelai tells Rory, \"Drop the 'the.' It's cleaner.\" Maybe that \"Social Network\" reference means Rory is going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg.\n5) What will happen with Christopher?\nWe were wondering if Christopher, Rory's father and Lorelai's first love, would make an appearance. Then, all of a sudden, there he was, working at the family business, still extremely rich. He gets a brief scene as Rory pays him a visit, and asks him how he felt about Lorelai raising her alone. It sounds like research for her book, but she may also want advice about her own pregnancy situation.\nWe also find out Christopher stays far, far away from the about-to-be-happily-married Luke and Lorelai. Will he ever return to mess things up for Lorelai again?\n6) How will Emily do in Nantucket?\nRealizing she no longer wanted to live in her Hartford mansion without Richard, Emily packs everything up and moves to Nantucket, where she lives in a gorgeous house on the ocean and volunteers at a whaling museum. Nope, not the ending we would have predicted for the queen of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), but it was worth it to see her lose it and yell \"bull---!\" so many times during her last DAR meeting, finally sick of the society life.\n7) Will Paris and Doyle get back together?\nIt was a little heartbreaking that this dysfunctional yet weirdly perfect couple got a divorce, even though Doyle is now a screenwriter, in a nice nod to Danny Strong's actual career. Frankly, the way Paris and Doyle interact as a divorced couple (in front of Rory, who briefly steps in to babysit their kids) isn't too different from how they acted when they were together, so ... you never know.\n8) Will Lane and Zach ever get out of Stars Hollow?\nPoor Lane. Rory's best friend was once on the road to being a rock 'n' roll star. Now, she's still stuck in Stars Hollow working at her mom's antique store and looking after her rambunctious 9-year-old twins. Sure, she and her husband, Zach, still play in their band, but Zach is also stuck in a crushingly boring office job. Will they ever live their musical dreams on the road?\n9) What will happen to the Dragonfly Inn?\nThat quick scene with Melissa McCarthy, reprising her role as Lorelai's best friend, chef Sookie St. James, was a cruel tease in the fourth episode. She and Lauren Graham are hilarious together, so it's too bad that McCarthy's movie star schedule didn't leave her more time to come back for the revival.\nWill Sookie ever quit her fancy farm (?) gig and come back? Will Michel really take that job in New York? Either way, Lorelai is determined to expand the Dragonfly, even using money in her father's will (originally set aside for Luke to franchise his diner) to open a second location in town. Soon, maybe the Dragonfly will be the place Jennifer Lawrence stays when she comes to Stars Hollow.\n10) Are Rory and Jess destined to be together?\nHmmm. While Rory definitively ended up alone in the final episode, we saw Jess steal that longing glance at her right before Luke and Lorelai's wedding. He gave Rory the idea to write the \"Gilmore Girls\" book, so it's likely he'll be back in the picture.\nRELATED STORIES: \nRory Gilmore's long road to ... nowhere \n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring \nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy \n'Gilmore Girls': 7 must-watch episodes of the original series \n \n \nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\n \nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant Lauren Graham",

      "text": "205 Pop Culture References in \"Gilmore Girls\" Lauren Hoffman Photo credit: Netflix / Getty More Pop culture references are a hallmark of Gilmore Girls dialogue, and the revival was chock full of them, ranging from modern to classic to sometimes completely random examples. Here, 208 for your perusal. How many did we miss? When Rory takes over editorial duties of the Stars Hollow Gazette , she commissions a film review from Doyle. He sends back 20,000 words, 5,000 of which are adjectives. When she tries to tell him this won't work, Doyle shoots back that he's been working with director Michael Bay , and Michael LOVES adjectives. In the last moments of the final episode, Rory's childhood crushes are revealed to be Pee-Wee Herman , Edward Scissorhands , and Law & Order 's Jerry Orbach . Lorelai struggles throughout the series to come up with a sweet, touching memory of her father. Finally, she remembers a terrible day in her adolescence on which her dad cheered her up by taking her to see first Grease , and then An Unmarried Woman - a movie for each of them, by his logic. Kirk's short film about the death of his pig is bizarre on every level, but it's made even stranger by the fact that it's underscored by the orchestral theme from the classic tearjerker Terms of Endearment . As a part of her grieving process, Emily discovers Marie Kondo and The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up . This means that, among other things, Emily discards a ball gown, a bunch of Rory's stored boxes, and her dining room chairs, because they don't \"spark joy\" in her. When we first meet Paris again, she's in the middle of firing and browbeating a young woman who's a recent Smith graduate. In the process of laying her off, Paris taunts her for wasting two full semesters studying Buffy, the Vampire Slayer . Luke asks Lorelai what she's doing one night before bed, and she informs him that she's arranging her magazines by Kardashian . In her grief, Emily accidentally commissions a portrait of Richard that reaches from floor to ceiling in her living room. It's so formidable that Lorelei likens it to Gandalf from Lord of the Rings saying, \"You shall not pass!\" Moping over the Dragonfly's failure to attract a-list guests, Lorelai complains to Rory, \"Why can't we bag Jennifer Lawrence ?\" When picking bridesmaid dress themes, Lorelai offers Rory two choices: cult camp film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or D esnudas , body-painted street performers. After Luke's list of wedding guests looks a little paltry, Lorelai tries to get him to name someone - anyone at all - to add to it. In this exchange, it comes out that Luke is buddies with Kiefer Sutherland . Yes, that Kiefer Sutherland. 24 jokes abound. (They met at baseball camp.) During the writing of the Stars Hollow musical, Taylor claims he studied under Edward Albee , who wrote Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? In this case studied = left a script on his table at a restaurant once, but STILL. When Emily reveals she has a new boyfriend (kind of) who is just as rich as she is, Lorelai twice quotes Kanye West's \"Gold Digger.\" After Logan takes her on a debaucherous night around the countryside of New England, accompanied by some of their wildest college friends, Rory thanks him for taking her on her own private Mr. Toad's Wild Ride , from The Wind in the Willows (and, more important, from Disneyland). Lorelai insists that the fictional diner owner in A History of Violence is so similar to Luke that director David Cronenberg must have based him on Luke himself. There's a running gag in which the lead of the town musical (Sutton Foster!) played the character of Kinky Boots in the musical Kinky Boots . The joke is that that's what the musical is called, but there's no character of that name. (It is a VERY EXTENDED joke.) Among the personal effects at Richard's grave are a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and a Chuck Berry album. When Taylor announces he's planning a gay pride parade for Stars Hollow, his rationale for doing so in 2016 is that it coincides with the anniversary of a seminal Liza Minelli album. At dinner with April, Lorelai quotes a Woody Allen joke from Annie Hall : “I was thrown out of college for cheating on the metaphysics exam; I looked into the soul of the boy sitting next to me.” Lorelai only has one piece of advice for Rory about her manuscript about her lives, which she's titled The Gilmore Girls . \"Drop the 'the.'\" This seems like a direct reference to Sean Parker telling Zuckerberg to drop \"the\" from Facebook in The Social Network . Lorelai reads Wild , which leads her to buy a backpack and hiking boots and follow in Cheryl Strayed's footsteps. At the trailhead, there's a running joke about whether the scores of women there are \"book people\" or \"movie people,\" depending on whether the memoir or its adaptation inspired them. While trying to get Rory interested in the idea of screenwriting, Doyle sends her DVDs of the Debra Messing series The Mysteries of Laura . Jess comes to visit Rory at her newspaper office, and she pulls a bottle of scotch out of the desk and pours him a drink for \"lunch.\" He compares her to Lou Grant , the gruff newsroom boss from The Mary Tyler Moore Show . After Rory gets off a plane, Lorelai thinks she looks entirely too fresh-faced, and should look more like she should \"be singing 'I Dreamed a Dream' with a bad haircut ,\" a nod to Anne Hathaway's Les Misérables performance. While trying to get the Stars Hollow Gazette 's ancient computer system to work, Rory notes that she should've paid closer attention to Halt and Catch Fire , the AMC series about the history of personal computers.

      "text": "Netflix Looks Ripe for Downside Play By Timothy Collins | Nov 28, 2016 | 10:37 AM EST \nOne name I don't see as a huge benefactor from the holidays is Netflix (NFLX) . While it may be on a few wish lists, I doubt it is something in high demand. I view Netflix more as a lifestyle change or rebellion move against cable, not so much as a gift. The stock saw a huge lift from earnings, but we've begun to wane, and a break of $115 should accelerate a move lower by $5 to $10. Factor in the short-term overbought market conditions and I'm looking at a downside play here. \nThe weekly chart is still bullish in terms of price. Again, it's that $115 support level; however, there are cracks in the foundation. We have a bearish crossover in the Full Stochastics as well as the Chaikan Oscillator. This double-cross, especially after the Full Stochastics were recently over 80, has been fairly bearish. At worst, it should hinder further upside moves. My approach here is long the December 16 $115-110 put spread for $1.54....147  ",

      "text": "Netflix December 2016: What's coming and going Get ready for seconds of Bob Ross and Chill. And lots more stuff. It's all good. By Scott T. Smith | Updated Nov. 28, 2016 at 1:13 PM Comments 1 of 2 \nSure, you've got mashed 'taters for Thanksgiving, and probably for a few days after. But if you want some of them French-fried 'taters a la Sling Blade on the Netflix, you're running out of time. MMMM- hmmm . \nThat movie, featuring a mentally challenged adult man fascinatingly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton , has an impressive 96 percent \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Your writer highly recommends it, but stream it before it vanishes at the end of November. Bonus: See if you can find the original short, called Some Call It a Sling Blade featuring Thornton with J.T. Walsh and Molly Ringwald , who did not appear in the full-length feature. Thornton wrote the short, and the full-length adapted screenplay that the short pitched to Hollywood. He took home an Oscar for his writing and a nomination for his acting. \nAs Karl might say: \"Aight, den\" ... on to a couple more highlights from December's comings and goings in Netflix's video treasure trove (full list below): \nLove Kevin Spacey ? You'll cringe with his character in American Beauty ( 88 percent Fresh ) but hurry because it's gone Dec. 1. If you're into extreme sports, athletes who take incredible risks and/or need a good cry before the end of the month, might we suggest McConkey , a critically acclaimed documentary on extreme sports pioneer Shane McConkey. Try to figure out who's on top in \"Top Gun\" before it runs out of fuel on Dec. 1. \nWith the family all home to argue about the election, you might consider The In-Laws a good distraction from the inevitable. Think again . This isn't the 1979 version starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin . There's never enough Falk and Arkin – ever. The remake does have Albert Brooks, so there's that. After Dec. 1, you won't have to worry about it any more – on Netflix, anyway. \nIf you just KNOW the government is hiding something really big via coded messages known only to the Illuminati, you have until Dec. 14 to find out – that's when The Da Vinci Code disappears like so much invisible continental congressional ink. \nDon't fret the losses ... a lot of cool new stuff is being added starting Dec. 1, including TOGA!!!! – National Lampoon's Animal House . And you'll be able to Netflix and Chill with Bob Ross to a greater degree than ever before ... featuring a collection of the big-haired painter's best, plus more than a few happy little trees starting bright and early Dec. 1. \nA slew of Netflix Originals are being added as well in December. Top of that list to watch with your Facebook-fake-news-sharing uncle is Barry , a biopic about Barack Obama that arrives on Dec. 16. Perhaps not. Possible alternatives from the newly arriving list include The Way of the Dragon , the awesome 1972 kung fu flick that features Bruce Lee denuding Chuck Norris ' chest of hair before dispatching him ... or perhaps Hitler: A Career ? Both arrive on Dec. 1. There's always America's biggest patriot beating up bad dudes in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War – arriving as a big present from Netflix on Christmas Day. Maybe just put your uncle on a filter and play it safe with My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic: Season 6 , arriving Dec. 20. \nHere's the full rundown: Departing Netflix in December 2016 \nDecember 1",

Share Save \nWhite Rabbit Project isn't an official continuation of the Mythbusters franchise, but it's pretty darn close. The show stars former Mythbusters members Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara, and it's set to premiere on Netflix on December 9th. This time around, Byron, Belleci and Imahara aren't just investigating strange scientific phenomena or seemingly impossible movie scenes; they're ranking history's weirdest inventions, heists and happenings, and seeing how science makes them possible. \nIn its first trailer, White Rabbit Project shows off a few familiar Mythbusters tropes, including explosions, wacky robotics, big guns and mild torture in the name of science. There's everything from training pigeons to robot jousting, and even an attempt to eat a fancy meal with electrodes intermittently zapping the hosts' muscles. \nWe first heard about White Rabbit Project in September. All episodes of the show will hit Netflix at once on December 9th.",

The family’s already tenuous bonds are tested when secrets from Grace’s past resurface, causing a restless night to go terribly awry as the brothers are thrust into a fight for their own survival. ”\nTom Lipinski (“The Knick”), Michael Godere (“The Affair”) and Dan Ziskie (“House of Cards”) also star in the film, which is produced by XYZ Films’ Kyle Franke and Nick Spicer and Uncorked Productions’ Andrew D. Corkin along with Robyn Bennett. \n\n",
