      "text": " Share Share on Facebook + Comments \nOne of the best developments of this season are these two guys . When it comes time to make moves for playoffs, these two should net us something tangible. Lakers could hopefully gain a 1st Rd pick in what is supposed to be one of the deepest drafts in memory. I NEVER thought I'd say this, but if they keep one of them, I hope it's Young. He's been playing both ways, and these young guys seem to respect him. I would of swore he would never be this type of player, much less this type of person. More from Silver Screen and Roll",

      "text": "Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Blog \nUNIVERSITY PARK , Pa . - After dropping its season opener at Drexel on Friday night, the Penn State women's basketball program will open the home portion of the 2016-17 slate with a contest against Saint Peter's on Sunday, Nov. 13. The Lady Lions and Peacocks will tip at 1 p.m. inside the Bryce Jordan Center. \nFollow Along Fans can follow along with the game on Twitter (@PennStateWBB), or via live stats, live video or live audio with the links to the right. \nSeries History \nThis sit he first meeting between Penn State and Saint Peter's in women's basketball. \nScouting Saint Peter’s \nSaint Peter’s returns its top two scorers from a 2015-16 team that finished 4-26 overall. Sajanna Bathea averaged 12.1 points and Talah Hughes logged 9.4 points in 30 appearances for each player. Saint Peter’s was out-scored by an average of 11.4 points per game in 2015-16, but the Peacocks held their own on the boards with a slim disadvantage in rebounding margin (37.3-37.7). Junior Sajanna Bethea was named Preseason All-Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Second Team. It is the second straight season Bethea earned a spot on the Preseason All-MAAC Second Team, after earning All-MAAC Third Team last season Bethea led the team in scoring (12.1 ppg) and rebounding (7.1 rpg). She posted four double-doubles and registered 18 double-figure scoring games and seven double-digit rebounding games. \nLast Time Out – at Drexel 83, Penn State 60 (Nov. 11, 2016) \nSenior Sierra Moore played in her first game in 617 days. She played her final game of the 2014-15 season on March 4, 2015 and missed all of 2015-16 due to injury (knee). Moore tied for team high with 15 points, the 23rd double-figure scoring game of her career. In 32 minutes, Moore connected on 7-of-8 shots from the field, grabbed four rebounds and added two assists. Also logging 15 points for Penn State was sophomore Teniya Page . Page added a game-high seven rebounds Playing 39 minutes in the game, Page logged her 19th game of at least 38 minutes in 32 career games. Redshirt-freshman Amari Carter tallied two points, four rebounds and four assists. True freshman Jaida Travascio-Green scored her first career points, hitting a pair of 3-pointers in the game to account for six points. True freshman Siyeh Frazier also saw her first collegiate action, playing three minutes. Drexel’s Jessica Pellechio tied a Penn State opponent record with eight made 3-pointers. \nNeeding 1 for 900 \nIn its 53rd season playing women’s basketball, Penn State owns an 899-438 overall record. Penn State is looking to become the 16th program in NCAA Division I history to reach the 900-win mark, including the third Big Ten school. \nBack at the BJC \nPenn State is 44-8 in season openers since earning its first win, 39-33, over Bloomsburg on Feb. 4, 1965 inside White Building on the University Park campus. The Bryce Jordan Center opened midway through the 1996 season, so since playing their first home opener in the building in 1997, the Lady Lions are 17-3 in the first game at the BJC. \nMoore’s Is Better \nSierra Moore missed the entire 2015-16 season due to injury, meaning her last on-court appearance came on March 3, 2015 in the Big Ten Tournament. Her absence spanned 617 days and she returned on Friday, Nov. 11 at Drexel. Moore tied for the team lead with 15 points, connecting on 7-of-8 shots from the floor and 1-of-2 attempts from the free throw line. She added four rebounds and two assists in 32 minutes on the floor. \nOpening on the Road \nPenn State opened a season on the road for the first time since the 2010-11 season (at Dayton) with an 83-60 loss at Drexel on Friday, Nov. 11. Since 2006-07, Penn State has now opened on the road four times; at Dayton (2010-11) and at Drexel (2016-17, 2009-10 and 2006-07). Starting its 53rd season on the road, Penn State has opened with a true road game on 18 occasions. The Lady Lions are 11-7 in those contests, with the season-opening loss to the Dragons snapping a three-game winning streak. \nBooks & Basketball \nSenior guard Sierra Moore walked across the stage at the Bryce Jordan Center last April as a member of The Pennsylvania State University’s graduating class of 2016. The Hanover, Pa., native accepted her diploma, a B.A. in broadcast & journalism, and is now working on a mater’s degree in human resources & employment relations. Moore missed the 2015-16 season due to injury (knee), after averaging 12.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 2014-15. The trio of Kaliyah Mitchell , Lindsey Spann and Peyton Whitted all excelled on the court and in the classroom during the 2015-16 campaign, earning Academic All-Big Ten honors. Along with her academic honor, Spann was an honorable mention All-Big Ten performer, as well. Mitchell and Whitted were also members of the Dean’s List following the 2016 spring semester. \n500 Club \nMore exclusive than Penn State’s 1,000-point club, the 500-rebound group currently has just 32 members. However, one of those is senior Kaliyah Mitchell and fellow fourth-year player Peyton Whitted is knocking on the door. Mitchell secured her 500th rebound in the opening game of the 2016 Big Ten Tournament vs. Illinois and enters today with 513 career boards. With just 51 rebounds, Mitchell can move into the No. 25 slot, currently held by Kelly Mazzante (2001-04), who nabbed 563 career rebounds. For Whitted, she is just 31 rebounds shy of becoming the 33rd member of the club, thanks for a 256-rebound season in 2015-16. \nPage Putting In Work \nTeniya Page produced eight games of at least 40 minutes last season and with her 39 minutes played at Drexel in the season opener, now has 19 games with more than 38 minutes played in 32 career games. Page has not fouled out of a game in her career, reaching four fouls in only eight games. Perspective: Page’s 19 games of at least 38 minutes were more than the rest of the team combined from 2015-16. Only four other players (12 times) played at least 38 minutes in a game. \nSpann Solid From The Stripe \nJunior Lindsey Spann has moved her named into the discussion as one of the top free throw shooters in school history. Spann has made 118-of-150 shots from charity stripe in her career to rank No. 14 on the career free throw percentage list at .786. Her .877 free throw percentage (57-of-65) in 2015-16 ranks tied for No. 8 on the single season charts with Jess Strom’s 71-of-81 effort in 2002-03. \nLong Range Lindsey \nIn just 61 career games, Lindsey Spann has ascended into the upper echelon of the single season and career charts for three-point shooting at Penn State. Her 102 makes from three-point range make her just the 14th player in Penn State history to hit the century mark from distance. She is currently 12 shy of passing Lynn Dougherty (113, 1989-92) for 13th on the career list. Her 65 makes from long range in 2015-16 sit tied with Kelly Mazzante (2000-01) for No. 11 on the single season charts. Spann’s seven three-pointers at Minnesota were the most in a single game in 2015-16 for Penn State and sit tied for No. 4 on the Lady Lion single game charts. She connected on at least two three-pointers in six straight games from Jan. 10 - Jan. 27, before going 0-for-3 against Purdue (1/30). \nVersus the MAAC \nPenn State owns a 12-0 against the current alignment of the Metro Atlantic Athletics Conference. Penn State has already faced six of the 11 schools in the conference, with Saint Peter’s and Iona on the schedule for the first time in program history in 2016-17. \nTeam - Record",

Jeff Seidel , Detroit Free Press Columnist 3:19 a.m. EST November 13, 2016 x Share Free Press sports writers Mark Snyder, Jeff Seidel break down what happened in U-M's 14-13 loss to Iowa Saturday in Iowa City, Iowa. Video by Mark Snyder/DFP Michigan's Mike McCray is called for a face mask on Iowa's Desmond King during the second half of U-M's 14-13 loss Saturday in Iowa City, Iowa. (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) \nHow will Michigan respond to this loss? \nThe truth is, we don’t know how the Wolverines will respond to this stunning, 14-13 loss against Iowa . \nAfter the game, all of the players said the right things. \nThey said they will bounce back. They talked about resilience and toughness and focus. But that’s exactly what this team was missing in this game. \nThe truth is, they couldn’t make the plays when it mattered the most. \nThey couldn’t hit the deep ball like they had done in the past. \nThey couldn’t stop the run when it mattered the most. \nThey couldn’t get a first down when it mattered the most. \nNow, consider the setting. \nMichigan was playing on national TV, on the road, under the lights, in a hostile environment. This was a huge test for the Wolverines. \nAnd Michigan failed. \nThink about what happened in the third quarter, after Michigan had fallen behind, 11-10. Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Are You Tired? Me, too. One of my friends on Facebook recently posted this: “I have a ton of friends who voted the opposite of me. Respect and love them, because they are some of the best and most wonderful people I know.. BUT, am kind of tired of those who post that Trump voters must be evil, anti-woman, homophobic, and racist” Oh, are you tired of the days, maybe months, of being held accountable for your support and what it means? Let me ask you this: Do you think woman and minorities are tired of anything? Maybe the systematic racism that stonewalls them at so many turns? Maybe the way that our culture objectifies them as things to look at but not listen to? Or maybe, just maybe, they are tired at how their supposed “white friends” keep claiming they aren’t racist or misogynistic, but then they perform their part in a societal machine that stops woman from equal treatment and minorities from feeling like all people are created equal. I bet they are tired, too. Make no mistake, electing this candidate has empowered the white nationalist movement. The number of hate acts and crimes in the wake of the results has been mind numbing. Here, why don’t you [look at a few]( https://twitter.com/i/moments/796417517157830656 ). Sure, I bet some of those are fabricated, but not all of them. If even 10% of what is on that page is true, and I believe it is a far higher percentage, then this is what your candidate has inspired. He has made villains feel safe and unchecked. I bet minorities are tired of being afraid. I bet they are tired of feeling like their country, one that is supposedly founded on equality for all, took a giant step back. And just when it was starting to feel like we were getting closer to the finish line. You know what I am most tired of? It has to do with my daughters. I am so, so tired of having to explain why the world seems to want to hold them back. I am tired of trying to make sense out of the acts of a nation that seems to find them inconsequential, unless they are pretty. And, in the days since the election, I am tired of remembering the message that this nation just sent to my girls and all girls in America, which is: * A much less qualified man will beat you, every time.* No matter how much you do, at the end of the day you are less than man.* It is OK to bully people.* It is OK to lie.* It is OK to disrespect entire groups in our society.* It is OK to cheat on your wife, but not OK for the wife to forgive you for it. I want you to find a girl in your life, maybe your daughter or a friend’s daughter. I want you to sit down with her and read those bullet points to her. Do it, and you might begin to understand why I can’t “get over it” and “come together” with a candidate and movement that built their victory on tearing us all apart. I’d love to say I am sorry that you feel tired and slighted for your support of your candidate. But, alas, I cannot. Not yet. Your mild discomfort due to your own actions is less important than my daughters’ right to feel valuable, hopeful, equal.",

      "text": "Jackie took to social nedia to express his joy. He posted this picture on Facebook, captioning it : So honored and happy and lost for words! (Pic courtesy: Facebook/ Jackie Chan). Mumbai: When Jackie Chan saw an Oscar at Sylvester Stallone's house 23 years ago, he said that was the moment he decided he wanted one.\nOn Saturday at the annual Governors Awards, the Chinese actor and martial arts star finally received his little gold statuette, an honorary Oscar for his decades of work in film.\n\"After 56 years in the film industry, making more than 200 films, after so many bones, finally,\" Chan, 62, quipped at the star-studded gala dinner while holding his Oscar.\nThe actor recalled watching the ceremony with his parents and his father always asking him why he didn't have Hollywood's top accolade despite having made so many movies.\nHe praised his hometown Hong Kong for making him ‘proud to be Chinese’ and thanked his fans, saying they were the reason ‘I continue to make movies, jumping through windows, kicking and punching, breaking my bones.’\nThe actor was introduced by his ‘Rush Hour’ co-star Chris Tucker, actress Michelle Yeoh and Tom Hanks, who referred to him as ‘Jackie 'Chantastic' Chan.’\nHanks said it was especially gratifying to be able to acknowledge Chan's work because martial arts and action comedy films were two genres often overlooked during awards season.\nThe Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, hosts of the annual ceremony, also bestowed honorary Oscars on British film editor Anne V. Coates, casting director Lynn Stalmaster and prolific documentarian Frederick Wiseman.\nThe evening was attended by Hollywood's elite, including Denzel Washington, Lupita Nyong'o, Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Amy Adams and Dev Patel.\nStalmaster, 88, credited with securing career-defining roles for actors such as Jeff Bridges, Andy Garcia, Christopher Reeve and John Travolta, is the first casting director to receive an Oscar.\nCoates, 90, who won the film editing Oscar for 1962's ‘Lawrence of Arabia’ and has edited more than 50 films, said she shared her honorary Oscar ‘with all the unsung heroes’ of filmmaking.\nWiseman, 86, whose documentaries include 1970's ‘Hospital’, 1987's ‘Blind’ and last year's ‘In Jackson Heights’, said: \"I think it's as important to document kindness, ability and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference,\" he said.",

      "text": "Home > Social Media > Facebook is testing a public group messaging… Facebook is testing a public group messaging service for those who still use chat rooms November 13, 2016 8:10 AM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThese days, your news feed is getting a bit stale. Same people, same old arguments about the election, complaints about work on Mondays, and celebrations from last night’s big game. \nFacebook knows this, so it has been experimenting with social expansion by kicking it back to the days of AIM chat rooms. Cue the nostalgia, as the company is rolling out a new feature called “Rooms” as part of Facebook Messenger — the addition is meant to encourage public conversations about topics and interests. \nWhile this probably just means that digital mobs of people wielding pitchforks will expand outward into the public sphere, Facebook is only rolling the feature out in select markets. It had previously experimented with the feature using a standalone app called Rooms, but that failed to catch on. This Messenger addition utilizes learnings from the earlier experiment, TechCrunch reported. \nRelated: Facebook sets wireless world record, transmits data at 20 GBPS over 13.2 kilometers \nEvery “Room” can focus on specific topics and can include both people friends and strangers, offering a separation from group chats, which usually include family and friends exclusively. \nThe feature is launching first in Australia and Canada to serve as a test market before the U.S. and international users get to use Rooms. Users will be able to set their Rooms as private and accept new additions after administrator approval. \nThe use-cases for the feature are far-reaching, as TechCrunch pointed out. \n“This could work well as an add-on for things like larger Facebook groups, where not all the members are also Facebook friends. (Or have even met in real life) … But it could also help connect people around subjects they want to discuss via messaging, instead of the more formal structure of a Facebook group.” \nThe Rooms feature could also come in handy for organizing events or sending out alerts, which certainly would have served political protesters well this past week in organizing post-election rallies across the country.

This team means the world to me. It is the biggest parasocial relationship I have. Sadly, I could not remember every single game. My first real season and experience came in 2008. Ever since that, us Chiefs fans have been used to losing, used to throwing away leads, and used to being blown out. But now, the Chiefs are the comeback kids. They are the ones that hold the lead. They are winners. We have the play-makers we need. Finally, us fans get what we deserve. After seeing what KC did to the Panthers today, without Justin Houston, Allen Bailey, Jaye Howard, and Jeremy Maclin, I have so much hope that I expect a win every weekend. We are finally in a happy place after these last 4 seasons. At 7-2, we have a long way to go still, but this IS the year. Forever and always, Chiefs Kingdom. -SageCat This is a FanPost and does not necessarily reflect the views of Arrowhead Pride's writers or editors. It does reflect the views of this particular fan though, which is as important as the views of Arrowhead Pride writers or editors. More from Arrowhead Pride",

      "text": "Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nMonty Python is famous for mixing silly and smart to make something masterful. The silliest bits— Ministry of Silly Walks , anyone?—played on broad physical comedy. At the same time, the troupe indulged its nerdy side with sketches featuring complex wordplay. These are my true favorites. \nBelow, enjoy four brilliant examples of Monty Python playing with language. Please post your favorites in the comments! THE MAN WHO SAYS THINGS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY \nThis sketch starts with a very straightforward premise, then goes utterly off the rails as a series of men appear who speak only the beginnings, middles, or ends of words. Delightful. (Note: there's a transcript in two parts that may help you follow along.) THE MAN WHO SPEAKS IN ANAGRAMS \nAnd then there's this delightful bit , which is exactly what it says on the tin.

      "text": "Home » News » United States News » Facebook, Twitter helped me win: Trump Facebook, Twitter helped me win: Trump 3 hours ago 14-11-2016 IANS NK US , New York, Nov 14 : Soon after critics blamed social media giant Facebook for influencing the US-elections in favour of President-elect Donald Trump by circulating a \"host of fake news stories about political topics\", Trump has now said the platform helped him secure victory. Facebook has been denying its role in making Trump the 45th President of the US but that position is harder to maintain as Trump said on CBS' 60 Minutes programme on Sunday: \"The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.\" \"I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent,\" The Verge quoted Trump as saying. According to the report, social media privileges were taken away from the President-elect just prior to the election -- before being restored a short time later -- but regular tweeter Trump seems very aware of his follower numbers on networks like Twitter and Facebook. Trump specified that he has more than 28 million followers across various social media platforms, and said that he was getting more each day. \"Twitter, Facebook, and the like are great form[s] of communication. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story,\" Trump said. Trump also said that despite the power he has now, he would limit the use of social networks. Recently, critics said that hoaxes and misinformation were showing up frequently in Facebook's \"Trending Topics\" section and that fake news was also a problem in the main News Feed. sku/na/sac",

      "text": "If you thought political discussions, for one timely example, on regular Facebook walls were often fast and furious, wait until these conversations are moved to chat. Facebook is in the process of enabling groups of people, and not necessarily \"friends\" who know each other, to interact around specific topics in real time on the social network. The app is called Rooms, same as a standalone app it attempted two years ago but then pulled back right after it bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in February 2014 . If you thought political discussions, for one timely example, on regular Facebook walls were often fast and furious, wait until these conversations are moved to chat, where participants can post their comments all together immediately and in one window without dealing with various threads. Users in the United States will have to wait for a while to be able to use it. The launch, which Facebook has discussed publicly earlier this year, was rolled out Nov. 11 through 13 in Canada and Australia. It is apparently a test to see if Facebook's Messenger chat platform is able to both scale and enable more public conversations focused on specific topics.Facebook's first Rooms app was rescinded in October 2014 due to the closure of the company's internal R1D division, Creative Labs. The new Rooms represents a complete refresh as a side feature of its popular Messaging app.In all accounts, Rooms enables administrators (those who create the Room) to approve the admission of new guests in the message feed. Admins also will have the ability to excise users if need be. Information on when other markets will get the new feature was not available Nov. 14. \nChris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK. Twitter: @editingwhiz .

(Photo: Julio Cortez, Associated Press) \nSAN FRANCISCO — President-elect Donald Trump credited social media for landing him in the Oval Office but pledged to be \"very restrained\" on Twitter and Facebook during his presidency. \nTrump, who estimates that 28 million people follow him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, touted social media during a 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl on Sunday night, saying social media was a key factor in defeating Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. \n\"I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent,\" Trump said. \nAsked whether he would continue to use Twitter as president, Trump, who has more than 14 million Twitter followers, said: \"I'm going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to be very restrained.\" \nBut, Trump said, he will not give it up entirely because it helps him counter falsehoods propagated by traditional media. \n\"When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another — a network, or whatever, because of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back.\" 'Massive rise' in hate speech on Twitter during presidential election \nTrump's use of Twitter ignited several controversies during the presidential campaign. His aides took away Trump's account in the days before the general election. \nOn Thursday, after protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against election, Trump complained that the protests were unfair and organized by \"professional\" agitators \"incited by the media.\" \nBarack Obama was the first U.S. president to tweet. His style has been more reserved than Trump's during the presidential campaign. Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' \nFacebook is taking steps to eliminate fake news and hoaxes that some critics have suggested might have influenced the 2016 presidential election, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Saturday. \nWhile reiterating earlier comments in which he said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that phony stories posted on Facebook changed the election outcome, Zuckerberg said work has already begun that would enable the social media giant's users \"to flag fake news and hoaxes.\" \n\"Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a personal Facebook statement posted Saturday night. \nZuckerberg provided no specifics about how Facebook's News Feed might be changed, cautioning that \"this work often takes longer than we'd like in order to confirm changes we make won't introduce unintended side effects or bias into the system.\" He encouraged Facebook's 1.79 billion worldwide users to follow updates online .

The check came from the post’s Children with Cancer Fund established by Kenneth Cole. \nFoundation grant helps purchase shoes, backpacks \nThe Susie Reizod Foundation received a grant of $2,500 grant from People’s United Community Foundation, a branch of People’s United Bank. The funds will be used to purchase new backpacks and shoes for school-aged children from low income families living in Poughkeepsie. \nThrough People’s United Community Foundation’s Youth Development initiative, the grant allows The Susie Reizod Foundation to focus its efforts on the needs of children and youth in Poughkeepsie. \nPeople’s United Community Foundation supports programs designed to promote affordable housing, youth development, and community development. Special emphasis is directed toward programs and services designed to advance economic self-sufficiency, education, and improved quality of life for low-income individuals and families, at-risk children and youth and individuals with special needs. \nThe Susie Reizod Foundation is a not-for-profit organization. Since April 2002, when the organization received 501c3 tax exemption status, it has served children in need in the United States and as well as in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.

      "text": "Discuss: ! \nThe owner of a new downtown coffee shop, facing threats of a boycott over his hate-filled racist and sexist rants on Facebook, apologized Sunday, calling his comments “the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.” \n“I completely apologize,” Larry Heafner said. “It was the dumbest thing I ever did. … I’m not going to sit and try to excuse my derogatory or negative comments, because it was ridiculous. I do want to say, I’m not racist by no means, and I’m not a woman hater.” \nHeafner is the majority owner of the Coffee Tavern at 2828 Second Ave. N., which was supposed to open this week. In light of the rapidly growing controversy over his Facebook posts, he said, the opening date has been indefinitely postponed. \nThe whole thing started on Friday, when Billings resident Josh Schleining, reacting to the election of Donald Trump, posted a montage of Facebook posts, some from people in Billings, about being the target of racist comments or actions. \nIn the midst of those remarks, Schleining also posted a comment from Heafner’s Facebook page, based on a screenshot a friend sent to Schleining. In it, in reference to a video of a white man being beaten by a group of black people, Heafner said, “These fucking monkeys would be hanging if I saw this shit!” \nThis is the original story that I saw: https://www.rawstory.com/2016/11/trump-loving-coffee-shop-owner-insists-he-is-not-racist-after-threatening-to-hang-black-monkeys/ \nThere is slightly different content depending on the local publication that one reads. Interesting. \nI also read one (and now can't find it) that showed screenshots, including a meme wondering if he can start grabbing women by the pussies now or if he has to wait for inauguration. \nkeyboard shortcuts: V vote up article J next comment K previous comment In these nations:",

      "title": "Are Facebook and Google really taking all the digital ad growth?",
      "text": "Turn on tldr \nAlthough it’s clear that most digital ad spend flows through Facebook or Google, it’s unclear how much of that money ends up in the pockets of other players. \nRecently, a few researchers have claimed that Google and Facebook are taking all of the upside in the digital ad industry’s growth, while the rest is actually shrinking. But it’s important to note that these researchers use different methodologies, which to one degree or another, favor large public companies and underestimate the long tail. Another issue is that most of these researchers only track where money starts and not where it ends up. Put simply, lots of money going to Google, and to a lesser extent Facebook, ends up in the pockets of publishers. \nIn this edition of “Internet Mysteries,” we examine whether Google and Facebook really are devouring all the digital ad growth. Advertisement \nDiffering measures The election has proven that data can be flawed. Because good data isn’t always available and there is not a clear-cut universal industry standard for tracking digital ad growth, researchers fill in the holes the best they can. With researchers having to piece together their own methodology, differing statistics come out of the analyses. \nBrian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, calculated that Facebook and Google took 74.6 percent of the digital ad growth in the U.S. in 2015, and about 98 percent of the growth in the first half of 2016. Digital Content Next also found that Google and Facebook were sucking up all the ad growth in the U.S. DCN claims that aside from Google and Facebook, the rest of the industry actually shrank, on average, during the first half of 2016. \nWieser said that Pivotal’s global figures were similar to their U.S. figures. Zenith Media didn’t have statistics to share for 2016, but a Zenith spokesperson said that their numbers show Facebook and Google accounted for 81 percent of worldwide digital ad growth in 2015. Like DCN’s U.S. numbers, Magna Global’s worldwide numbers show Facebook and Google taking all the digital ad growth during the first half of 2016, while the rest of the industry, on average, shrank a few percentage points. Magna also reports that in 2016, Facebook and Google commanded 64 percent of the worldwide digital ad market combined. \nLong-tail problems One reason these numbers differ is because they rely on different surveys to gauge the size of the digital ad market. Many researchers base their overall ad spend estimates off Interactive Advertising Bureau surveys. Although IAB surveys, undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers, are widely recognized within the advertising industry, they, like all surveys, cannot capture every company operating on the internet. (See voter surveys that had Hillary Clinton winning by a wide margin in Ohio.) \nAs mentioned in its most recent survey , PwC “applies a conservative revenue estimate based on available public sources” for companies that don’t participate. These “conservative” estimates have been a part of their methodology for more than 15 years . While cautious analysis prevents statistics from being inflated, it also skews results toward what’s publicly available. PwC declined an interview request, although a spokesperson confirmed that PwC surveys sellers and not buyers. \n“The long tail is indeed very long, and there are still a ton of smaller growth pools that are likely not seen or tracked in context,” said James Douglas, executive director of social media at Mediabrands Society. A researcher added, “It’s easy to capture Facebook and Google; they report their revenue, so they can’t miss those. But the market is probably bigger than IAB reports, which may mitigate the results.” \nAfter all, there are plenty of digital media companies growing significantly. It’s hard to square that growth with the doom and gloom often bandied about. \nDistinguishing between gross and net revenue Another important caveat is the distinction between gross and net revenue. Research that shows Facebook and Google receive all the digital ad growth is examining gross revenue, which means it’s only tracking how money flowed through the channels. \nTracking gross revenue is relevant, even if it doesn’t tell you where the money winds up. Google and Facebook receiving all the gross revenue growth indicates that publishers are losing direct relationships with buyers, Wieser said. Even if publishers indirectly receive a portion of the spend flowing through Facebook and Google, they lose control over the deal terms as more spend is directed through the platforms, he said. \nAnother reason some researchers track gross rather than net revenue is because “we can create a more plausible number for gross than for net revenue,” Wieser said. “You have to make a lot of assumptions to get net.” \nEMarketer is one firm that forecasts net revenue. Its research predicts that Google and Facebook will account for 57.6 percent of net revenue growth in worldwide digital advertising in 2016. \nTo obtain net revenue estimates, eMarketer had to balance various revenue sharing schemes across the numerous parts of Facebook and Google. Aside from publicly available numbers, eMarketer also factored in interviews with content creators and agencies to forecast how much of Google’s and Facebook’s revenues would be diverted to other parties, said Martín Utreras, eMarketer senior forecasting analyst. \n“If you are looking at an app that is using Google for search to bring in ad revenue, they are getting the money there, so that money doesn’t belong to Google,” Utreras said. “That’s why we look at it from a net basis because we cannot ignore those players.” \nWhere does the spend go? An enormous chunk of money sits in between eMarketer’s 58 percent net growth estimate and Pivotal’s 98 percent gross growth estimate. \n“It’s not that all insertion orders just go into Facebook or Google,” said Sarah Baehr, evp of digital investment at Horizon Media. “But it seems like they are part of the buy of nearly everything when you connect the dots through the ecosystem.” \nBut it’s really difficult to calculate not only if the net revenue splits are correct, but also where that money is going. Just on YouTube alone, there are thousands of content-creator partners, Utreras said. \n“When you try to get under the hood of any of these numbers, there is a range of quality,” Wieser said. “But if people don’t get under the hood, they just take numbers at face value too often.”",

      "text": "SHARE: Facebook At the turn of the 20 th century, San Antonio, Texas had one of the most popular tourist attractions around. It was called the “sporting district” but was, in fact, the red light district. \nThere were so many saloons, brothels, and roadhouses that a guide was published. “This Directory of the Sporting District is intended to be an accurate guide to those who are seeking a good time,” stated the twenty-five cent booklet. Fannie Porter Photo Credit \nOne of the most popular brothels was owned by Fannie Porter, a native of England who came to the United States with her parents as a baby. She began working as a prostitute when she was fifteen, and by the age of twenty, she owned her own brothel. \nBy the end of the 1900s, her establishment was one of the most visited in the west. She employed young women, usually five to eight at a time. The 1900 Federal Census shows Porter as head of the household for a boarding house at the age of 27. \nHer Home in 1900 was San Antonio Ward 2, Bexar, Texas, Race: White, Gender: Female, Immigration Year: 1874, Relation to Head of House: Head, Marital Status: Widowed, Father’s Birthplace: England, Mother’s Birthplace: England, Occupation: Boarding house. \nMembers of household: Maud Smith Age: 21 Boarder, Annie Williams Age: 22 Boarder, Daisy Turner Age: 24 Boarder and Thora Armstrong Age: 19 Boarder. \nPorter’s “boarding house” was luxurious with fine glass fixtures, plush carpeting, silk sheets and lace curtains. Painting by William Hogarth \nShe frequently served champagne and fine food to her special customers, who included Butch Cassidy and his famous Hole in the Wall Gang, and Kid Curry and the Wild Bunch. Porter chose the most beautiful girls and insisted upon good manners, cleanliness, and only the best personal appearance. She always looked out for her “boarders” and if one had a bad experience, the offending customer was dismissed and unable to return. \nPorter frequently concealed outlaws from authorities, but oddly enough her home was also popular with lawmakers such as William Pinkerton of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. \nKnown for her discretion and excellent manners, she was respected everywhere. Porter is said to have remarked that Pinkerton treated her “like a lady”. One of her “boarders”, Della Moore, began a serious relationship with Harvey Logan-aka Kid Curry. Another, Etta Place, is rumored to have met Harry Longabaugh –aka The Sundance Kid, through Porter. A female member of the Wild Bunch, Laura Bullion, may have also worked for Porter at the turn of the century. \nBy the time Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had escaped to South America in 1901, after being the guests of honor at a going away party hosted by Porter, the public began to frown upon openly operating brothels. \nThe Wild Bunch Photo Credit \nIt was about that time that Porter closed her house on the corner of Durango and South San Saba Streets. In 1914 it was sold to the Carmelite Sisters of Divine Charity and operated as a day care center. The property is now home to the Girls & Boys Town of San Antonio. \nNo one knows what became of Fannie Porter. Some say she retired as a wealthy woman and lived in seclusion for the rest of her life, while others believe she married a wealthy man. Some say she returned to England. \nIt is also believed by some that she was killed in an automobile accident in El Paso, Texas in 1940. \nThere are no records to substantiate any of these claims, however, and Fannie Porter has faded away into one of the many legends that surround the Old West in America.",

Must-Reads from Magazine Twitter Print A The key problem with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s newly named strategist, isn’t that he’s an anti-Semite. He may be, though the only piece of personal information suggesting anti-Semitic views come from a contentious divorce proceeding two decades ago—and such charges need to be viewed skeptically. Anti-Semites usually out themselves on a regular basis because they can’t help it. And the late Andrew Breitbart, who was his close friend as well as mine and a loyal if entirely nonpracticing Jew, would not have had a minute’s time for someone who spewed anti-Semitism in private. No, the key moral problem with Steve Bannon is that as the CEO of Andrew Breitbart’s namesake organization, he is an aider and abetter of foul extremist views, including anti-Semitic ones. He used the site to promote the alt-right, which has retailed anti-Semitism as well as general outright racism and white nationalism. The distinction may seem like a minor one, but it isn’t; the hatred Breitbart has channeled is too general for it to be singled out for its anti-Semitic content. Breitbart hasn’t promoted the alt-right for the purposes of advancing the alt-right agenda, I don’t think. It may well be he doesn’t care about these matters one way or the other. What he hates are liberalism and leftism, and he sees the alt-right’s utterly implacable vileness as a useful organizing tool. He is a self-described Leninist who wants to use Lenin’s “by any means necessary” philosophy to extirpate liberalism on the one hand and to pursue the concomitant extirpation of those he perceives as collaborationist conservates on the other. That’s why the greatest degree of passion on the site these past two years has been directed not at the Left but rather at Republicans deemed insufficient in their rage against the Left and insufficiently bloodthirsty in their efforts to destroy the Left. They are his kulaks. It should go without saying that the president of the United States should not have a tawdry, destructive, and repulsively uncivilized goon as a chief strategist. One can hope he will be moved into a tiny windowless office at the end of the hall in the West Wing next to the closet where they keep the toilet paper and scrub brushes. One can hope. One does not know. He could be Trump’s Valerie Jarrett for all we know. With Bannon in a senior role at the White House and the possible appointment of the radical congressman Keith Ellison as head of the Democratic National Committee, we could be seeing our political system devolving to its extremes. Donald Trump hasn’t sounded as though that is the direction in which he is heading himself in the interviews he’s given since the election, but it’s all a guessing game until he starts implementing actual policy. Twitter Print A \nJohn Podhoretz is out on assignment this week. Filling in, Abe Greenwald and Noah Rothman dig into a weekend of anti-Trump protests and some violence, punctuated by reports of racist acts of harassment and vandalism by Trump supporters. Do Donald Trump’s early administration picks give us a window into how he will govern? Finally, which direction will the Democratic Party go as it enters a rebuilding period? We probably already know the answer to that one. Twitter Print A \nOne of the few pledges that Donald Trump made during the campaign that brought joy to the hearts of national security conservatives was his promise to rebuild the U.S. armed forces from the damage suffered under the sequestration budget cuts. He called for increasing the army from 450,000 active-duty soldiers to 540,000, the Marine Corps from 182,000 marines to 200,000, the Navy from 272 deployable ships to 350, and the air force from 1,141 combat aircraft to 1,200. This is a great idea. The U.S. armed forces need to get bigger to counter the rise of Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and other threats. \nThe fact that Republicans control both houses of Congress makes it more likely that this vision can be realized, but it is far from a sure thing. Trump did not spell out how he would pay for his ambitious spending plans. Mackenzie Eaglen of the American Enterprise Institute noted that President Obama was already planning over the next four years to spend $113 billion more than the sequestration caps allow. Trump’s spending plan would require a minimum of another $250 billion to $300 billion extra over four years. \nWhere is the money coming from? During the campaign, Trump claimed that the entire amount could be generated by simply eliminating “waste, fraud and abuse” at the Pentagon. If only. The reality, as old Washington hands know, is that one person’s waste is another person’s vital program. Each line-item in the defense budget has its defenders and won’t be easily cut. Some wasteful spending can be squeezed out but nowhere near enough to pay for Trump’s defense buildup. \nCongress would have to appropriate more money for defense, but while this will find favor with defense hawks, it is sure to meet resistance from budget hawks. In his election victory speech, the president-elect didn’t mention defense spending but did tout his plan to spend $1 trillion on rebuilding infrastructure. \nAnd then there is Trump’s other priority: tax cuts. Independent budget analysts suggest that Trump’s tax cut plans could cost the Treasury as much as $10.8 trillion in lost revenues over ten years. Some of those losses could be offset by goosing economic growth, provided Trump doesn’t enact job-killing tariffs, but not all. Trump does not have comparable budget-cutting plans. In fact, during the campaign, he ruled out cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. \nIf all of Trump’s plans are implemented, the Tax Foundation found , “Including the costs of additional federal borrowing from Mr. Trump’s plans, the national debt would rise by $5.3 trillion over a decade relative to current policy, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 105 percent, which is significantly higher than either Mrs. Clinton’s policies or the current trajectory for the debt.” \nI find it hard to believe that a Republican-dominated Congress will accede to such a massive debt increase without a fight. Something will have to give. Not long ago, Trump was praising Pentagon budget cuts . Will Trump fight to enact the defense buildup to which he committed relatively late in the campaign? It’s unclear, and that makes it all the more important to appoint a defense secretary who will work to ensure that the Defense Department has the funds it needs to keep up with America’s enemies. \nJoin us—you'll be in good company. Everyone worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY: “ There’s an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there’s a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It’s a journal I’ve read for nearly 30 years and I can’t think of a time when I’ve valued it more. „ Jonah Goldberg “ There is more commentary in the world than ever before—whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective—well, you’re left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years—for instance, it now publishes this blog—but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. „ Max Boot “ Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. „ Yuval Levin “ In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: “The world's best magazine?” Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts—and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years—the Obama administration home stretch—and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. „ Arthur Herman “ For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed—exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad—in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. „ Charles Krauthammer “ COMMENTARY isn’t just an important magazine. It’s an indispensable one. It’s been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It’s indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it’s indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it’s ever been. „ William Kristol “ COMMENTARY’s writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. „ Victor Davis Hanson “ COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it’s a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys—the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell—are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about “Moon River” that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts’n’culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I’m still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson’s mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That’s COMMENTARY for you—provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as “Moon River” teaches us, there’s such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can’t know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. „ Mark Steyn “ COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. „ John Bolton “ In the midst of today’s political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY’s talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America’s public dialogue and shape the nation’s future. „ Karl Rove “ It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis—and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. „ Elliott Abrams “ For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country’s intellectual health. „ Donald Rumsfeld “ COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and—of course—Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. „ Bret Stephens “ Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a “frequent contributor” who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. „ Ruth R. Wisse “ Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. „ Joseph Epstein “ Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. „ Matthew Continetti “ COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. „ David Brooks “ Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment—whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard—has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. „ Heather Mac Donald “ I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P’s: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my “idealistic” ’60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life’s ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation’s history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn’t alone. „ Michael Medved “ Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. „ Andrew Roberts “ In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. „ David Frum “ COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there’s anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America’s place in the world and what it should be. I’m a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. „ Dana Perino \nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast—the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945. \nJoin the intellectual club, today.

The fun starts Nov. 25 and goes through Jan. 15. (Photo: Provided by LG&E and KU) \nThe holiday season kicks off in grand style Nov. 25 at Light Up Louisville, the annual event that launches Holiday in the City, a kaleidoscope of seasonal activities for families that extends through Jan. 15. \nLots of sparkle The sights, sounds and activities will include an 8,000-pound Christmas tree, parade, live entertainment, ice skating, 5K run and more. Shoppers will enjoy market chalets and the “Gum Drop Trail” featuring special discounts by participating shops. The trail includes a stretch of Fourth Street between West Jefferson and West Broadway. \nActivities will be held at Holiday Square, located at Fourth and Jefferson streets, Fourth Street Live! or adjacent places downtown. A quick look at happenings appears below. For details, visit www.louisvillesholidayinthecity.com . \nEconomic treats With Holiday in the City, all that glitters is gold. Light up Louisville attracts some 50,000 people while Holiday in the City captures far larger crowds, said Janice Cates, director of Mayor’s Office of Special Events. \n“Louisville typically embraces celebrations and festivals with special zeal,” said Cates. “Holiday in the City is no exception, offering activities and memorable experiences that have become a regional attraction.” \nOut-of-town visitors, including those from other states, often return to Holiday in the City with more guests, she said. They shop, dine and stay in area hotels, giving Louisville some economic gifts to start the New Year. \nAll of which means Holiday in the City grows like a January icicle. Think Jack Frost meets Derby Festival to understand its luster, value and potential. \nPartners make it happen Light Up Louisville and Holiday in the City are made possible by partners and dedicated volunteers. Support is provided by Kentucky’s largest gas and electric utility, a regional bank, a labor union, media firms and other organizations. \nBecause your energy matters, this content was powered by LG&E and KU .",

Aging doesn’t have to mean the end of intimacy and connection. For many, sex is even better in the golden years. (Photo: Shutterstock) \nDespite the misconception that intimate and sexual connection is an activity for the young, for many people, interest in sex doesn’t go away with age. \nIn fact, sex may be even more enjoyable during your golden years. Why? Women no longer have to worry about becoming pregnant, and both genders may have developed a better understanding of their bodies, their likes and dislikes, and their needs and desires. The result: Lovemaking becomes more intimate, maybe even more passionate. \nIn fact, many people have fulfilling sex well into their 80s. Here are five suggestions for ways to keep those fires burning and help maximize pleasurable sexual activity well into your golden years: Make sure you’re in good health. Every health condition from head to toe can impact your activity in the bedroom. Conditions that affect the heart, including heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes—and the medications required to treat those conditions—may impact sexual function. Similarly, arthritis, chronic pain, hormonal problems and mood disturbances such as anxiety and depression may negatively affect your interest in sex. Protecting your general health and well-being and talking to your doctor about your concerns can help ensure you enjoy sex throughout your senior years. It is also important to review your medications and recommended treatments with your health care provider and ask about their sexual side effects. Report any problems you note, and ask about alternatives that may be considered. Embrace change. Aging comes with many physical and biochemical changes. In addition to gray hairs and deepening wrinkles, hormone changes in both men and women may dampen desire. Changes in circulation or declining testosterone levels in men may make it more difficult for them to get or maintain an erection, while lower estrogen levels in women can translate to vaginal dryness and painful sex. The end result: Both genders may need more time or require a little more foreplay and effort to get in the mood and to engage in sexual activity. Keep in mind that as you age, sex may occasionally have to take a backseat to health concerns, pain, discomfort and fatigue. Including intimate touch in your routine can be an enjoyable experience for both that can help maintain connection during these challenging times. Get creative . Good sex goes far beyond intercourse. It’s also about connecting emotionally and touching. In the face of illness, ailments, functional challenges or disabilities, the recipe for sexual interaction may need to be redefined. Instead of focusing on orgasm or intercourse alone, learn to enjoy the entire journey of intimacy. Hugging, kissing, rediscovering sensual activities you shared early in your relationship and even exploring new options can go a long way toward helping you feel physically and emotionally fulfilled. Communicate . Communicating with your partner is even more important as your body and feelings change, or if your libidos are not quite in sync . Discussing your thoughts, fears and desires can lead to a more emotionally and physically fulfilling relationship. Open, honest communication about sex can allow partners to work together towards mutual sexual satisfaction. If you’re the one providing care to your partner or spouse, don’t underestimate how that role can affect intimacy. If possible, step out of your role as caregiver from time to time and focus instead on being a partner. Play it safe . No matter what your age, you should always follow safe sex practices with a new or different partner. Don’t assume people are monogamous or low risk because of their age or social status. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) more than 25 percent of the people living with HIV infection are over the age of 55. People over 50 are getting STIs (sexually transmitted infections) more than ever before. In fact, incidences of syphilis and chlamydia in adults aged 45 to 64 tripled between 2000 and 2010. Store and use condoms correctly. Talk with your doctor about this and other issues such as screening for you and your partner and ways to prevent transmission of infections. \nThere’s no doubt that having sex as you age improves mental and physical health, to say nothing of its effects on reducing anxiety and stress. Instead of trying to get back to the type of sex you had in your 20s, find ways to enjoy the unique advantages of having sex during your later years. \nNot sure where to start? Ask your health care provider for useful suggestions or a referral to a specialist. \nPhillis Mims-Gillum, M.D. (Photo: Henry Ford Health System) \nDr. Phillis Mims-Gillum is an OB/GYN who specializes in sexual health and sexuality counseling, and sees patients for these conditions at Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital.

      "text": "George Takei has wise words about unfriending people on Facebook If there’s one thing we can all agree on after last week’s election, it’s that Facebook has been absolutely abuzz with political news and opinions. And one of our favorite Internet wise men wants to impart an important, Facebook-related message during this tense time.\nVulture let us know that George Takei doesn’t want you to unfriend people with opposing political perspectives. Apart from the fact that it spells #drama because you can see who unfriended you (and that causes real-life consequences ), Takei provides one of the best reasons possible: optimism. In an op-ed for The Daily Beast he wrote,\n“There is an understandable impulse to disengage, to “unfriend” others on social media who disagree, to demonize whole groups as irredeemable racists and sexists. This may gain some momentary satisfaction, but with all its fury it solves nothing in the end. It certainly does not bring us closer to the promise of our country.” We’re extremely on board with Takei’s positive approach to this difficult subject, and appreciate that he’s advocating for small changes that impact our community in meaningful ways.\n“There are many who rightly feel afraid for what will happen next. But hard as it is to face, we must remind ourselves that fear is the favored weapon of bullies and thugs. Fear can make us turn away from our hopes and give in to mistrust and cynicism. Let us instead take each moment of fear as a challenge to stand up ever taller.” If you’ve been seriously considering unfriending some Facebook friends this week, just make sure to take a moment to really think about what it means. What might seem like an inconsequential gesture could end up contributing to the tense political climate we’re all trying to move past.\nWe’re open to more wise words from George Takei anytime!\nThe post George Takei has wise words about unfriending people on Facebook appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Courtesy Mark Woods \nIt started with a heartfelt Facebook message and ended with love from all over the world. \nOn Nov. 8, Mark Woods of Cornwall, England, shared a heart-wrenching post on Facebook: he was putting his beloved dog Walnut to sleep the following Saturday. But before that sad moment, he told his followers that he planned to walk on a beach his dog loved just one last time, and asked people to join him. That’s when something amazing happened. \nWhat could have been a few family and friends turned into something epic: More than 19,000 people reacted to the Facebook post, with hundreds attending the walk, and many more walking with their own beloved pets at 9:30 a.m. around the world, according to Woods. \nThe post read: \n“Walk with Walnut Sadly I am having to have Walnut euthanised on Saturday 12th November and so we will be having a last walk together on his beloved Porth Beach at 9.30am. I would love it if dog lovers/owners and friends would join us for a celebration of Walnut on his favourite Porth Beach. He has had an incredible life and having reached the grand age of 18 is ready for his final sleep. Hope to see you on Saturday.” \nAfter the overwhelming show of support on and off the beach that day, Walnut was put to sleep at 11:56 a.m., and it’s clear the support from so many people — including countless strangers — definitely eased the blow. \n“I am humbled by the support from all over the world that I have received,” Woods told PEOPLE in an email. “I set out to have a walk with Walnut and now I feel I am walking with you all, thank you.” \nWalnut left this world with his family and his siblings — whippets Monty, Nelson and Charlie — by his side. “He went very quickly in my arms,” Woods wrote on Facebook, “I am writing this post because I owe it to everyone who has supported myself, my family and most importantly Walnut.” \nThis unexpected closing chapter in the dog’s beautiful life ended with a sweet poem, sent to Woods by one of the many well wishers and read to the dog before he was put to sleep on Saturday. \nToday you did the bravest thing, Today you set me free Thank you for showing me The ultimate dignity I’m sorry that my leaving Has broken your kind heart But we knew this day would come, The day we had to part Don’t think I did not hear Every last word you said Don’t think I did not feel Your trembling hand touch my head Today you did the bravest thing Today you set me free Thank you for a wonderful life Thank you for loving me \nWoods wrote that it was a reminder of “just how lucky we are to be alive and to share in the wonderful world that our pets give us.” Show Full Article",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nNow the question is posed: Given how wonderfully complete the work of Christ on the cross is in covering our sin and completing our righteousness, and given how complete the work of the Holy Spirit is in sealing us for the day of redemption, how does Christ’s ongoing advocacy or intercession relate to these things? Why is it even necessary, she asks? \nSo let’s put just two texts in front of us and see if they shed light on the answer. “My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin . . . ” — now, what is he going to say next? We have a cross? We have a crucifixion? We have an atonement? He says, “ . . . if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous” (1 John 2:1). So, John doesn’t simply say we have a Redeemer who died for us. He does say that in the next verse. But here he says: Take heart from the fact that this very day, the day that you sin and confess it, Christ the righteous one is your advocate in heaven. \nAnd is it not significant that he calls Jesus the “righteous” one? “Jesus Christ the righteous.” It seems to me that the righteousness of Christ is highlighted here not because we need an upright lawyer in our defense, but because we ourselves are in Christ Jesus and are only accepted before the Father in the righteous one and, therefore, the advocacy of Jesus is the ongoing presentation of the reality established at the cross and through faith and by the Spirit. God the Father doesn’t just look back to the cross. He looks straight ahead into the face of the living, righteous Jesus Christ, who is our righteousness and is our life and is our purchase and payment. \nIn other words, we might think — if we were writing the story, we might think — that the work of Christ on the cross would be more magnified if all attention were backward on that event. God doesn’t see it that way. And we need to rest and rejoice. God doesn’t see it that way. That event, that past event led to a resurrection from the dead. It led to a coronation of the Son of God at the Father’s right hand. It led to an ongoing embodiment in the God-man, the Mediator of all that he had achieved and all that he is as our ground of eternal salvation. \nHere’s one more passage: “He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?” (Romans 8:32). Now, don’t miss how God’s not sparing his Son is the ground on the basis of which everything good that happens from now on to us sinners takes place, from now to eternity. Everything good that happens to us is based on that not sparing his own Son. There is no minimizing of the Father’s offering of the Son as a sacrifice. He is not minimizing it. That is the basis of everything good that comes to us. He is magnifying the death in the past by drawing attention to what is achieved for the future as Christ keeps on working. \nAnd so, he continues — that verse goes on like this: “Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect” — in the future forever? “It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died.” Now, pause. There he stresses it again: “Christ Jesus is the one who died.” Death is the foundation of everything. And then he adds, “More than that.” So, we should be thrilled that there is “more than that.” “More than that, who was raised — who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” (Romans 8:33–35). “The death of Christ is not the end, but the beginning and the foundation of everything that God does for the elect.”",

      "text": "Story \nCould fake news on Facebook have swung the presidential election one way or the other? \nThe debate is raging, and despite denying that false information on Facebook influenced voting, the company announced this week that it'll try to crack down on any financial incentives to creating and publishing false information on its site. Facebook will update its ad policies, which ban deceptive or misleading content, to explicitly include fake news. \nAnd Google, which accidentally promoted a false story at the top of its search results (for \"final election count\") just a day or two after the election, said it will also ban fake news outlets from using its AdSense advertising network. \nWill the measures work? Maybe. Cutting off the money is a pretty good disincentive — but only if the policies are actually enforced. And enforcing the policies suggests that both Google and Facebook have some kind of technology for determining whether news is fake, and that'll lead to a host of questions about why they don't just stop it from disseminating in the first place. And none of that will change the fact that both Google and Facebook have an incentive to keep promoting interesting, click-worthy, shareable content in order to serve their bottom lines, and that doesn't always lead to the highest quality stuff, as I think we've amply discovered. \nBut how did we get here in the first place? \nLet's start by saying that in the history of modern media, there aren't many parallels to the way Google and Facebook distribute news. \nNeither is, strictly speaking, a news publisher — a distinction that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has clung to with increasingly white knuckles for years (fun fact: the issue of Facebook as a media company actually started cropping up around 2012 , right before Facebook's IPO, when the company vociferously denied that it had anything in common with the financially shaky \"media\" label .) \nBut both are in the business of distributing information and attaching advertising to that information and deriving revenue from increased interactions from that information. The only difference is that they don't generate the information. Nevertheless, Google and especially Facebook are on the hook for what those stories say —partly as a matter of reach and power, yes. Facebook reaches 67 percent of adults in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center; and two thirds of those adults get some or even all of their news there. \nBut the other issue is that each company has its own way of tampering with the information you see in order to make money. \nGoogle ranks pages and search results according to its PageRank algorithm , among others, in the hope of making search results more accurate and trustworthy. And Facebook's News Feed algorithm similarly sorts and assigns computerized rankings to stories to determine what you see when you're browsing the site, with the hope of creating a collection of posts that will keep you on the site for the longest amount of time. \nAnd in both cases, the more you use the sites and the more ads you click, the more money the sites make. \nPlus, up until the changes announced this week, Google and Facebook have allowed publishers to sell ads on their news sites, whether the information is true or not. So there's also been a clear financial incentive for people to create and distribute any story that will get clicks, sell ads on those stories and reap the benefits. \nAnd thus, the election. \nAmerican consumers have proven highly engaged with news about the 2016 presidential election — particularly with news about Donald Trump. According to marketing startup Keywee, stories about Trump got about eight times more likes than stories about Hillary Clinton; the Trump news bonanza has delivered record traffic and revenue for media outlets ranging from the New York Times to NPR to, well, Facebook. \nSo there was even more incentive than usual to create fake stories that might make money — and if you had an interest in the outcome of the election, so much the better. And now we're wondering whether these amplification algorithms, these engagement tools, these mysterious chunks of code, might have actually influenced the outcome of an extremely close race. \nAccording to Mark Zuckerberg, that's \" a pretty crazy idea .\" According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, it's a solid maybe. \nHe told the BBC on Tuesday that given the extremely tight margins of the election, anything that could swing the vote of \"one in a hundred voters\" is worth considering. Pichai said Google's goal shouldn't be to debate the influence of news, but to work hard on improving its tools to create maximum accuracy and get rid of incentives to game the system. \nFor both sites, interestingly, the biggest reason to clean up the news comes down to trust, which is exactly the thing that keeps reputable news sources from lying about or overly distorting the news. The thinking is (or at least has been) that if you lie too much, people will stop trusting you and they'll go somewhere else. \nFacebook is skating close to that edge. It's a pretty crazy idea that Facebook can remove itself entirely from a conversation about the influence of the news it presents, and Mark Zuckerberg should stop pretending to be a disinterested purveyor of interesting links. \nFacebook has both hired and then fired human curators to present news, regularly censored everything from photos of breastfeeding women (actually, really just women , a lot, like really, really a lot) to photos of burn victims to historical war photos to posts about controversial political issues and potentially even conservative news stories writ large — all while apparently exempting Donald Trump's posts from its hate speech policies . \nThe reason the News Feed algorithm exists is to encourage people to visit Facebook and use it as a constant and, ultimately, reliable source for information. Google is its biggest competitor. If Facebook can't get its act together and clean up the information on its site, we'll eventually start to see it as untrustworthy and go back to good old search engines. Best-case scenario? Facebook and Google get locked in a truth war. Hey, a person can dream.",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nShe just had to hand it to him… \nAnna Kendrick treats good sex the way I treat a good movie: If there’s a good climax, I’m going to clap my hands together in applause. \nIn her new memoir “Scrappy Little Nobody,” Anna opened up about how she delivered a high five to the first guy who ever gave her an orgasm and his subsequent (and kinda lame TBH) reaction, \nSo hey, first time I’ve had an orgasm during that whole situation. I raised my hand for a high five. ‘Up top!’ The guy apparently didn’t take the compliment very well, but let’s be honest, any form of communication and camaraderie in your sex life should be a good thing. \nBasically, I’m guessing this laying of skin looked a lot like this: Giphy \nSo, I have quite a few thoughts on this anecdote. \nIf anyone gave me a high five after sex and then bellowed, “Up top,” I’d feel on cloud nine. I love high fives, plus it builds up your resistance to germs. \nWho is this (sexually gifted) loser to judge a high five coming from the perfect person that is Anna Kendrick? \nForget giving this guy a high five. His inability to take this high praise deserves a low three, if you know what I mean. \nSecondly, Anna’s absolutely right. Communication is key when it comes to bumpin’ in the boudoir or chafin’ in the chamber. \nAlthough I’m told my insistence on referring to sexual intercourse as “bumpin’ in the boudoir” is not good communication (and a turnoff). \nI’m also told my reference to sex as “chafin’ in the chamber” is actually a crime in 11 states or will soon be… in Trump’s America. Giphy \nThe bottom line is Anna is always pitch perfect in her pithy musings and stories. \nIf you need to catch yourself up on what she’s been up to, check out her newly crimped hairdo . 5TAGES of Going On A Social Media Detox  ",

      "text": "<iframe src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/2016/11/15/world/fake-news-problem-explained/popout\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240px\"></iframe> Copy - Omar Havana/Getty Images \nCould fake news on Facebook have swung the presidential election one way or the other? \nThe debate is raging, and despite denying that false information on Facebook influenced voting, the company announced this week that it'll try to crack down on any financial incentives to creating and publishing false information on its site. Facebook will update its ad policies, which ban deceptive or misleading content, to explicitly include fake news. \nAnd Google, which accidentally promoted a false story at the top of its search results (for \"final election count\") just a day or two after the election, said it will also ban fake news outlets from using its AdSense advertising network. \nWill the measures work? Maybe. Cutting off the money is a pretty good disincentive — but only if the policies are actually enforced. And enforcing the policies suggests that both Google and Facebook have some kind of technology for determining whether news is fake, and that'll lead to a host of questions about why they don't just stop it from disseminating in the first place. And none of that will change the fact that both Google and Facebook have an incentive to keep promoting interesting, click-worthy, shareable content in order to serve their bottom lines, and that doesn't always lead to the highest quality stuff, as I think we've amply discovered. \nBut how did we get here in the first place? \nLet's start by saying that in the history of modern media, there aren't many parallels to the way Google and Facebook distribute news. \nNeither is, strictly speaking, a news publisher — a distinction that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has clung to with increasingly white knuckles for years (fun fact: the issue of Facebook as a media company actually started cropping up around 2012 , right before Facebook's IPO, when the company vociferously denied that it had anything in common with the financially shaky \"media\" label .) \nBut both are in the business of distributing information and attaching advertising to that information and deriving revenue from increased interactions from that information. The only difference is that they don't generate the information. Nevertheless, Google and especially Facebook are on the hook for what those stories say —partly as a matter of reach and power, yes. Facebook reaches 67 percent of adults in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center; and two thirds of those adults get some or even all of their news there. \nBut the other issue is that each company has its own way of tampering with the information you see in order to make money. \nGoogle ranks pages and search results according to its PageRank algorithm , among others, in the hope of making search results more accurate and trustworthy. And Facebook's News Feed algorithm similarly sorts and assigns computerized rankings to stories to determine what you see when you're browsing the site, with the hope of creating a collection of posts that will keep you on the site for the longest amount of time. \nAnd in both cases, the more you use the sites and the more ads you click, the more money the sites make. \nPlus, up until the changes announced this week, Google and Facebook have allowed publishers to sell ads on their news sites, whether the information is true or not. So there's also been a clear financial incentive for people to create and distribute any story that will get clicks, sell ads on those stories and reap the benefits. \nAnd thus, the election. \nAmerican consumers have proven highly engaged with news about the 2016 presidential election — particularly with news about Donald Trump. According to marketing startup Keywee, stories about Trump got about eight times more likes than stories about Hillary Clinton; the Trump news bonanza has delivered record traffic and revenue for media outlets ranging from the New York Times to NPR to, well, Facebook. \nSo there was even more incentive than usual to create fake stories that might make money — and if you had an interest in the outcome of the election, so much the better. And now we're wondering whether these amplification algorithms, these engagement tools, these mysterious chunks of code, might have actually influenced the outcome of an extremely close race. \nAccording to Mark Zuckerberg, that's \" a pretty crazy idea .\" According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, it's a solid maybe. \nHe told the BBC on Tuesday that given the extremely tight margins of the election, anything that could swing the vote of \"one in a hundred voters\" is worth considering. Pichai said Google's goal shouldn't be to debate the influence of news, but to work hard on improving its tools to create maximum accuracy and get rid of incentives to game the system. \nFor both sites, interestingly, the biggest reason to clean up the news comes down to trust, which is exactly the thing that keeps reputable news sources from lying about or overly distorting the news. The thinking is (or at least has been) that if you lie too much, people will stop trusting you and they'll go somewhere else. \nFacebook is skating close to that edge. It's a pretty crazy idea that Facebook can remove itself entirely from a conversation about the influence of the news it presents, and Mark Zuckerberg should stop pretending to be a disinterested purveyor of interesting links. \nFacebook has both hired and then fired human curators to present news, regularly censored everything from photos of breastfeeding women (actually, really just women , a lot, like really, really a lot) to photos of burn victims to historical war photos to posts about controversial political issues and potentially even conservative news stories writ large — all while apparently exempting Donald Trump's posts from its hate speech policies . \nThe reason the News Feed algorithm exists is to encourage people to visit Facebook and use it as a constant and, ultimately, reliable source for information. Google is its biggest competitor. If Facebook can't get its act together and clean up the information on its site, we'll eventually start to see it as untrustworthy and go back to good old search engines. Best-case scenario?

Dr. Jeffrey Stansberry, For Go Healthcare 3:20 p.m. PST November 14, 2016 This content is produced and presented by our sponsor, Go Healthcare. A woman with back pain. (Monkey Business Images, Getty Images/Monkey Business) (Photo: Provided by Go Healthcare) 9 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nI’m sure at some point in time either you yourself or a friend, family, or neighbor you know, has suffered with low back pain. As a matter of fact, almost 80% of all adults experience low back pain during their adult years. Low back pain can be a painful condition, with intensity ranging from constant dull aching to sharp stabbing like pain that can completely stop a person in their tracks. As for what causes low back pain, the answers can be just as widely varied as the symptoms of the condition itself. Anything from bending/lifting wrong to a sports injury to a flare-up of a previously existing condition. \nOne of the most common conditions related to low back pain is a condition known as Sciatica. You may have heard this word from a golf buddy who was suffering from low back pain or maybe one of your coworkers mentioned it when their low back pain flared up. Sciatica is a condition that occurs when the sciatic nerve becomes compressed. What is the sciatic nerve you ask? Well, the sciatic nerve is a major nerve extending from the lower end of the spinal cord down through the buttocks and extends down the back of the legs. This can cause low back pain that is often accompanied by other symptoms such as; burning, tingling, numbness, cramping, or muscle weakness. While it most commonly affects one leg/side, it can in fact affect both legs/sides of the body and can even create those symptoms all the way down into the calves & feet. Needless to say, Sciatica is a painful condition that can very easily disrupt a person’s normal daily activities. \nMedically accurate illustration of a painful sciatic nerve. (Eraxion, Getty Images/iStockphoto) (Photo: Provided by Go Healthcare) \nOkay, enough about the pain though, instead let’s focus on how to address the condition. There are a number of different healthcare options that can assist with a condition as painful as Sciatica, but we at Go Healthcare Physical Medicine have found that a multifaceted healthcare approach can often be a more successful way to overcome a person’s low back pain and/or Sciatica pain. That is why our practice combines the unique talents of physical medicine, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, manual therapy, spinal decompression, as well as chiropractic. With all of these options under one roof, our multi-specialty team is able to provide a non-surgical approach to a person’s pain or injury, including low back pain and Sciatica. Plus, when someone has a whole team of knowledgeable & friendly medical professionals behind them committed to providing them with the highest quality of health services, not only can it help to restore them to optimal health and well-being, but it can also provide a positive atmosphere to encourage their healing along. \nWith the approach described above, our patients have come to expect great results from us and because of that, they know that when they encounter someone who is suffering from low back pain or sciatica, they can confidently encourage that person to seek help from Go Healthcare Physical Medicine. Low back pain, such as Sciatica, may be something that 80% of all adults will experience in their lifetime, but that doesn’t mean that that they should have to suffer needlessly because of it.

      "text": "It seems incredible that in an age where most of the videos we take on our mobile devices are HD, Facebook hasn’t allowed users of its Android app to upload it in that quality. But now, a user on Reddit has reported that he has spotted a toggle button on his account, allowing him to upload HD videos. Not everyone is seeing it though, so it may be a server side update that they’re slowly rolling out to selected Android app users.\nWhich.com\nA few months ago, Facebook introduced HD photo upload for Android users, even as that feature, together with the HD video upload, has been around for some time now for iOS users. If you’re using the beta version though, that option has been available for quite some time as well, but not everyone is a fan of having the beta version of an app. But it’s about time and long overdue for the social network to have this option, especially now that uploading videos is one of the more popular habits that people do on the app.\nReddit user mr3305, whose Facebook for Android app is in version 102.0.0.28.70, suggests that if the option is not showing up for you yet in the Facebook settings, you can restart the app and if that feature has been activated for you, you should be able to see the toggle button. But other users have also suggested just uploading the video though Facebook on the browser.\nThe Facebook official app has long been criticized for not being as great as an app as you would expect from a big company like the social network giant. And of course there’s the memory issue and the battery drainage problem, so not everyone is fond of using it when mobile.\nVIA: Reddit",

Bush announced on Facebook that he and his wife, Laura, went to the Jan Rees-Jones Animal Care Center in Dallas last week to thank employees for their work and ended up leaving with Freddy, an Australian shepherd mix. \n“We already love him, and even our cats Bob and Bernadette are finding Freddy’s charm futile to resist,” the 43rd US president posted late Monday . “If you could use a little extra joy in your life, consider adopting a pet from an animal shelter or rescue group.” \nThe 12-week-old dog was among several puppies found abandoned last month by a sanitation worker at a dump site in southern Dallas, Bush spokesman Freddy Ford told the Dallas Morning News . \nThe animals were taken to Dallas Animal Services and later transferred to the SPCA of Dallas, the newspaper reports. \nWhile in the White House, the Bushes owned two Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. Barney, known as the family’s “first dog,” died in 2013, while Miss Beazley died in 2014. Both dogs died of lymphoma. \nBarney, who once had his own official government website, was a gift to Laura Bush from Christie Whitman, then governor of New Jersey, for her birthday in 2000. Miss Beazley, meanwhile, was a gift from the president to his wife in 2005, according to the Washington Post . Share this: ",

Facebook brings Instagram and Messenger together to make social for business easier 0 Share: Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? Photo by Facebook \nFacebook , Instagram , and Messenger will all be under the umbrella of a single app soon . With businesses in mind, Facebook is integrating all three into its Pages Manager mobile app in the coming weeks, letting manage messages and comments of all three platforms from one page. \nPages Manager is a free app aimed to help people who manage the Facebook account of businesses. It shows you a specialized view of the pages you administrate, helping you more quickly manage comments and posts while keeping your personal account separate. \nWith the new inbox, you'll be able to see if anyone's commented on any of the three pages. You can respond to inquiries and tap on the name to see the Facebook profile of the person and past interactions that person has had with your business. You'll also still be able to use the Instagram app separately, even if you integrate it with Pages Manager. \nGiven that Messenger is already a Facebook application and Facebook owns Instagram , the integration makes sense. If well implemented, it could prove convenient for the busy social administrator.",

      "text": "Facebook Facebook Twitter Twitter LinkedIn LinkedIn Google + Google+ Email Email 0 Comments Comments Marketers may not want to go back to this era, but Facebook is the virtual shop window and “help wanted” board. Ad targeting can go awry when used incorrectly and illegally to discriminate against African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic consumers. \nOn Election Day, I stood in line for more than an hour. So I started talking with the African-American woman in line in front of me, and the subject of published racism came up. \n“It’s 2016,” she said with incredulity — as though this should absolutely not still be happening. \nShe was specifically talking about “the media.” That generic term, of course, came back to what she saw on Facebook. \nSwastikas, Confederate flags and racial epithets abound in Facebook posts. \nBut Facebook ads? \n“African-Americans need not apply for this job.”“Hispanics can’t live here.”“No loans for Asian-Americans.” \nAds on Facebook may not actually say these things, but they can by default. Marketers can target their desired demographics; which means, if they like, they can exclude them, as well. But those omissions will soon end for ads about employment, housing and credit. Facebook is implementing new ad tools to fight discriminatory — and, therefore, illegal — employment, housing and credit ads. This is a housing ad on Facebook that was in my news feed and is, therefore, an example of content marketing. I don’t know if it excluded minorities in its targeting. \n“Discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook,” asserts Erin Egan, Facebook VP, U.S. Public Policy and Chief Privacy Officer in a blog post on Friday. \nShe and the others at Facebook may mean well, but they’re still expecting a lot that may be generally absent from human nature — a sense of responsibility and knowledge of the law. \nExpecting self-policing from all marketers and fact-checking from consumers will probably not sustain Facebook’s ad business and the content being shared. There are some dangerous problems ahead for Facebook if its leaders don’t wrap their heads around this: The Law of Unintended Consequences \nLost consumer trust is difficult to regain, marketers tell me. \nWith so many ways to lose trust, what’s Facebook’s route? \nI’d say it’s content — organic and paid. \nMarketers may assume Facebook has a handle on it, but they did see Facebook’s video view metric snafu. It’s a basic metric, and Facebook is having trouble. \nSo expecting Facebook to keep its entire network trustworthy may be expecting a lot — especially when the company tends to fire editors and replace them with engineers and algorithms; thereby, introducing fake content to the trending stories section. ( Google has this fake news problem, too. ) \nAbout 44 percent of Americans get their news from Facebook and the fake news they’re reading is in the double digits, according to Pew. That doesn’t indicate to me that consumers are fact-checking what they’re reading. So when they find out it’s false, I’ve heard them blame the platform — not just the sources. Facebook, a source for news \nSo, Facebook advertisers, I argue that content is so nuanced and varied that it needs trained human eyes to review it. Not just algorithms. \nIt’ll take more than the dozen Facebookers in the company’s task force studying this controversy to fix it. Facebook will have to hire editors. \nThat absence of carbon-based life forms seems to permeate Facebook’s ad process, too. \nPlus, there’s the side-cost to brands of platforms seeming to be automated. Consumers get angry, according to a Twitter brand manager who spoke to Digiday: “If someone’s not happy, the reaction is always the same. There’s no middle ground, just all-out rage. To them, we are the worst people in history. If people don’t get the answer they want, they can become trolls. They don’t realize there is a person behind that screen; they see it as an outlet to vent.” Optimize Ads \nFacebook should probably have lawyers review its entire ad structure. Brands and consumers will benefit from it. \nEffectively redlining in home sales is such an “of course you don’t do that” situation that it doesn’t seem as though the social network is really thinking these things out. (Another example is Facebook Marketplace. When the general public got to use it, sellers were hawking babies and guns.) How Facebook Marketplace designers must’ve felt \nMost marketers seem to pay attention to the law and follow it, and have good intentions toward their customers. But the ones who don’t are the reason laws exist to prevent discriminatory practices and, for that matter, deceptive advertising and a whole lot more. \nWhat do you think, marketers? \nPlease respond in the comments section below.",

The aftermath was broadcast live on Facebook in July. AP\nIn this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence where protesters demonstrated in St. Paul, Minn., against the July 6, 2016, shooting death of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. (Photo: Jim Mone, AP)\nST. PAUL — A Minnesota police officer was criminally charged Wednesday in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile , Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said.\nOn Wednesday, Choi's office charged St. Anthony Police officer Jeronimo Yanez with second-degree manslaughter and multiple counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm. He said that under Minnesota law as written the deadly use of force is not justified.\n\"I have given Officer Yanez every benefit of the doubt on his use of deadly force, but I cannot allow the death of a motorist who was lawfully carrying a firearm under these facts and circumstances to go unaccounted for,\" said Choi. He said second-degree manslaughter, which involves \"gross negligence and an element of recklessness,\" is the most appropriate charge in these circumstances.\nYanez will make his first court appearance Friday. The county attorney said the officer is expected to turn himself in to authorities before then.\nChoi said that after much deliberation it became clear to him that he must make the charging decision, and not refer the case to a grand jury.\n\"My conscience tells me it would be wrong to ask a grand jury to make this decision when I know in my heart what must be done,\" said Choi.\nProsecutors have been weighing potential charges against Yanez since receiving results of an in-depth investigation by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on Sept. 28. Choi also enlisted the help of a special prosecutor, veteran civil rights attorney Don Lewis, to help forge a decision on potential charges and whether to bring the case to a grand jury.\nUSA TODAY\nSpecial prosecutor to help in Minn. police-killing case\nCastile, 32, was fatally shot during a traffic stop the night of July 6 in Falcon Heights, Minn. His girlfriend Diamond Reynolds insists the officer shot Castile as he reached for an ID despite the fact Castile informed Yanez he had a gun and a permit to carry it. The officer's attorney has said the officer was simply reacting to seeing a gun.\nReynolds streamed the graphic aftermath of the shooting live on Facebook, which brought the incident into the national spotlight. The YouTube clip of the incident has been viewed millions of times. The shooting triggered a series of emotionally charged protests, including one that shut down Interstate 94 and injured a law enforcement officer. Protesters camped out for weeks in front of the mansion of Minn. Gov. Mark Dayton. They shut down Summit Avenue a number of times.\nChoi's announcement comes a day after the one-year anniversary of another high-profile police killing in Minnesota. Jamar Clark was killed in Minneapolis on Nov. 15, 2015.\nUSA TODAY\nJustice Dept.: No charges against Minneapolis police in Jamar Clark case\nThe deadly encounter with Clark, 24, followed a police call for a domestic assault at a birthday party where a man was interfering with medical personnel.\nDuring a subsequent struggle with Clark, one of the officers told state investigators that Clark's hand reached his gun. The officer's partner reportedly warned Clark to release the weapon when Clark allegedly replied, \"I'm ready to die.''\nHennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman decided no charges would be filed in that case, opting to make the decision himself instead of handing the case to a grand jury.\nCastile was shot a day after a Baton Rouge police officer fatally shot Alton Sterling.\nThe July 5 shooting, recorded on two cellphones and shared on the Internet showed two white officers who pinned down Sterling. The police had responded to a convenience store after an anonymous caller indicated a man, later identified as Sterling, 37, was selling music CDs and wearing a red shirt threatened him with a gun, Cpl. L’Jean McKneely said.\nContributing: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY; The (Lafayette, La.) Daily Advertiser; Step Solis, USA TODAY.

      "text": "Share on Facebook 9 Cast the First Stone marks the welcome and highly anticipated return of Ion Dissonance. Six years after their last album, Cursed , to say it's good to have them back would be a severe understatement. Thankfully, the time away has served them well, as the Montreal death metal/mathcore band not only pick up right where they left off, but also surpass expectations with an album that is even more dynamic, menacing and chaotic than its predecessor. Ion Dissonance's fifth album showcases the kind of technical, angular guitar work, viciously discordant rhythms and intense grooves that made 2005's Solace an instant classic. It's a relentless, anxiety-inducing attack as soon as first track \"Burdens\" kicks in with hostile vocals, chaotic guitars and frenetic drum blasts. This carries on throughout \"The Truth Will Set You Free\" and \"To Expiate,\" while \"To Lift the Dead Hand of the Past\" also features an underlying, yet totally destructive, groove. The slow \"Untitled II\" provides a bit of a breather before the second half of the album bounces back with harsh brutality. \"Ill Will\" features a particularly powerful breakdown, while \"Virtue\" highlights the band's knack for unpredictable structures and unorthodox tempo changes. Showcasing impeccable musicianship and songwriting throughout, Cast the First Stone summarizes everything fans know, love and appreciate about Ion Dissonance. (Good Fight) Get It",

Post to Facebook FTW: RG3 is the Browns' best option Why not?  //usat.ly/2g05FEh   Join the Nation's Conversation   FTW: RG3 is the Browns' best option Steven Ruiz , USATODAY 5:44   \n(Photo: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports) \nRobert Griffin III has been cleared for non-contact activity after a long recovery following yet another injury in his still young NFL career. While it may take Griffin a couple of weeks to return to the field, the question has to be asked: What do the Cleveland Browns do with him over the last month of the season? \nWith the season essentially over and third-round pick Cody Kessler on the roster, it's not a given the Browns will give Griffin his starting job back. These live game reps will be valuable for not only Kessler, but also the front office and coaching staff, who will have to determine if Kessler is the guy before they head into the offseason. \nBut based on last Thursday, the Browns may have already made that decision and come to the conclusion that Kessler is not franchise quarterback material. How else would you explain Hue Jackson benching him at halftime of Cleveland's loss in Baltimore? \nJackson said he was just looking to spark the offense, but if you are committed to a young quarterback, you don't destroy his confidence in order to jolt your team in a completely meaningless game. \nThat Jackson was willing to sit Kessler bodes well for Griffin;s chances of regaining the starting job. It shows the first-year coach isn't pressed to give the rookie reps. An if that is the case, you'd have to think Griffin would be Jackson's starter after beating out Kessler and McCown in August. \nGriffin's injury history shouldn't factor into the decision. The fragile quarterback suffering another injury doesn't carry any financial risk for the team. The Browns can cut Griffin before the new league year without much of a cap penalty. \nCleveland will have to make a decision on Griffin fairly soon. Nearly $1 million of his 2017 salary becomes fully guaranteed in March . If Griffin doesn't play for the Browns in 2016, it's unlikely he will ever play for them again. I can't see Jackson giving up on a player he was reportedly \"too focused\" on reviving after just one regular season game. If Jackson truly believed Griffin could be salvaged, would one shoulder injury really convince him otherwise? \nFrom a football standpoint, Griffin still has more upside than Kessler. The rookie is accurate and makes smart decisions, but he just doesn't have enough arm strength to be a good starting quarterback in the league. Kessler's ceiling is as a high-level backup. \nGriffin, on the other hand, still possesses loads of potential - even if it is increasingly unlikely that any team will be able to unlock it. He may not see the field clearly, but coaches can scheme around that. Griffin is just as accurate as Kessler and has one of the stronger arms in the league. He's also only three years older than Kessler. \nIf there is currently a franchise quarterback on the Browns roster (there probably isn't), Griffin is the most likely candidate. That's more than enough reason for the 0-10 Browns two take a four-week flyer on Griffin this season. What do they have to lose? Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g05FEh Most Popular",

      "text": "Facebook on Wednesday acquired face recognition technology provider FacioMetrics in a move to beef up its photo and video capabilities. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nA spin-off from Carnegie Mellon University in 2015 as a response to market demand surrounding use of facial image analysis, FacioMetrics is the producer of developer tools for understanding facial behavior and demographic from videos, detection, and even letting you swap faces. It appears that all of its apps have been removed from both the App Store and Google Play store.\nCompanies that used FacioMetrics’ technology include those in the academic and industry world, such as Lightricks, Anki, Meograph, University of Kentucky, Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a “leading social networking company” — perhaps Facebook?\n“How people share and communicate is changing and things like masks and other effects allow people to express themselves in fun and creative ways,” remarked a Facebook spokesperson in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome the Faciometrics team who will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos and build even more engaging sharing experiences on Facebook .” \nThe purchase of FacioMetrics comes weeks after Facebook demonstrated Prisma-like filters for its live video product. At this year’s WSJD Live conference, chief product officer Chris Cox showcased a new app which would let you transfer the style of an artist, such as Rembrandt onto your image using Convolutional Neural Network and computer vision. It also isn’t the social networking company’s first foray into the image recognition space.\nCox explained that real-time implementation was the hardest challenge the company faced, as the program functions at 24 frames per second. “It’s taking something that’s a known technology, but it was getting it to be fast on a phone and to be able to be done at a low-enough latency, without dropping frames, stuttering, or…blurring.” The app is still in its prototyping phase, but there’s certainly an advantage to get these augmented reality filters up and running sooner than later.\nThe battle for influencers and content creators around live video is heating up and while giving people the ability to livestream is one thing, empowering them to own the experience is another. And it’s here where FacioMetrics could play an important role.\nCertainly this is impactful for Facebook, especially around its Oculus VR division and will pair well with technology gleaned through its Face.com purchase in 2012 . With Oculus, FacioMetrics’ technology could assist developers in developing more realistic-like experiences so avatars appear and respond more like the user.\nHere’s FacioMetrics’ announcement of the acquisition by its chief executive Fernando De La Torre:\nWe started FacioMetrics to respond to the increasing interest and demand for facial image analysis – with all kinds of applications including augmented/virtual reality, animation, audience reaction measurement, and others. We began our research at Carnegie Mellon University developing state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for facial image analysis. Over time, we have successfully developed and integrated this cutting-edge technology into battery-friendly and efficient mobile applications, and also created new applications of this technology.\nNow, we’re taking a big step forward by joining the team at Facebook, where we’ll be able to advance our work at an incredible scale, reaching people from across the globe. We are thrilled for our next big step forward by joining Facebook. We’d like to thank Carnegie Mellon University and our clients for their trust and support – we couldn’t have made it this far without them.\nWe are looking forward to getting started at Facebook!\n",

They oppose the US Ecology hazardous waste facility that is a few blocks from their homes. (Photo: Regina H. Boone, Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo \nA hazardous waste processing facility in Detroit — which could gain state approval to expand its storage facilities tenfold — has released excessive amounts of mercury, arsenic, cyanide and other toxic chemicals into the city sewer system more than 150 times since September 2010, a review of Great Lakes Water Authority records shows. \nUS Ecology is allowed to put pretreated chemical waste into the sewer system, but under strict, permitted requirements. \nThe Free Press, through the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, reviewed records related to the company's wastewater discharge permit going back to September 2010. The records are held by the Great Lakes Water Authority, the regional body that took over wastewater treatment operations from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department on Jan. 1. \n►Related: Yellow, foamy blob outside US Ecology was soap, company says \nThe records show frequent, sometimes alarming, violations of permitted maximum discharges on at least 20 hazardous chemicals or metals, either discovered by the authority during inspections or self-reported by US Ecology at its facility on Georgia Street near the Hamtramck border. The records also show that the company almost never provided a written explanation to Water Authority officials about why a violation occurred and why it wouldn't again in the future, a requirement of its permit. \nUS Ecology officials issued an e-mailed statement in response to Free Press requests for an interview. They stated the excessive discharges were infrequent — found in less than 1% of the more than 10,000 tests conducted over four years. \n\"While our goal is to eliminate all discharge exceedances, the ones that do occur tend to be very minor in nature and their frequency is low relative to the thousands of monitoring tests conducted annually,\" US Ecology spokesman David Crumrine said in the written statement. \n►DEQ: We don't yet know full extent of Wurtsmith Air Base contamination \nState and local regulators say the releases never threatened human health or the environment, never interfered with the wastewater treatment plant's processes, and didn't end up causing excessively toxic flows out of the plant and into the Detroit or Rouge rivers. \nBut environmental experts point to the potential cumulative environmental damage from even tiny amounts of some toxins not adequately controlled at times at the hazardous waste facility. And officials with another large Midwest city's sewer system — Milwaukee — say the number of permit violations at US Ecology raises red flags. \n\"We view anything over four or five exceedances\" in a year \"as bad news,\" said Bill Graffin, spokesman for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. \n\"The number, 150, you have there is way extreme from what we might see,\" added Sharon Mertens, director of water quality protection at Milwaukee's sewer district and head of its industrial wastewater pretreatment program. \nWhile Milwaukee's sewer system does not serve any hazardous waste processing facility, it does accept chemical waste-treaters' discharges, Mertens said. It also has a \"very large, diverse industrial base,\" Graffin said. Residents angry \nAt the center of the Detroit controversy are local residents, already wary of the hazardous waste facility's proximity to their homes, schools, churches and playgrounds. They see US Ecology's violations as a sign the company can't fully control the industrial wastes already being moved through it. That bolsters their adamant stance that the facility shouldn't be allowed to expand by a DEQ that — particularly after the Flint water crisis — they don't trust to prioritize their well-being over economic interests. \n\"I'm horrified. This is not acceptable,\" said Diane Weckerle, who's part of a coalition of area residents opposed to the facility's expansion. \n\"It makes me furious,\" said Sharon Buttry, who lives in nearby Hamtramck. \nMark Covington has lived only about a mile from the facility all of this life. \n\"Even as an adult, I didn't actually know what they did there,\" he said. \"People around here definitely don't know they are allowed to dump a certain amount in the sewer system.\" What it does \nThe US Ecology facility, at 6520 Georgia St., takes in many of the region's most toxic chemicals from industrial processes, as well as very low-level radioactive byproducts primarily from oil and gas hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Located near the Hamtramck-Detroit border on the east side, the facility is within a mile-and-a-half of a public playground, Dickinson East Elementary School, Oakland International Academy charter school, several churches and scores of residential homes. \nRecords show that US Ecology had wastewater discharge violations in eight to 10 months of every year from 2011 through 2015. While most of the more than 150 violations involved violating daily limits, at least 23 violations involved excessive averages of specific toxic chemicals over an entire month. \nWastewater sampling occurs from under a manhole cover just outside US Ecology's facility, which is upstream of the public sewer, ensuring that the company's discharges are isolated for inspection. \nThe sampling results, at times, have been startling: In October 2012, the mercury level in US Ecology's wastewater measured 0.7 parts per million — more than 3,500 times the permitted maximum. In a sampling taken in December 2010, the arsenic levels in the company's wastewater registered 53.6 parts per million, almost 350 times the permitted maximum. US Ecology was found to be in \"significant noncompliance\" when more than a third of measurements taken for titanium levels in its wastewater exceeded permitted maximums for six straight months, from March through August 2013. Many samples \nDespite some of the high numbers, Stephen Kuplicki, an industrial waste control manager with the Great Lakes Water Authority, concurred generally with US Ecology's position. \n\"Because the facility is so vigorously monitored, there are large numbers of samples taken and thousands of parameters that are tested for,\" he said. \"This can lead to what looks like a large number of exceedances simply due to the large volume of samples.\" \nThe wastewater treatment plant itself must comply with federal environmental guidelines with its discharge, and US Ecology's violations have never led to a plant violation, or interfered with treatment processes, he pointed out. \n\"The plant is able to treat US Ecology's discharge and ensure the protection of the environment,\" he said. \nIt's more important that certain discharged materials from US Ecology don't consistently exceed regulatory limits, Kuplicki said. \n\"Through our stringent monitoring, we have been able to determine that no such patterns currently exist, and US Ecology has always been able to demonstrate compliance within 30 days of their written notice through verified sampling,\" he said. \nIndeed, the records show time after time, after receiving a notice of violation, US Ecology officials remedied it by presenting their own, later sampling, conducted by a contracted laboratory, that showed the toxic chemical or metal no longer exceeded permitted maximums. \nBut compliance has often been short-lived. Records show 37 violations of titanium discharge levels from March 2011 to September 2015. After each violation — even when it was determined to be in \"significant noncompliance\" for titanium in 2013 — US Ecology was subsequently deemed back in compliance because it submitted new sampling showing a titanium level within permitted parameters — until the next violation, one to three months later. \n\"It's a mess,\" said Nicholas Schroeck, director of the Transnational Environmental Law Clinic at Wayne State University Law School. \n\"The question is, when you have a repeated lack of compliance, over and over again, are they ever actually in compliance?\" \nAmong the requirements US Ecology faces is controlling the alkalinity of its wastewater. Regulations require pH levels lower than 11.5 units. (A pH level of 7.0 is neutral, with a smaller number more acidic and a higher number more alkaline.) In an April 1 letter this year from Water Authority Interim Director David McNeely to US Ecology officials, he announced changes to the company's wastewater discharge permit to require continuous pH monitoring, after the findings from two straight months of monitoring from Oct. 7 to Dec. 6, 2015. \n\"There were 322 instances of pH noncompliance greater than 11.5 units,\" McNeely stated, adding that US Ecology staff failed to self-report any exceedances to either Detroit Water and Sewerage Department or Great Lakes Water Authority staff. \n\"It is obvious that US Ecology exercises limited control of the pH of its discharge,\" McNeely stated. \nA 2013 University of Maryland study showed acid rain and human pollution are making rivers more alkaline in the eastern U.S. \n\"It's like rivers on Rolaids,\" associate geology professor and study lead author Sujay Kaushal said in a 2013 release. \"We have some natural antacid in watersheds. In headwater streams, that can be a good thing. But we're also seeing antacid compounds increasing downriver. And those sites are not acidic, and algae and fish can be sensitive to alkalinity changes.\" \nMore alkaline waterways can mean more algae blooms and harder, more saline water, decreasing its drinkability and the difficulty in treating it. Hard to regulate \nHazardous waste processing facilities are a very difficult type of industry to regulate because of the diverse materials they collect and treat, said Jodi Peace, the DEQ's industrial pretreatment specialist. \n\"Centralized waste-treaters in general have some of the worst compliance records of any type of industry that discharges into wastewater treatment plants,\" she said. \nIn the Great Lakes Water Authority's annual report to the DEQ for 2015, four other centralized waste-treaters in addition to US Ecology received at least one notice of exceedance. \nUS Ecology's compliance is actually better now than in years past, Peace said. \n\"I've been looking at it since the mid-1990s, when it was really bad,\" she said. \"There would be many more violations, a lot of oil. There were a number of centralized waste-treaters back then who were in significant violation all the time.\" \nThe purpose of the industrial pretreatment program is to protect the sewer system from industrial wastes that might harm pipelines or infrastructure at the wastewater treatment plant, or that might interfere with the plant's processes, such as a chemical that kills off the bacteria used to eat organic wastes. \nThe maximum levels of toxic chemicals in industrial wastewater discharges are set under federal law so industries can't shop from state-to-state for more lenient standards, Peace said. They are set not only taking into consideration human health and environmental protection, but the type of industry and the wastes it produces, and the latest technologies available to reduce pollutants. \nEnsuring US Ecology complies with its discharge permit falls to the Great Lakes Water Authority. But the DEQ has inspected the US Ecology facility multiple times since September 2010, and found it in compliance with environmental law and regulations — even as discharge violations were popping up. \nViolations that aren't chronic and recurring are \"more of a naggy kind of little thing,\" Peace said. If it is not a significant noncompliance, \"it's more of the routine, 'Show us you are back in compliance.'\" \nAnd any exceedances are not passing a cost onto Detroit sewer ratepayers, Kuplicki said. \n\"The discharge does not affect the treatment costs at the plant,\" he said. \nWastes that are difficult for bacteria to break down, such as suspended solids, are what adds significant cost to wastewater treatment, Peace said. Industries like US Ecology pay a surcharge for the volumes of excess solids they introduce to the system, she said. Great Lakes Water Authority officials declined to provide the Free Press with records indicating how much US Ecology pays for sewer service. \nThe biosolids left after clarification — settling tanks at wastewater treatment plants that remove solids — have water further removed and are then incinerated, taken to landfills or processed into fertilizer that is spread on area farms, Peace said. Those biosolids are tested for metals and other pollutants per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, Peace said, and have not been found in violation. \nThe sheer volumes of wastewater moving into the Detroit sewer system — the largest single-site wastewater treatment plant in the U.S., and one of the biggest systems that combines sewage and stormwater drainage — may help explain why excessive levels in US Ecology's discharge don't amount to much upon reaching the plant. \n\"If you look at the size of the Detroit wastewater treatment plant, it would take an awful lot of anything to cause a problem — not that we're in favor of, 'Dilution is the solution,'\" Peace said. \nThat's not good enough for Wayne State's Schroeck. \n\"When US Ecology is violating these pretreatment requirements, it shows symptoms of a larger problem that they can't, for whatever reason, stay within their permit parameters that are there to make sure our waters remain usable, fishable, swimmable places to be,\" he said. \"If they can't handle it now, how are they supposed to handle it when the facility has expanded 10 times in size?\" \nA frequent violator of pretreatment requirements is \"super-unfair to the taxpayers,\" whether or not those violations are leading to water quality problems at the wastewater treatment plant or in its discharge, Mertens at the Milwaukee wastewater treatment plant said. In addition to any treatment costs, some chemical and metal discharges, in excess, can rapidly corrode sewer infrastructure, she said. \n\"There's all kinds of issues that have a cumulative effect,\" Mertens said. \"Under federal law, dilution is not the solution to pollution.\" \nThe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department conducted a visual inspection of sewer pipes outside US Ecology after a 2013 incident in which a mysterious foam rose up from a drainage basin near the facility. The foam was washed back down the drain by responding Detroit firefighters using hoses and wasn't analyzed, Peace said. The city's pipe inspection \"identified large calcium deposits\" under several manholes near US Ecology, she said. \nMercury overages are particularly troublesome, said Joel Blum, a University of Michigan professor of Earth and environmental sciences. \n\"Mercury is a toxin with unusual properties that make it a cause for concern even though the levels at the wastewater treatment plant may not be over the regulatory limits,\" he said. \nBecause mercury isn't broken down in wastewater treatment processes, it could end up in small amounts in the Detroit and Rouge rivers via discharge, or in the atmosphere as a gas after dried sludge incineration that then settles on land and water, Blum said. The metal then \"bioaccumulates\" in the food web with every creature that takes it in — a tiny aquatic insect eats the mercury, gets eaten by a small fish, which gets eaten by a medium-sized fish, which gets eaten by a larger fish, magnifying the contamination the larger and more complex the fish or animal gets. Larger fish can see an increase in mercury concentration up to a million times higher than the concentration in water, Blum said. \n\"Thus, it is not only the concentration of mercury released to waterways and the atmosphere that is important, but the total amount of mercury, even if it is present at low concentrations,\" he said. \nSuch chemicals and metals, Mertens said, \"don't just disappear.\" They have to be dealt with, one way or another. \n\"I think it's especially disturbing that a company that makes its business out of that whole concept — that you have to treat waste — is passing it along,\" she said. \"That's just not a good thing.\" \nMore needs to be done to force consistent compliance with US Ecology, said David Holtz, chairman of the nonprofit environmental group Sierra Club's Michigan Chapter. \n\"This sends a message to polluters that violating environmental rules and dumping hazardous wastes is no big deal if it happens in low-income, minority neighborhoods in Detroit,\" he said. \n\"DEQ Director Heidi Grether needs to deal with this and do so immediately. People want and deserve an environmental cop on the beat, not one that enables corporate polluters and doesn’t even let families in on the reality of what’s going on in their own neighborhood.\" New license \nThe DEQ in July 2015 announced its intention to approve a new license for US Ecology that would allow it to increase hazardous waste storage in tanks and containers from 64,000 gallons to nearly 666,000 gallons. The public outcry was large, with demonstrations held outside the plant by opposed area residents. \nRichard Conforti, the DEQ's permit engineer for the facility, said US Ecology did not ask for an expansion of its wastewater discharges, only its storage capacity. The company's permit with the Great Lakes Water Authority limits hazardous waste liquid discharges at a maximum of 144,000 gallons per day, with an overall wastewater discharge limit of 300,000 gallons per day. \n\"They would have to get that changed first before they could discharge more,\" Conforti said. \nCrumrine, the US Ecology spokesman, said there will be no increased discharges to the sewer system associated with the storage capacity increase. \nEven if such a sewer discharge increase was later allowed, the wastewater would still need to comply with permitted limits on hazardous chemical levels, Conforti said. \nAfter a delay to respond to hundreds of public comments, the DEQ is continuing to consider approving the permit to allow US Ecology to expand its storage, he said. \nMosetta Jackson, 81, lives on Concord Street, about a half-block from the US Ecology facility, and has lived in the community for more than 60 years, raising seven daughters there. She lives across from a public playground. She opposes the proposed US Ecology expansion, but doesn't expect the DEQ will listen to her and others. \n\"We're ignored because we're a poor, black neighborhood,\" she said. \"We're worried about what it's going to mean to our health.\" \nContact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

      "text": "“We’re excited to welcome the FacioMetrics team who will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos and build even more engaging sharing experiences on Facebook.” (Reuters) Facebook said that it has bought facial recognition startup FacioMetrics, potentially using the technology for photo or video effects to better challenge rival Snapchat.\n“How people share and communicate is changing and things like masks and other effects allow people to express themselves in fun and creative ways,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email reply to an AFP inquiry.\n“We’re excited to welcome the FacioMetrics team who will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos and build even more engaging sharing experiences on Facebook.”\nSilicon Valley-based Facebook did not disclose financial terms of the deal to buy FacioMetrics, which was spun out of Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania.\nFacioMetrics was founded in 2015 and specializes in using artificial intelligence to give facial image analysis capabilities to applications that run on smartphones.\nThe technology has potential in a host of applications, including those focused on animation, measuring audience reactions, and virtual or augmented realities, FacioMetrics founder and chief executive Fernando De la Torre said in a release.\n“We’re taking a big step forward by joining the team at Facebook, where we’ll be able to advance our work at an incredible scale, reaching people from across the globe,” De la Torre said.\nUsing FacioMetrics to let users of Facebook, or subsidiaries such as Instagram, have fun with photos or video could be a counter-move to those kinds of features offered in “filters” at vanishing message service Snapchat.\nParent company Snap estimates it has more than 100 million users globally of the service for sending videos, images and text messages which vanish after being viewed. Some reports say it generates 10 billion video views per day.\nSince trying unsuccessfully to buy Southern California-based Snapchat several years ago, Facebook has turned to cloning popular features.",

      "text": "Facebook moving to appease advertisers By Steve Lohr and Sapna Maheshwari / New York Times News Service Published Nov 17, 2016 at 12:02AM Facebook is moving to restore confidence among advertisers and publishers that it is accurately measuring how often and how long users see videos, news articles, ads and corporate messages on its social network. The steps, announced Wednesday, followed the company’s apology in September for an error that resulted in considerably overstating how long, on average, users spent watching videos on Facebook. Facebook said it would increase its use of outside measurement services for display and video ads. The company said it is expanding its use of metrics services like comScore, Moat, Nielsen and Integral Ad Science, and looking to add others. Facebook said it would form a “measurement council” of ad agency executives and marketers to develop metrics suited to the needs of advertisers. “This is an important evolution for Facebook,” said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group of media and technology companies, including Facebook. “This is Facebook saying, ‘Yes, we know that we need to be and are getting more involved in advertising transparency.’” The impact of the disclosure of further calculation miscues, after the September apology, is uncertain. Advertisers and publishers have little choice but to embrace Facebook given its huge audience and its dominance, with Google, of online advertising. But analysts said concerns about the accuracy of Facebook’s metrics could prompt some to question whether they should invest so much time, money and resources with the company. 15636932",

      "text": "Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections by Seth Fiegerman @sfiegerman November 17, 2016: 11:33 AM ET Fake news sites designed to trick you During the Republican primaries, Facebook's powerful data told those working to get Ted Cruz elected which ads could win over Donald Trump voters. \nOne video highlighted Trump's coziness with politicians over the years. The other featured an impassioned Cruz speech about being an outsider who could fix Washington. \nThe ads were largely informed by and distributed through Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) . Tommy Swanson, CEO of a digital marketing agency called Stripes, used Facebook's advanced advertising tools to target specific demographics and measure the impact. \n\"Going into Iowa, we already knew which creative was going to turn 40+ year-old female Carson supporters into Cruz supporters,\" says Swanson, whose agency worked with a super PAC supporting Cruz's candidacy. \nCruz won Iowa, the first state to vote in the primaries, and would go on to win three states on Super Tuesday. One of those was Texas, where Swanson's Facebook campaign led to an \"increase in intent to vote for Ted Cruz\" among those who had previously leaned Trump. \nThat point is one of many included among a group of \" success stories \" for political advertising on Facebook's official marketing page. The stories highlight how political campaigns have used Facebook advertising tools to drive increases in voter registrations, boost support among Hispanics and get voters to pick one candidate over another. \nRelated: Did the internet elect the president? \nIn short, these stories show how Facebook pitches itself as a platform to influence voting decisions just as it does with buying decisions. But you might not know that from listening to its CEO deny that rampant fake news on Facebook could have changed the way people voted in the presidential election. \n\"Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook -- of which it's a small amount of content -- influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" Mark Zuckerberg said at the Techonomy conference last Thursday. \nZuckerberg's point, as he elaborated on later in a Facebook post , was that \"only a very small amount\" of what shows up in Facebook News Feeds is fake news. \"More than 99% of what people see is authentic,\" he wrote. So how much impact could it really have on the election? \nTo some who've worked at Facebook, however, Zuckerberg's comments contradict Facebook's pitch to advertisers. \nRelated: Facebook and Google to stop ads from appearing on fake news sites \n\"In 2012, we were pitching political advertisers saying precisely that Facebook could influence voters,\" says Antonio Garcia-Martinez, who worked as an ads targeting product manager at Facebook until 2013. \"Now Zuck is going and saying, 'No that's impossible.'\" \n\"Facebook understood that it could throw an election as far back as when I was there,\" says Garcia-Martinez, author of Chaos Monkeys, about his time working in Silicon Valley. \nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment beyond Zuckerberg's public statements. \nFacebook now finds itself striking a tricky balance. Its core business is built on the premise that advertisers can use Facebook's targeting tools to show the right users the right message at the right time leading to the right outcome. \nThe same dynamic applies to political ads. Citigroup said last month that Facebook and Google would be the \"largest recipients of political digital ad spend\" from the 2016 election cycle. It even suggested Facebook could top Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) for the first time. \nOn the other hand, Facebook doesn't want to be seen as powerful enough to tip elections, deliberately or not. \nRelated: Facebook shows you what you want to see post-election \nThere is certainly a difference between influencing a few voters through ads or fake news and single-handedly deciding an election. The problem, according to former employees, is that Facebook employees don't always know the full impact that every little tweak to its platform may have on voters. \n\"This is a very powerful product that can have effects that we didn't imagine it having,\" says one former Facebook employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nGarcia-Martinez recalls one rumor that some Facebook employees were nervous about rolling out a voting prompt to iPhone users first in 2012 because itcould have benefited Obama. The reason: iPhone owners might be more likely to live on the coasts and be more liberal. \nThat might sound ridiculous -- it probably is ridiculous -- but the fear speaks to Facebook's tremendous reach and influence in all things, including voting. \nRelated: Trump win could be bad news for tech IPOs \nJudd Antin, a former research manager at Facebook, urged the company to do more surveys and analysis into the fake news problem rather than rely on broad data points like the sweeping 99% figure cited in Zuckerberg's post. \nAs Antin pointed out in a Medium post this week, that final 1% can still be quite large when you consider more than one billion people check Facebook every day. \n\"Mark and his leaders seem to have applied their own intuition with a hefty dose of bias and self-interest,\" Antin wrote. \"He jumped to conclusions about what it means and why, likely in the absence of good information about how fake news can matter.\" \n\"When data-driven becomes data-myopic, we all suffer,\" Antin added. \"I worry that Facebook's decision-making has lost its humanity. And that's frightening given the central role it plays in our world.\" CNNMoney (New York)   11:33 AM ET",

Join the Conversation Matt Zimmer , mzimmer@argusleader.com 12:53 p.m. CST November 17, 2016 \nSkyler Flatten's 15 points Wednesday night were a bright spot for SDSU (Photo: ALM) \nSouth Dakota State avoided disaster last night in their home opener, grinding out an 80-72 win over Division II Wayne State to pick up their first win of the season and first for new coach T.J. Otzelberger. \nMaybe Wayne State is a much-improved team, but still. Had the Jackrabbits lost it would’ve been one of the lowest moments in program history. Wayne State was 5-24 last year. They were picked to finish 15th in the 16-team NSIC (the only team picked beneath them, Minnesota Crookston, is SDSU’s next home opponent). Without Mike Daum the Jacks probably would have lost, perhaps convincingly. \nWhen SDSU lost its season opener 82-53 to Cal, it wasn’t exactly a catastrophe, but the fact that the Bears played that game without their best player (big man Ivan Rabb) and still dominated should’ve been something of a red flag. \nWhen they lost 73-58 to an unspectacular UC-Irvine team in their second game, it was further disappointment, but the Jacks shot so horribly (28 percent, including 5-for-30 from 3) that it was easy to write it off as simply a game where the shots didn’t fall. \nBut if the Jacks weren’t sweating those losses, the win over Wayne State clearly got their attention. Daum called it a wake-up call, and while Otzelberger did his best to find positives he looked a little shaken at the postgame press conference. Jacks struggle to pick up first win vs D2 Wayne State \nThe Jacks are shooting 33 percent as a team. King (42 percent) and Daum (40 percent) have been their best shooters. Grad transfer AJ Hess, touted as one of the best shooters in the country, has scored three points in three games. He’s 1-for-12 from the floor and 0-for-9 from deep. As a team the Jacks are 19-for-85 from 3-point land. That’s 22 percent. \n“I think the one thing I thought we’d be able to count on would be that we’d be a great shooting team from the perimeter and at this point we’ve really struggled,” Otzelberger said. “If you had asked me what would be the strength of this team I’d have thought 3-point shooting would be right near the top. Right now it’s not happening, but I still attribute it to us not getting stops.” \nIndeed, what caused problems last night against Wayne was the Jacks’ failure to get stops and get to Wildcat shooters. Wayne shot 50 percent from 3, and SDSU couldn’t use its advantages in athleticism because their poor defense robbed them of transition opportunities. \nFrom a big picture standpoint, there’s no reason to panic. It’s three games. Any Jacks fans that thought SDSU could win 25 games again this year were overly optimistic at best, delusional at worst. Yes, Daum returns as arguably the Summit League’s best player, but losing all four of the team’s primary guards (Deondre Parks, George Marshall, Jake Bittle and Keaton Moffitt) forces a team to start over in a lot of ways. It was almost stunningly apparent watching this team last night just how good Parks and Marshall really were. If Scott Nagy hadn’t left to become the coach at Wright State the Jacks would still be going through some rebuilding pains right now. A new coaching staff just makes that process harder. \nDaum struggled in the team’s first two games, though he played well last night. Tellinghuisen and Hess didn’t contribute much last night, and they need to, because it looks as though the Jacks might not be able to count on much scoring from their guards. It’s way early, but King, Cole Gentry, Andre Wallace and Michael Orris all look like players who are better off setting up others than scoring themselves. \nAnd to be fair, it looks like Otzelberger has been more concerned with trying to find working combinations and figuring out who can do what than playing to win. Orris, Lane Severyn and Adam Dykman didn’t play last night. Hess has played limited minutes. Had he wanted to, Otzelberger surely could’ve arranged the minutes for a more favorable result on the scoreboard against Wayne State. \n“We’re certainly trying different combinations,” Otzelberger said. “We settled in with a 9-man rotation (against Wayne) but we’re still trying to figure it out. We’re a work in progress. You lose four guards like the guys we had that were here last year and have a lot of new guys in new roles. And even as talented as Mike Daum is he’s going from a guy teams are aware of to the No. 1 guy on the scouting report. People are doubling and tripling him. There’s new roles and new responsibilities for people. I think guys are trying to feel their way through things and we’re trying to find the right mix.” \nDaum admitted the players are still feeling each other out. \n“It’s choppy right now but I definitely think every day on and off the court we’re getting to know the guys better and know each other’s strengths better,” Daum said. “Every day in practice guys are fighting for spots, so going into a game we don’t know who’s starting. Everyone’s got the mindset they’re still competing to be a starter. It’s good because it keeps our competitive edge up, but when we get in games guys have to play with more energy and get their roles down.” \nOtzelberger remained pretty composed during the game against Wayne State. While Nagy was no hot-head there were definitely times he could get loud, animated and in his players’ faces. TJ never did that last night, maintaining a cool head even at the lowest moments. Patience is important this early in the season, but the coach also acknowledged that his players are going to get some unfiltered feedback if things don’t improve. \nSDSU heads west this weekend to play at Wyoming and Idaho, then return to South Dakota to play in the Sanford Pentagon Showcase over Thanksgiving weekend. The Jacks do not want to fall on their faces in that event. \n“My approach is to be 100 percent honest and then be upbeat and positive to build toward where we’re going,” Otzelberger said. “There’s some things we need to address, and I’m not gonna sugarcoat it or act like those things aren’t there. We’ve got to rebound better. We’ve got to defend better. If we do those things we can push it more and be better on offense. I’m gonna be very candid with the guys, but we are just three games into this, and I’m gonna be positive, too. It’s very process-driven, so right now we’re gonna focus on what we need to do today to make us better tomorrow.” Read or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/2fAolvI Most Popular",

      "text": "Share on Facebook 7 The Shuvs, formed in 2013 and independent to this day, inject soul into Toronto's DIY movement. Their first full-length LP, Can't Find Love , shows just how far a grounded work ethic, combined with solid band chemistry, can go. The band shine when vocalist Laura Anderson takes the lead, as on the opening/title track \"Can't Find Love.\" From there, the album rarely wavers from its steady rhythm, seemingly riding a breeze through to the final track. Vocal contrasts between Anderson and guitarist Rob Nicholls provide enough variation to keep things intriguing. The album's instrumentation is tucked neatly behind the band's lyrics, which are full of nostalgic and lighthearted themes, as heard on \"Rich Cousins.\" \"Already Left\" exemplifies how a simple guitar slide can make all the difference in the world. The record's feel is pure soul groove, aided by a touch of Motown, folk and a dash of jangly guitar. In contrast to the overwhelmingly anxious music of today, Can't Find Love comes across as completely carefree. Listeners will find themselves coming around for another listen just to keep the feeling going —exactly what a lot of people could use in this era of constant restlessness. (Independent) Get It",

      "text": "Facebook is unleashing more social good tools to the community.\nThe company announced plans on Thursday for a new ‘Community Help’ feature that will help people lean on their network in times of need.\nThe feature, slated to roll out in early 2017, will pair with the company’s Safety Check tool.\nSafety Check, which has been activated 39 times by the social network since its 2014 launch, enables people to quickly notify friends and family that they’re safe in a crisis situation, like a natural disaster or terror attack. By selecting “I’m Safe,” Facebook sends an automatic notification to their network.\nCommunity Help takes that one step further by allowing people to ask for or offer help to others, from providing food and water to transportation and shelter. The Help feature is a new kind of marketplace.\nIn the wake of tragedies, people have created hashtags as a way to source housing. For example, the hashtag #PortesOuvertesNice — which means “open doors” — surfaced online following the attack in Nice, France on Bastille Day.\nNaomi Gleit — VP of social good — also announced at its Social Good Forum in New York City that the company is turning over its Safety Check feature entirely to the community.\nIn June, it rolled out a community-triggered feature that automatically activates Safety Check once a lot of people in a certain region post about a crisis situation. This is usually verified by a third-party organization that confirms an issue in the area.\nSince then, the community has activated it 335 times, including the Pulse Nightclub attack in Orlando, Florida and the Chelsea neighborhood bombings in New York City.\nFacebook is now making it easier to fundraise on the platform, too. The social network will soon bring its fundraiser tools to Facebook Live, so people can donate in real-time.",

      "text": "Facebook boosts efforts to 'do good' with new tools Barbara Ortutay, Ap Technology Writer Updated 5:10 pm, Thursday, November 17, 2016 NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is offering new tools for charity fundraising, for marking yourself safe during a crisis and for helping others — or asking for help — after a natural disaster. The social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \"The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. \"And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.\" Most Popular 28-year-old died of asphyxia after falling 20 feet in vehicle... USER POWER? A tool called \"safety check\" lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that's a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. At first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like \"was that an earthquake?\"), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. DISASTER AID Beginning early next year, a tool called \"community help\" will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as #PorteOuverte (open door) after last year's attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. But it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. CHARITY HELP Facebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money — but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation.",

      "text": "Facebook boosts efforts to 'do good' with new tools By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer Updated 0 \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is offering new tools for charity fundraising, for marking yourself safe during a crisis and for helping others — or asking for help — after a natural disaster. \nThe social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \n\"The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. \"And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.\" \nUSER POWER? \nA tool called \"safety check\" lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that's a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. \nAt first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like \"was that an earthquake?\"), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. \nDISASTER AID \nBeginning early next year, a tool called \"community help\" will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as #PorteOuverte (open door) after last year's attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. \nBut it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. \nCHARITY HELP \nFacebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money — but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation. Tags",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nIs preschool worth it? Policymakers, parents, researchers — and NPR's education team — have spent a lot of time thinking about this question. \nWe know that most pre-kindergarten programs do a good job of improving ' specific skills like phonics and counting, as well as broader social and emotional behaviors, by the time students enter kindergarten. Just this week, a study looking at more than 20,000 students in a state-funded preschool program in Virginia found that kids made large improvements in their alphabet recognition skills . \nSo the next big question to follow is, of course, Do these benefits last? \nNew research out of North Carolina says yes, they do. The study found that early childhood programs in that state resulted in higher test scores, a lower chance of being held back in a grade, and a fewer number of children with special education placements. Those gains lasted up through the fifth grade. \nThe research, published this week in the journal Child Development , studied nearly 1 million North Carolina students who attended state-funded early childhood programs between 1995 and 2010, and followed them through fifth grade. \nThey concluded that the benefits from these programs grew or held steady over those five years. And when the researchers broke the students down into subgroups by race and income — they found that all of those groups showed gains that held over time. \n\"Pre-kindergarten and early education programs are incredibly important,\" says Kenneth Dodge, the lead author on the study and the director of the Duke Center for Child and Family Policy. \"Especially for parents, for business leaders — because of the workforce development aspect — and for policy makers who are spending the money on it.\" \nThis new research confirms what researchers recently found in Tulsa, Okla. – one of the most highly regarded preschool programs in the country. In that study, children who attended Head Start had higher test scores on state math tests up through eighth grade. \nEearlier studies have found the positive effects fade as students move into elementary school — this large study from Vanderbilt is one of them . \nThe big difference between the long-term findings in North Carolina and Tulsa and the fade out in Tennessee, researchers say, is the quality of the preschool program. \nHaving a high-quality program is key, says Dodge. \"The long-term impact,\" he says, \"depends entirely on quality and how well elementary schools build on the foundations set in pre-K.\" \nNorth Carolina's state-funded program, known as NC Pre-K, has been praised as a model for other states. \nExperts cite several key elements in \"high-quality\" preschool: small class sizes, student-directed learning and lots of open-ended play. And r esearchers have warned that outcomes are short-lived when those elements are not present. \n\"I think that the question is turning away from whether we should do pre-kindergarten and instead to how should we do pre-kindergarten,\" says Dodge. \nWhile President Obama made universal, high-quality preschool a priority, it's unclear at this early stage whether that focus will continue in the Trump administration. Conversations about broad changes may continue to happen more at the state and local level. \nMost states have some version of pre-K — 42 states plus the District of Columbia had state-funded programs in the 2014-2015 school year, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research, based at Rutgers University. \n\"I don't think we can anticipate that the federal government is going to roll out a single universal preschool program,\" says Dodge. \"The reality is that preschool is becoming a state and local and community initiative.\" \nDodge says that's why research looking at these state programs – which often vary in size, quality and funding – is so important.

The social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \"The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. \"And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.\" VIDEOS TOP JOBS USER POWER? A tool called \"safety check\" lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that's a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. At first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like \"was that an earthquake?\"), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. DISASTER AID Beginning early next year, a tool called \"community help\" will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as (hash)PorteOuverte (open door) after last year's attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. But it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. CHARITY HELP Facebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money — but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation.",

The company’s latest acquisition, FacioMetrics , has the ability to track faces and recognize various emotions and, Facebook could expand this technology into various applications, including special effects in videos and photos. \nFilter apps that allow users to add masks and other special effects to their images and videos have grown in popularity. With the addition of FacioMetrics, Facebook can begin to offer similar services. \n“We’re excited to welcome the FacioMetrics team, who will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos, and build even more engaging sharing experiences on Facebook,” a spokesperson for Facebook said in an email. \nMore: Facebook now lets Pages access Instagram and Messenger interactions in one place \nThe financial details of the deal were not publicly released, but Facebook has already discontinued FacioMetrics’ products and removed them from the App Store. For now, the FacioMetrics website bears only a message about acquisition. \nFacioMetrics founder and CEO Fernando De la Torre said, “We’re taking a big step forward by joining the team at Facebook, where we’ll be able to advance our work at an incredible scale, reaching people from across the globe.” FacioMetrics was created to meet the demand for various facial image applications, including virtual and augmented reality, animation, and audience reaction measurement. FacioMetrics was born after De la Torre joined the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where he used IntraFace software released by CMU’s Human Sensing Lab, in 2003. \nFacioMetrics isn’t the first company that Facebook has bought in an attempt to compete with services like Snapchat that allow users to enhance photos and videos. Facebook acquired Masquerade Technologies, another company that adds special effects to users’ images, in March,.",

      "text": "Fake news: Facebook, Google screening news is good Fake news: Facebook, Google screening news is good In the internet age, social media campaigns have become a powerful tool of political campaign. By: The Financial Express | Published: November 17, 2016 6:15 AM Fake news was being generated on social media platforms even before the US election, but the poll results have shone the spotlight on the issue. (Source: Reuters) \nIn the internet age, social media campaigns have become a powerful tool of political campaign. So, while Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were arguing in the presidential debates, their supporters and the social media machinery were busy countering their arguments and, in some cases, even “creating” news to garner votes. Fake news was being generated on social media platforms even before the US election, but the poll results have shone the spotlight on the issue. One, because this was the first election in the country that engaged social networks like Facebook and Twitter like never before, and two, because the propaganda somehow eclipsed news on most of these sites. So, even if Trump was not supported by Pope Francis and did not win the popular vote, stories that went viral via Facebook and featured in the listing of Google News had users believe otherwise. \nThis has led people to question the trustworthiness of these platforms. Google and Facebook have done well to announce a ban on fake news sources to restore their credibility, but they will have to do more than just banning a few to not end up like Twitter, which has not been able to control online abuse and cyber-bullying on its platform. Although these websites have maintained a neutral stance till now, with social media becoming important aggregators of news, they need to self-regulate what is posted and promoted. That may play a havoc with advertising revenues—Google earns revenue from sites promoting themselves via its AdSense service—but that is an issue it will have to deal with in order to retain users; it will have to choose whether to introduce filters for AdSense that screen out fake content or make disclaimers regarding the veracity of the story more prominent.

      "text": "Facebook boosts efforts to 'do good' with new tools By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer Updated 7 hrs ago \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is offering new tools for charity fundraising, for marking yourself safe during a crisis and for helping others — or asking for help — after a natural disaster. \nThe social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \n\"The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. \"And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.\" \nUSER POWER? \nA tool called \"safety check\" lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that's a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. \nAt first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like \"was that an earthquake?\"), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. \nDISASTER AID \nBeginning early next year, a tool called \"community help\" will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as #PorteOuverte (open door) after last year's attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. \nBut it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. \nCHARITY HELP \nFacebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money — but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation. Tags",

      "text": "Share on Facebook © K Martinko -- The curious stingless honey bees of the Yucatan, Mexico \nHow did honey go from being the world's most important food to an undervalued afterthought? Gastropod explores why this happened. \nHoney is one of those ordinary pantry staples that we take for granted, and yet it used to be one of the world’s most important foods. This makes it an excellent topic for exploration on Gastropod , a collection of podcasts hosted by Nicola Twilley and Cynthia Graber, that explore food from an historical and scientific perspective. \nGastropod’s 45-minute podcast, called “ The Buzz on Honey ,” is a fascinating journey into an ingredient that once featured prominently in the lives of our ancestors, but has now become as ordinary as butter and jam—a most unfortunate loss. \nAlthough there is evidence of wild honey-seeking by humans as far back as 6,000 B.C.E., the earliest records of domesticated beekeeping date to 2450 B.C.E. , on an ancient Egyptians bas-relief. Described by entomologist Gene Kritsky, author of Tears of Re: Beekeeping in Ancient Egypt , this image is the first to depict honey bees being kept in an artificial cavity. \nHoney was so valuable in Egypt at the time that it was used as currency. Marriage vows included a husband’s promise to provide his new wife with honey. There was even a civil service devoted to honey. The Egyptians knew how to use smoke to calm bees, although they wouldn’t have understood the science behind inhibiting the bees’ chemical communication and preventing them from panicking. \nLater, the ancient Romans used honey, and honey still features in many modern Italian recipes from that region, according to Hattie Ellis, author of cookbook Spoonfuls of Honey . The 1100s, however, were the peak of honey consumption, with Europeans eating an estimated 4.5 pounds of honey per person each year. It was the only source of sweetness at the time. (While dates are sweeter, they require a hot, dry climate to grow.) Consumption dropped to less than a half-pound per person per year at the turn of the 20th century, having lost its supremacy to sugar. \nMonasteries were the main beekeepers in the Middle Ages, as Europe’s immense, dark cathedrals required beeswax for illumination. Beeswax, unlike tallow made from animal fat, burns bright and clean, leaving almost no ash. It wasn’t until 1900 that the Pope allowed churches to burn non-beeswax candles, which meant that monks had a big responsibility to produce sufficient beeswax. A related benefit, of course, was the mead (fermented honey) that they were able to drink on the side! \nstorebrukkebruse -- Beeswax tapers / CC BY 2.0 \nHoney is a natural antibacterial substance, used since Egyptian times to heal cuts and burns. Because it contains so little water, it can kill yeast and other bacteria by sucking water right out of the cells. Certain kinds of honey even react with human bodily fluids to produce hydrogen peroxide, a natural antiseptic. It’s not hard to see why the Egyptians considered honey to have magical powers. \nBees themselves are incredible little creatures. They collect both nectar (sugars) and pollen (essentially plant sperm, rich in lipids and protein). The pollen is used to feed their young and the nectar is inserted into wax cells where the water evaporates, the sugars are broken down, and the bees are left with a rich source of carbohydrates—basically, energy goo—with which they can survive the long winters. \nClimate change, pesticides, and mites, however, are wreaking havoc with bee populations. Every year in the United States, colonies lose 30 to 40 percent of their population on average. The losses appear to have stabilized in recent year, but bees are far from safe. \nThe podcast calls on consumers to appreciate honey, to realize its incredibly rich history and uniqueness, and to do whatever we can to preserve bee populations, both honey bees and the other 20,000 bee species that exist. The best thing one can do? Plant flowers and do not spray them. \nTake a listen here , and your morning toast with honey will never be the same. Related on TreeHugger.com:",

(Photo: DOMENECH CASTELLO, EPA) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Bob Dylan, who was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature but won't be attending the prize ceremony, likely will travel to Stockholm next year and might give his Nobel Lecture then, the Swedish Academy said Friday. \nDylan likely will give a concert in the Swedish capital, offering \"a perfect opportunity to deliver his lecture,\" the academy said. The Swedish Academy awards the Nobel Prize for literature. \nSara Danius, the organization's permanent secretary, told Swedish public radio Friday that the Nobel Foundation's rules for laureate lectures are \"flexible.\" Dylan can deliver his as \"a written speech, a spontaneous discourse, a film,\" or another format of his choosing, Danius said. \nIn 2004, Austrian playwright and Nobel literature prize winner Elfriede Jelinek stayed home because of social phobia. Her lecture was pre-recorded, and shown on video in Stockholm. \nDylan has said he cannot attend the Dec. 10 prize ceremony, pleading other commitments.",

      "text": "\nJust a couple of weeks ago, Facebook made industry news when technology reporters discovered a Jobs tab on their business page. The social network later confirmed that it was experimenting with a suite of sourcing tools to capitalize on the boom in social recruiting. Workforce industry experts believe that Facebook may be trying to muscle in on LinkedIn’s sacred grounds. However, even bigger revelations came November 15 when Google announced its own foray into the realm of talent acquisition — a move that staffing insiders have been predicting for some time. The fascinating twist with Google is that the Internet giant has no plans to build a standalone technology, such as a branded applicant tracking system (ATS), online recruitment platform or vendor management system (VMS). Instead, Google is offering “Cloud Jobs API,” which allows workforce technology developers to integrate robust machine learning features into their systems.\nWhat Is Cloud Jobs API? Google is promoting its targeted API as a powerful job search and discovery platform dedicated to improving processes in the talent industry. Machine learning forms the core of the technology and its potential boon to staffing professionals. Google describes the innovation on its site :\nCompany career sites, job boards and applicant tracking systems can improve candidate experience and company hiring metrics with job search and discovery powered by sophisticated machine learning. The Cloud Jobs API provides highly intuitive job search that anticipates what job seekers are looking for and surfaces targeted recommendations that help them discover new opportunities.\nTo ensure that users receive the most relevant search results and recommendations, the API relies on Google’s advances in machine learning to understand how job titles and skills correlate. It then compiles the data to determine the closest match between job content, location and seniority.\nThe Value of Cloud Jobs API Meaningful Search Results When Google first launched its search functionality, it revolutionized the Internet. It masked cutting-edge algorithms in a simple interface, which delivered the most comprehensive and relevant results available — and disrupted an entire industry. Google is no longer just a technology solutions provider, it’s become a cultural institution. Now, it’s expanding that reach into our industry.\nRecruiters today still face challenges with cumbersome job boards, muddled sourcing systems and attempts to cull vital information from a lot of digital noise. That’s precisely what Google intends to help them overcome.\nAs Google explains: “Job postings are often worded in industry- and company- specific jargon that job seekers don’t search for. Cloud Jobs API provides intuitive job search that surfaces relevant opportunities by leveraging a complete graph of how job titles, skills, and seniority relate to one another.”\nDynamic Job Discovery The inherent machine learning in Cloud Jobs API promises to bring big data directly to users, while compacting it into right-sized data. Google’s platform will monitor job searching behavior and the data present in career path progressions to suggest opportunities. It will also recommend additional roles that are aligned to a job seeker’s skill sets and interests. As the API collects more information, it can render more accurate assessments.\nBecause cultural fit has taken precedence with candidates, recruiters, hiring managers and contingent workforce leaders alike, Cloud Jobs API could streamline the process of creating ideal matches.\nSimple Integration and Other Features Simplicity in user functionality has always been a hallmark of Google. The company assures staffing industry technology providers that integrating the API is a fairly effortless undertaking. Despite this ease, however, the API will continue to support a wide range of critical features.\nSynonym and acronym expansion : The system can incorporate relevant results even when job postings are written in company specific terms, industry jargon or acronyms that candidates may not be familiar with. Job enrichment : Results are optimized with enhanced content that includes additional details about location, employment type, benefits and more. Geographical data : Tapping into the power of Google’s robust geolocation systems, Cloud Jobs API will interpret countless forms of location data to help users refine their searches. “From street address to colloquial regions (Bay Area, Research Triangle) to precise geo-coordinates,” Google writes, the platform will enable “fine grained job filtering based on distance and commute times.” Seniority alignment : Google says the API understands the seniority requirements of positions and returns only the relevant results. Dynamic recommendations : The API encourages users to mark which jobs they liked and which they considered poor fits. The “recommendation engine” records these inputs and factors them into future searches for optimized suggestions. How Does Cloud Jobs API Work? Ontological Structure \n“At the heart of Cloud Jobs API,” Google explains , “there are two main proprietary ontologies that encode knowledge about occupations and skills, as well as relational models between these ontologies.” For the sake of avoiding confusing tech terms, let’s just call these “ontologies” data models.\nThe first data model deals with occupation. It includes about 30 general job categories (e.g., accounting and finance, human resources, hospitality, etc.), over 1,000 occupational families (e.g., database administrators), and 250,000 specific job titles.\nThe second data model focuses on skills. Google claims that it can define and organize about 50,000 hard and soft skill sets with different types of relationships. Basically, it seems to produce an analogy along the lines of “this hard skill is related to this soft skill.” Or, as an example, we could say “customer service is related to strong interpersonal communication skills.”\nMachine Learning Of course, the breakthrough of Cloud Jobs API comes from access to Google’s machine learning algorithms, which play a predominant role in driving the performance of talent acquisition strategies. The first step involves cleansing job titles. Google’s API is programmed to standardize the titles it sees, which represents a huge benefit to job seekers and job posters.\nThe APi initially removes language not directly related to the occupation’s definition. This includes location, employment type, salary details, company names, advertising phrases and “administrative jargon.”\nNext, the API takes the scrubbed job descriptions and attempts to recognize actual occupations from vague expressions. Google illustrates the process with an example: “The title ‘retail sales’ maps to the broad category ‘Sales and Retail,’ while a ‘flooring installer’ job title encompasses ‘carpet installer,’ ‘floor layer,’ and ‘tile and marble setter’ occupation families.” The system can detect titles that are not occupations and assign a confidence score to the mappings.\nAfter these processes, machine learning takes over and supports the following functions:\nIdentifying an occupation based on a candidate’s search queries and then matching them to the occupation data model with a confidence score. Mapping job titles in postings to relevant roles in the occupation data model with a confidence score. Detecting specific skills in candidate search queries and matching them to values in the skills data model. Extracting relevant skills from job postings and matching them to values in the skills data model. Computing the relationship between occupations and skills. Who’s Already Using Cloud Jobs API? According to ERE Editor-in-Chief Todd Raphael, three big industry firms have already incorporated the API into their systems: Dice, CareerBuilder and Jibe . In his article, Todd provides insights from this early batch of Google partners. The results enjoyed by CareerBuilder are particularly compelling and seem to hint at great potential for the API.\nDice. The company says it was selected “specifically for its technology focus and position in the technology community.”\nCareerBuilder. Google says that CareerBuilder created “a prototype in just 48 hours, found improved, more accurate results when compared to its existing search algorithm.” Google gives an example of a search for “part time” and how the results are “richer” because of the use of synonyms like PT. CareerBuilder appears to be just testing the tool and later expanding it to greater use among its customers.\nJibe, whose CEO Joe Essenfeld says, “With the launch of Google Cloud Jobs API, Google machine learning will become the standard for career sites” and is a cornerstone of the company’s candidate experience platform. Jibe says career site/ATS users — job candidates, in other words — will get better search results as Jibe integrates Google with career sites.\nA New, Data-Driven Frontier for Hiring and Staffing Google’s Cloud Jobs API is definitely a gift to staffing industry professionals and candidates. Workforce solutions providers will be able to integrate the platform into their own systems to create a more vivid way to hire exceptional talent. However, I believe Google’s approach has accomplished something even more important.\nStaffing technology companies are facing fierce competition these days. Big VMS providers, for example, are acquiring other tech offerings and growing to levels where smaller players struggle to stay afloat. Meanwhile, lean and savvy startups have circulated new offerings into the market, such as freelance management systems, online recruitment platforms and a variety of tools that target niche groups. Existing workforce technology providers are scrambling to incorporate the latest modules and remain relevant.\nGoogle probably could have built its own machine and just dominated the space. It didn’t. Instead, Google chose to become a great equalizer. The API gives tech players of all sizes the chance to benefit from its enhanced functionality. It will be exciting to see how this offering helps reshape our industry in the coming months and drives performance to unprecedented heights.\n",

      "text": "Facebook boosts efforts to 'do good' with new tools \nPosted 6:00 p.m. yesterday   You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK — Facebook is offering new tools for charity fundraising, for marking yourself safe during a crisis and for helping others — or asking for help — after a natural disaster. \nThe social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \n\"The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. \"And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.\" \nUSER POWER? \nA tool called \"safety check\" lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that's a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. \nAt first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like \"was that an earthquake?\"), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. \nDISASTER AID \nBeginning early next year, a tool called \"community help\" will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as #PorteOuverte (open door) after last year's attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. \nBut it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. \nCHARITY HELP \nFacebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money — but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation. \n ",

      "text": "\"It’s a nice, high energy place to work,\" Reynar says. Sarah Jacobs If you're looking for an especially quiet place to escape, the office library offers just that. Sarah Jacobs We asked Reynar about the culture. As we passed this sign, he explained that traditions like \"hackathons\" are crucial for helping the company to maintain its startup feel as it grows. Sarah Jacobs Another thing Facebook is famous for: the food. Sarah Jacobs We saw several snack bars around the office throughout our tour. All food and drinks are completely free (and unlimited!) for employees. Sarah Jacobs Facebook staffs a culinary team that works out of a fully-equipped commercial kitchen. Favorites include the pizza station, the salad bar, and the frozen yogurt, which is made in the office. The office even employs a pastry chef. Sarah Jacobs \"The food is great and the menu is different every day, which is really nice,\" Reynar says. \"We get breakfast, lunch, dinner and coffee. You don't always have to go out to a restaurant.” However, he notes that Facebook also encourages its employees to get out and explore the surrounding neighborhood establishments. Sarah Jacobs Facebook is in the process of building a second cafeteria in their New York office. Until construction is done, Facebook employees are enjoying meals from these subway-themed food trucks. Sarah Jacobs The perks aren't limited to the food. Employees can also enjoy board games or virtual reality sessions in the office. Sarah Jacobs Employees can also hit up this free vending machine if they ever need batteries, a new mouse, or a new keyboard. Sarah Jacobs But this office's defining trait is its art. There are creative works scattered throughout the floors, created by visiting artists and employees alike. Sarah Jacobs Employees can design and print their own posters to decorate the walls at the office's analog research laboratory. Sarah Jacobs There are also murals and posters around every corner. Much of the art reflects Facebook's values. These posters demonstrate the tech giant's support of gay pride ... Sarah Jacobs ... as does this colorful flower wall. \"There’s a lot of art that’s influenced by openness, connectedness, and the company mission of connecting the world,\" Reynar says. Sarah Jacobs “Rather than just going out and buying cool art and hanging it up somewhere, we get the artist to come in and make the art here,\" Reynar says. \"It’s kind of fun because not only do the employees get to hang out and chat with the artist about what they’re doing and why, but Facebook sort of gets to influence the theme somewhat.\" Sarah Jacobs Sometimes, decorating the office also allows for teams to collaborate on fun projects. These \"space hacks\" involve figuring out creative ways to design or utilize spaces. This purple electrical display on the left is one space hack. Sarah Jacobs Here's another space hack, where employees set up a costume wall. Sarah Jacobs Reynar says he watched from his desk as an artist painted this mural, which is a physical manifestation of the crowdsourced \"Manhattan Memories Map\" — a global project that asked New Yorkers to share memories on Facebook or Instagram using the hashtag #manhattanmemoriesmap. Sarah Jacobs \nSource: Facebook One of the most remarkable pieces of art hangs in the staircase between the eighth and seventh floors. This piece incorporates thousands of strands of thread connecting the ceiling to the floor. As you walk up the stairs, it shimmers and appears to move. Sarah Jacobs \"I think both the kind of colorful nature of the space and all the comfortable seating and the art in particular would surprise a lot of people,\" Reynar says. \"It's a little more vibrant than you might expect.\" Sarah Jacobs Before we left, we checked out one final perk: a fantastic view of New York City. Reynar says that the Manhattan office's eclectic, industrial look is meant to both provide employees with a positive, vibrant workspace and reflect the motto, \"this journey is 1% finished.\" \"It’s supposed to look like a work in progress,\" Reynar told Business Insider. \"We're only getting started.\" Sarah Jacobs",

Take a look at our favorite jokes, then vote for yours at opinion.usatoday.com. USA TODAY Opinion_Eileen Rivers Stephen Colbert (Photo: Paul Zimmerman, Getty Images for Montclair Film) \nHad your fill of debates over the outcome of Election 2016? Tired of hearing about President-elect Donald Trump's transition team? Turned off by protesters? Stephen Colbert suggests a move that might give you the escape you need. No, not to Canada, but to Colorado. \nDenver is the first city where voters have given a thumbs up to making pot a side dish — sort of. The recreational drug can now be used in bars and restaurants. Or, as Stephen Colbert put it, waiters will have to ask: \"Would you like to get fried\" with that? Restaurant goers have to bring their own pot, and it can only be used inside the restaurant if it's not smoked. They may be able to smoke in designated areas outside. \nSound too restrictive? Conan O'Brien suggests one advantage for pot smokers who have bad tickers in today's Punchlines, above. \nTake a look at our favorite jokes from last night's late-night lineup, then vote for yours in the quick poll to the right.

This contradicts two prevailing stereotypes about millennials — that they’re hopelessly addicted to social media and wary of using credit. \nThe surprising result, however, is emblematic of the positive view of credit held by people seeking to improve their borrowing power. In the “Capital One Credit Confidence Study,” released Oct. 20, 81 percent of respondents said they believe they are able to improve their credit. The study polled 2,300 people who are new to credit, building their score or rebuilding their credit, Capital One said in a news release. \nBelow are a few other interesting attitudes people have toward credit. People are just as comfortable talking about their credit as they are discussing sex, God and politics. When asked which of a handful of taboo topics would be fair game to talk about with strangers, 24 percent said credit. Twenty-seven percent said religion, 26 percent said their love lives and 24 percent said politics. Good credit means you’re a good person. Seventy percent of respondents said good credit is a reflection of hard work, and nearly half said your credit score is a reflection of your personal character. Your credit determines your social status. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe people with good credit get special treatment, while 55 percent said those with bad credit are treated like second-class citizens. Credit is a ladder to success, but it’s no thrill ride. Capital One said the people who were surveyed used a variety of words to describe what credit means to them. Lots of them said “opportunity” (47 percent) and “flexibility” (44 percent), but few said “exciting” (18 percent). Furthermore, when asked what emoji would best describe their credit, only 11 percent said “fist pump,” compared to 32 percent for “thumbs-up” and 23 percent for “smiley face.” \nThe study also shows that many consumers are misinformed about how credit scoring works. Nearly a third believe closing an unused card is good for your credit. Closing a card, however, can reduce the average age of your accounts, which makes up 15 percent of your credit score. Slim majorities of respondents believe carrying a balance and paying your cellphone bill on time are score-building habits. Actually, it’s important to keep balances low relative to your credit limits. Meanwhile, things such as rent, utility and phone bill payments are not reported to credit bureaus, but long overdue bills can ultimately show up on your credit report. More than a quarter believe checking your credit report lowers your credit score . It does not, but when a lender pulls your credit report, it results in a hard inquiry. That can temporarily lower your score by a few points. \nIt’s clear that many Americans place a high value on good credit and believe they can achieve it. Misinformation, however, is a real barrier to improving your credit score. If you’re new to credit, achieving an excellent score takes a little research and a lot of responsible financial behavior. \nThankfully, none of us will ever face as big a gut check as being asked to delete your Facebook page in exchange for excellent credit. \nNote: Capital One’s poll was conducted online, and all respondents were screened to verify eligibility and ensure a diverse mix of credit histories. Since it is not a random scientific survey, the study does not have a margin of error calculation. ",

      "text": "Terrence Horan/MarketWatch \nDear Moneyologist, \nI love my sister. She is a great person and has always been supportive of me in my life. \nWe were very close growing up and often socialized together. She got married in her early 30s and had three children, and married a man who works on Wall Street. She spends her time lunching with friends, taking vacations to St. Bart’s in the winter and the Hamptons in the summer, and cataloguing her life like it was a magazine spread in Country Life one day and Harper’s Bazaar the next. I don’t like her very much these days. She spends her time cataloguing her life like it was a magazine spread in Country Life one day and Harper’s Bazaar the next. ‘Sister’ in D.C. \nI love her, like I said. We are family, after all. But I don’t like her very much these days. She is rich (not her fault) and entitled (has no idea how the other half live.) I am happy for her and I enjoy my job (I’m a teacher) but I am nearly 40 and single, and find myself groaning and shaking my head when I see her photos. Then look around my one-bedroom apartment and wonder, ‘Where did I go wrong?’ My sister appears to have no sensitivity about other people’s real lives. \nI feel like a voyeur in her life rather than a participant. \nSister in D.C. \nDear Sister, \nIt’s interesting that you can read Harper’s Bazaar or Country Life and feel not a pang of jealousy or self-pity, but you look at your sister frolicking all over Instagram and Facebook and — bam! — the Green Eyed Monster hits you right where it hurts. Often times, we can feel in competition with one person, and yet can lose ourselves in the excessive consumption of someone else. You might buy Lady Gaga’s new perfume or read about The Kardashians on TMZ, but the smell of your sister’s perfume reminds you of everything you don’t have and, perhaps, the glamorous life you would like to lead. Pick up the phone and see her. You may get a peek behind the online fiction and discover that she has some real problems. \nIn his book, “Status Anxiety,” the philosopher Alain De Botton asks why some successes bother us, while others don’t: “Given the vast inequalities we are daily confronted with, the most notable feature of envy may be that we manage not to envy everyone. There are people whose enormous blessings leave us wholly untroubled, even as others’ negligible advantages become a source of relentless torment for us. We envy only those who we feel ourselves to be like — we envy only members of our reference group.” That’s why we can leave our school reunion nursing a “violent sense of misfortune.” \nRead: This academic study of people who post selfies confirms everything you suspect When your sibling is richer than you \nSocial media can keep siblings in touch with each other's lives but what happens when a more successful sibling causes envy? Moneylogist Quentin Fottrell discusses. \nThen there’s the medium through which you’re viewing your sister’s seemingly charmed life. Plenty of research suggests that consuming photo after photo on social media can make us feel deeply resentful about other people’s lives. Those who used Facebook longer than others agreed more with the notion that other people were happier and led better lives, and agreed less that life is fair, according to a 2012 study of 425 Facebook users — “They Are Happier and Having Better Lives than I Am: The Impact of Using Facebook on Perceptions of Others’ Lives” — by researchers at Utah Valley University. \nAlso see: When death meets Facebook: Social networkers upstage the deceased \nMore than one-third of respondents reported predominantly negative feelings, such as frustration, with their online activities, a 2013 German study of 600 Facebook users found. “Access to copious positive news and the profiles of seemingly successful ‘friends’ fosters social comparison that can readily provoke envy,” the study — “Envy on Facebook: A Hidden Threat to Users’ Life Satisfaction” — concluded. Social networks give unprecedented access to other people’s lives, much more than is available offline. This, it said, can lead to more photos and competition, which can lead to an “envy spiral.” \nHow does this help you? Hide your sister’s news feed on Facebook, unfollow her on Instagram (if she has a lot of followers, she may not notice) and pick up the phone and see her. You may get a peek behind the online fiction and discover that she has some real problems that are troubling her right now. Or you might see that she is blissfully free of any worries and, perhaps, even find yourself relieved that your beloved sister is healthy and happy, and has the luxury to blithely go about her life. You may count her blessings, rather than her money, to paraphrase Dolly Parton, and realize that you are among her blessings, too. \nRead: Lonely people share too much on Facebook \nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

      "text": "Filed in: Education , News (Photo: Facebook) \nA video circulating on Facebook is showing one amazing black girl schooling her teaching about racism. \nWhen the video begins, you know it’s going to be good, because as soon as the teacher tries to talk over her, this young woman isn’t having it, saying, “I let you talk; you’re gonna let me talk.” \nShe then goes on to explain racism: “I’m sorry this is the way it is. It is f***ed up. But white people control everything. And that’s not fair. And when anybody, any other minority, tries to say anything about it or change it, we’re complaining or we’re ungrateful.” \n–White teacher calls students ‘broke a** ni**ers who’ll get shot’– \nShe then tries to continue, speaking to a comment the teacher had made before the video began about immigration, claiming there were “too many Latinos,” and when the teacher tries to argue that he did not say anything like that, others in the classroom pipe up with, “Yes, you did!” and another arguing “You want to preserve ‘American culture.'” \nThe brilliant student then goes on to say that “there is no American culture” before continuing, “And because you are white and you are so closed-minded, you refuse to accept that.” \nThe brilliant student then goes on to say that “there is no American culture” before continuing, “And because you are white and you are so closed-minded, you refuse to accept that.” \n“Don’t tell me I’m closed-minded,” the teacher insists. \n“Everything you’ve said to me is closed-minded,” she replies. \n“Just because I don’t agree with you doesn’t mean I’m closed-minded.” \n“I’ve had conversations with people that don’t agree with me,” she counters. “But if they at least listen and try to accept, but you’re not accepting the truth.” \n“Why do I have to accept what you think is right? Why?” asks the teacher, raising his voice. \n“You need to accept the truth, not what I think is right, what’s actually happening,” she shoots back. \nTalking over her, the teacher says, “And let me tell you one other thing. You said white people have everything, control of everything. Who is the president of the United States right now?” \nThe girl then stands up, clearly frustrated as she starts to list off, “With a white Congress, with a white Senate, with white everything else! He doesn’t have control of everything.” As the classroom bursts into murmurs of agreement, the teacher tries to shush them before looking to the girl speaking out. \n“Do you have to scream?” he asked. \n“Yes, because I’m mad.” Related Posts",
