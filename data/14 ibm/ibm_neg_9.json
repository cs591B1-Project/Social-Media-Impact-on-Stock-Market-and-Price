      "text": "Electrical engineer Erich Bloch, IBM pioneer, 91 Updated November 28, 2016 10:43 PM By The Washington Post \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nErich Bloch, an electrical engineer who helped usher in the era of modern computing during three decades with IBM, and who later directed hundreds of millions of federal dollars toward scientific and technological innovation as director of the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, died Friday at his home in Washington, D.C. He was 91. \nThe cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, said his daughter, Rebecca Rosen. \nThe only child in a German-Jewish family, Bloch was orphaned during the Holocaust, survived the war years in Switzerland at a home for young refugees, and immigrated to the United States in 1948. He put himself through night school while pumping gas and cleaning laboratory equipment. \nIn 1952, he joined IBM in New York, where he established himself as a pre-eminent engineer in computing — and where he sharpened a competitive streak that he took to the sometimes fusty halls of government. As NSF director from 1984 to 1990, Bloch was credited with transforming the agency from a benefactor mainly of pure research into an engine of practical advancement. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nBloch was the first NSF director without a doctoral degree. His qualifications lay in his achievements at IBM, where he helped mastermind revolutionary developments in computing. \nHe was chief engineer of the company’s “Stretch” supercomputer, so named because it stretched what were then the limits of computing. Introduced in 1961 with a $10 million price tag, it was used initially by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Security Agency and was the most powerful computer at the time. \nLater that decade, Bloch helped develop the IBM System/360, a family of models that are the ancestors of today’s mainframes. Fred Brooks, one of two IBM colleagues who shared with Bloch a 1985 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, credited him with managing the development of the computer’s processing chips, called Solid Logic Technology. \nBloch also oversaw the creation of NSFNET, a precursor to the modern internet, and the establishment at universities of Engineering Research Centers as well as Science and Technology Centers — long-term collaborations among the public, private and academic sectors to tackle complex matters such as lasers applications and earthquake prediction and engineering.

      "text": " 00 AM EST EnOcean Alliance and IBM join forces to standardize intelligent building solutions for the Internet of Things The EnOcean Alliance expands and strengthens its position in building automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) \nSAN RAMON, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/29/16 -- The EnOcean Alliance has significantly expanded, and strengthened its programme in building automation and the Internet of Things with IBM supporting the EnOcean Alliance as a Promoter Member. \nThe EnOcean Alliance is a consortium of more than 400 companies which standardize and develop intelligent building solutions integrating energy harvesting wireless technology. Together, IBM and the EnOcean Alliance will bring sensors to the cloud and develop self-powered solutions as a standard for the Internet of Things. \nEnOcean-based sensors and devices operate large numbers of IoT devices efficiently and supply reliable data to IoT systems. Furthermore, the EnOcean Alliance offers the benefit of a broad, proven ecosystem of interoperable energy harvesting wireless sensor solutions, which are available for intelligent buildings worldwide. These solutions help optimize the utilization of buildings, create new service models and make buildings more flexible, more energy-efficient and altogether more cost-effective. \nSelf-powered wireless solutions Using the sub 1 GHz band (ISO/IEC 14543-3-1X), the EnOcean wireless standard is perfectly suited for use in building automation and smart homes worldwide. In contrast to other wireless products that require batteries and their associated maintenance problems, EnOcean-based devices are self-powered and enable a 'fit and forget' sensor solution. Energy harvesters gain energy from the surrounding environment, including motion, light or temperature differences, to power wireless modules. This energy harvesting principle makes the devices maintenance-free. \nConnected to the cloud The IBM Watson IoT Platform is a fully managed, cloud-hosted service that makes it simple to build and deploy apps for IoT devices, sensors and gateways. When combined with the IBM Bluemix® environment, and the secure Watson APIs, the platform allows integration and analyzes predictive, cognitive, and contextual analytics for stronger decision-making. Organizations are able to securely and easily connect devices, ranging from chips and intelligent appliances to applications and industry solutions. Scaling through cloud-based services and using rich analytics, the IBM Watson IoT Platform provides organizations with new insight for innovation and transformation. IBM TRIRIGA provides a single system to manage the lifecycle of facilities. Its integrated workplace management system increases the operational, financial and environmental performance of facilities. \nInteroperable network In close collaboration, the EnOcean Alliance and IBM define and expand standards for self-powered solutions for the IoT. Together, both partners standardize the EnOcean to IP interface and simplify the usage of applications in the IoT. This, for example, allows the integration of energy-harvesting wireless technology into the IBM Watson IoT Platform to conduct predictive and real-time analysis of facilities. These solutions can be used in various cases from asset management, ambient assisted living projects, insurance or hotel and campus projects, giving maintenance-free wireless switches and sensors based on EnOcean technology. \nNigel Milton, Watson IoT European Ecosystem Executive, said: \"IBM is excited to join the EnOcean Alliance as a promoter member. The EnOcean Alliance is specialised in self-powered wireless sensor solutions and will continue to progress as a key partner in the IBM Watson IoT ecosystem. For the past 12 months, IBM has been working with EnOcean and look forward to strengthening our relationship with them, as well as all members of the EnOcean Alliance.\" \nGraham Martin, Chairman of the EnOcean Alliance, comments: \"We are very excited to welcome IBM as a new promoter member in the EnOcean Alliance. With IBM's long-standing expertise in cloud-based services and IoT, we have gained a very strong partner in the ecosystem. We are looking forward to a successful cooperation to build the future of IoT.\" \nOne recent example of this excellent partnership is the development of a solution for the Internet of Things sector: together with its partners, IBM, Digital Concepts and element14, EnOcean GmbH has launched a certified kit called \"Intelligent Building -- Self-powered IoT Solution\" with batteryless EnOcean-based wireless sensors. \nAbout IBM For more information about IBM Watson IoT, please visit www.ibm.com/iot . \nAbout EnOcean Alliance Leading companies worldwide from the building sector collected to form the EnOcean Alliance and establish innovative automation solutions for sustainable building projects -- and so to make buildings more energy-efficient, more flexible and lower in cost. The core technology of the Alliance is energy harvesting wireless technology for flexibly positioned and service-free sensor solutions. The EnOcean Alliance aims to internationalise the energy harvesting wireless technology, and is dedicated to creating interoperability between the products of OEM partners.

      "text": "IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nThis will likely make you angry. It made me livid. \nIt’s a report, 34 pages long, from the Identity Theft Resource Center of the known systems breaches just this year . \nIt does not include the San Francisco Metro Transit Authority (SFMTA) hack from Thanksgiving weekend , where the SFMTA had to let passengers go free through the gates. \nThe Democratic Political Organizations are lumped together. There is no known number of records exposed, but this is also true for the vast majority of the breaches cited in this report. It changes daily. \nAnd it’s a travesty, a blindness, a breach of trust. \nBecause corporations and many corporate entities have no legal liability for data breaches, not much is done. Yes, there are vast citations of how much breaches cost the corporations. Occasionally, a few execs or administrators fall on their swords or are otherwise sacked. \nBut what this proves is: The U.S. government is no longer in charge of data border security. These breaches were unlikely domestic, although we cannot know the percentages. Making laws about security is a nihilistic endeavor. Personal data asset value is meaningless, viz the protections asserted yet foiled time and time again. Your stuff, your personal stuff and your loved one’s stuff is online now—and it’s for sale. Scroll through the long list of just this year’s breaches if you had any questions. Political and even government functionality is at stake. Please note just these 2016 political unit breaches. Cohesive threat intelligence is working for some but not for others. An inclusive mandate to share data seems like a great idea, and yes, there are ways to diligently look for strategies that keep the walls high. \nWhat feeds this? Is it the advent of BYOD? A failure of education? Diligence? I understand the nature of chaos and randomness, but I don’t believe in luck, good or bad. We’re losing the data asset wars to the bad guys, and no one/not enough people seem to be listening. \nThe internet and online business has become dominant. Few want to invest more capital and operational expense into their infrastructure because it cuts their rate of return. Paradoxically, people aren’t enraged, although they still buy online from desktops, rather than BYOD/smartphone devices . They’re helpless. They’re not tech savvy. They try to do the right thing. \nAdmins try as well. But the vast variety of platforms thwarts configuration wisdom, as the superfluity of hacks on different, even diverse, platforms become commonplace. \nThere is no one solid platform, and there shouldn’t be. Nothing is foolproof because fools are so ingenious, it’s said. Yet the real work of restructuring the internet to characterize undesirable activity obviously isn’t on the agenda of the U.S. government, and it isn’t working well for organizations large and small, viz the report. \nThe security future is bleak. This isn’t a reason to become depressed. Rather, we’re losing the data asset wars to the bad guys, and no one/not enough people seem to be listening.

      "text": "IBM Forecasts Global Shoppers Will Drive Double Digit Online Sales Growth on Cyber Monday [November 28, 2016] Tweet \nARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today forecasts that shoppers will drive double digit growth for retailers around the world on Cyber Monday. IBM found that pre-holiday online shopping was up nearly 10 percent over 2015. This momentum has grown over Thanksgiving , Black Friday and the weekend with consumers opening their wallets and taking advantage of the great deals being offered online by U.S. and global retailers. \nIBM is familiar with what it takes to help retailers achieve success over the busiest shopping days of the year. Over the 2015 holiday season, IBM powered more than $62B in online sales and the supported clients that sent more than 1.4 billion emails during this same holiday period without a single interruption. This holiday season is already showing signs of significant growth with IBM driving record levels of engagement with their customers online and via mobile. On Black Friday alone, there were nearly 405 million email notifications sent to consumers around the world. And mobile push outreach is on track for 35% growth over 2015. \nNo longer limited just to US retailers, Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping growth was a world-wide phenomenon this year with retailers outside of the US experiencing significant growth. Key findings holiday shopping findings include: Thanksgiving Shopping Becomes a Global Sensation: Online sales for global retailers increased by nearly 24 percent (2.9%) over 2015. For example, a major UK retailer saw 2100 hits to their website per second in the early hours of Black Friday shopping. US Retailers Cash in on Thanksgiving : Online sales for US retailers increased by nearly 12 percent (11.7%) over 2015. Global Retailers Experience Double Digital Black Friday Growth: Online sales for global retailers increased by more than 28 percent (28.4%) over 2015. US Retailers Drive Strong Black Friday Growth: U.S. retailers saw online sales grow by close to 10 percent (9.3%). Thanksgiving and Black Friday Fuel Four-Day Online Spending Spree : Global retailers saw continued momentum over the weekend with online sales up close to 20 percent (19.5%) over this four-day period last year. U.S. retailers also cashed in over these days with sales increasing more than 9 percent (9.3%) over 2015 Online Holiday Sales Will Continue: IBM predicts that online sales on Cyber Monday will increase by double digits over 2015. It also predicts that overall 2016 online sales (November and December) for retailers will increase by nearly 14 percent (13.89%) over 2015. \"It is clear, online shopping during the US holiday period has become a global phenomenon and more than ever companies are turning to IBM as a trusted technology provider and supporter to help them succeed during this critical period,\" said Harriet Green , General Manager IBM Commerce. \"The pace at which consumers demand personalized service across multiple channels requires new levels of cognitive capabilities on everything from consumer behaviors, inventory management, marketing and an organization's supply chain -- only IBM can deliver that complete solution for companies.\"\nThis year, IBM's Holiday Readiness team is supporting 41% more clients -- keeping online shopping up and running for some of the world's largest brands through its highly scalable and secure platform. These clients represent more than 21 countries and a variety of industries including retail, telecommunications, travel, consumer packaged goods, manufacturing and shipping. \nIBM powers the full spectrum of cognitive engagement offerings delivered as a service and on premise for more than 17,000 companies around the world including 7 of the top 10 companies on the Fortune 500. \nThe result of significant investment from IBM, the Cognitive Engagement SaaS portfolio is driving rapid client adoption as companies look for integrated offerings that fit into any IT environment and that span the entire client journey.

      "text": "  04:39 AM EST IBM's Cognitive Computing Defines Cognitive Intelligence \nIn today's world of rapidly evolving digital technology, the role of IT is changing from a focus on back office processing to back office optimisation and front office software. Traditionally, IT existed solely in the form of back office software, but now it is being called upon to fill a different role. At Computacenter, they know that IT must be at the forefront of organisations strategies. One way to approach this transition is through tools for data mining. For IT to perform at its best, it becomes necessary to utilise data mining tools in order to enable cognitive technologies to introduce innovation into the company. Paul Brown, Vice President and Partner Growth at IBM UK & Ireland, asks “How do you use cognitive technology to make and use the data that's in the organisation? How do you use systems that understand, reason and learn?” He uses the analogy of data as a natural resource. Companies must focus on mining data, refining it, and using it to their best advantage. With the exponential rate of growth of data every minute, the only way to access it is to use appropriate, cutting-edge data mining tools. Computacenter recognises the critical importance of utilising cognitive technologies to access and manage data, curating information and directing it to the entire benefit of the organisation. Paul goes on to explain that today's CIO plays two roles. On one side, the CIO must focus on back office optimisation, which means asking the question, “How can I do what we do, for less?” That is, how can the CIO drive cost efficiency across the company, making IT more agile and flexible on all fronts? On the other side, the CIO must also consider front office innovation. The question then becomes, “How can I utilise data for competitive advantage?” In addition, it is crucial to consider security and agility. All the rules are changing, and Computacenter's approach to back office optimisation and front office innovation works by remaining forever agile.

      "text": "CHICAGO , Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2016) it will preview new imaging solutions from Watson Health and Merge Healthcare (Merge; an IBM Company) designed to help healthcare providers pursue personalized approaches to patient diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The solutions benefit from more than a decade of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) work conducted in IBM Research. Further, IBM Research has partnered with the Radiological Society to debut a live demonstration of how Watson understands, reasons and learns from imaging information. \nMedical images are by far the largest and fastest-growing data source in the healthcare industry -- IBM researchers estimate that they account for at least 90% of all medical data today -- but they also present challenges that need to be addressed. The volume of medical images can be overwhelming to even the most sophisticated specialists; radiologists in some hospital emergency rooms are presented with thousands of images each day. 1 \nContinue Reading\nIBM Research Demonstrates Artificial Intelligence May Help Doctors See Heart Disease Tools to help clinicians extract insights from medical images remain limited, requiring most analysis to be done manually. This has created an opportunity to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources to enable providers to compare new medical images with a patient's image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies.\n\"The breadth and depth of Watson -powered solutions on display at RSNA 2016 from Watson Health's imaging group and from Merge are unmatched among the AI community, and showcase how IBM is bringing cognitive computing to healthcare in clinically meaningful ways,\" said Anne LeGrand , Vice President of Imaging for IBM Watson Health. \nWatson Health will show: \nA cognitive peer review tool intended to help healthcare professionals reconcile differences between a patient's clinical evidence, and data in that patient's electronic health record (EHR). A cognitive data summarization tool intended to provide radiologists, cardiologists, and other physicians with patient-specific clinical information to use when interpreting imaging studies, or when diagnosing and treating patients. A cognitive physician support tool intended to help doctors personalize healthcare decisions based on integrating imaging data with other types of patient data. The MedyMatch \"Brain Bleed\" App , a cognitive image review tool intended to help emergency room physicians diagnose a stroke or brain bleed in a trauma patient by identifying relevant evidence in a patient record.       Merge will show: \nMarktation , a new process for interpreting medical images intended to help physicians improve image reading speed and accuracy, with an initial application in mammography. Watson Clinical Integration Module , a cloud application for radiologists that aims to help increase reader efficiency and counteract common causes of errors in medical imaging, such as base rate neglect, anchoring, bias, framing bias, and premature closure. Lesion Segmentation and Tracking Module , designed to help radiologists increase the speed by which they interpret and report comparison exams in cancer patients and for other patient conditions that require longitudinal tracking. \" Watson cognitive computing is ideally suited to support radiologists on their journey 'Beyond Imaging' to practices that address the needs of patient populations, deliver improved patient outcomes, and demonstrate real-world value,\" said Nancy Koenig , General Manager of Merge Healthcare. \"This week at RSNA, Merge is proud to unveil solutions for providers that enable the first steps on the cognitive care journey, addressing breast cancer, lung cancer, and trauma patients in the ER.\"     \nRSNA and IBM Research Show Physicians How Watson Understands, Reasons and Learns \nIBM Research will show physicians how Watson might reduce the time to diagnosis and increase efficiency in provider workflows. Radiologists select cases from a variety of imaging topics, make their diagnosis, and see how a Watson solution attempts to assist the same case as it understands, reasons and learns from text- and imaging data in real time. \nThe live demonstration showcases more than a decade of work by IBM Research's top medical imaging, text mining, and AI data scientists. The demo is able to analyze patient data culled from thousands of data sources and present insights in a compact summary report intended to help clinicians efficiently reach a differential diagnosis. For example, the technology featured in the demo uses deep learning to recognize positions in the body for major anatomical structures (such as in a CT imaging study) and detects anomalies (such as dissections in the aorta, or embolisms in pulmonary arteries). Combining imaging and clinical data with clinical knowledge, it performs clinical inference on the patient's condition and its management, pre-assembling relevant information in a simple online format for a diagnosing physician to consider.\nIBM is also showcasing at RSNA 2016 its ecosystem approach to innovation, including the global Watson Health medical imaging collaborative and work with Siemens Healthineers to introduce Population Health Management solutions worldwide. For more information about IBM's presence at RSNA 2016, visit the Merge web site and follow @MergeHealthcare for #RSNA16 updates throughout the conference.  \nThe Watson Health Imaging and Merge demonstrations are cognitive healthcare works-in-progress in Booth 2538 in South Hall A. 2 \nAbout IBM Research\nFor more than seven decades, IBM Research has continued to define the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. Scientists from IBM Research have produced six Nobel Laureates, 10 U.S. National Medals of Technology, five U.S. National Medals of Science, six Turing Awards, 19 inductees in the National Academy of Sciences and 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame.

This has created an opportunity to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources to enable providers to compare new medical images with a patient’s image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies. \n“The breadth and depth of Watson-powered solutions on display at RSNA 2016 from Watson Health’s imaging group and from Merge are unmatched among the AI community, and showcase how IBM is bringing cognitive computing to healthcare in clinically meaningful ways,” said Anne LeGrand, Vice President of Imaging for IBM Watson Health. \nWatson Health will show: A cognitive peer review tool intended to help healthcare professionals reconcile differences between a patient’s clinical evidence, and data in that patient’s electronic health record (EHR). A cognitive data summarization tool intended to provide radiologists, cardiologists, and other physicians with patient-specific clinical information to use when interpreting imaging studies, or when diagnosing and treating patients. A cognitive physician support tool intended to help doctors personalize healthcare decisions based on integrating imaging data with other types of patient data. The MedyMatch “Brain Bleed” App , a cognitive image review tool intended to help emergency room physicians diagnose a stroke or brain bleed in a trauma patient by identifying relevant evidence in a patient record. \nMerge will show: Marktation , a new process for interpreting medical images intended to help physicians improve image reading speed and accuracy, with an initial application in mammography. Watson Clinical Integration Module , a cloud application for radiologists that aims to help increase reader efficiency and counteract common causes of errors in medical imaging, such as base rate neglect, anchoring, bias, framing bias, and premature closure. Lesion Segmentation and Tracking Module , designed to help radiologists increase the speed by which they interpret and report comparison exams in cancer patients and for other patient conditions that require longitudinal tracking. \n“Watson cognitive computing is ideally suited to support radiologists on their journey ‘Beyond Imaging’ to practices that address the needs of patient populations, deliver improved patient outcomes, and demonstrate real-world value,” said Nancy Koenig, General Manager of Merge Healthcare. “This week at RSNA, Merge is proud to unveil solutions for providers that enable the first steps on the cognitive care journey, addressing breast cancer, lung cancer, and trauma patients in the ER.” \nRSNA and IBM Research Show Physicians How Watson Understands, Reasons and Learns IBM Research will show physicians how Watson might reduce the time to diagnosis and increase efficiency in provider workflows.

The demo is able to analyze patient data culled from thousands of data sources and present insights in a compact summary report intended to help clinicians efficiently reach a differential diagnosis. For example, the technology featured in the demo uses deep learning to recognize positions in the body for major anatomical structures (such as in a CT imaging study) and detects anomalies (such as dissections in the aorta, or embolisms in pulmonary arteries).

      "text": "Two open letters, issued from opposite ends of the IBM organizational chart, are getting equal attention this week.\nThe first one came a week after the election. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote an open letter to President-Elect Donald Trump, which clearly spoke to the more optimistic version of his presidential persona.\n\"Last Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future, and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all,\" she began. \"I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.\"\nHer ideas involved the creation of \"new\" collar jobs IT jobs, filled by vocational training instead of traditional college; the need to include cybersecurity in any infrastructure plans; using IT to drive better health outcomes and eliminate government waste; tax reform and better health care for veterans.\nHer tone was neutral, reasonable and clearly established IBM's stake in key debates going forward, as both a tech innovator and employer.\nBut the letter did not sit right with one employee, a senior content strategist named Elizabeth Wood. After much thought, Wood wrote her own open letter , addressed directly to IBM’s chief executive, and announced she was resigning.\n\"Your letter offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen.\" That Rometty’s letter came so quickly after the election told Wood that the company had chosen to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain. \"The president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities,\" she wrote. \"These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead, Ms. Rometty. They work every day for IBM's success and have been silenced by your words.\"\nThese two letters highlight the painful balancing act that chief executives and other leaders now face: How to work productively with a deeply divisive new government while reaffirming their commitment to the difficult work of maintaining an inclusive culture within their own ecosystems. Their businesses depend on mastering both.\n\"I was really offended -- really deeply crushed,\" Wood later told Slate . Wood had liked her job of two years and felt she had a future at IBM. But she just couldn't stay. \"This was such a welcoming letter that it was just really distressing.\"\nAnd as the news gets worse, the work will only get more difficult.\nOn Point [bs-title]How should diversity experts feel about their career these days?[/bs-title][bs-content]After the election of Donald Trump, the growing diversity and inclusion field has suffered - but is it a setback? Something more? It's hard to know. The professionals who help companies build more inclusive cultures are understandably nervous. Some are hopeful that the tough talk about race will lead to openness. But many are reporting a new set of challenges. Now, they say, they have to work harder to tamp down heightened feelings of' us versus them', and public conflicts are popping up at the mere mention of a hot button term.

Malik has written an important piece about the soul searching the tech community needs to do to better understand life in a post-Trump world. \"Silicon Valley's biggest failing is not poor marketing of its products, or follow-through on promises, but, rather, the distinct lack of empathy for those whose lives are disturbed by its technological wizardry.\"[/bs-content][bs-link link=\"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/silicon-valley-has-an-empathy-vacuum\" source=\"New Yorker\"]\n[bs-title]Only one person went to jail for a spate of corporate pollution scandals[/bs-title][bs-content] Kerr-McGhee, among many other things, was alleged to have poisoned some 15,000 people in mostly black communities near the company's chemical plants. The company has since been forced to reorganize; but remarkably, the only person held accountable is an independent lab owner turned activist and whistleblower, who appears to have embarrassed the EPA and Justice Department with her claims of negligence and corporate malfeasance. Tennie White was ultimately prosecuted for falsifying test records when she was unable to produce three wastewater tests.

He is a mass of contradictions, a manipulative \"screamer\" with a rabid love for Reagan, honed by Harvard Business School and Goldman Sachs, who occasionally muses about limiting voting rights to property owners, which would disproportionately impact citizens of color. \"Maybe that's not such a bad thing,\" he said.[/bs-content][bs-link link=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/us/politics/steve-bannon-white-house.html\" source=\"New York Times\"]\nThe Woke Leader [bs-title]On race, President Trump and hopelessness[/bs-title][bs-content]Tressie McMillan Cottom, Ph.D., is an assistant professor, researcher and prolific blogger. Her most recent post is a difficult and emotional look at race in America, and the truly fine line so many Americans walk when we try to parse our difficult history of racial hierarchy. Can you believe Donald Trump's populist money talk and not get entangled by racism? It's complicated, but she remains hopeful. \"[W]hen black people say that they are plenty hopeful we tend to mean that our hope is tempered by a deep awareness of how thin is the veneer of white civility.\"[/bs-content][bs-link link=\"https://tressiemc.com/tmcpublicsociology/finding-hope-in-a-loveless-place/\" source=\"TressieMc Blog\"]\n[bs-title]An unexpected Cuba[/bs-title][bs-content]\"If you really want to get to know a country, become a perp in it,\" begins this intriguing short film that is part of The New Yorker Presents documentary series. Author and filmmaker Eugene Jarecki was invited to Cuba two years ago to take part in the country's first-ever TED event. As he was touring the country doing research, his taxi hit a guy on a bike. He learned more about Cuba than he ever imagined, all of it beautiful. (The guy survived.) Sure, it's a \"white guy visits foreign land\" trope, but he does an excellent job.

      "text": "  Download Current Issue \nFinnish national airline Finnair is adopting internal enterprise apps through a deal with IBM. \nThe company said the move will see the workforce use apps and support its internal digital transformation. The airline has already introduced digital services for customers, but this deal brings it into the internal operation.   Brexit and UK tech: Essential guide \nFind your way in the post-Brexit world and establish priorities in the face of uncertainty   \n“We are working with the core processes of an airline and bringing digital services into them,” Katri Harra-Salonen, chief digital officer at Finnair , told Computer Weekly. “This will bring better quality to the processes, build more user-friendly applications and tools for our employees, and increase productivity.” \nFinnair, which carries 10 million travellers annually, will be the first company to use IBM’s Mobile at Scale for iOS development model, which launched in August. This gives Finnair full access to IBM’s MobileFirst iOS business app portfolio (which was built in partnership with Apple ), as well as its app development and design tools. As of November 2016, MobileFirst covered over 100 apps across 15 industries. \n“We have a portfolio of 14 airline-specific applications in the pipeline, and nine have been delivered already,” said Raimon Christiani, global industry leader at IBM Travel and Transportation . “There is a team of developers, security and legacy integration specialists taking care of scaling the mobile app portfolio for Finnair.” \nFinnair’s first two iOS apps will be deployed in early 2017, and focus on aircraft line maintenance. They will provide aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation, while their supervisors get a real-time overview of flight schedules, maintenance processes and mechanic availability. Read more about Finnair IT Finland’s national airline, Finnair, has signed a five-and-a-half-year services deal with IBM to transform its technology infrastructure into a hybrid cloud platform. Finnair is on a digital transformation journey , and the airline’s CIO is changing the IT department as it progresses. \nBoth apps are already part of IBM’s existing portfolio for the airline industry, but will be customised for Finnair. This customisation and app development will be carried out by IBM’s dedicated MobileFirst Garage team in Bangalore, working with the airline. Finnair sees this as a flexible and cost-efficient approach to enterprise apps. \n“This also gives us the opportunity to develop custom apps,” said Harra-Salonen. “T he business can benefit from such apps, but it is important we have a rapid cycle to put them into use as needed.” A history of collaboration \nFinnair and IBM have a long history of collaboration, and signed a five-and-a-half-year cloud transformation deal in 2015. But the enterprise apps are a separate partnership, and the airline talked with several potential partners before making the decision to work with IBM again. \n“We started this process from a very user-focused angle,” said Harra-Salonen. “We had workshops with different teams in our operations unit, and really tried to figure out how we could make their daily work more comfortable and effective. We then started to look at how we should build and provide this experience.” \nHarra-Salonen added that users have been involved at every step. Finnair has sent teams to IBM’s facilities in Bangalore, as well as had maintenance staff attend workshops with Apple’s designers. \nWhile Finnair believes enterprise apps have potential benefits to offer across its operations, it wants to take its time to identify the right areas for further digital integration. \n“We have already completed early work with different teams, such as the crew, pilots and ground operations, so we have an initial view of the systems we might need in future. We haven’t, however, made any decisions on where to go next,” Harra-Salonen said. CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join. E-Zine",

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nMicrosoft wants to stop supporting its Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) because all of the security features have been baked into Windows 10. A vulnerability analyst says Windows with EMET offers additional security protections not available in standalone Windows 10. \n\"Even a Windows 7 system with EMET configured protects your application more than a stock Windows 10 system,\" said Will Dormann, a vulnerability analyst with the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute. [ InfoWorld's deep look: Why (and how) you should manage Windows 10 PCs like iPhones . | The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. ] \nOriginally introduced in 2009, EMET adds exploit mitigations, including address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP), to Windows systems to make it harder for malware to trigger unpatched vulnerabilities. Since Windows 10 includes EMET’s anti-exploit protections by default, Microsoft is planning to end-of-life the free tool in July 2018. CERT’s Dormann said Microsoft should keep supporting the toolkit because Windows 10 does not provide all of the application-specific mitigations available in EMET. \n“Windows 10 does indeed provide some nice exploit mitigations. The problem is that the software you are running needs to be specifically compiled to take advantage of them,” Dormann said. OS-level vs application-level defenses \nDormann argues that Microsoft should keep supporting the toolkit -- currently EMET 5.51 -- because it provides both system-wide protection and application-specific mitigations that make the toolkit relevant for Windows security, even on Windows 10 systems. \nEMET’s system-wide protections include the aforementioned ASLR and DEP, Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), Certificate Trust (Pinning), and Block Untrusted Fonts. EMET’s application-specific protections include DEP, SEHOP, ASLR, Null Page Allocation, Heapspray Allocations, Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF), Export Address Table Access Filtering Plus (EAF+), Bottom-up Randomization (BottomUP ASLR), Attack Surface Reduction (ASR), Block Untrusted Fonts, and Return-Oriented Programming mitigations. \nMicrosoft’s principal lead program for OS security, Jeffrey Sutherland, recently said that users should upgrade to Windows 10 since the latest operating system natively includes the security features provided by EMET. That is true to some extent, as DEP, SEHOP, ASLR, BottomupASLR, and ROP mitigation (as Control Flow Guard) are part of Windows 10, but many of the application-specific mitigations are not. \nWhat Sutherland neglected to consider was that most Windows administrators rely on EMET to apply all of the available exploit mitigations to applications. Consider that a Windows 10 system with EMET properly configured has 13 additional mitigations -- the application-specific controls -- than a standalone Windows 10 system. \n\"It is pretty clear that an application running on a stock Windows 10 system does not have the same protections as one running on a Windows 10 system with EMET properly configured,\" Dormann said. Application defenses still lagging \nWindows 10 may be the most secure Windows ever , but the applications have to be compiled to utilize the exploit mitigation features to actually benefit from those enhanced security features . For example, if the application isn’t designed to use Control Flow Guard, then the application doesn’t benefit from Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) defenses, despite the fact that Control Flow Guard is part of Windows 10. \n\"Out of all of the applications you run in your enterprise, do you know which ones are built with Control Flow Guard support? If an application is not built to use Control Flow Guard, it doesn't matter if your underlying operating system supports it or not,\" Dormann said. \nThe problem isn’t limited to just third-party and custom enterprise applications as there are some older -- but still widely used -- Microsoft applications which don’t access the advanced exploit mitigations. For example, Microsoft does not compile all of Office 2010 with the /DYNAMICBASE flag to indicate compatibility with ASLR. An attacker could potentially bypass ASLR and exploit a memory corruption vulnerability by loading a malicious library into the vulnerable application’s process space. \nIronically, administrators would protect the application from being targeted in this way by running EMET with application-specific mitigations. \n\"Because we cannot rely on all software vendors to produce code that uses all the exploit mitigations available, EMET puts this control back in our hands,\" Dormann said. Don’t pick sides; do both \nMicrosoft says to start migrating to Windows 10 and stop using EMET by 2018. A senior engineer at CERT, tasked by the United States Department of Homeland Security to make security recommendations of national significance, says EMET still offers better security than standalone Windows 10. What is a Windows administrator to do? \nThe answer, according to Dormann, is to follow both recommendations: Upgrade to Windows 10 to take advantage of native exploit mitigation features, and install EMET to apply application-specific mitigations. \nEMET will continue to keep working even after its end-of-life date, which means administrators can still use the tool to protect unsupported software against possible zero-day vulnerabilities. Several other Microsoft applications are nearing their end-of-life dates, including Microsoft Office 2007. Administrators can continue to use EMET to protect these applications from attacks looking for zero-day vulnerabilities. \n“With such out-of-support applications, it is even more important to provide additional exploit protection with a product like EMET,” Dormann said. \nIt’s possible that with Microsoft’s new Windows-as-a-service model, the remaining EMET defenses will be added to Windows 10 before the end-of-life date, at which point Windows 10 would be able to handle the application-specific protections without EMET. \nUntil then, EMET is “still an important tool to help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities,” Dormann said.

The Node.js platform is already available on a variety of VMs, like Samsung’s JerryScript , a lightweight JavaScript engine for the Internet of Things. While many steps are needed to allow Node.js to work in VM environments outside of V8, the work the Node.js API working group and ChakraCore are doing are important steps to offer greater choice. Today, we are excited to announce several initial milestones in these efforts. The first is centered around Node.js API (ABI Stable Module API or NAPI for short), which is focused on defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in V8.",

      "text": "IBM Model F AT with GERMAN LAYOUT | The legends are true « on: Tue, 29 November 2016, 10:31:15 » If you are German and are looking for a IBM model F keyboard, you are usually limited to the older XT variant, since these are practically the only ones to find in German layout, or at all. AT keyboards are very rare in germany indeed, in any layout, it appears like they don't exist. Now I've finally found another Model F AT in ISO DE layout, I've already got one, but you can never have enough of them. Picture from the Ebay auction. I swear , there CAN only be like 1000 of them in the whole world .

Just a BAE innit? Oo I can live with anything on this keyboard but the small backspace and the big ass enter. It is possible to change that to regular ISO type backspace and enter by just swapping some key caps from my Model M's. However I would loose one key since the most left slider of the big ass enter has no switch under it, it only serves as a stabiliser. I did the same with my other Model F. I wonder if there is space for another switch on the PCB.

I wonder if there is space for another switch on the PCB. I think you can ANSI-mod F ATs, but I don't think I've ever heard of someone ISO-modding one. That said, the F122 comes in ISO-only layout, why not get one of them? Check my keyboard video reviews: I can live with anything on this keyboard but the small backspace and the big ass enter.

That said, the F122 comes in ISO-only layout, why not get one of them? Like I said, it can be done but one would sacrifice two keys, hence why no one really does it. I don't really care about loosing the keys, I can just remap another one that I don't use. Here you can see that a regular backspace and enter does fit, only that one key (the one you win loosing the big ass enter) could not be actuated, and the backspace has a switch too much, but you can remove the left spring and replace it with a stabiliser from a Model M and simply remap the key.

      "text": " IBM\nCHICAGO IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2016) it will preview new imaging solutions from Watson Health and Merge Healthcare (Merge; an IBM Company) designed to help healthcare providers pursue personalized approaches to patient diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The solutions benefit from more than a decade of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) work conducted in IBM Research. Further, IBM Research has partnered with the Radiological Society to debut a live demonstration of how Watson understands, reasons and learns from imaging information.\nMedical images are by far the largest and fastest-growing data source in the healthcare industry -- IBM researchers estimate that they account for at least 90% of all medical data today -- but they also present challenges that need to be addressed. The volume of medical images can be overwhelming to even the most sophisticated specialists; radiologists in some hospital emergency rooms are presented with thousands of images each day. 1\nTools to help clinicians extract insights from medical images remain limited, requiring most analysis to be done manually. This has created an opportunity to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources to enable providers to compare new medical images with a patient's image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies.\n\"The breadth and depth of Watson -powered solutions on display at RSNA 2016 from Watson Health's imaging group and from Merge are unmatched among the AI community, and showcase how IBM is bringing cognitive computing to healthcare in clinically meaningful ways,\" said Anne LeGrand , Vice President of Imaging for IBM Watson Health.\nWatson Health will show:\nA cognitive peer review tool intended to help healthcare professionals reconcile differences between a patient's clinical evidence, and data in that patient's electronic health record (EHR). A cognitive data summarization tool intended to provide radiologists, cardiologists, and other physicians with patient-specific clinical information to use when interpreting imaging studies, or when diagnosing and treating patients. A cognitive physician support tool intended to help doctors personalize healthcare decisions based on integrating imaging data with other types of patient data. The MedyMatch \"Brain Bleed\" App , a cognitive image review tool intended to help emergency room physicians diagnose a stroke or brain bleed in a trauma patient by identifying relevant evidence in a patient record. Merge will show:\nMarktation , a new process for interpreting medical images intended to help physicians improve image reading speed and accuracy, with an initial application in mammography. Watson Clinical Integration Module , a cloud application for radiologists that aims to help increase reader efficiency and counteract common causes of errors in medical imaging, such as base rate neglect, anchoring, bias, framing bias, and premature closure. Lesion Segmentation and Tracking Module , designed to help radiologists increase the speed by which they interpret and report comparison exams in cancer patients and for other patient conditions that require longitudinal tracking. \" Watson cognitive computing is ideally suited to support radiologists on their journey 'Beyond Imaging' to practices that address the needs of patient populations, deliver improved patient outcomes, and demonstrate real-world value,\" said Nancy Koenig , General Manager of Merge Healthcare. \"This week at RSNA, Merge is proud to unveil solutions for providers that enable the first steps on the cognitive care journey, addressing breast cancer, lung cancer, and trauma patients in the ER.\"\nRSNA and IBM Research Show Physicians How Watson Understands, Reasons and Learns\nIBM Research will show physicians how Watson might reduce the time to diagnosis and increase efficiency in provider workflows. Radiologists select cases from a variety of imaging topics, make their diagnosis, and see how a Watson solution attempts to assist the same case as it understands, reasons and learns from text- and imaging data in real time.\nThe live demonstration showcases more than a decade of work by IBM Research's top medical imaging, text mining, and AI data scientists. The demo is able to analyze patient data culled from thousands of data sources and present insights in a compact summary report intended to help clinicians efficiently reach a differential diagnosis. For example, the technology featured in the demo uses deep learning to recognize positions in the body for major anatomical structures (such as in a CT imaging study) and detects anomalies (such as dissections in the aorta, or embolisms in pulmonary arteries). Combining imaging and clinical data with clinical knowledge, it performs clinical inference on the patient's condition and its management, pre-assembling relevant information in a simple online format for a diagnosing physician to consider.\nIBM is also showcasing at RSNA 2016 its ecosystem approach to innovation, including the global Watson Health medical imaging collaborative and work with Siemens Healthineers to introduce Population Health Management solutions worldwide. For more information about IBM's presence at RSNA 2016, visit the Merge web site and follow @MergeHealthcare for #RSNA16 updates throughout the conference.\nThe Watson Health Imaging and Merge demonstrations are cognitive healthcare works-in-progress in Booth 2538 in South Hall A. 2\nAbout IBM Research\nFor more than seven decades, IBM Research has continued to define the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. Scientists from IBM Research have produced six Nobel Laureates, 10 U.S. National Medals of Technology, five U.S. National Medals of Science, six Turing Awards, 19 inductees in the National Academy of Sciences and 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame. For more information about IBM Research, visit www.research.ibm.com .\nAbout IBM Watson Health\nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. IBM Watson Health is helping to improve the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical research and social health data.

      "title": "Goodbye SIEM, Hello SOAPA",
      "text": "IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have been around for a dozen years or so. During that timeframe, SIEMs evolved from perimeter security event correlation tools, to GRC platforms, to security analytics systems. Early vendors like eSecurity, GuardedNet, Intellitactics, and NetForensics, are distant memories, today’s SIEM market is now dominated by a few leaders: LogRhythm, McAfee (aka: Nitro Security), HP (aka: ArcSight), IBM (aka: QRadar), and Splunk. \nOf course, there is a community of innovative upstarts that believe that SIEM is a legacy technology. They proclaim that log management and event correlation can’t keep up with the pace of cybersecurity today, thus you need new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and neural networks to consume, process, and analyze security data in real-time. \nAs an industry analyst, I should be waving my arms around madly, proclaiming that “SIEM is dead,” since that’s what those in my profession tend to do. Sorry, but I don’t think SIEM is dead at all. Instead, enterprise security operations and analytics requirements are forcing rapid consolidation into something new that ESG calls a security operations and analytics platform architecture (SOAPA). \nWithin SOAPA, SIEM -like functionality still plays a starring role, often aggregating analytics data into a common repository. But unlike the past, SIEM is one of several security tools within SOAPA, and these technologies must be designed for asynchronous cooperation so security analysts can quickly pivot across tools to find data and take action as they need to in real-time. \nSOAPA is a dynamic architecture, meaning that new data sources and control planes will be added incrementally overtime. I do believe however that today’s SOAPA is built with SIEMs (or similar log management and search products/services) and: Endpoint detection/response tools (EDR). Security analyst often want to dig deep into security alerts by monitoring and investigating host behavior so EDR (i.e. CarbonBlack, Countertack, CrowdStrike, Guidance Software, etc.) is an essential component of SOAPA. Incident response platforms (IRPs). Aside from collecting, processing, and analyzing security data, cybersecurity professionals want to prioritize alerts and remediate problems as soon as possible. These requirements are giving rise to the rise of IRPs like Hexadite, Phantom, Resilient Systems (IBM), ServiceNow, and Swimlane. Network security analytics. SIEM’s log analysis and EDR host behavior monitoring are complemented by flow and packet analysis in SOAPA, provided by vendors like Arbor Networks, Blue Coat/Symantec, Cisco (Lancope), RSA, etc. UBA/machine learning algorithms. While these tools have received an inordinate degree of industry hype, there’s little doubt that machine learning will be baked into security analytics henceforth, thus vendors like Bay Dynamics, Caspeda (Splunk), Exabeam, Niara, Sqrrl, and Varonis should be included in SOAPA. Vulnerability scanners and security asset managers. Part of security operations is knowing which alerts should be prioritized. These decisions must be driven by solid data from vulnerability management systems (i.e. Qualys, Rapid7, Tanium), and other tools that monitor the state of systems and network configurations (i.e. RedSeal, Skybox, Verodin, etc.). Anti-malware sandboxes. This technology represents another key pivot point for understanding targeted attacks that may use zero-day malware. Sandboxes from FireEye, Fidelis, and Trend Micro are definitely part of SOAPA. Threat intelligence. Enterprise organizations want to compare internal network anomalies with malicious “in-the-wild” activities so SOAPA extends to threat intelligence sources and platforms (i.e. BrightPoint (ServiceNow), FireEye/iSight Partners, RecordedFuture, ThreatConnect, ThreatQuotient, etc.). \nAside from the technologies themselves, here are a few other thoughts on SOAPA: \n1. Beyond data exchange between security tools, the next big innovation will be central SOAPA command-and-control for analytics and management (i.e. configuration management, policy management, etc.) of the security infrastructure. \n2. The market is already moving in SOAPA’s direction. Witness IBM’s acquisition of Resilient Systems for IRP, Splunk’s purchase of Caspida for UBA, and Elastic Search’s acquisition of Prelert. \n3. Now that McAfee is independent of Intel, look for it to invest in its enterprise security manager (i.e. Nitro). McAfee will also accelerate SOAPA technology integration with its own tools and ecosystem partners, and acquisitions aimed at filling architectural gaps. \n4. Given the central role that SIEM still plays in SOAPA, someone (CA? Palo Alto? Symantec? Trend Micro?) will buy LogRhythm. \n5. Each of the technology elements described above could be delivered on premise or via SaaS options. SOAPA must be flexible to accommodate these options. \n6. SOAPA must be built for immense scale – especially as organizations increase their use of cloud computing and IoT. It’s likely cloud analytics or storage will become part of the architecture. \n7. A few vendors may be able to deliver their own proprietary SOAPA solutions but enterprise customers will likely eschew single vendor solutions while anchoring their SOAPAs with lead vendors and ecosystem partners. Small enterprises and SMBs could buy from a single product or SaaS vendor however. \nHow does all this come together and in what order? I’m about to launch a research project to answer these questions. Stay tuned. To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream . Related:",

      "text": "Two open letters, issued from opposite ends of the IBM organizational chart, are getting equal attention this week.\nThe first one came a week after the election. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote an open letter to President-Elect Donald Trump, which clearly spoke to the more optimistic version of his presidential persona.\n\"Last Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future, and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all,\" she began. \"I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.\"\nHer ideas involved the creation of \"new\" collar jobs IT jobs, filled by vocational training instead of traditional college; the need to include cybersecurity in any infrastructure plans; using IT to drive better health outcomes and eliminate government waste; tax reform and better health care for veterans.\nHer tone was neutral, reasonable and clearly established IBM's stake in key debates going forward, as both a tech innovator and employer.\n \nSign up for raceAhead , Fortune's daily newsletter on race and culture here . \n \nBut the letter did not sit right with one employee, a senior content strategist named Elizabeth Wood. After much thought, Wood wrote her own open letter , addressed directly to IBM’s chief executive, and announced she was resigning.\n\"Your letter offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen.\" That Rometty’s letter came so quickly after the election told Wood that the company had chosen to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain. \"The president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities,\" she wrote. \"These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead, Ms. Rometty. They work every day for IBM's success and have been silenced by your words.\"\nThese two letters highlight the painful balancing act that chief executives and other leaders now face: How to work productively with a deeply divisive new government while reaffirming their commitment to the difficult work of maintaining an inclusive culture within their own ecosystems. Their businesses depend on mastering both.\n\"I was really offended -- really deeply crushed,\" Wood later told Slate . Wood had liked her job of two years and felt she had a future at IBM. But she just couldn't stay. \"This was such a welcoming letter that it was just really distressing.\"\nAnd as the news gets worse, the work will only get more difficult.\n \nEllen McGirt is a senior editor for Fortune ",

      "title": "IBM: Expel NY Blood Center For Abandoning Chimps",
      "text": "by: Donny Moss target: Ginni Rometty For 30 years, the New York Blood Center (NYBC) conducted experiments on approximately 500 chimpanzees in laboratory in Liberia, where the organization could capture wild chimps and breed them in captivity. When the experiments were finished, NYBC moved the survivors to islands in Liberia and The Ivory Coast with a promise to provide them with food and water for the remainder of their lives.In 2015, when the world was distracted by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, NYBC terminated funding for the chimps, leaving the 66 survivors to die of starvation and thirst. NYBC abandoned the chimps in spite of its public pledges to provide them with lifelong care and in spite of the fact that the organization has earned an estimated $500 million in royalties off of the research conducted on these chimps. NYBC's actions have garnered condemnation from its own corporate donors, including MetLife and Citigroup. In 2015, Dr. Jane Goodall issued an open letter to NYBC's CEO, Dr. Christopher Hillyer, saying, \"I find it completely shocking and unacceptable that NYBC would abandon these chimpanzees and discontinue support for even their basic needs.”NYBC earns approximately $300 million each year selling our blood donated by the public at NYBC collection sites in and around New York City. The space for one of these collection sites is donated by IBM. IBM’s Code of Conduct states that the company is “committed to principles of business ethics and lawful conduct” and that “any violation of this Code of Conduct . . . will constitute the basis for the immediate termination of your business relationship with IBM.” We ask that IBM CEO Ginni Rometty honor her company's code of conduct by terminating its relationship with NYBC and reallocating its blood donation space to another blood collection organization. We also ask IBM to join MetLife, Citigroup and elected officials in NY in publicly condemning NYBC’s abandonment of 66 chimpanzees.",

By Jena McGregor November 29 at 1:46 PM Follow @jenamcgregor IBM Chair and CEO Virginia \"Ginni\" Rometty speaks at an IBM Watson event in New York in 2014. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid) \nMost CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump, one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it. \nElizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM , published an \" open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty \" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda.\" Wood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\" \nIn Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as healthcare, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote. [ How CEOs are responding to Donald Trump's win ] \nBut she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees -- though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\" \nFew employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome. In the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left. \nCEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways --- from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce -- more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum. IBM, for instance, was one of the corporate signers of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign opposing North Carolina's so-called \" bathroom bill ,\" which dictates which restroom transgender people should use in government buildings and public schools. \nMeanwhile, companies must also grapple with employees' ability to broadcast their dissatisfaction via online channels. Wood's letter was shared widely on social media , with some calling her decision \" brave \" or commending her \" courage .\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defense of Rometty's letter. \nIn an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to President-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who’s going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\" \nWood acknowledged that she had experienced frustrations of working in a company as large as IBM but said she had not been planning to leave the tech giant before seeing Rometty's letter. A writer and \"content strategist,\" Wood also said she was aware her move had the potential to raise her profile; she has pinned the letter she wrote to the top of her LinkedIn profile and her Twitter feed . \nYet she also said she was aware of and had considered the risks her outspokenness could prompt when it comes to getting hired in the future. \"I thought I would have a mark on my back,\" she said, making her \" that mouthy strategist that speaks out.\" She said she intends to freelance and does not have another full-time job lined up. \nA range of CEOs have written letters to employees in the aftermath of the election. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, wrote to his employees that \"we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.\" Apple's Tim Cook quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that \"our company is open to all ... regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\" [ Why some Donald Trump supporters are taking aim at Pepsi ] \nOthers have spoken directly in letters to the president-elect. Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, for instance, had his own words of advice for Trump in a letter addressed to him. \"While your Electoral College victory was solid, you should guard against the victor's curse: Don't convince yourself that your victory is a personal mandate that absolves you of the need to collaborate in governing. While millions voted for you because they agreed with your ideas, millions voted for you even though they agreed with only some of your ideas or because they didn't like the alternative. And, of course, many did not vote for you. Bring all those people along with you. Leadership is about listening and then convincing. It is not about mandating.\" \nRead also:",

      "text": "IBM employee quits over her CEO's letter to Donald Trump Ginni Rometty David Paul Morris / Bloomberg \nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty delivers a keynote address during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, on Jan. 6, 2016. \nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty delivers a keynote address during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, on Jan. 6, 2016. (David Paul Morris / Bloomberg) Jena McGregor The Washington Post \nMost CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump , one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it. \nElizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda.\" \nWood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\" \nIn Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as healthcare, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote. Donald Trump 's presidency.\nYou may not be fearful. And if you voted for Trump, you may believe that people have nothing to fear. But your comfort level or confidence does little to allay... \nLet's agree, if possible, on one thing in this moment of national division: There are many Americans fearful of Donald Trump 's presidency. \nYou may not be fearful. And if you voted for Trump, you may believe that people have nothing to fear. But your comfort level or confidence does little to allay... (Rex Huppke) \nBut she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees -- though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\" \nFew employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome. \nIn the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left. \nCEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways --- from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce -- more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum. IBM, for instance, was one of the corporate signers of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign opposing North Carolina's so-called \"bathroom bill,\" which dictates which restroom transgender people should use in government buildings and public schools. (Natalie Kitroeff) \nMeanwhile, companies must also grapple with employees' ability to broadcast their dissatisfaction via online channels. Wood's letter was shared widely on social media, with some calling her decision \"brave\" or commending her \"courage.\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defense of Rometty's letter. \nIn an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to President-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who's going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\" \nWood acknowledged that she had experienced frustrations of working in a company as large as IBM but said she had not been planning to leave the tech giant before seeing Rometty's letter. A writer and \"content strategist,\" Wood also said she was aware her move had the potential to raise her profile; she has pinned the letter she wrote to the top of her LinkedIn profile and her Twitter feed. \nYet she also said she was aware of and had considered the risks her outspokenness could prompt when it comes to getting hired in the future. \"I thought I would have a mark on my back,\" she said, making her \"that mouthy strategist that speaks out.\" She said she intends to freelance and does not have another full-time job lined up. \nA range of CEOs have written letters to employees in the aftermath of the election. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon , for instance, wrote to his employees that \"we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.\" Apple's Tim Cook quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that \"our company is open to all ... regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\" \nOthers have spoken directly in letters to the president-elect. Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, for instance, had his own words of advice for Trump in a letter addressed to him. \"While your Electoral College victory was solid, you should guard against the victor's curse: Don't convince yourself that your victory is a personal mandate that absolves you of the need to collaborate in governing. While millions voted for you because they agreed with your ideas, millions voted for you even though they agreed with only some of your ideas or because they didn't like the alternative. And, of course, many did not vote for you. Bring all those people along with you. Leadership is about listening and then convincing. It is not about mandating.\"",

      "title": "IBM Employee Answers CEO's Open Letter To Trump With An Open Letter Of Her Own",
      "text": "Brett Hershman , Benzinga Staff Writer November 29, 2016 4:01pm Comments Share: \nAn open resignation letter from an International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) employee to company CEO Virginia \"Ginni\" Rometty is circulating on the web in response to the Rometty’s “optimistic” open letter to President-elect Donald Trump last week. \nThe letter comes from Elizabeth Wood , a senior content strategist at IBM, and displayed her frustration with Rometty. The disgruntled employee fired shots at the CEO's support of Trump and his rhetoric toward minorities. \n“Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen,” said Wood. \nWith Rometty belonging to a small group of female Fortune 500 CEOs, Wood suggested the CEO’s stance on the new presidential administration should fall in line with another high profile female CEO, Indra K. Nooyi of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP ), who publicly condemned Trump. “Forget about the Pepsi brand. How dare we talk about women that way?” said Nooyi after the election. \nWood resigned from IBM with no back-up plan or job lined up, but because of her conviction regarding IBM’s support of Donald Trump. \n“With IBM The company’s hurry to do this was a tacit endorsement of his position, and has signaled to me something very important about IBM’s values: a willingness to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain,” she added. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

( INTC ) was little changed Tuesday afternoon amid reports it will supply chips to a joint venture formed by computer vision and machine learning specialist Mobileye NV ( MBLY ) and Delphi Automotive plc ( DLPH ) that is working to develop a self-driving vehicle.\nThe supply deal with Mobileye and Delphi represents a boost for Intel, which has been trying to broaden its chip dominance in the autonomous vehicle market. The deal was confirmed by Glen De Vos, Delphi's vice president for engineering, in an interview with Reuters.\nThe companies are hoping to debut an automated vehicle by 2019, with De Vos explaining it likely would operate initially within a limited area, such as a ride-hailing service or an airport shuttle. The joint venture was announced in August.\nINTC shares were down about 0.5% at $35.35 apiece, or dropping back near the bottom of their trading range today of $35.33 to $35.64 a share. MBLY shares also were ending lower, dropping just over 2% at $37.64 each, matching their session low while DLPH shares were off more than 4% at $63.62 a share, bouncing back somewhat from a much deeper decline to $60.50 a share.\nIn other sector news,\n(+) DRAM, Finalizes terms for the acquisition of U.S. Gold, the owner of an advanced-stage exploration project in the Silver Crown mining district of southern Wyoming.

      "text": "IBM, American Airlines Sign a Bigger Cloud Deal By Investopedia | November 29, 2016 — 4:34 PM EST \nThe long-standing relationship between the world's largest air carrier, American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) has expanded to include Big Blue's cloud-related Bluemix product suite. With this deal, the airline will be moving more of its enterprise applications to IBM's cloud. Financial terms were not disclosed. \nAccording to the announcement, American Airlines opted to do more business with its partner of some 60 years due to IBM's global cloud footprint, which includes more than 50 data centers and the flexibility of its Bluemix cloud platform. Bluemix includes comprehensive data analytics via IBM's cognitive computing system, Watson, along with app development and multiple server alternatives. \nThe new deal with American Airlines will help IBM maintain its momentum relating to all things cloud-related, which it demonstrated again last quarter. \nOf IBM's $12.7 billion annual cloud revenue run-rate in its third quarter, $7.5 billion -- up an impressive 66% compared to a year ago -- was derived from software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales. With cloud SaaS a key component of CEO Ginni Rometty's \"strategic imperatives\" initiative, that source is expected to propel its revenue growth in the burgeoning market. \nAlong with business-process-as-a service (BPaaS) solutions, cloud software sales are expected to generate a combined $80.3 billion this year, and there is no indication that rapid growth will slow anytime soon. That's great news for IBM as it positions itself as the cloud industry leader, and now it can add yet another significant win to its name. \n10 stocks we like better than IBM When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and IBM wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of Nov. 7, 2016 \nTim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "text": " IBM\nCHICAGO IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2016) it will preview new imaging solutions from Watson Health and Merge Healthcare (Merge; an IBM Company) designed to help healthcare providers pursue personalized approaches to patient diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The solutions benefit from more than a decade of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) work conducted in IBM Research. Further, IBM Research has partnered with the Radiological Society to debut a live demonstration of how Watson understands, reasons and learns from imaging information.\nMedical images are by far the largest and fastest-growing data source in the healthcare industry -- IBM researchers estimate that they account for at least 90% of all medical data today -- but they also present challenges that need to be addressed. The volume of medical images can be overwhelming to even the most sophisticated specialists; radiologists in some hospital emergency rooms are presented with thousands of images each day. 1\nTools to help clinicians extract insights from medical images remain limited, requiring most analysis to be done manually. This has created an opportunity to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources to enable providers to compare new medical images with a patient's image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies.\n\"The breadth and depth of Watson -powered solutions on display at RSNA 2016 from Watson Health's imaging group and from Merge are unmatched among the AI community, and showcase how IBM is bringing cognitive computing to healthcare in clinically meaningful ways,\" said Anne LeGrand , Vice President of Imaging for IBM Watson Health.\nWatson Health will show:\nA cognitive peer review tool intended to help healthcare professionals reconcile differences between a patient's clinical evidence, and data in that patient's electronic health record (EHR). A cognitive data summarization tool intended to provide radiologists, cardiologists, and other physicians with patient-specific clinical information to use when interpreting imaging studies, or when diagnosing and treating patients. A cognitive physician support tool intended to help doctors personalize healthcare decisions based on integrating imaging data with other types of patient data. The MedyMatch \"Brain Bleed\" App , a cognitive image review tool intended to help emergency room physicians diagnose a stroke or brain bleed in a trauma patient by identifying relevant evidence in a patient record. Merge will show:\nMarktation , a new process for interpreting medical images intended to help physicians improve image reading speed and accuracy, with an initial application in mammography. Watson Clinical Integration Module , a cloud application for radiologists that aims to help increase reader efficiency and counteract common causes of errors in medical imaging, such as base rate neglect, anchoring, bias, framing bias, and premature closure. Lesion Segmentation and Tracking Module , designed to help radiologists increase the speed by which they interpret and report comparison exams in cancer patients and for other patient conditions that require longitudinal tracking. \" Watson cognitive computing is ideally suited to support radiologists on their journey 'Beyond Imaging' to practices that address the needs of patient populations, deliver improved patient outcomes, and demonstrate real-world value,\" said Nancy Koenig , General Manager of Merge Healthcare. \"This week at RSNA, Merge is proud to unveil solutions for providers that enable the first steps on the cognitive care journey, addressing breast cancer, lung cancer, and trauma patients in the ER.\"\nRSNA and IBM Research Show Physicians How Watson Understands, Reasons and Learns\nIBM Research will show physicians how Watson might reduce the time to diagnosis and increase efficiency in provider workflows. Radiologists select cases from a variety of imaging topics, make their diagnosis, and see how a Watson solution attempts to assist the same case as it understands, reasons and learns from text- and imaging data in real time.\nThe live demonstration showcases more than a decade of work by IBM Research's top medical imaging, text mining, and AI data scientists. The demo is able to analyze patient data culled from thousands of data sources and present insights in a compact summary report intended to help clinicians efficiently reach a differential diagnosis. For example, the technology featured in the demo uses deep learning to recognize positions in the body for major anatomical structures (such as in a CT imaging study) and detects anomalies (such as dissections in the aorta, or embolisms in pulmonary arteries). Combining imaging and clinical data with clinical knowledge, it performs clinical inference on the patient's condition and its management, pre-assembling relevant information in a simple online format for a diagnosing physician to consider.\nIBM is also showcasing at RSNA 2016 its ecosystem approach to innovation, including the global Watson Health medical imaging collaborative and work with Siemens Healthineers to introduce Population Health Management solutions worldwide. For more information about IBM's presence at RSNA 2016, visit the Merge web site and follow @MergeHealthcare for #RSNA16 updates throughout the conference.\nThe Watson Health Imaging and Merge demonstrations are cognitive healthcare works-in-progress in Booth 2538 in South Hall A. 2\nAbout IBM Research\nFor more than seven decades, IBM Research has continued to define the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. Scientists from IBM Research have produced six Nobel Laureates, 10 U.S. National Medals of Technology, five U.S. National Medals of Science, six Turing Awards, 19 inductees in the National Academy of Sciences and 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame. For more information about IBM Research, visit www.research.ibm.com .\nAbout IBM Watson Health\nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. IBM Watson Health is helping to improve the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical research and social health data.

      "title": "IBM employee quits over her CEO&apos;s letter to Donald Trump",
      "text": "Most CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump , one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it.\nElizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda.\"\nWood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\"\nIn Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as healthcare, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote.\nWhat workplaces must do in the age of Trump Rex Huppke Let's agree, if possible, on one thing in this moment of national division: There are many Americans fearful of Donald Trump 's presidency.\nYou may not be fearful. And if you voted for Trump, you may believe that people have nothing to fear. But your comfort level or confidence does little to allay...\nLet's agree, if possible, on one thing in this moment of national division: There are many Americans fearful of Donald Trump 's presidency.\nYou may not be fearful. And if you voted for Trump, you may believe that people have nothing to fear. But your comfort level or confidence does little to allay...\n(Rex Huppke) But she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees -- though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\"\nFew employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome.\nIn the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left.\nCEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways --- from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce -- more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum. IBM, for instance, was one of the corporate signers of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign opposing North Carolina's so-called \"bathroom bill,\" which dictates which restroom transgender people should use in government buildings and public schools.\nTrump tapped the misery of factory workers, but can he bring back their jobs? Natalie Kitroeff Michael Smith is not used to stretching a paycheck. As recently as March 2015, the 42-year-old was earning nearly $100,000 a year as a district manager on oil fields for company based in Union City, Pa. Then oil prices dropped, and his company laid him off.\nSmith, a father of four boys, now makes...\nMichael Smith is not used to stretching a paycheck.

Wood's letter was shared widely on social media, with some calling her decision \"brave\" or commending her \"courage.\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defense of Rometty's letter.\nIn an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to President-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who's going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\"\nWood acknowledged that she had experienced frustrations of working in a company as large as IBM but said she had not been planning to leave the tech giant before seeing Rometty's letter. A writer and \"content strategist,\" Wood also said she was aware her move had the potential to raise her profile; she has pinned the letter she wrote to the top of her LinkedIn profile and her Twitter feed.\nYet she also said she was aware of and had considered the risks her outspokenness could prompt when it comes to getting hired in the future. \"I thought I would have a mark on my back,\" she said, making her \"that mouthy strategist that speaks out.\" She said she intends to freelance and does not have another full-time job lined up.\nA range of CEOs have written letters to employees in the aftermath of the election. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon , for instance, wrote to his employees that \"we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.\" Apple's Tim Cook Quote: d Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that \"our company is open to all ... regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"\nOthers have spoken directly in letters to the president-elect. Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, for instance, had his own words of advice for Trump in a letter addressed to him. \"While your Electoral College victory was solid, you should guard against the victor's curse: Don't convince yourself that your victory is a personal mandate that absolves you of the need to collaborate in governing. While millions voted for you because they agreed with your ideas, millions voted for you even though they agreed with only some of your ideas or because they didn't like the alternative. And, of course, many did not vote for you. Bring all those people along with you. Leadership is about listening and then convincing. It is not about mandating.\"\n Donald Trump Human Rights Campaign Tim Cook Indra K. Nooyi Jamie Dimon",

      "text": " IBM\nCyber Monday Becomes a Worldwide Shopping Event - Online Sales Up Nearly 17 Percent\nARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today reported that Cyber Monday has officially turned into a global shopping holiday with consumers taking advantage of online deals being offered by retailers all around the world. Over Cyber Monday, retailers saw online sales increase by 16.7 percent. Cyber Monday caps a five-day shopping period where online sales increased by nearly 9 percent (8.8%) over the same period in 2015.\nWith a dedicated team of technical experts, IBM ensured that all retail customers large and small were prepared for this surge and that all systems, whether cloud or on premise, remained up and running so they can meet the needs of their customers. Working with IBM's Holiday Readiness team, customers rapidly and securely scaled their online shopping, inventory and order management systems, generated massive amounts of data and successfully processed record numbers of transactions, one as high as 1M in a single day. As a result, IBM clients met the specific needs of each shopper, from the first click to when the item arrived in the hands of the customer.\nFor example:\nOn Cyber Monday alone IBM clients sent nearly 500M email notifications to consumers around the world – a one day record high. Mobile push outreach continued its rapid growth and was up 47 percent over 2015. A large home building and supply retailer saw a 44 percent increase in sales over 2015 and had more than 1.1 million page views per hour during their peak period. On Thanksgiving and Black Friday alone, a US retail giant received more than 2 million orders and a mid-sized women's apparel company processed more than 565K orders over the holiday shopping week. Over the holiday shopping period a US retailer generated more than 260 terabytes of data. A global technology company had more than 9.1M page views on their website per day. A major UK home and general merchandise provider experienced a 50% increase in website traffic this holiday season with a peak of more than 2,300 visits per second. \"Cyber Monday is a global shopping event and great deals appeal to all consumers regardless of where they live,\" said Harriet Green , general manager, IBM Commerce. \"At IBM we recognize that today's retailers must think globally and personalize interactions with every person whether they live around the corner or across the globe. To deliver this one-to-one experience retailers must embrace new innovations such as cognitive technologies delivered as a service with leading security and scalability to ensure the unique needs of every consumer are met.\"\nIBM has made significant investments to infuse cognitive capabilities and SaaS into its highly scalable and secure platform to help clients gain better insights into these high volumes of data and rapidly respond across all parts of the client journey. These investments are driving rapid client adoption as companies look for integrated offerings that fit into any IT environment and that span the entire client journey. Over the last ten months IBM has won nearly 800 new SaaS clients.\nIBM powers a full spectrum of cognitive commerce offerings delivered as a service and on premise for more 17,000 companies around the world including 7 of the top 10 companies on the Fortune 500. and companies such as 1 -800-FLOWERS.COM , Yoox Net-a-Porter, Moosejaw Mountaineering , The North Face , Luxottica, The Works UK, and hhgregg.\nFor more information visit THINK Marketing\nMedia Contact\nDoug Fraim\nIBM Media Relations\n617-501-6376\ndfraim@us.ibm.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-retail-clients-set-records-on-cyber-monday-turn-customer-demand-into-online-holiday-sales-growth-300369864.html\n ",

      "text": "IBM Cloud wins American Airlines deal \nIn these packages, you'll find ABC, Fox and NBC broadcast channels, and cable channels such as ESPN, HGTV, CNN, and Nickelodeon. At the 100-channel level you'll also get such channels as DIY Networks, BBC World News, and NBA TV. HBO and Cinemax will also be available for $5 each a month. What you won't get is CBS and Showtime. \nNow for the bad. \nYou also won't get cloud DVR services. PlayStation Vue already offers this and Sling TV is opening a beta cloud DVR program. \nAlso those local broadcast networks? You only get those in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, or New York City, where the broadcaster owns a local station. If you live, as I do, somewhere else, you'll only get next day video-on-demand for these networks. \nThat said, it's not that different from what Sling TV and PlayStation Vue offers. If you want local channels for the cheapest possible price your best bet is still an antenna for over-the-air broadcasts. \nOh, and NFL fans? You won't find DirecTV NFL Sunday Ticket here. That's still only available for DirecTV satellite customers. \nOut the door, DirecTV Now doesn't support Roku , the best of today's streaming devices . At launch DirecTV Now will support Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, web browsers, Android, iOS, Chromecast, and Google Cast TVs. If you pre-pay for any level of service, AT&T will throw an Amazon Fire Stick into the deal. For three months, they'll give you an Apple TV. In early 2017, AT&T claims the service will support Roku, Samsung smart TVs, and Amazon Fire tablets. \nFinally, there's the ugly. \nAT&T is smashing net neutrality with DirecTV Now. AT&T is a major broadband and wireless internet service provider (ISP). The company states that \"If you're an AT&T Mobility customer, DirecTV will pick up the tab for data to help you achieve all your binge-worthy goals. Data Free TV means you won't use your AT&T mobile data for watching DirecTV Now.\" \nNow that's quite a deal if you're at AT&T 4G user. Video eats up bandwidth like an elephant does peanuts. But, you're screwed if you use Verizon or any other service. \nYou're also likely to be messed over after the first year or two. The entire point of net neutrality is that all internet data is treated equally. No one is allowed to put, say, Netflix data into a fast lane or YouTube videos into a slow lane. \nWhat AT&T is trying to do is called zero rating . In this, AT&T isn't slowing down rivals Sling TV or PlayStation Vue. Nor is it speeding up DirecTV Now. Instead, in zero rating the content provider picks up the user's data charges. It just so happens that in this case, AT&T owns DirecTV. In short, AT&T is just shuffling money between accounts. \nThat's great for customers in the short run. But, in the long run it makes it much harder for its competitors, and afterwards its customers. If, for example, AT&T was successful in knocking out its competition, it could then drop zero rating and jack up its prices. \nSound far-fetched? AT&T is buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion . This would give them control of such content providers as CNN, HBO, DC Comics, Warner Bros, and Cartoon Network. \nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) saw this coming and has stated that it has \"serious concerns\" about AT&T zero rating DirecTV Now . \nThey have reason. What looks like a sweet deal now can easily become poisonous. \nWorst still, incoming president Trump is expected to back away from net neutrality . AT&T's plans plus Trump's anti-business regulation stance means net neutrality, and thus our open, free internet, is endangered. \nRelated Stories:",

      "title": "IBM employee quits over her CEO’s letter to Donald Trump",
      "text": "Most CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump, one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it. Elizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda.\"\nWood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\"\nIn Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as health care, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote.\nBut she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees — though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity.\nIBM spokesperson Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\"\nFew employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome.\nIn the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left.\nCEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways — from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce — more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum.\nMeanwhile, companies must also grapple with employees' ability to broadcast their dissatisfaction via online channels. Wood's letter was shared widely on social media, with some calling her decision \"brave\" or commending her \"courage.\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defence of Rometty's letter.\nIn an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to president-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who's going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\"\nWood acknowledged that she had experienced frustrations of working in a company as large as IBM, but said she had not been planning to leave the tech giant before seeing Rometty's letter. A writer and \"content strategist,\" Wood also said she was aware her move had the potential to raise her profile; she has pinned the letter she wrote to the top of her LinkedIn profile and her Twitter feed.\nYet she also said she was aware of and had considered the risks her outspokenness could prompt when it comes to getting hired in the future. \"I thought I would have a mark on my back,\" she said, making her \"that mouthy strategist that speaks out.\" She said she intends to freelance and does not have another full-time job lined up.\nWashington Post",

      "text": "An open resignation letter from an International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) employee to company CEO Virginia \"Ginni\" Rometty is circulating on the web in response to the Rometty’s “optimistic” open letter to President-elect Donald Trump last week.\nThe letter comes from Elizabeth Wood , a senior content strategist at IBM, and displayed her frustration with Rometty. The disgruntled employee fired shots at the CEO's support of Trump and his rhetoric toward minorities.\n“Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen,” said Wood.\nWith Rometty belonging to a small group of female Fortune 500 CEOs, Wood suggested the CEO’s stance on the new presidential administration should fall in line with another high profile female CEO, Indra K. Nooyi of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP ), who publicly condemned Trump. “Forget about the Pepsi brand. How dare we talk about women that way?” said Nooyi after the election.\nWood resigned from IBM with no back-up plan or job lined up, but because of her conviction regarding IBM’s support of Donald Trump.\n“With IBM The company’s hurry to do this was a tacit endorsement of his position, and has signaled to me something very important about IBM’s values: a willingness to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain,” she added.\n ",

      "text": "American Airlines Moves to IBM Cloud (AAL, IBM) By Vanessa Page | November 29, 2016 — 2:26 PM EST \nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. ( AAL ) and International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) announced a new partnership on Nov. 29. Financial details of the partnership have not been released. \nAccording to a press release from IBM, American Airlines has named IBM as its cloud provider. The partnership will allow American Airlines “greater enterprise flexibility, scalability and reliability.” Currently, IBM has 50 data centers in 17 countries. (See also: Cloud Battle Gets More Intelligent .) \nAmerican Airlines will move some of its business software applications to IBM’s public cloud and then use IBM’S Bluemix tools to modernize them, reports Fortune. American Airlines will also begin using Watson, IBM’s artificial intelligence software. This software will allow the airline to analyze data and customize its existing software. \nAccording to CIO Dive, American Airlines had been searching for a cloud provider for months. Given its recent computer failure, American is likely to outsource more computer infrastructure and applications. (See also: US Airlines Affected by Sabre Glitch .) \nIBM beat out Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) and Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) to win the partnership contract, reports CIO Dive. This partnership is not American Airlines’s first partnership with IBM. The two companies had previously worked together to build SABRE, the online reservation system.

      "title": "IBM Employee Quits Over Her CEO's Letter To Donald Trump",
      "text": "World | Jena McGregor, The Washington Post | Updated: November 30, 2016 09:06 IST EMAIL COMMENTS IBM CEO Ginni Rometty delivers a keynote address during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. Most CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump, one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it.Elizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda.\"Wood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\"In Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as healthcare, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote.But she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees -- though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\"Few employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome.In the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left.CEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways --- from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce -- more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum. IBM, for instance, was one of the corporate signers of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign opposing North Carolina's so-called \"bathroom bill,\" which dictates which restroom transgender people should use in government buildings and public schools.Meanwhile, companies must also grapple with employees' ability to broadcast their dissatisfaction via online channels. Wood's letter was shared widely on social media, with some calling her decision \"brave\" or commending her \"courage.\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defense of Rometty's letter.In an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to President-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who's going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\"Wood acknowledged that she had experienced frustrations of working in a company as large as IBM but said she had not been planning to leave the tech giant before seeing Rometty's letter. A writer and \"content strategist,\" Wood also said she was aware her move had the potential to raise her profile; she has pinned the letter she wrote to the top of her LinkedIn profile and her Twitter feed.Yet she also said she was aware of and had considered the risks her outspokenness could prompt when it comes to getting hired in the future. \"I thought I would have a mark on my back,\" she said, making her \"that mouthy strategist that speaks out.\" She said she intends to freelance and does not have another full-time job lined up.A range of CEOs have written letters to employees in the aftermath of the election. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, wrote to his employees that \"we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.\" Apple's Tim Cook quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that \"our company is open to all ... regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"Others have spoken directly in letters to the president-elect. Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, for instance, had his own words of advice for Trump in a letter addressed to him. \"While your Electoral College victory was solid, you should guard against the victor's curse: Don't convince yourself that your victory is a personal mandate that absolves you of the need to collaborate in governing. While millions voted for you because they agreed with your ideas, millions voted for you even though they agreed with only some of your ideas or because they didn't like the alternative. And, of course, many did not vote for you. Bring all those people along with you. Leadership is about listening and then convincing. It is not about mandating.\"ÂŠ 2016 The Washington Post (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.) Trending",

      "title": "Erich Bloch, IBM pioneer who later led National Science Foundation, dies at 91",
      "text": "Erich Bloch, an electrical engineer who helped usher in the era of modern computing during three decades with IBM, and who later directed hundreds of millions of federal dollars toward scientific and technological innovation as director of the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, died Nov. 25 at his home in Washington, D.C. He was 91. The cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, said his daughter, Rebecca Rosen.\nThe only child in a German-Jewish family, Mr. Bloch was orphaned during the Holocaust, survived the war years in Switzerland at a home for young refugees, and immigrated to the United States in 1948. He put himself through night school while pumping gas and cleaning laboratory equipment.\nIn 1952, he joined IBM in New York, where he established himself as a preeminent engineer in computing – and where he sharpened a competitive streak that he took to the sometimes fusty halls of government. As NSF director from 1984 to 1990, Mr. Bloch was credited with transforming the agency from a benefactor mainly of pure research into an engine of practical advancement.\nHe “changed NSF’s image,” Science magazine writers Joseph Palca and Eliot Marshall observed when Mr. Bloch left office, “from that of a mother hen for a brood of academic scientists to an agency with a plan for improving the nation.”\nMr. Bloch was the first NSF director to come from a business rather than academic background and the first without a doctoral degree. His qualifications lay in his achievements at IBM, where he helped mastermind revolutionary developments in computing.\nHe was chief engineer of the company’s “Stretch” supercomputer, so named because it stretched what were then the limits of computing. Introduced in 1961 with a $10 million price tag, it was used initially by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Security Agency and was the most powerful computer at the time.\nLater that decade, Mr. Bloch helped develop the IBM System/360, a family of models that are the ancestors of today’s mainframes. Fred Brooks, one of two IBM colleagues who shared with Mr. Bloch a 1985 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, credited Mr. Bloch with managing the development of the computer’s processing chips, called Solid Logic Technology.\nThomas J. Watson Jr., who led IBM at the time, is widely regarded as having “bet the company” on Mr. Bloch, his colleagues and System/360 project, which cost $5 billion – twice the company’s annual revenue. It became, according to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., the “most successful computer system of all time.”\n“These were really the Apollo astronauts of the computing field,” John C. Hollar, the president and chief executive of the museum, said in an interview. “They were doing things that no one had ever attempted to do before.”\nMr. Bloch’s experience at IBM informed his philosophy at NSF, a federal agency that is the government’s chief funder of non-medical scientific research. His goal, he told the publication Science in 1985, was to make sure “that our own infrastructure and research is the best in the world,” capable of competing with Europe, Japan and other markets.\n“A lot of people are upset about that kind of approach to life. They say science is international, so who cares who does it,” he remarked.”I say science is no more international than commerce is. . . . I think it’s a highly competitive field, I don’t apologize for it.”\nBill Harris, who served at NSF as assistant director for math and physical sciences, credited the approach with saving the NSF from possible elimination during federal belt-tightening. Mr. Bloch persuaded Reagan administration officials not only to spare it, but even to increase its budget.\nUnder Mr. Bloch, the NSF emphasized fields such as computer science, engineering and biotechnology. He oversaw the creation of NSFNET, a precursor to the modern Internet, and the establishment at universities of Engineering Research Centers as well as Science and Technology Centers – long-term collaborations among the public, private and academic sectors to tackle complex matters such as lasers applications and earthquake prediction and engineering.\n“The single investigator can’t do it with a Bunsen burner,” he told Science in 1986.\nMr. Bloch’s admirers regarded him as a powerful advocate for results in a bureaucracy that tended toward inertia. Some detractors saw him as insufficiently attentive to individual researchers pursuing questions of pure science. But, in his view, scientists “have no inalienable right to funding.”\n“If all that we are doing is the individual research grant approach to science, then I think this country is going down the drain,” he told Science. “Science is changing, the tools of science are changing. And that requires different approaches. Yeah, it will make some people nervous. Well, they don’t have to participate in it. But that doesn’t mean that the country doesn’t need that approach. It does need it. And it should have started earlier, in my opinion.”\nErich Bloch was born in Sulzburg, a town located in the Black Forest, on Jan. 9, 1925. His father, a businessman, and his mother, a homemaker, were deported by the Nazis and perished in the concentration camps.\n“I have been pretty much on my own my whole life,” he told the New York Times in 1987. “It wasn’t easy getting started. It took a certain amount of drive and aggressiveness. I learned very early I had to do things myself for something to get done.”\nMr. Bloch received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1952 before joining IBM, where he retired as vice president of technical personnel development.\nAt NSF, Mr. Bloch took particular interest in programs benefitting women, minorities and the disabled in the sciences. After leaving office, he co-founded a consulting firm, the Washington Advisory Group. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the nonprofit Council on Competitiveness and a past board member of Motorola.\nHis wife of 56 years, the former Renee Stern, died in 2004. Survivors include his daughter, Rebecca Rosen of Trumbull, Conn.; two granddaughters; and two great-grandchildren.\nIn recent years, an interviewer from SUNY-Buffalo asked Mr. Bloch if, looking back on his career at NSF and beyond, he would have done anything differently.\n“No,” he replied. “I did what I thought at that time was important. Revisiting that now and coming to a different conclusion is not very helpful to anyone, especially oneself. You live a life only once. You don’t live it twice. You do what you think is right at the time, and you stand on that.”\nbloch-obit",

      "text": "November 29, 2016 at 11:14 AM EST IBM Unveils Watson-Powered Imaging Solutions for Healthcare Providers IBM today announced at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting it will preview new imaging solutions from Watson Health and Merge Healthcare designed to help healthcare providers pursue personalized approaches to patient diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The post IBM Unveils Watson-Powered Imaging Solutions for Healthcare Providers appeared first on Investing News Network . \nIBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2016) it will preview new imaging solutions from Watson Health and Merge Healthcare (Merge; an IBM Company) designed to help healthcare providers pursue personalized approaches to patient diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The solutions benefit from more than a decade of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) work conducted in IBM Research. Further, IBM Research has partnered with the Radiological Society to debut a live demonstration of how Watson understands, reasons and learns from imaging information. \nMedical images are by far the largest and fastest-growing data source in the healthcare industry — IBM researchers estimate that they account for at least 90% of all medical data today — but they also present challenges that need to be addressed. The volume of medical images can be overwhelming to even the most sophisticated specialists; radiologists in some hospital emergency rooms are presented with thousands of images each day. 1 \nTools to help clinicians extract insights from medical images remain limited, requiring most analysis to be done manually. This has created an opportunity to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources to enable providers to compare new medical images with a patient’s image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies. \n“The breadth and depth of Watson -powered solutions on display at RSNA 2016 from Watson Health’s imaging group and from Merge are unmatched among the AI community, and showcase how IBM is bringing cognitive computing to healthcare in clinically meaningful ways,” said Anne LeGrand , Vice President of Imaging for IBM Watson Health. \nWatson Health will show: A cognitive peer review tool intended to help healthcare professionals reconcile differences between a patient’s clinical evidence, and data in that patient’s electronic health record (EHR). A cognitive data summarization tool intended to provide radiologists, cardiologists, and other physicians with patient-specific clinical information to use when interpreting imaging studies, or when diagnosing and treating patients. A cognitive physician support tool intended to help doctors personalize healthcare decisions based on integrating imaging data with other types of patient data. The MedyMatch “Brain Bleed” App , a cognitive image review tool intended to help emergency room physicians diagnose a stroke or brain bleed in a trauma patient by identifying relevant evidence in a patient record. \nMerge will show: Marktation , a new process for interpreting medical images intended to help physicians improve image reading speed and accuracy, with an initial application in mammography. Watson Clinical Integration Module , a cloud application for radiologists that aims to help increase reader efficiency and counteract common causes of errors in medical imaging, such as base rate neglect, anchoring, bias, framing bias, and premature closure. Lesion Segmentation and Tracking Module , designed to help radiologists increase the speed by which they interpret and report comparison exams in cancer patients and for other patient conditions that require longitudinal tracking. \n“ Watson cognitive computing is ideally suited to support radiologists on their journey ‘Beyond Imaging’ to practices that address the needs of patient populations, deliver improved patient outcomes, and demonstrate real-world value,” said Nancy Koenig , General Manager of Merge Healthcare. “This week at RSNA, Merge is proud to unveil solutions for providers that enable the first steps on the cognitive care journey, addressing breast cancer, lung cancer, and trauma patients in the ER.” \nRSNA and IBM Research Show Physicians How Watson Understands, Reasons and Learns IBM Research will show physicians how Watson might reduce the time to diagnosis and increase efficiency in provider workflows. Radiologists select cases from a variety of imaging topics, make their diagnosis, and see how a Watson solution attempts to assist the same case as it understands, reasons and learns from text- and imaging data in real time. \nThe live demonstration showcases more than a decade of work by IBM Research’s top medical imaging, text mining, and AI data scientists. The demo is able to analyze patient data culled from thousands of data sources and present insights in a compact summary report intended to help clinicians efficiently reach a differential diagnosis. For example, the technology featured in the demo uses deep learning to recognize positions in the body for major anatomical structures (such as in a CT imaging study) and detects anomalies (such as dissections in the aorta, or embolisms in pulmonary arteries). Combining imaging and clinical data with clinical knowledge, it performs clinical inference on the patient’s condition and its management, pre-assembling relevant information in a simple online format for a diagnosing physician to consider. \nIBM is also showcasing at RSNA 2016 its ecosystem approach to innovation, including the global Watson Health medical imaging collaborative and work with Siemens Healthineers to introduce Population Health Management solutions worldwide. For more information about IBM’s presence at RSNA 2016, visit the Merge web site and follow @MergeHealthcare for #RSNA16 updates throughout the conference. \nThe Watson Health Imaging and Merge demonstrations are cognitive healthcare works-in-progress in Booth 2538 in South Hall A. 2 \nAbout IBM Research For more than seven decades, IBM Research has continued to define the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. Scientists from IBM Research have produced six Nobel Laureates, 10 U.S. National Medals of Technology, five U.S. National Medals of Science, six Turing Awards, 19 inductees in the National Academy of Sciences and 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame. For more information about IBM Research, visit www.research.ibm.com . \nAbout IBM Watson Health Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. IBM Watson Health is helping to improve the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical research and social health data.

      "text": "Home | International Business | IBM Employee Quits In Protest Over CEO's Letter To Donald Trump Elizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week. Jena McGregor, The Washington Post | Last Updated: November 30, 2016 10:15 (IST) Jena McGregor, The Washington Post EMAIL COMMENTS IBM CEO Ginni Rometty in her letter to Trump had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration \nMost CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump, one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it. Elizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda.\" Wood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\" In Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as healthcare, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote. But she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees -- though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\" Few employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome. In the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left. CEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways --- from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce -- more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum. IBM, for instance, was one of the corporate signers of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign opposing North Carolina's so-called \"bathroom bill,\" which dictates which restroom transgender people should use in government buildings and public schools. Meanwhile, companies must also grapple with employees' ability to broadcast their dissatisfaction via online channels. Wood's letter was shared widely on social media, with some calling her decision \"brave\" or commending her \"courage.\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defense of Rometty's letter. In an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to President-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who's going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\" Wood acknowledged that she had experienced frustrations of working in a company as large as IBM but said she had not been planning to leave the tech giant before seeing Rometty's letter. A writer and \"content strategist,\" Wood also said she was aware her move had the potential to raise her profile; she has pinned the letter she wrote to the top of her LinkedIn profile and her Twitter feed. Yet she also said she was aware of and had considered the risks her outspokenness could prompt when it comes to getting hired in the future. \"I thought I would have a mark on my back,\" she said, making her \"that mouthy strategist that speaks out.\" She said she intends to freelance and does not have another full-time job lined up. A range of CEOs have written letters to employees in the aftermath of the election. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, wrote to his employees that \"we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.\" Apple's Tim Cook quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that \"our company is open to all ... regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"\nOthers have spoken directly in letters to the president-elect. Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, for instance, had his own words of advice for Trump in a letter addressed to him. \"While your Electoral College victory was solid, you should guard against the victor's curse: Don't convince yourself that your victory is a personal mandate that absolves you of the need to collaborate in governing. While millions voted for you because they agreed with your ideas, millions voted for you even though they agreed with only some of your ideas or because they didn't like the alternative. And, of course, many did not vote for you. Bring all those people along with you. Leadership is about listening and then convincing. It is not about mandating.\" (c) 2016, The Washington Post (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nHelsinki, Finland and Armonk, N.Y. - 30 Nov 2016: Finnair and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a first-of-its-kind agreement to utilize iOS enterprise apps from IBM to support the airline’s overall digital transformation. \nIBM expands its global cloud data center footprint by opening 4 new facilities in UK. IBM Cloud will have 6 cloud data centers in UK, 16 across Europe and 50+ worldwide. (credit IBM) Finnair is focused on Asia-Europe traffic, carrying over 10 million customers annually and connecting 70 European destinations with 17 Asian mega-cities and three North-American cities via its Helsinki hub. In preparation for growth, Finnair has recruited more than 500 employees, rolled out new aircraft and launched new routes this year. Now, Finnair seeks to improve its processes and enhance the customer experience through digital transformation. \n\"Our collaboration with Apple and IBM is an important building block in our digital transformation,\" says Katri Harra-Salonen, Chief Digital Officer, Finnair. \"We want to link our employees with the insights they need to make better decisions. This collaboration enables a user focused, high quality, yet cost effective way of developing digital solutions, helping us to improve the way we operate as an airline.\" \nFirst applications from the collaboration will be deployed in Finnair Technical Operations in aircraft line maintenance in the beginning of 2017. \n“We see a wealth of opportunities for improving productivity as well as adding value to the work flow of our employees, by improving real-time visibility and transparency across the entire maintenance process,\" says Jari Huhtinen, Head of Finnair Technical Operations. \"Our mechanics team participated in the application creation work with Apple and IBM to ensure the best possible design, user experience and fit into our organizational processes.\" \nFinnair is the first organization to take advantage of IBM's new app design and development model for clients that plan to adopt multiple iOS apps, called Mobile at Scale for iOS. This integrated approach, unique to IBM MobileFirst for iOS , increases the speed, efficiency and quality of how iOS apps are designed, developed, deployed, enhanced and maintained over their lifecycle. \nThe airline has a team in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS Garage dedicated to rapidly executing Finnair projects. The MobileFirst for iOS Garage operates as a global hub for the development of iOS, enabling Finnair to tap into the world’s largest concentration of Swift developers, design, integration and iOS device expertise along with consulting services. The Garage team can deliver initial apps in weeks that are tailored to meet Finnair’s enterprise needs and the user requirements of its employees This integrated approach brings consistency to the project, saving 25 percent of development effort, cost and time . \nThe apps will be managed and hosted on IBM Cloud allowing Finnair to implement multiple apps at speed and at scale, transforming everyday tasks for employees across the organization. The apps combine simplicity with the power of analytics to generate insight for more informed decision-making and better management. \n“Finnair is innovating and setting an example -- not just for its industry, but for all enterprises. Rather than using mobile in silos, the airline is looking to IBM’s industry expertise and solutions to digitize the entire airline,” said Raimon Christiani , global industry leader IBM Travel & Transportation. “Finnair has access to IBM’s full portfolio of MobileFirst for iOS apps and if there’s something else it needs to empower employees and provide Finnair passengers a more seamless travel experience, we can build it.\" \nThe first apps to be rolled out within the agreement are: Inspect & Turn provides aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation with analytics-driven recommendations to complete work assignments to ensure the safe upkeep of aircraft and achievement of on-time arrival and departure targets. Assign Tech provides aircraft mechanic supervisors a clear overview of ﬂight schedules, maintenance process and mechanic availability. Using advanced analytics, the app recommends optimal shift assignments and incorporates the skills and certiﬁcations of each mechanic. Push notiﬁcations also alert supervisors to ﬂight delays process issues, so they can easily make changes on the ﬂy. \nAbout Finnair \nFinnair flies between Asia, Europe and North America with an emphasis on fast connections via Helsinki, carrying more than ten million passengers annually and connecting 17 cities in Asia with more than 70 destinations in Europe. The only Nordic carrier with a 4-star Skytrax ranking, Finnair has also won the World Airline Award for Best Airline Northern Europe for the past seven years running. Finnair is a member of one world, the alliance of the world's leading airlines committed to providing the highest level of service and convenience to frequent international travelers. www.finnair.com . \nAbout IBM \nFor more information, visit http://www.ibm.com/services/gbs . \nFor more information regarding IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps and services please visit www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/mobilefirst-for-ios.html or www.apple.com/business/mobile-enterprise-apps/ .

      "text": "November 30, 2016 12:01am Comments Share: First IBM MobileFirst for iOS applications taken into use in Finnair Technical Operations \nHELSINKI and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Finnair and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a first-of-its-kind agreement to utilize iOS enterprise apps from IBM to support the airline's overall digital transformation. \nFinnair is focused on Asia - Europe traffic, carrying over 10 million customers annually and connecting 70 European destinations with 17 Asian mega-cities and three North-American cities via its Helsinki hub. In preparation for growth, Finnair has recruited more than 500 employees, rolled out new aircraft and launched new routes this year. Now, Finnair seeks to improve its processes and enhance the customer experience through digital transformation. \n\"Our collaboration with Apple and IBM is an important building block in our digital transformation,\" says Katri Harra-Salonen , Chief Digital Officer, Finnair. \"We want to link our employees with the insights they need to make better decisions. This collaboration enables a user focused, high quality, yet cost effective way of developing digital solutions, helping us to improve the way we operate as an airline.\" \nFirst applications from the collaboration will be deployed in Finnair Technical Operations in aircraft line maintenance in the beginning of 2017. \n\"We see a wealth of opportunities for improving productivity as well as adding value to the work flow of our employees, by improving real-time visibility and transparency across the entire maintenance process,\" says Jari Huhtinen, Head of Finnair Technical Operations. \"Our mechanics team participated in the application creation work with Apple and IBM to ensure the best possible design, user experience and fit into our organizational processes.\" \nFinnair is the first organization to take advantage of IBM's new app design and development model for clients that plan to adopt multiple iOS apps, called Mobile at Scale for iOS.

They make a decent daily driver once you remap the keys and swap a few keycaps around. :-) « Last Edit: Mon, 28 November 2016, 14:21:22 by ekeppel » Logged Re: IBM Model F XT Keyboards - 3 available @$60 each free shipping « Reply #1 on: Mon, 28 November 2016, 15:24:46 » These have great switches. Clean, remap, swap a few keycaps and you've got a great Model F keyboard. - Ron | samwisekoi Logged I like keyboards and case modding. Everything about a computer should be silent -- except the KEYBOARD!'85 IBM F-122/Soarer Keyboard | Leopold FC200 TKL (Browns) + GH36 Keypad (Browns/Greens) | GH-122 (Browns/Greens) with Nuclear Data Green keycaps in a Unicomp case « Reply #2 on: Mon, 28 November 2016, 15:36:47 » **** remapping, you'd be surprised at how functional the layout is if you give it a try . « Reply #3 on: Tue, 29 November 2016, 15:57:11 » what would be your suggestion for remapping it? especially for the ctrl-alt-(win)-arrows-del-ins ?thanks, what would be your suggestion for remapping it? especially for the ctrl-alt-(win)-arrows-del-ins ?thanks, tent:wq Everyone has their own preference and some don't remap at all, as Chyros said. Here is the Soarer's Converter config file that I'm currently using: Quote EQUAL F12endblock I moved around a bunch of keys, stole keys from a Model M, and even swapped a hammer over so as to use the same wide left-shift from an ANSI Model M. The left arrow next to the original enter key is a duplicate enter key so I don't need to stretch my pinky. That way it is in about the same spot as I hit enter on a regular ANSI keyboard. The right ALT used to be my WIN-key, but it's since become a FN key to enable a second layer F1-F12 along the top row and force the numpad from navigation back to numbers while held. I have volume up/down and mute to the left where F6-F8 would normally be. With the second layer handling F1-F12 already, you could put a win key over there along with whatever else you wanted quick access to.The numpad has been reconfigured to have most of the keys that a standard numpad would have, but of course it is missing the enter key thanks to that GIANT + key that IBM stuck there, lol. :-)Yes, those are labels from a handheld label printer on the backspace and right shift key. They are 1.5W keys taken from a Model M. I just found them easier to hit than the stepped keys that were there originally. I realize the whole thing is rather ugly (some would say an abomination), but it's a work in progress and does improve usability for me. I am trying to keep the typing experience as close to a standard 101 ANSI feel as I can for the majority of the keyboard, but of course it's just not completely possible with this PCB.If anyone has any suggestions or criticisms, feel free to let me know.Edit: I just realized that I don't know how to properly insert a scrollable inline text file, so I ended up using the QUOTE tag.

      "text": "November 30, 2016 at 00:01 AM EST Finnair Adopts iOS Enterprise Apps from IBM to Accelerate Digital Transformation \nHELSINKI and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Finnair and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a first-of-its-kind agreement to utilize iOS enterprise apps from IBM to support the airline's overall digital transformation. \nFinnair is focused on Asia - Europe traffic, carrying over 10 million customers annually and connecting 70 European destinations with 17 Asian mega-cities and three North-American cities via its Helsinki hub. In preparation for growth, Finnair has recruited more than 500 employees, rolled out new aircraft and launched new routes this year. Now, Finnair seeks to improve its processes and enhance the customer experience through digital transformation. \n\"Our collaboration with Apple and IBM is an important building block in our digital transformation,\" says Katri Harra-Salonen , Chief Digital Officer, Finnair. \"We want to link our employees with the insights they need to make better decisions. This collaboration enables a user focused, high quality, yet cost effective way of developing digital solutions, helping us to improve the way we operate as an airline.\" \nFirst applications from the collaboration will be deployed in Finnair Technical Operations in aircraft line maintenance in the beginning of 2017. \n\"We see a wealth of opportunities for improving productivity as well as adding value to the work flow of our employees, by improving real-time visibility and transparency across the entire maintenance process,\" says Jari Huhtinen, Head of Finnair Technical Operations. \"Our mechanics team participated in the application creation work with Apple and IBM to ensure the best possible design, user experience and fit into our organizational processes.\" \nFinnair is the first organization to take advantage of IBM's new app design and development model for clients that plan to adopt multiple iOS apps, called Mobile at Scale for iOS. This integrated approach, unique to IBM MobileFirst for iOS , increases the speed, efficiency and quality of how iOS apps are designed, developed, deployed, enhanced and maintained over their lifecycle. \nThe airline has a team in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS Garage dedicated to rapidly executing Finnair projects. The MobileFirst for iOS Garage operates as a global hub for the development of iOS, enabling Finnair to tap into the world's largest concentration of Swift developers, design, integration and iOS device expertise along with consulting services. The Garage team can deliver initial apps in weeks that are tailored to meet Finnair's enterprise needs and the user requirements of its employees This integrated approach brings consistency to the project, saving 25 percent of development effort, cost and time. \nThe apps will be managed and hosted on IBM Cloud allowing Finnair to implement multiple apps at speed and at scale, transforming everyday tasks for employees across the organization. The apps combine simplicity with the power of analytics to generate insight for more informed decision-making and better management. \n\"Finnair is innovating and setting an example -- not just for its industry, but for all enterprises. Rather than using mobile in silos, the airline is looking to IBM's industry expertise and solutions to digitize the entire airline,\" said Raimon Christiani , global industry leader IBM Travel & Transportation. \"Finnair has access to IBM's full portfolio of MobileFirst for iOS apps and if there's something else it needs to empower employees and provide Finnair passengers a more seamless travel experience, we can build it.\" \nThe first apps to be rolled out within the agreement are: Inspect & Turn provides aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation with analytics-driven recommendations to complete work assignments to ensure the safe upkeep of aircraft and achievement of on-time arrival and departure targets. Assign Tech provides aircraft mechanic supervisors a clear overview of ﬂight schedules, maintenance process and mechanic availability. Using advanced analytics, the app recommends optimal shift assignments and incorporates the skills and certiﬁcations of each mechanic. Push notiﬁcations also alert supervisors to ﬂight delays process issues, so they can easily make changes on the ﬂy. \nAbout Finnair Finnair flies between Asia , Europe and North America with an emphasis on fast connections via Helsinki , carrying more than ten million passengers annually and connecting 17 cities in Asia with more than 70 destinations in Europe . The only Nordic carrier with a 4-star Skytrax ranking, Finnair has also won the World Airline Award for Best Airline Northern Europe for the past seven years running. Finnair is a member of one world, the alliance of the world's leading airlines committed to providing the highest level of service and convenience to frequent international travelers. www.finnair.com \nAbout IBM For more information, visit http://www.ibm.com/services/gbs . \nFor more information regarding IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps and services please visit www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/mobilefirst-for-ios.html or www.apple.com/business/mobile-enterprise-apps/ . \nCONTACTS:",

Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris. IBM employee quits over her CEO's letter to Donald Trump By Jena McGregor • Washington Post 10 hrs ago ( … ) David Paul Morris \nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty delivers a keynote address during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, on Jan. 6, 2016. Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris. \nMost CEO letters are greeted by employees with a yawn. But after IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter to president-elect Donald Trump, one of her employees decided to quit in response, publishing a letter of her own online to describe why she did it. \nElizabeth Wood, until recently a senior content strategist at IBM, published an \"open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty\" last week in which she said she resigned because she felt the Nov. 15 letter \"offered the backing of IBM's global workforce in support of his agenda.\" \nWood, 31, wrote that the tech giant's recruitment materials suggest \"the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision\" within the letter Rometty wrote to Trump. Wood wrote to Rometty that \"the president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead.\" \nIn Rometty's letter to Trump, she had offered ways for IBM to work with the new administration, saying \"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.\" She spoke about scaling up vocational \"new collar\" IT jobs, working on infrastructure projects that incorporate technology and artificial intelligence, as well as healthcare, tax reform, and the use of IBM technology to improve care for veterans. \"As you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society,\" Rometty wrote. \nBut she did not address the deeply divisive rhetoric from Trump's campaign or his supporters about issues such as undocumented immigration or a proposed ban on Muslim refugees — though, when she shared that letter with employees, she said in the accompanying email that IBM supports tolerance and diversity. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said \"the great majority of feedback from IBM employees has been very positive\" but noted that the company, as a policy, does not otherwise comment on personnel matters. In her letter to Trump, Rometty also wrote that \"in the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.\" \nFew employees, of course, are likely to quit over a CEO's letter. Still, Wood's very public response is illustrative of the delicate and unusual situation many CEOs could find themselves in following this year's election outcome. \nIn the aftermath of such a brutally divisive campaign, business leaders' public comments and traditional outreach to a new administration have come under greater scrutiny by their employees and customers. Remarks by PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi at a November conference sparked a boycott from some Trump supporters, while a comment by a New Balance executive prompted a backlash from the left. \nCEOs, of course, must advocate for their company's business interests and opportunities. Yet at the same time, especially as businesses have touted their commitment to issues like diversity and gay rights in increasingly public ways — from political advocacy to sharing data about their own workforce — more employees are going to expect their bosses to speak out forcefully on those issues, no matter the forum. IBM, for instance, was one of the corporate signers of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign opposing North Carolina's so-called \"bathroom bill,\" which dictates which restroom transgender people should use in government buildings and public schools. \nMeanwhile, companies must also grapple with employees' ability to broadcast their dissatisfaction via online channels. Wood's letter was shared widely on social media, with some calling her decision \"brave\" or commending her \"courage.\" Comments to her letter online were met with everything from praise to defense of Rometty's letter. \nIn an interview, Wood, who had worked for IBM for two years and whose mother was born in Cuba, said she would have liked Rometty to send \"a more inclusivity-minded statement\" to President-elect Trump, and that a mention of diversity and tolerance in an internal email was not enough. \"To not acknowledge that in your first correspondence with someone who's going to be in control when you have such a responsibility to your workforce to represent them,\" she said, was a \"huge disservice.\"",

      "text": "Mahindra and IBM to Develop Blockchain Solution for Supply Chain Finance Cloud-based blockchain app to speed invoice discounting   MUMBAI , India and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov.   The Mahindra Group, one of the largest diversified multinational group of companies based in India , and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced the development of a blockchain solution that has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes. This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions through a permissioned distributed ledger. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only their part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information. Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. Supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes have historically been said to be difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers. Human errors during this process have been known to create inconsistent records, ultimately resulting in delayed payments and capital that cannot be accessed. \"The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth. We are actively looking at other applications across the Group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech ,\" said Anish Shah , Group President (Strategy), Mahindra Group. \" This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance's small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time.\" Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future. \"Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, and IBM is at the forefront of the revolution. We offer a comprehensive enterprise-class blockchain solution that is secure, scalable and reliable. The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, and we're confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,\" said Lula Mohanty , Managing Partner of IBM Global Business Services, IBM ISA. IBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make Blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger Fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix cloud, developers can easily and quickly develop applications while testing security, availability and performance of a permissioned blockchain network. IBM is committed to advancing the science of blockchain, helping to remove complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, trade finance and logistics, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks.

(Photo: Russell Edwards/TED) \nFrom artists to scientists, mothers, mathematicians and business visionaries, people in every corner of the world are dreaming up solutions to our most pressing problems. Whether tackling war and peace or the principles of machine learning, ingenuity starts with one thing: a spark. \nAnd regardless of where the spark takes hold, inspiration demands action to reach its greatest potential. At the third installment of TED@IBM — part of the TED Institute , held on November 15, 2016, at the SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco — a diverse and brilliant collection of speakers and performers dared to ask: What if we used our collective expertise and insights to provide a spark that could change the world for good? \nAfter opening remarks from Michela Stribling, IBM’s editorial director, the talks in Session 1 challenged us to think about how we can work together to solve problems and, maybe, leave the planet better than we found it. \nWhere light meets sound. In a performance that blurs the boundaries of light and sound, Ryan and Hays Holladay create a visual experience of beats and tones shaped around reverberations of color. With multicolored projections and an assortment of carefully placed lamps, the brothers transcribe their music across the illuminated bursts of surfaces suddenly made visible. Here, music becomes the performer, rather than the performance, directing us not toward itself but toward the tempo and rhythm that orchestrates its narration. It’s a melody as much seen as it is heard: a series of intonations whose colorful pattern of sound eventually collapses into the nearly faded spotlight of a solitary lamp. \nThe answer to fighting cybercrime. Cybercrime netted $450 billion in profits last year, with 2 billion records lost or stolen. As the vice president at IBM Security, Caleb Barlow recognizes the insufficiency of our current strategies to protect our data from the ultra-sophisticated criminal gangs that are responsible for 80 percent of all cyber attacks. His solution? When a cyber attack occurs, we should respond to it with the same collective effort and openness as a health care crisis — we need to know who is infected and how the disease is spreading. Last year, Barlow and his team started publishing all of IBM’s threat data in an effort to encourage the same sharing from other major corporations, governments and private security firms. If we’re not sharing, he says, then we’re part of the problem. According to Adam Grant, there are three basic kinds of employees: givers, takers, and matchers (who’ll match the prevailing behavior of the group). The key to a happy workplace is to balance that mix. Grant speaks at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED) \nOne bad apple spoils the bunch. The success of any company is defined by the quality of people who work there. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant has spent a lot of time analyzing business structures, and he’s concluded that there are three different types of employees: givers, takers and matchers. To achieve a balanced workplace with equal opportunity for and distribution of work, power and play, companies must endeavor to hire givers and matchers, whose personalities allow employees to feel supported, heard and acknowledged. The challenge is to stop takers from getting a seat at the table, because they so often undercut the spirit of collaboration workplaces need to thrive. \nThe business of rewriting stereotypes. After what felt like a lifetime spent simultaneously living out stereotypes and being imprisoned by them, Villy Wang wondered how she could break the cycle of racism and still make a living. She hit upon the idea of empowering young, diverse kids — those most misrepresented in the media — to become storytellers, training them in filmmaking so they can create new, authentic stories. After training, she helps place them into creative industries that influence media and entertainment, helping rewrite stereotypes at one of its sources. Wang has nested this entire program within a professional media production studio, a business that helps fund and ensure the future of the program. “Obviously, racism is deeply rooted in our history, politics, media and language,” she says, “but I believe if we can empower more diverse kids to take that narrative and change it, we will break hold of these ugly roots.” Performer Ise Lyfe, at right, breaks down the Bay Area’s gentrification battles in a spoken-word collaboration with cellist Michael Fecskes, performed at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED) \nWe are not mud, we are fertile ground. Spoken-word artist and activist Ise Lyfe sparks crucial dialogue on social justice through performance. With music accompaniment by master cellist Michael Fecskes , Lyfe unravels the impact of the displacement of minority communities in American cities, threaded from his personal experience in East Oakland. By using the image of a flag in the mud to convey the claiming of a muddy territory, Lyfe creates a symbol for gentrification but urges: “I reject the notion of your flag in our mud. Let us be the spark to convey. We are not mud, we’re fertile ground waiting on the rain.” \nAI and justice for all. You need a good lawyer if you’re involved in a legal case. But a typical case can cost thousands of dollars in legal fees — and a lot of that money goes toward the time it takes to learn the case and study the law around it, sifting through hundreds of documents and databases to find a winning angle. Lawyer and entrepreneur Andrew Arruda set out to democratize this process by partnering with a computer scientist to create the world’s first artificially intelligent lawyer, ROSS. Using ROSS, a lawyer can search through millions of documents in a matter of minutes, saving hours of research time. ROSS is already being rolled out, for free, to pro-bono lawyers who are helping those most in need. “Justice should cost the same for everyone,” Arruda says. “More money should not buy better justice.” \nIntelligence, knowledge and wisdom … in the age of smart machines. Artificial intelligence is a next step in the evolution of our species; some say, in fact, we have come to the limits of our own intelligence. But intelligence is only part of the story — it’s what we do with that intelligence that matters. In a special video created for TED@IBM , Guruduth Banavar, chief science officer of cognitive computing at IBM, asks us to cultivate the wisdom necessary to improve our future. \nAn organic approach to an organic problem. Beset by plunging biodiversity, pathogens and skyrocketing populations, our global food supply is at risk — but solutions that rely on chemicals and genetically modified organisms come with their own problems. Computational geneticist Laxmi Parida proposes instead that we use the genetic biodiversity that already exists within plants, wrought over millennia by evolution, in order to safeguard our food. To sort through and make sense of the vast amount of sequenced DNA, artificial intelligence and machine learning don’t quite make the cut. Parida has another technique in mind: discrete mathematics. Using math, Parida is cracking open our understanding of the links between DNA and external traits, like stress resistance, so we can breed more robust crops while reducing strain on the environment. \nBuilding with dust. The world-changing promise of nanotechnology remains just that — a promise. We don’t yet have the disease-fighting nanobots, elevators to space or quantum computers that nanotech could someday provide. Why? Because building things from nanomaterials is incredibly difficult, says George Tulevski , a nano architect and researcher at IBM. We don’t have tools small enough to manipulate nanomaterials into something useful. But Tulevski and his team think they’ve located the missing link: chemistry. They’re developing chemical processes to compel billions of nanoparticles to simultaneously assemble themselves into the patterns needed to build circuits, much the same way that natural organisms like Radiolaria build intricate, diverse and elegant structures. It’s like building a sculpture from dust, Tulevski says, and it may be the key to delivering on — or far exceeding — those original promises of nanotechnology. World music group Wobbly World led off Session 2 of TED@IBM: Spark with a musical celebration of collaboration that included singing, rapping, guitar, congas and much more. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED) \nSession 2 kicked off with Wobbly World , a global collective of musicians whose dynamic blend of sounds from around the world reminds us of the incredible power of music at bridging the cultural divide. \nOne of the most important tools in the fight against cancer? Time. An early cancer diagnosis can be the difference between a chance to fight for life, or death. But diagnostic tools tend to be costly, invasive and slow to reveal results, and they’re not always totally accurate. Cancer fighter Joshua Smith presents an affordable, formidable weapon in the fight against cancer that combats these statistics — a noninvasive early-warning system that works like a pregnancy test by intercepting and analyzing the biomarkers that may hint at the presence of cancer. With this streamlined process, says Smith, early-stage cancer detection can happen more frequently and start when a person is still healthy. It’s a strong beacon of hope in the fight against cancer. We can’t afford to give up on government, says Charity Wayua. She speaks at TED@IBM:Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED) \nHow to cure ailing governments. In the current political climate, it’s easy to want to give up on transforming government, says cancer researcher Charity Wayua — but we can’t afford to be afraid to tackle challenges like government efficiency head-on. Starting in 2014, Wayua, a trained biochemist, and a team of scientists, engineers and technologists began to “treat” the government of Nairobi, Kenya, as an ailing patient in order to restore the health of the country and its economy. In keeping with a biomedical approach, the team examined the government, its divisions, its employees and every single one of its malfunctions before making a diagnosis and devising a strategic treatment plan. Within two years, the efforts of Wayua and her team paid off, and Kenya moved from 136 to 92 on the World Bank’s index ranking the ease of doing business there. As Wayua says, just because something is sick doesn’t mean it’s dying. \nBehavior hacks for the well-intentioned. “Why is it that we have such a difficult time doing what’s right?” asks behavioral scientist Bob Nease . “It’s because intention and action don’t often go hand-in-hand.” That is, good intentions don’t always lead to good behavior, while bad behavior is not always the result of bad intentions. So how do we bridge the gap between good intention and positive action? Nease offers two simple mind-hack solutions: first, make the right thing so easy to do that it requires minimal mind power to arrive at a good decision. Then make the wrong thing so drawn out and convoluted that it’s nearly impossible to justify doing. Nease applies these principles to current issues surrounding health, business and even government reform. \nThe drumming habits of neurons. In March 1993, an article published in the journal Cell identified the single gene responsible for Huntingon’s disease. The product of a nearly ten-year effort by scientists from around the world, the article held great promise that a cure for the neurodegenerative disorder would soon follow; yet today, there is still not a single medicine able to slow, stop, or reverse this disease. James Kozloski has watched a generation of neuroscientists struggle with this, and his conclusion is that neuroscientists have focused far too long on just the neuron. He argues that the answer lies not only in showing how neurons suffer from genetic disorders but also in how genes suffer from nervous disorders. Comparing the communication of neurons to the beat of a drummer, Kozloski highlights that in brains, things like a bad gene, an injury or aging can lead to changes in circuits that first create and then reinforce subtle bad drumming habits, which are often difficult to detect until it’s too late. His team has been working to detect these habits early in order to break them, mapping the brain’s core components and connecting them together in what he calls the Grand Loop. “Before we can fully understand how genes cause imbalance in neurons leading to their death,” he says, “neuroscience must understand how the brain’s core circuitry balances itself, how genes change synapses, and how brain feedback onto neurons, synapses and genes can push imbalance to the tipping point.” \nHow the internet of things is transforming the routine. How do we protect our aging population while letting them keep the comfort of their lives and their daily routine? Everyday objects with sensors and WiFi can track each step of that routine and form a picture of a life being lived, in real time, to the children and support systems caring for the safety and independence of their loved ones. Learn more about how the internet of things is changing the routine in another special video produced for TED@IBM . \nA library of human cognition. What if you could consult Winston Churchill on a looming international crisis? Or ask Einstein what he thinks about the latest scientific breakthrough? National security expert Juliane Gallina is working on a way to harness the best minds of all time to make the world safer. When Gallina was in the military, she learned a special concept: the OODA loop, a mental model (which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) designed to help intelligence officers get into the minds of their adversaries. You’re in the OODA loop right now, Gallina says, and every person or team that makes decisions is constantly using it. Today, Gallina is a technologist, and she’s using the OODA loop in her work on cognitive computing. Her goal: to create a way to systematically record the way we think when solving problems so that future generations can better tap into the wisdom of the past. “Let’s find and record the exquisite thinking strategies of innovators and pioneers,” Gallina says, “and then let’s use it.” \nThe untold story behind a landmark NASA mission. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson — you’ve probably never heard their names, but these three African-American women were instrumental in putting astronaut John Glenn into orbit around Earth. Their story has been largely untold until now with the upcoming release of biographical film Hidden Figures . Elizabeth Gabler, president of Fox 2000 Pictures, talks with TED@IBM curator Bryn Freedman about what drew her to make film and shares with the audience more about the women from the upcoming film and the barriers they overcame. \nNo expertise required. The problem with music, says Tim Exile , is that it’s so perfect. For those of us who didn’t grow up playing an instrument, instruments can never be objects of play because we’re often too afraid to mess around and try things out due to a strict idea of what an instrument should sound like. In a talk-performance hybrid, Exile demos a software instrument that he designed to allow anyone, whether they have musical training or not, to record loops, mix sounds and make music. “Apart from anything else,” he says, “this is is a hell of a lot of fun, and we’re all missing out!” Grady Booch asks us to worry a bit less about artificial intelligence, while speaking at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED) \nThe illusion of intelligence. When we think about artificial intelligence and its possibilities, it becomes difficult to disassociate the concept with the dangers outlined by films like The Terminator and 2001: A Space Odyssey . For supporters like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, such fears are far from misplaced; they and others argue that artificial intelligence represents an existential threat to humanity. But according to Grady Booch , super-knowing is not the same as super-doing. Cognitive systems, he argues, are far different from the software-intensive systems of earlier generations, in that, “by and large, we don’t program them: we teach them,” imparting onto those machines reflections of our already-present human values. Rather than worry about any existential threat of superintelligence, Booch cautions us to focus instead on the realities that we currently face, “for the rise of computing already brings to us a myriad of other human and societal issues to which we must attend.” Indeed, from raising the level of education around the world to helping humans eventually reach the surface of Mars, “the right question we should now be asking is how shall we best use this technology to augment our humanity, not diminish it.” ",

      "text": "Mahindra And IBM To Develop Blockchain Solution For Supply Chain Finance Cloud-based blockchain app to speed invoice discounting PR Newswire Nov30,20162:00AMEST MUMBAI , India and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mahindra Group, one of the largest diversified multinational group of companies based in India , and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced the development of a blockchain solution that has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes. This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions through a permissioned distributed ledger. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only their part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information. Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. Supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes have historically been said to be difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers. Human errors during this process have been known to create inconsistent records, ultimately resulting in delayed payments and capital that cannot be accessed. \"The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth. We are actively looking at other applications across the Group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech ,\" said Anish Shah , Group President (Strategy), Mahindra Group. \" This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance's small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time.\" Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future. Prev 0 of 2 Next  ",

      "text": "Training Companies to Handle a Hack IBM’s cyber range borrows tactics from military simulations. Michael Riley November 23, 2016 — 9:00 AM EST November 23, 2016 — 3:09 PM EST From Subscribe Reprints \nDespite billions of dollars invested in antihacking technology over the past 10 years, companies appear to have little idea of how to respond to a cyber attack. When Target was hacked during the busy 2013 Christmas season, investigators found the company had missed early warnings that might have prevented the loss of data belonging to 70 million customers. When the news came out, lawsuits were filed, and Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel resigned. Sony Pictures Entertainment’s fumbling response a year later to North Korean hackers turned a bad situation into a terrible one, costing Amy Pascal, one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, her job as co-chairman. \nIBM, which has spent five years buying companies to make itself the world's third-largest cybersecurity provider, wants to train corporate security teams, CEOs, and PR departments to handle those kinds of crises. Shortly after Election Day, the company unveiled a facility that combines gaming techniques and millions of dollars of sophisticated hardware to re-create scenarios like Target’s and Sony’s in white-knuckle, stock-plunging detail. \nThe idea is borrowed from the Pentagon, which uses a similar approach to train soldiers for cyberwar. Instead of the pressure of combat, the facility at IBM’s security division headquarters on the Charles River in Cambridge, Mass., wants to re-create a postbreach pressure cooker that can move rapidly from a regulatory investigation to a call from the FBI to whatever else the range’s multimedia producers can conjure. “We don’t want to scare the crap out of people,” says Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security. “We do want people to feel a little of the adrenaline burst and the pressure.” \nBy the time IBM’s cyber range is fully operational in January, it will offer 12 training programs. Think of them as plays, Barlow says, with settings, acts, and an unusually wide range of actors, including general counsels, marketing teams, and C-suite executives. \nThe staging area is a bit like a flight simulator built for two dozen. Theater-quality video panels cover the front wall, and the ceiling is studded with the same sensors that allowed Tom Cruise to manipulate data with his hands in the movie Minority Report . (The ceiling array, made by Oblong Industries in Los Angeles, is the most expensive thing in the room.) Racks of servers located a floor below simulate the data stream of a full-size corporate network. \nDuring a recent afternoon demo, the training program began with a phishing e-mail sent to a fictitious HR rep. The hackers made off with a cache of data before the IT crew could isolate the source of the breach. Then an insider leaked news of the breach, and the pressure mounted. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation. More pressure. \nAs the afternoon wore on, events spun out of control. The security team discovered that the hackers hadn’t just stolen information, they’d also altered the company’s financial data shortly before its quarterly earnings report. Uh-oh. \n$200 million: IBM spending on its cyber range and teams for intel and incident response \nAll this realism doesn’t come without risks. The range is designed to test out some of the most virulent malware, so the whole thing is air-gapped, which means it’s not connected to the real internet. Instead, developers collected data from thousands of web pages to create a miniature, self-contained internet. \nLike many of the range’s features, that idea came from Joe Provost, the project’s threat modeling and simulation architect and a former master hacker for the National Security Agency. Two days after hackers took some of the world’s most popular websites offline in October with a botnet of infected home routers, TVs, and other internet-connected devices, Provost figured out how to replicate the attack so he could add it to one of the range’s scenarios. In the simulations, he also plays the main bad guy. \nThe facility is expensive, and IBM wouldn’t say exactly how much it costs to run. Barlow says the company had spent a combined $200 million on the range and the development of cyber intelligence and incident response teams for on-site investigations of major hacks. He may be reticent to break out spending on the facility, because there’s no guarantee the investment will pay off. IBM says it’s not planning to charge people who come in for the training sessions; it’s more of a marketing tool, an effort to convince companies there’s enough value in IBM’s various cybersecurity technologies to make them worth buying. “This is in some ways a grand experiment,” Barlow says.

By: FE Online | New Delhi   12:41 PM In an email with the letter while sharing it with her employees, the IBM CEO mentioned that the company supports tolerance and diversity. (Reuters) \nFollowing IBM CEO Ginni Rometty’s letter to the US President elect Donald Trump, one of her employee, Elizabeth Wood, a senior content strategist at the company, resigned, publishing online a letter of her own to the CEO, explaining the reason for her resignation. \nThe IBM employee published “An Open Letter to My Boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty”, where, explaining the reason behind her decision, she said, “Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his (Donald Trump) agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen.” \nThe IBM CEO, in her letter, lauded the new President elect, saying that she is certain on the fact that Trump is committed towards the economic growth of America and had also offered ways to work together ‘to achieve prosperity’. \nElizabeth Wood, in her letter, expressed discontent as the CEO’s letter to the US President-elect didn’t mention issues like undocumented immigration and Trump’s proposal on the ban on Muslim migrants in the United States. “When the president-elect follows through on his repeated threats to create a public database of Muslims, what will IBM do? Your letter neglects to mention,” she wrote. \nHowever, in an email with the letter while sharing it with her employees, the IBM CEO mentioned that the company supports tolerance and diversity. Following the US presidential elections and the divisive poll campaigns by the presidential nominee, global business leaders’ comments had been under critical observation by customers and employees.

      "text": " 00 AM EST Mahindra and IBM to Develop Blockchain Solution for Supply Chain Finance \nMUMBAI , India and ARMONK, N.Y.   Mahindra Group, one of the largest diversified multinational group of companies based in India , and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced the development of a blockchain solution that has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes. \nThis cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions through a permissioned distributed ledger. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only their part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information. \nInvoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. Supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes have historically been said to be difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers. Human errors during this process have been known to create inconsistent records, ultimately resulting in delayed payments and capital that cannot be accessed. \n\"The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth. We are actively looking at other applications across the Group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech ,\" said Anish Shah , Group President (Strategy), Mahindra Group. \" This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance's small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time.\" \nBlockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future. \n\"Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, and IBM is at the forefront of the revolution. We offer a comprehensive enterprise-class blockchain solution that is secure, scalable and reliable. The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, and we're confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,\" said Lula Mohanty , Managing Partner of IBM Global Business Services, IBM ISA. \nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make Blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger Fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix cloud, developers can easily and quickly develop applications while testing security, availability and performance of a permissioned blockchain network. IBM is committed to advancing the science of blockchain, helping to remove complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, trade finance and logistics, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks. \nAbout Mahindra \nThe Mahindra Group focuses on enabling people to rise through solutions that power mobility, drive rural prosperity, enhance urban lifestyles and increase business efficiency. \nA USD 17.8 billion multinational group based in Mumbai, India , Mahindra provides employment opportunities to over 200,000 people in over 100 countries.

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 3 OF 14 Why IBM’s Focus on Hybrid Cloud Is Opportune By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST Hybrid cloud saw rapid adoption in 2016 \nEarlier in this series, we discussed how IBM’s ( IBM ) latest acquisition of Sanovi Technologies would complement its dominance in the hybrid cloud space as well as its DRaaS (disaster recovery as a service) offerings. \nHybrid cloud technology provides its users with the opportunity to place their workloads into environments according to suitability. By combining public and private cloud services, users can maximize the benefits of cloud migration. \nThough the private cloud lags behind the public cloud in terms of adoption, it’s not far behind. In 2015, the hybrid and private cloud spaces registered 45% growth, compared to the 51% growth in the public cloud space. \nThis growth was evident in RightScale’s 2016 report, which stated that private cloud adoption had risen from 63% in 2015 to 77% in 2016. As more and more companies add private cloud technology, the likelihood of hybrid cloud adoption should continue to improve. The rise in private cloud adoption caused hybrid cloud adoption to rise 58% in 2015 to 71% in 2016 on a YoY (year-over-year) basis. Scalability and flexibility are driving hybrid cloud adoption \nAccording to Lifehacker, a recently conducted survey done by Microsoft ( MSFT ) that involved 1,200 information technology leaders across the Asia-Pacific ( VPL ) region, including Australia ( EWA ), showed that 40% of Australian organizations were either already using or readying themselves to use hybrid cloud solutions. This number is estimated to rise to 49% within next one to one-and-a-half years. \nIt’s the scalability and flexibility offered by the hybrid cloud that enables an enterprise to develop an automated, secure, and integrated computing environment in a cost-effective manner. \nHybrid cloud offers a combination of features of two or more cloud models—private, community, and public. The hybrid cloud provides the control and security of a private cloud along with the versatility, user friendliness, and cost-effectiveness of a public cloud. It’s preferred by organizations because even when using cloud services, they still have control over their data. Thus, hybrid cloud technology offers more control, cost structure efficiency, reduced risk, and better performance. These factors are likely a significant factor in the hybrid cloud’s increased adoption. \nIBM is a leader in the private cloud and the hybrid cloud space, and it’s expected to benefit from the increased adoption of hybrid cloud technology. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"MSFT\",\"VPL\",\"IBM\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Vanguard MSCI Pacific ETF\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\"]} X",

Sanovi Technologies provides business continuity, cloud migration, and hybrid cloud software solutions. \nAs is usually the case with IBM’s buyouts, financial details of the acquisition weren’t disclosed. \nSanovi has its headquarters in Bangalore, India ( EPI ). Chandra Sekhar Pulamarasetti, cofounder and CEO of Sanovi, said about Sanovi’s acquisition, “IBM’s technology leadership in hybrid cloud infrastructure and resiliency services makes it a clear choice to bring end-to-end services to our customers and transformational value to IBM’s existing client base.” \nSanovi’s offerings will be integrated into IBM’s resiliency portfolio and its Global Technology Services (or GTS) segment. IBM’s dominance in the hybrid cloud space will get a boost with Sanovi Technologies \nIBM, a leader in the hybrid cloud space , entered into a strategic partnership with VMware ( VMW ) to further boost its position in the hybrid cloud space. Apart from strengthening IBM’s position in the hybrid cloud space, IBM said that Sanovi Technologies would enhance its “position in cloud migration and business continuity software for enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructure.” \nRecently, VMware entered into a partnership with Amazon ( AMZN ), which is symbiotic to both companies, as VMware will get a much-needed push from Amazon’s undisputed dominance in the overall cloud space, and Amazon will gain a foothold in the hybrid cloud space. \nIn late June 2016, IBM was ranked a market leader in cloud application development and transformation by TBR (Technology Business Research), an independent technology market research company. TBR also ranked IBM a market leader in public cloud IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) adoption. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"VMW\",\"AMZN\",\"EPI\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"VMware, Inc.\",\"Amazon.com, Inc.\",\"WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (ETF)\"]} X",

      "text": "Related resources \nMumbai and Armonk, NY - 30 Nov 2016: The Mahindra Group, one of the largest diversified multinational group of companies based in India, and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced the development of a blockchain solution that has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes. This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, i s designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions through a permissioned distributed ledger. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only their part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information. \nInvoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. Supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes have historically been said to be difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers. Human errors during this process have been known to create inconsistent records, ultimately resulting in delayed payments and capital that cannot be accessed. \n“The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth. We are actively looking at other applications across the Group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech ,” said Anish Shah, Group President (Strategy), Mahindra Group. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain , still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business . Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time. ” \nBlockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future. \n“Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, and IBM is at the forefront of the revolution. We offer a comprehensive enterprise-class blockchain solution that is secure, scalable and reliable. The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,” said Lula Mohanty, Managing Partner of IBM Global Business Services, IBM ISA. \nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make Blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger Fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix cloud, developers can easily and quickly develop applications while testing security, availability and performance of a permissioned blockchain network. IBM is committed to advancing the science of blockchain, helping to remove complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, trade finance and logistics, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks. \nAbout Mahindra \nThe Mahindra Group focuses on enabling people to rise through solutions that power mobility, drive rural prosperity, enhance urban lifestyles and increase business efficiency. \nA USD 17.8 billion multinational group based in Mumbai, India, Mahindra provides employment opportunities to over 200,000 people in over 100 countries.

      "text": " IBM\nCloud-based blockchain app to speed invoice discounting\nMUMBAI , India and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mahindra Group, one of the largest diversified multinational group of companies based in India , and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced the development of a blockchain solution that has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.\nThis cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions through a permissioned distributed ledger. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only their part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.\nInvoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. Supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes have historically been said to be difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers. Human errors during this process have been known to create inconsistent records, ultimately resulting in delayed payments and capital that cannot be accessed.\n\"The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth. We are actively looking at other applications across the Group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech ,\" said Anish Shah , Group President (Strategy), Mahindra Group. \" This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance's small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time.\"\nBlockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.\n\"Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, and IBM is at the forefront of the revolution. We offer a comprehensive enterprise-class blockchain solution that is secure, scalable and reliable. The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, and we're confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,\" said Lula Mohanty , Managing Partner of IBM Global Business Services, IBM ISA.\nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make Blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger Fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix cloud, developers can easily and quickly develop applications while testing security, availability and performance of a permissioned blockchain network. IBM is committed to advancing the science of blockchain, helping to remove complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, trade finance and logistics, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks.\nAbout Mahindra\nThe Mahindra Group focuses on enabling people to rise through solutions that power mobility, drive rural prosperity, enhance urban lifestyles and increase business efficiency.\nA USD 17.8 billion multinational group based in Mumbai, India , Mahindra provides employment opportunities to over 200,000 people in over 100 countries.

      "text": "Mahindra and IBM to Develop Blockchain Solution for Supply Chain Finance [November 30, 2016] Tweet \nMUMBAI , India and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mahindra Group, one of the largest diversified multinational group of companies based in India , and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced the development of a blockchain solution that has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes. \nThis cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions through a permissioned distributed ledger. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only their part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information. \nInvoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. Supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes have historically been said to be difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers. Human errors during this process have been known to create inconsistent records, ultimately resulting in delayed payments and capital that cannot be accessed. \n\"The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth. We are actively looking at other applications across the Group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech ,\" said Anish Shah , Group President (Strategy), Mahindra Group. \" This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more ompelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance's small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time.\" \nBlockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future. \n\"Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, and IBM is at the forefront of the revolution. We offer a comprehensive enterprise-class blockchain solution that is secure, scalable and reliable. The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, and we're confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,\" said Lula Mohanty , Managing Partner of IBM Global Business Services, IBM ISA. \nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make Blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger Fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix cloud, developers can easily and quickly develop applications while testing security, availability and performance of a permissioned blockchain network. IBM is committed to advancing the science of blockchain, helping to remove complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, trade finance and logistics, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks. \nAbout Mahindra \nThe Mahindra Group focuses on enabling people to rise through solutions that power mobility, drive rural prosperity, enhance urban lifestyles and increase business efficiency. \nA USD 17.8 billion multinational group based in Mumbai, India , Mahindra provides employment opportunities to over 200,000 people in over 100 countries.

      "text": "American Airlines has selected IBM Cloud to be a service provider as it moves its internal applications to the public cloud.\nAdvertisement They said that it was looking to move some of its customer web site and back office applications to the public cloud. American Airlines was evaluating Amazon Web Services, IBM, and Microsoft.\nIBM said that American will use its infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service tools.\nPatrick Grubbs, Vice president of travel and transportation at IBM said that they will be partnering with American Airlines and will be kicking off at the enterprise level, some will be customer facing system and others will be at the back office.\nAmerican Airlines had told an interview about its cloud bake off in September and noted that a deal will be announced soon.\nFor IBM, the American Airlines win comes amid AWS' re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. Grubbs added that part of the IBM deal with American revolves around agile development. American may include other cloud providers, but Grubbs noted that the airline wasn't looking to break its infrastructure into chunks.\nAccording to the American Airlines, the cloud move is part of a much broader systems integration effort following the mergers in United States Airways.\nOn its annual report, American Airlines noted this:\nWhile we have to date successfully integrated several of our systems, including our customer reservations system and our pilot and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration projects. The integration of these systems in a number of prior airline mergers has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecast.\nThe implementation process to integrate these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.\nAmerican Airline is the world's largest airline when measured by fleet size, revenue and scheduled passengers-kilometer flown and the second largest by number of destination served.\nAdvertisement\n IBM and American Airlines Together Get The Best Deals For Cyber Monday Tom Herman had moved to Texas How Walmart Performs During The 'Cyber Monday' 2016 Deal The Wirecutter Offers $100 Off Deal For New MacBook Pro Advertisement",

      "text": "5 Things You Should Unlearn About Marketing Learn from top marketers at IBM, Hawaiian Airlines and Brooks Brothers. Founder and CEO, Epic PR Group @ EpicBVA WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nThe belief that entrepreneurs can't market like the big guys is a marketing myth in itself. While you may not have the budget of IBM or Brooks Brothers you can easily apply all the advice shared here to your own marketing strategies. \nSo get rid of the rules and conventional thinking and discover new ways to tell your story. Read on for some myth-busting advice that will help you grow your business and influence your industry. \nHere are five myths about marketing that you should cast aside: 1. Social Media Is Easy \nThere's a lot more to social media than repurposing the same generic content on multiple sites. \nGeorge Faulkner, social marketing and communication lead at IBM, thinks social media is hard to do well. \"It often feels like brands are frantically waving their arms for attention,\" he observes. \"This is understandable, but they should also be introducing themselves, shaking hands and engaging in meaningful interactions.\" \nFor example, IBM launched a 360 video series that features employees commuting to work from across the company's global community. In one of the first films, IBM developer Gabriel Rosa is followed on his skateboard as he crosses the Williamsburg Bridge into NYC. \nToo often brands are just creating noise. When Faulkner goes to a brand's page, he's looking to make a connection. \n\"If I show up and ask your brand a question--and I don't hear back from you pretty quickly--I am likely not coming back,\" he said. 2. Cause Marketing Isn't Effective \nPatagonia recently announced it would give 100 percent of retail and online Black Friday sales directly to nonprofits working to protect the environment. \nAs a result, the company reached a record-breaking $10 million in sales , according to Scott Carrington, Patagonia's manager of digital and social media marketing. To put that in perspective, this was five times more than the company's previous Black Friday sales. \nThere was a lot of positive momentum and a top-down approach that enabled the internal creative team the freedom to move quickly and effectively without a lot of push back. Carrington explained, \"There was no time to water down the message or waffle on the approach--we just got it done and the results have been amazing.\" 3. It's All About Your Company \nMichael Fitzsimmons, WeWork's vice president of marketing, uses customer stories to make his brand come to life. \nWeWork designs versatile open office spaces, with customization as a major selling point. The company's motto is \"To create a world where people work to make a life, not just a living.\" Those words inform the company's marketing style. \nRather than tout their design skills, WeWork shines the spotlight on the pride their customers take in the end result. For example, the company has a dedicated magazine called Creator that highlights member success stories. This community-building approach helped WeWork build to 100 locations. 4. You Get to Decide What Your Brand Stands For \nJohn Erickson, vice president of brand content, social media and communications at Brooks Brother's says, \"You don't get to decide what your brand is anymore--the consumer decides for you.\" \nThe 198-year-old company has not rested on its laurels and is consistently pushing for new and innovative ways to connect with its customers. Recently, they created a the Red Fleece Cafe in New York City where customers can buy coffee, get a fitting and experience the iconic brand in full effect. \n\"We have definitely found that people are looking for brand experiences and that's what we gave them with the cafe. And, the idea was born from social media interactions and data. We are actively looking at what our fans are responding too and that cafe lifestyle really resonated,\" said Erickson. 5. Brand Experiences Can't Last \n\"No matter what you are selling, you want to try to bring your product to life through a variety of sensory-based techniques,\" says Asiana Ponciano, social media marketing specialist at Hawaiian Airlines. \nThe airline aims to create a brand experience that delivers the sights, sounds, tastes, and flavors of Hawaii to passengers as soon as they board the plane. From the in-flight entertainment featuring a famous ukulele player to authentic meals made by local chefs served on the flights, the airline's experience makes it one of the top-ranked airlines in 2016 for service and staff, according to Skytrax World Airline Awards. \nWhile the airline has a visually stunning product to work with--they are careful to keep the Hawaiian culture as pure as possible. For social media, they show beautiful scenic photos, food and island guides. \n\"We purposefully connect to the destination by showing the faces of people of Hawaii and Hawaiian Airlines. We use the local way of speaking to keep the brand experience authentic and memorable,\" said Ponciano. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

This collaboration enables a user focused, high quality, yet cost effective way of developing digital solutions, helping us to improve the way we operate as an airline.\"\nFirst applications from the collaboration will be deployed in Finnair Technical Operations in aircraft line maintenance in the beginning of 2017.\n\"We see a wealth of opportunities for improving productivity as well as adding value to the work flow of our employees, by improving real-time visibility and transparency across the entire maintenance process,\" says Jari Huhtinen, Head of Finnair Technical Operations. \"Our mechanics team participated in the application creation work with Apple and IBM to ensure the best possible design, user experience and fit into our organizational processes.\"\nFinnair is the first organization to take advantage of IBM's new app design and development model for clients that plan to adopt multiple iOS apps, called Mobile at Scale for iOS. This integrated approach, unique to IBM MobileFirst for iOS , increases the speed, efficiency and quality of how iOS apps are designed, developed, deployed, enhanced and maintained over their lifecycle.\nThe airline has a team in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS Garage dedicated to rapidly executing Finnair projects. The MobileFirst for iOS Garage operates as a global hub for the development of iOS, enabling Finnair to tap into the world's largest concentration of Swift developers, design, integration and iOS device expertise along with consulting services. The Garage team can deliver initial apps in weeks that are tailored to meet Finnair's enterprise needs and the user requirements of its employees This integrated approach brings consistency to the project, saving 25 percent of development effort, cost and time.\nThe apps will be managed and hosted on IBM Cloud allowing Finnair to implement multiple apps at speed and at scale, transforming everyday tasks for employees across the organization. The apps combine simplicity with the power of analytics to generate insight for more informed decision-making and better management.\n\"Finnair is innovating and setting an example -- not just for its industry, but for all enterprises. Rather than using mobile in silos, the airline is looking to IBM's industry expertise and solutions to digitize the entire airline,\" said Raimon Christiani , global industry leader IBM Travel & Transportation. \"Finnair has access to IBM's full portfolio of MobileFirst for iOS apps and if there's something else it needs to empower employees and provide Finnair passengers a more seamless travel experience, we can build it.\"\nThe first apps to be rolled out within the agreement are:\nInspect & Turn provides aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation with analytics-driven recommendations to complete work assignments to ensure the safe upkeep of aircraft and achievement of on-time arrival and departure targets. Assign Tech provides aircraft mechanic supervisors a clear overview of ?ight schedules, maintenance process and mechanic availability. Using advanced analytics, the app recommends optimal shift assignments and incorporates the skills and certi?cations of each mechanic. Push noti?cations also alert supervisors to ?ight delays process issues, so they can easily make changes on the ?y.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIn this episode, Jason Velez explains how he is using IBM’s Watson to empower 1Law , the small firm and affiliation of US lawyers he founded.

Each week, Lawyerist brings you advice and interviews to help you build a more successful law practice in today’s challenging and constantly changing legal market. Now, here are Sam and Aaron.\nTranscript\nSam Glover: Well, thanks for joining us Jason. And I guess bears mentioning, you and Tyler, your co-founder? Partner?\nJason Velez: Partner and founder, co-founder.\nSam Glover: All right. Were both at TBD Law where you were really interesting to get to know, and so that’s why I want to put you on our podcast today to talk about your firm which starts out having the interesting name of 1LAW. Why don’t you give me the background, like how did you come to start 1LAW? Then we’ll talk about what it’s all about.\nJason Velez: Yeah, so well, thank you Sam and Lawyerist for having me. I guess the background, it was basically, as I mentioned, practicing for about 16 years, about the middle of my practice, about six, seven years into practice, I went to work for a large TV firm, a PI Mill, maybe some people may call it. I was working there for about three years when I hit, whether it’s the dry-wall ceiling, the acoustic ceiling, but bottom line, there was a disagreement over what I thought I was worth and what they thought I was worth, and so they showed me the door. I found myself having closed a solo practice that was providing for me and my family to make the jump for this opportunity with the personal injury firm.\nBasically, next day, I had no clients, I had closed my practice, so-to-speak. I still had my corporate entity alive, and so basically what I did was I dusted off that solo practice, and I got an opportunity to essentially start over again, but with the, let’s say at that point, nine years of understanding of practicing. I basically took the business number I had, which we’ll segue here in a minute, but the business number I had was 634-1529, and 1529 equals 1LAW. I had reestablished that business line and went out to get some business cards, and a senior attorney saw my business card and basically said, “I like that, 1LAW.” Basically I went from A. Jason Velez, PC to A. Jason Velez, PC, DBA, 1LAW. The 1LAW, a little bit, it’s a brand …\nSam Glover: Wait, hold on. What’s the A?\nJason Velez: The A, Antonio.\nSam Glover: Okay.\nJason Velez: Or as my wife says, her Latin lover.\nSam Glover: Got you.\nJason Velez: A. Jason Velez, PC, DBA, 1LAW, and that actually is the structure of our current law firm is [Labram 00:08:57], Todd, Park, Velez, DBA, 1LAW. 1LAW you can consider an umbrella brand, and so it’s a little bit unusual or non-traditional, but it’s a bit of an ice breaker. You can say you’ve worked for Smith and Velez, but you say 1LAW, people, “Oh, what was that? What’s 1LAW?” Now you’ve broken the ice. It’s a little more memorable. Bottom line, from activating that phone number, 1529, to the input to a senior attorney, and I guess the real curve ball was the fact that in 2010 we were still economically a little soft in the states, and so a kind gentleman out of Singapore sold me the domain for what he felt was an unreasonably low price, but due to economic conditions in the US he would accept it. Bottom line, I grabbed the domain, and here we are getting close to 2017. I guess we just celebrated our sixth anniversary of 1LAW.\nSam Glover: Very cool. It’s a law firm, but I see on your website you also talk about having a network of 150 attorneys. Tell me, what’s the relationship between the nine people I see on your attorney page, and the 150 attorneys in the network.\nJason Velez: The relationship is, if you can imagine a window sticker, and the window sticker would say 1LAW, and you could have the window sticker be a 3×5-inch type of sticker that’s there next to your, “We accept Visa, MasterCard”, or if you come to our office, you’ll see a four foot by three foot 1LAW over the receptionist. It’s an affiliation, if you would, of hopefully like-minded attorneys. My big premise, I got into the law to help people, and I sincerely believe most lawyers, probably I would say, I’d to even say all lawyers, had that idea.\nEverybody wants to make a living, but we thought we’d be able to help people. Some people feel maybe more on the change-the-world scale than others, but the idea is like-minded attorneys that were looking for a little bit of a different identity. You get to keep your Jason Velez, PC, but at the same time you can use the icebreaker of the 1LAW. You can have that letterhead or that window sticker as large or small as you like. The network of attorneys are geographically-based attorneys that are essentially following the symbol or philosophy, if you would.\nThe idea is you’ve got to be, obviously, an attorney in good standing. We like to have some referrals from practitioners in your marketplace, so we know that people like to do business with you. Beyond that, it’s as with everything, the client is the boss and can ultimately choose who they hire, but the idea is that there are attorneys in other practice areas for cross-referrals for areas of expertise that we may not have. The longer you practice law …\nSam Glover: Am I right to describe it as a branded referral network?\nJason Velez: I like to call it … Affiliation is what I like to call it because it does not require that you refer. There’s not an obligation to refer, but the idea is that there’s an opportunity to refer, and then there’s an opportunity to distinguish yourself in the marketplace. I guess, I would just say it’s a branded affiliation network. I don’t know, you can help me. It’s not …\nSam Glover: What I’m curious about too, if somebody joins the network, I assume there’s a process for coming on board, then are you paying referral fees back and forth? Besides affiliating themselves with the brand, what else do they get out of it?\nJason Velez: They get the ability to refer. I’m not interested in governing how attorneys run their practice, even between attorneys in the network, as you would say. Any referral fees are going to be based between the parties. It’s not something that I govern. What I’m trying to do is … I guess what I’m doing is marketing the brand. I call it the big-game marketing approach, whether that’s the Super Bowl or another big game. The idea is that for the big game a national ad, we’ll just use round numbers, cost a million dollars. A local ad costs $50,000. If you have enough local people, you can now buy a national ad. Instead of having a local ad with the local production quality and whatnot, you contribute less, 25,000, to a national spend, and now you’ve marketed throughout the whole United States, and it’s basically national strength, local care.\nSam Glover: You make those decisions about marketing, or do you ask people to kick in money, or is there a membership fee?\nJason Velez: The marketing is a co-op type of situation. If you want to participate in the marketing, there is a fee to that. I make the marketing decisions. The membership is nominal on the entry level, but the marketing participation is where the spend would come, if that makes sense.\nSam Glover: Yeah.\nJason Velez: The membership is not … I’m not looking to make it on subscriptions. I’m trying to say, “Hey, if you want to grow in a particular area, here’s a campaign you can be involved in.”\nSam Glover: Then you’ll buy, if they contribute, you’ll buy marketing in their area.\nJason Velez: Correct. Correct. What we like to say is activate in their area.\nSam Glover: Got you. You mentioned when we were talking before the show about the value of referrals. I think I’m starting to see more what you mean about that, but tell me more.\nJason Velez: Sure. As TBD, and again, that was an awesome, for the listeners, you’ve got the Jason Velez endorsement …\nSam Glover: Thanks.\nJason Velez: … of going and participating and really getting a view of what the practice of law is outside of where you live. It was a great experience to meet with, I consider them, comrades. Solo practice is not easy, and I get it, and TBD gave a lot of hope for people looking to the next 20 years or 50 years of their practice, depending on how old they are. Maybe this is my giveaway, if you would, or my two bits, that I do feel that the legal market, especially solo and small firms don’t maybe appreciate, but personal injury referrals, you don’t have to be a personal injury expert to intake a personal injury case and either co-counsel, associate counsel, or in some states I believe you’re allowed a direct referral to a personal injury firm.\nI believe that a lot of solos, they’ll get a call on a personal injury, or even one of their clients, and they don’t always know where to send them. Like any other area of the legal market, it’s all negotiable, so I would suggest for, and this is part of the 1LAW philosophy, is to provide a personal injury lawyer, or for attorneys to get to know more than one personal injury lawyer. You want to know what relationships you can forge, what association fees they’re willing to share, how much do you want to be involved in the case? If you look around your market, and they’re rarely the firms that are advertising on TV. You generally would be a boutique personal injury firm that understands that, “Hey, we’re willing to pay,” in some cases, don’t use this is as a rule, but I would say up to 50% depending on your involvement and depending on the case.\nI believe that that is hopefully a way some of your listeners and some of these solos can leverage their relationships because that does exist. Unless there’s a state that has an absolute prohibition on any type of association or a referral, you should be able to refer the case to a competent personal injury practice, maintain an involvement, possibly even maintain the lead on the case until litigation. Be that point person with your client, and it’s a nice payday for people.\nSam Glover: Here’s always been my hesitation about is, in my state at least, in Minnesota, in order to get a referral fee you have to be co-counsel, basically. Lots of personal injury lawyers are willing to make you co-counsel in name, but you don’t actually do anything on the case. Potentially you run into questions there about the proportionality, the fairness of the size of your fee. More than that, I just didn’t really want to keep any responsibility for the case. I didn’t want the malpractice liability, exposure for actually staying on the case. I’m wondering, is that particular to my state, or is that are real thing, or am I just over-dramatizing the potential exposure from doing that referral arrangement?\nJason Velez: Well I would say no, that is not unique to your state, and no that is not an actual concern. What I would say to that is any personal injury lawyer worth their salt is also aware of that, and statue of limitations, that’s probably the number one zinger in personal injury. I would just say to any personal injury lawyer, “Do you track your statue of limitations? How often do you check them?” We check them once a year in our office, go through every file, and they have to be hand touched to identify the police report or the originating document on a case to say when the appropriate statute date is.\nThe exposure issues, one on malpractice, if you’re only doing a personal injury case every couple of years, you’re below even 1% of your gross or your caseload, and so it’s not going to impact your malpractice insurance. Secondarily, the associating attorney, I would make sure that they have proper insurance as well. They’re little educational points, and that’s part of what we do in being in the 1LAW family, so to speak, is making sure that the comfort level for someone like yourself is there so you know, “Hey, I have these concerns, are they addressed?” The proportionality issue goes back to, I personally, when I started out, even though I, you know, there are some cases I took, but I associated almost immediately because of the scope of the case, too many plaintiffs, the value was too great, but what I did was, I quarterbacked the case, so to speak.\nI was the point of contact for the client. I knew enough of personal injury, and it’s not that complicated. We’re talking about medical records, bills, police reports, to be involved. The nuances, the expertise that’s provided by these skilled personal injury practitioners is the difficult part. Being participating in a case is not as difficult as you would think, you know, going to a deposition, participating in the interrogatory process. There are ways that are very just bread and butter, cut and dry, to participate and to maintain because in Utah there is that association. Utah is not a direct referral state. California is, but in Utah it is a [quantum meruit 00:20:26] or however you want to describe it, as far as you have to add value to the case.\nSam Glover: We’re going to take about two minutes for sponsors, and when we come back, I want to talk about another aspect of 1LAW which we haven’t really touched on, but is really interesting, and you have, well 1LAW and you, have been working on some interesting ways to use technology to get more about of law practice, including working with Watson, IBM’s famous Watson AI. We’re going to take two minutes, and when we come back, I want to talk more about that.\nThis podcast is supported by Ruby Receptionists. As a matter of fact, Ruby answers our firms at Lawyerist, and my firm was a paying Ruby customer before that. Here’s what I love about Ruby, when I’m in the middle of something, I hate to be interrupted, so when the phone rings, it annoys me, and at often carries over into the conversation I have after I pick up the phone, which is why I’m better off not answering my own phone.\nInstead, Ruby answers the phone, and if the person on the other end asks for me, a friendly, cheerful receptionist from Ruby calls me and asks if I want them to put the call through. It’s a buffer that gives me a minute to let go of my annoyance and be a better human being during the call. If you want to be a better human being on the phone, give Ruby a try. Go to CallRuby.com/Lawyerist to sign up, and Ruby will wave the $95 set-up fee. If you aren’t happy with Ruby for any reason, you can get your money back during your first three weeks. I’m pretty sure you’ll stick around, but since there is no risk, you might as well try.\nAaron Street: Billable hours are the life-blood of a successful law practice. Problem is you still have to bill those hours. Even if your law firm has an account, tracking hours, clients, rates, preparing invoices, and collecting on those invoices is time you never get paid for, and writing notes to yourself in court or on the road is inefficient and error prone.

Beautiful accounting software.\nSam Glover: Okay, we’re back, and Jason, tell me where did the tech experiments come from? Give me the background on how you started branching out because so far you’ve described sort of a, I called it a branded referral network and affiliation, a network of attorneys that are sending cases to each other, that are collaborating on marketing. That all sounds pretty interesting, but normal. Then at some point you started releasing apps and started working with AI. How did that happen?\nJason Velez: Yeah, I think you just hit it on the head there, collaboration. That may be, that’s my takeaway Sam. How did it start? I go back to 2010, right, the phone number and the senior lawyer, and that was … Facebook was really starting to gain some momentum at that time. It had come from this communication and funsy thing to where I believe it was a true business tool. We’ve always been very active participants in definitely the Facebook, social media, and working on the others.\nWhat Facebook allowed you to do, it still does in some capacity, but in the early days I started with basically a note on a Facebook that said, “If you have a legal question, go ahead and ask it.” That’s was kind of my start of this. There’s a number of dot coms that offer this type of service, but that was the [forward 00:23:49], that was the groundbreaking for the technology. From that idea that people could virtually interact with the brand or the lawyer or however you want to look at it. It started on Facebook.\nThen, very shortly after, I came to the realization that a simple will is not something that people should be charged for. There’s certain legal aspects of life that I consider almost like a utility, you know, that people should be able to just have access to. I started basically building a machine learning a logic tree will, and learned how hard that was, and the iterations. We’re going back to like ’12, ’13. In tech terms, that is kind of a long time ago, but to have a website that, back then I don’t think that we were on Word Press, we were just a regular custom-coded website to try to integrate a tool that allowed you to actually build a simple will. A simple will is not that crazy, but it was quite an undertaking.\nThose are my first forays, some playing around with early kind of text interactions. Those three are where I’d say the genesis came. The entire time I’ve had the brand, I’ve wanted what I call a widget, and the widget being the tech because as you identified, the collaboration is fairly normal, and maybe a little atypical, but you can select your flavor of collaboration if you want in this day and age.\nSam Glover: You won’t freak anybody out to hear 1LAW described.\nJason Velez: Yeah, no, absolutely. Then, having that, the desire widget led me, and then knowing what I knew about the tech, I thought, “Hey, where is the space? Where is the space?” I started on demand a the very rudimentary, geo-based, hit a geo pin on a map and be able to interact with a lawyer through video chat. [Out 00:26:04] of good fortune this was launched, basically, I think we’re probably close to the birthday of the tech. It’s somewhere in November, I made my first payment in …\nSam Glover: We’re talking about the 1LAW app right now, which basically lets anybody who has the app talk to a lawyer in the 1LAW network on demand, basically.\nJason Velez: Yes, yes, and more as we’ll get to Watson, but yes, absolutely. That is a year old, launched in … The idea was in the summer of last year, the coding started in November. An on-demand product, and I was very fortunate, it was just timing. I’ve heard timing is a big deal in any new venture, and we used Twilio, which I give a shout out to Twilio, and it’s very powerful developer kits that they have for you. They had programmable video was in beta, and so we launched right into programmable video. Following programmable video, we went into the programmable, I guess the chat, if you would. We offer SMS text, but we went right into the chat with attachments.\nI went to a conference in February of this year, 2016. I didn’t know if I had a thing. I went to the conference to see validation of the idea. I had a working beta, and it was evident pretty quickly that there is a market for what I had. Now that doesn’t meant that everybody was throwing money at me, it just meant that people saw the vision. From there, I really kind of doubled down on the tech. Twilio had their signal conference, I want to say May, I believe it was in May, up in San Francisco, and went there …\nSam Glover: Why don’t you back up real quick. What is Twilio?\nJason Velez: Twilio is, my gosh, Twilio in my little overview, one a stock you should own, two it’s AT&T. Basically, in this day and age of digital communication, Twilio is AT&T. If you’re using VOIP internet, they’re the backbone behind most of that.\nSam Glover: Got you.\nJason Velez: Your programmable tech, so they are a switchboard, in a simple term, for digital communication.\nSam Glover: Got you, okay. Back to the app.\nJason Velez: Twilio, so made our way to the Twilio conference. I should mention, along the way, I became aware that my app had a very good application in the legal aid world. We made an opportunity to talk about that because a lot of clients in legal aid, fairly routine answers, most of it is just ask and answer triage type of stuff. Well, why should you have to drive or take a bus or even make an appointment if you could just know that between these two hours on a given day, or every day between four and five there’s an attorney available to answer to questions, and if you don’t get him today, you can ask him tomorrow.\nSam Glover: Are legal aid organizations using it?\nJason Velez: Yes. We are live in two states, and it’s a big push. A huge push of what we’re doing because I believe if you can solve the justice gap issue, that you’re going to make one heck of a private market product. That aside, absolutely. Legal aid, it’s free to legal aids. We do ask if there’s an ability to write [TIG 00:29:29] that if appropriate we would apply for a TIG, and if not …\nSam Glover: What’s a TIG?\nJason Velez: A technology and innovation grant.\nSam Glover: Got you.\nJason Velez: There’s lots of federal dollars out there to help provide these utility services, if you would. If the TIG is not granted, they still get the product for free.\nSam Glover: Cool.\nJason Velez: That’s just part of the 1LAW philosophy, and what we do. Going to Twilio, Twilio conference, met some really cool people up there because we were working with the programmable video, and they were really pushing Watson. The light bulb came on back to my free will and my logic tree that, “Hey, this is a way to not only do what I was trying to do, but now you can serve it up via …” We use it primarily as a chat bot. We have it as a Word Press plugin in the Word Press store, and we’re on GitHub. It is available as an SMS, and then just, I guess, we’re in beta, but it’s just a flip of a switch on Facebook messenger.\nRealizing that what I like to call augmented legal because it’s not just about having a chat bot fill out forms, which is really powerful. That’s something that we have. We have an editor to allow you to submit documents to our chat bot, but that’s only one piece of the puzzle. To do it yourself, you need a certain level of competence, and there’s going to be the next step that it’s do it yourself, but I have a few questions. Then there’s the people that don’t even want to do it themselves, they would just say, “Hey, can you do this for me?”\nThey don’t realize that they’ve actually lowered their cost because they’ve done 75% of the process, whether it’s intake, filling out a questionnaire, it allows the attorney to then go forward and finish the product, or at least have the information that they need to build something for the client. Watson …\nSam Glover: Yeah, what is working with Watson like? Do you just plug into it? I haven’t really explored it.\nJason Velez: Think of Watson as the brain, and the chat is the call. Right, you’re making a call to Watson. Watson is this processor, and so what Watson does really well is handle the natural language. If you have just yes, no stuff, you don’t really need Watson. If you have people, you need to discern what they said, because yes, no is very easy, but discern what they said, that’s where Watson comes in. Basically Watson, you send it. You’ll ask a question, “Who is the person, the will?” This is, you’re asking of the client. The response is sent to Watson. Watson can now say, “Okay, I heard what he said, the person to make the will is Jason Velez.” Now, Watson can really turn that into text. Then Watson can also discern whether what you said … You know, if I say, “30 degree west,” that’s not going to be a typical answer to who is the person for this [inaudible 00:32:49] …\nSam Glover: Oh, so Watson can go, “Oh, that’s not what I was expecting.”\nJason Velez: Right, yeah, exactly. “I didn’t hear you right. Do you want to try that again? What was that? I didn’t get it. It didn’t fit the criteria.” That’s the beauty of machine learning is that. That’s AI. The chat bot experience is awesome, but the learning part of it is the big deal, knowing that, hey, names two, three, proper names, maybe four, but starting to get weird things, numbers and what not …\nSam Glover: I’ve read lots of discussions about how do you validate a name field in a form? If you subtract machine learning, you have to say, “Well, it’s going to have a first and a last name, and they should both be capitalized,” except that’s not true. Some people have lower cased their names as a form of protest, for example, in the 60’s that was one form of protest. One of my law school professors, his name is spelled in all lowercase, so you got to throw that out. Also, some places, the last name comes before the first name, and in some countries people typically have many names. In some countries they typically have one. As soon as you start trying to validate that input, it gets impossible, but if you give it to something like Watson, you can just feed it all of the proper names that every census in the world knows about, and it’s got a pretty decent idea of what might validate within that form field.\nJason Velez: Yes, and you can have it learn from what the inputs it’s have received. We haven’t put every census name in, but we got a pretty good pool of general names. How we solve the issue of lowercase or whatnot, you can override because what our chat bot does, it says, “Is that correct?”\nSam Glover: Got you.\nJason Velez: If you say it’s correct, it’s just going to accept it. Or if you say, “no,” it’ll say, “What part isn’t correct?”\nSam Glover: Does it also at that point go, like sort of take that into account next time so that the next person …\nJason Velez: Yes.\nSam Glover: … who enters something similar might not get a kickback?\nJason Velez: Yes.\nSam Glover: That’s interesting.\nJason Velez: That’s the beauty of using AI, if you would. One thing though, for people that aren’t familiar with Watson, there is a cost. It’s not crazy. Watson is pretty economical, I would say, for what you’re getting, but there is a cost. What we did was instead of having … We’ve now built … Our first generation was pretty much exactly as I described to you. Imagine a text message, we’re texting Watson, Watson is interpreting, and then spitting back the next question or validation of the existing answer. We knew that that would get expensive quickly, you know, on scale, millions of calls, things like that. We developed our own hybrid engine. Now most of the logic is handled on our end, except for the heavy [natural 00:35:52] lifting, if you would.\nSam Glover: What are some examples of that? We’ve talked about validating names, but that’s probably the smaller part of it. What other things actually get sent to Watson?\nJason Velez: The big things are going to be like what type of form you’re looking for, so the initial query. Some people may say, you know, “I want a will”, “I want a living will”, “I want different types of documents.” That first initial, “Hey, this is what we’re doing”, and then things like when you have multiple children and you want to deal with certain distributions, right, you’re going to say, “Hey, I want to leave my, what is it, Patek Phillipe, or whatever, watch to Billy, and I don’t want Jimmy to get this”, some of the more sophisticated language within a will, if you would. Or, say, in instructions on a corporate organization or things of that nature.\nThe basic stuff, like you said, names, addresses, things that you’re able to really isolate that they should fit within certain parameters, that’s where we now pulled from Watson to allow it really take the, [you 00:37:10] want to say, maybe the free form text, a text field, the bigger text fields. We might say, let’s say over six, seven words, something like that. Really what it … Go ahead.\nSam Glover: From listening to you, I’m assuming that Watson is basically available as an API, and you can just send it things, and it sends back responses.\nJason Velez: Yeah. If you go to our site, we’ve got, let me see, 1LAW …\nSam Glover: And we’ll obviously link to this on our show notes.\nJason Velez: Cool. 1LAW.comintro-docubot, it kind of discusses the flow to Watson. It’s a call, so there’s an API that is, you know … Whether it’s an API or a little bit different, but that’s essentially what you’re doing, and you go in and deliver up to Watson. You’re telling it, “Hey, here’s what I’m sending you, and this is what I want back,” more or less.\nSam Glover: Pretty cool.\nJason Velez: It’s awesome. I was going down a path, and I still may because I’m that intrigued by this. I know we don’t say this for the [skunk 00:38:21] works, but I’m very interested in how AI can, again, augment the practice of law. This isn’t a replacement. This is a tool. This is something that can make your practice better.\nSam Glover: You mentioned that there is a cost. Are you willing to share what the cost is because I bet people are curious?\nJason Velez: The cost to use Watson?\nSam Glover: Yeah.\nJason Velez: Oh, I mean …\nSam Glover: I assume it’s per query or something like that.\nJason Velez: I want to say, generally speaking, we’ve got a … When we started, a simple will or a form letter or things like that were costing us about 75 cents on the Watson end, to give you an idea, to build that.\nSam Glover: Got you.\nJason Velez: We’re down now below 50 cents and probably going to see it land in about 40 cents. It’s really based on, you know, I’m just trying to think, a simple will. You’ve got your name, your address. You’ve got spouse. I mean, there’s quite a few, quite a bit of information. I’d say you’re probably looking at maybe 70ish queries, something like that. It’s somewhere in the five to 10 cents type of thing.\nSam Glover: Let me, kind of by way of seguing to a close here, but how are you doing all of this? I think part of what has to happen for lawyers who want to get involved in tech is they have to figure out how to get it done because you can necessarily just go out there and patch something into your practice which is exactly why you’re doing this because you’ve got a network of people who you can got to and say, “Hey, this is an awesome thing, let’s do it.” They’re essentially investing in it. The typical solo or small firm lawyer is going to have a hard time doing that. I’d like to talk about how are you getting it done, and maybe those others who are interested then can take lessons from that.\nJason Velez: I didn’t really say it in my lead in, so, studied in South America, graduated. I hooked up with a consulting firm. I did political science, hooked up with a consulting firm, sent me back to South America. A bunch of engineers were getting kicked off of jobs because they were too a little bit American cowboy. Bottom line, a poly-sci guy with a little computer background, I spent three years traveling the globe as a network engineer, poly-sci guy turned network engineer, and a little bit of experience with sequel databases. I have a rudimentary background in code and in getting there.\nWhat I do is I start out on a white board, and just a dry erase board, and you draw pictures with text of what you think it will look like. This is probably the biggest takeaway for anybody wanting to get into tech. You don’t want to call up a developer and say, “Hey, I want you to build me a on-demand app.” You want to tell them, “I’ve got an idea for an app. You’re going to come into the app, and it’s going to look like this. From there, this button does that.” The more you can do that … I laid out version one, or whatever, .01, the crudest MVP, I had built. I took it from a white board, two iterations on a white board. I did two sessions, large sessions on a white board, moved it to word, and drew little boxes with pictures in it, and then breakout boxes for the text. Then I shopped developers which is a huge part of the process,\nSam Glover: Where do you go to shop developers?\nJason Velez: You identify what you’re looking for. First you go to the App Store and see if there’s anything out they are. I’d recommend that to anybody, the App Store or Google. What products are out there? Then, I started out, I did three-fold. I did one, a pretty well-respected, you know, I’m in southern California, so I’ve got some good resources, but Irvine is very close to me. They were a high-profile firm. I looked to outsource, and so I took a bid from a company overseas, and then I talked to some people that had provided me tech support in the past. I said, one, I just went out and searched the marketplace here, locally. One, I searched the marketplace abroad, and then finally, I asked people that I felt would have some level of expertise.\nSam Glover: You actually engaged in a … You did a bunch of research, and then you did an actual hiring process.\nJason Velez: Yeah. Yeah. Because at that time I knew what I was asking for.\nSam Glover: Yeah.\nJason Velez: I was able to take them, after some [NDA’s 00:42:50] of course, and I was able to take them what I was looking for, and then get their feedback. Again, I have a rudimentary understanding, so if they were talking … I if I couldn’t understand what they were telling me, I felt that maybe there was a little too much magic behind the curtain. If I could understand, again, I don’t necessarily know how to take it from a blank page …\nSam Glover: That’s a really good point. Lots of lawyers are impressed by people who say things they can’t understand, but I don’t remember who said it, but you don’t truly understand something unless you can explain it to people who aren’t as expert as you are.\nJason Velez: Fair enough.\nSam Glover: That seems like a pretty good litmus test.\nJason Velez: Yeah. Along those lines, one thing I would share to the listeners that want to build any type of tech, or even applying certain tech just to their … You know, website is tech. One thing that I’ve learned, speed is important. If somebody can meet their delivery deadlines, that’s a first indicator that something is going right by a developer. Secondarily, quality. It’s kind of a speed, quality. Cost, I’m going to assume you’ve figured out your budget, so your budget is your budget. If somebody’s taking a long time to deliver something to you, if it’s really good, maybe, but if somebody’s meeting their time deadlines and the product is good, and meaning good that you as the consumer, the person who’s paying for it is saying, “Hey, this really feels good, looks good. It’s meeting my expectations”, you’ve got a good developer right there.\nSam Glover: Yeah.\nJason Velez: Just so people know.\nSam Glover: Very cool. Jason, thank you so much for being with us and taking us through the stuff you’re working on and where it came from. There’s a lot going on there, and if people want to know more go check it out at number one law dot com. That’s 1LAW.com with the number one, not the word. You can see Docubot there. You can get links to the apps. It’s neat stuff, and I think what is maybe so neat about this is this is all coming out of a law firm of just nine lawyers, but there’s an extended network supporting it. Thanks for taking us through that Jason, and helping us understand what it all is, and showing us what’s possible.\nJason Velez: Hey, thank you, Sam, and thanks for the platform you give people like me and everybody out there.\nAaron Street: Make sure to catch next week’s episode of the Lawyerist Podcast.

      "text": "Two open letters, issued from opposite ends of the IBM organizational chart, are getting equal attention this week.\nThe first one came a week after the election. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote an open letter to President-Elect Donald Trump, which clearly spoke to the more optimistic version of his presidential persona.\n“Last Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future, and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all,” she began. “I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.”\nHer ideas involved the creation of “new” collar IT jobs, filled by vocational training instead of traditional college; the need to include cybersecurity in any infrastructure plans; using IT to drive better health outcomes and eliminate government waste; tax reform and better health care for veterans.\nHer tone was neutral, reasonable and clearly established IBM’s stake in key debates going forward, as both a tech innovator and employer.\nSign up for raceAhead , Fortune’s daily newsletter on race and culture here .\nBut the letter did not sit right with one employee, a senior content strategist named Elizabeth Wood. After much thought, Wood wrote her own open letter , addressed directly to IBM’s chief executive, and announced she was resigning.\n“Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen.” That Rometty’s letter came so quickly after the election told Wood that the company had chosen to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain. “The president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities,” she wrote. “These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead, Ms. Rometty. They work every day for IBM’s success and have been silenced by your words.”\nThese two letters highlight the painful balancing act that chief executives and other leaders now face: How to work productively with a deeply divisive new government while reaffirming their commitment to the difficult work of maintaining an inclusive culture within their own ecosystems. Their businesses depend on mastering both.\n“I was really offended — really deeply crushed,” Wood later told Slate . Wood had liked her job of two years and felt she had a future at IBM. But she just couldn’t stay. “This was such a welcoming letter that it was just really distressing.”\nAnd as the news gets worse, the work will only get more difficult.\nEllen McGirt is a senior editor for Fortune",

      "text": "American Airlines plans to use IBM’s public cloud to run some of its applications, both companies said early Tuesday.\nAmerican Airlines, like most large companies, has legacy applications to manage tasks and will move some of them to IBM’s ibm public cloud and use IBM’s BlueMix tools to modernize them. It did not specify which applications would move.\n“The agreement runs the gamut from software and services to infrastructure and also will include data analytics and Watson going forward,” said Patrick Grubbs, IBM’s vice president of travel and transportation. “ Watson” is IBM’s brand of artificial intelligence software that is being customized to suit various vertical industries.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter.\nNeither he nor an American Airlines aal spokeswoman would put a dollar figure on the deal, which is not exclusive. In a prepared statement, the airline said that the cloud computing model, which lets companies add and delete resources as needed, will give it more flexibility and scale for some of its business software.\nIn September, American’s chief information officer Maya Leibman told the CIO Journal that the airline was evaluating a move to the cloud and expected to make decisions about it within months. This looks to be one of those decisions. The American Airlines statement noted that IBM was “a cloud partner,” so there is no exclusivity implied.\nAsked about that point, an airlines spokeswoman stressed that it is a big company that works with lots of tech providers. “We use the best and newest tools for the right applications,” she told Fortune . And, since this is new technology, there will be a lot of testing before it goes live.\nThe airline is not alone in this massive technology shift. Most large companies are weighing the need to keep building and operating their own data centers or moving more of those computing and data storage jobs to a third-party cloud provider like Amazon amzn Web Services, Microsoft msft Azure, Google googl Cloud Platform, or IBM SoftLayer.\nFor more on IBM, watch :\nThere will be more discussion about companies moving to the cloud at Amazon’s annual AWS Re:invent conference this week in Las Vegas, where Amazon will undoubtedly claim a list of customer wins . But while AWS is by far the largest public cloud purveyor, it doesn’t have this market to itself anymore. Microsoft , Google , VMware vmw , IBM, and others are all wooing enterprise customers with their respective public clouds.\nIt probably doesn’t hurt that IBM and American have a relationship going back decades. IBM, for example, worked with American Airlines on SABRE , the pioneering online reservation system.",

      "text": "IBM unveils Watson-powered imaging solutions for healthcare providers November 30, 2016 BM demos AI and imaging at RSNA 2016, world's largest annual gathering of radiologists in Chicago. Credit: IBM Watson Health \nIBM today announced at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2016) it will preview new imaging solutions from Watson Health and Merge Healthcare (Merge; an IBM Company) designed to help healthcare providers pursue personalized approaches to patient diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. The solutions benefit from more than a decade of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) work conducted in IBM Research. Further, IBM Research has partnered with the Radiological Society to debut a live demonstration of how Watson understands, reasons and learns from imaging information. \nMedical images are by far the largest and fastest-growing data source in the healthcare industry—IBM researchers estimate that they account for at least 90% of all medical data today—but they also present challenges that need to be addressed. The volume of medical images can be overwhelming to even the most sophisticated specialists; radiologists in some hospital emergency rooms are presented with thousands of images each day. \nTools to help clinicians extract insights from medical images remain limited, requiring most analysis to be done manually. This has created an opportunity to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources to enable providers to compare new medical images with a patient's image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies. \n\"The breadth and depth of Watson-powered solutions on display at RSNA 2016 from Watson Health's imaging group and from Merge are unmatched among the AI community, and showcase how IBM is bringing cognitive computing to healthcare in clinically meaningful ways,\" said Anne LeGrand, Vice President of Imaging for IBM Watson Health. \nWatson Health will show: A cognitive peer review tool intended to help healthcare professionals reconcile differences between a patient's clinical evidence, and data in that patient's electronic health record (EHR). A cognitive data summarization tool intended to provide radiologists, cardiologists, and other physicians with patient-specific clinical information to use when interpreting imaging studies, or when diagnosing and treating patients. A cognitive physician support tool intended to help doctors personalize healthcare decisions based on integrating imaging data with other types of patient data. The MedyMatch \"Brain Bleed\" App, a cognitive image review tool intended to help emergency room physicians diagnose a stroke or brain bleed in a trauma patient by identifying relevant evidence in a patient record. The video will load shortly \nMerge will show: Marktation, a new process for interpreting medical images intended to help physicians improve image reading speed and accuracy, with an initial application in mammography. Watson Clinical Integration Module, a cloud application for radiologists that aims to help increase reader efficiency and counteract common causes of errors in medical imaging, such as base rate neglect, anchoring, bias, framing bias, and premature closure. Lesion Segmentation and Tracking Module, designed to help radiologists increase the speed by which they interpret and report comparison exams in cancer patients and for other patient conditions that require longitudinal tracking. \n\"Watson cognitive computing is ideally suited to support radiologists on their journey 'Beyond Imaging' to practices that address the needs of patient populations, deliver improved patient outcomes, and demonstrate real-world value,\" said Nancy Koenig, General Manager of Merge Healthcare. \"This week at RSNA, Merge is proud to unveil solutions for providers that enable the first steps on the cognitive care journey, addressing breast cancer, lung cancer, and trauma patients in the ER.\" \nRSNA and IBM Research Show Physicians How Watson Understands, Reasons and Learns \nIBM Research will show physicians how Watson might reduce the time to diagnosis and increase efficiency in provider workflows. Radiologists select cases from a variety of imaging topics, make their diagnosis, and see how a Watson solution attempts to assist the same case as it understands, reasons and learns from text- and imaging data in real time. \nThe live demonstration showcases more than a decade of work by IBM Research's top medical imaging, text mining, and AI data scientists. The demo is able to analyze patient data culled from thousands of data sources and present insights in a compact summary report intended to help clinicians efficiently reach a differential diagnosis. For example, the technology featured in the demo uses deep learning to recognize positions in the body for major anatomical structures (such as in a CT imaging study) and detects anomalies (such as dissections in the aorta, or embolisms in pulmonary arteries). Combining imaging and clinical data with clinical knowledge, it performs clinical inference on the patient's condition and its management, pre-assembling relevant information in a simple online format for a diagnosing physician to consider.",

      "text": "Dear Ms. Rometty, Elizabeth Holli Wood. Photo via Twitter My name is Elizabeth Wood and I am a senior content strategist within the IBM ( No. 20 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list) corporate marketing department, based in New York City. I have worked hard to get to this stage in my career, and have been a valued member of my team at IBM. However, I have chosen to resign, as I can no longer contribute to an organization that would ignore the real needs of its workforce. Last Tuesday, you shared with the world your open letter to president-elect Donald Trump, outlining ways for his administration’s success to conveniently dovetail with that of IBM products. Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen. The company’s hurry to do this was a tacit endorsement of his position, and has signaled to me something very important about IBM’s values: a willingness to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain. The president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead, Ms. Rometty. They work every day for IBM’s success and have been silenced by your words. As a female CEO at a Fortune 500 company, you are in a painfully small club. There is no doubt that you have faced many obstacles to get to where you are now, including from men like president-elect Trump. Why not be clear that his words and actions are unacceptable? For example, take Pespico, Inc. CEO Indra K. Nooyi who publicly remarked in response to his despicable conduct , “Forget about the Pepsi brand. How dare we talk about women that way?” A look at IBM recruitment collateral suggests that the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision within the many pages of your letter to a man who will soon be in the top office of the United States government. There have been days of protest across the country. Students everywhere — future IBMers — are marching out of their high schools and colleges to express their outrage. The spike in hate crimes that has erupted across this country since the election emphasizes what a disservice to your workforce it is to ignore their safety. When the president-elect follows through on his repeated threats to create a public database of Muslims, what will IBM do? Your letter neglects to mention. The choice to leave IBM did not come lightly. I am not leaving for another offer, nor do I have a safety net to fall back on. What I do have is the knowledge that my own life — and those of the several hundred thousand who serve your company worldwide — are too valuable to waste at an organization where we are not respected. It is my belief that you owe your staff and the president-elect a public clarification on IBM’s commitment to the protection and representation of all of its employees. Sincerely,",

      "title": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty’s Letter to the U.S. President-Elect",
      "text": "Ginni Rometty \nCongratulations on your election as the 45th president of the United States. \nLast Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future, and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all. I know that you are committed to help America’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people. \nI am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change. I do so as the leader of the nation’s largest technology employer, its leading patent creator, and the company that for more than 105 years has believed that prosperity and progress can be achieved by unleashing the potential of all people. Permit me to offer a few specific suggestions: \nCreating “New Collar” Jobs Getting a job at today’s IBM ( No. 20 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list) does not always require a college degree; at some of our centers in the United States, as many as one third of employees have less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes obtained through vocational training. In addition, we are creating and hiring to fill “new collar” jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence and cognitive business. \nYou’ve spoken about the importance of vocational education, and we agree. IBM has championed a new educational model for the United States – six-year public high schools that combine traditional education with the best of community colleges, mentoring, and real-world job experience. The first of these schools opened with IBM’s support 5 years ago in New York; we have hired some of the first graduates. There will soon be 100 such schools across the country. With your support, we could do much more. Let’s work together to scale up this approach of vocational training, creating a national corps of skilled workers trained to take the “new collar” IT jobs that are in demand here in America. \nBuilding Intelligent, Secure Infrastructure You’ve said we need to invest in America’s infrastructure, and we agree. As we build big, let’s also build smart. The country should focus on infrastructure investments that incorporate Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence to improve performance. And as infrastructure gets smarter, it also increases the need for cybersecurity, so that vital networks cannot be compromised. We recommend that your infrastructure package include incentives for states and localities to build intelligent – and secure – roads, bridges, buildings, and other public facilities. \nHealthcare: Applying Lessons from Private Sector Experience IBM operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the United States. In 2009, IBM offered 15 specific ideas for how America could save more than $900 billion over ten years through common-sense reforms to the healthcare system, leveraging lessons learned in the private sector. These included using data analytics to reduce fraudulent Medicare claims, improving the exchange of healthcare information among providers, and leveraging the government’s purchasing power to lower the cost of drugs and care. IBM will update its recommendations for the healthcare system and hopes to work with Congress and your HHS Secretary to drive better healthcare at lower cost. \nUsing Data to Fight Government Waste and Inefficiency Eight years ago, IBM helped lead an effort to identify $1 trillion in savings the federal government could achieve through using advanced data analytics, data center consolidation, and the use of cloud technologies to improve the cybersecurity of key government systems. As part of the Technology CEO Council of which I am a member, we will prepare an updated set of recommendations for how you could use technology and fraud analytics to save the government more than $1 trillion. \nBringing Money Home to Invest in America IBM supports your proposal to make American’s tax system more competitive. Many billions of dollars of American companies’ earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system. Your tax reform proposal will free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs. We will support the efforts of your administration and Congress to pass tax reform early in 2017. \nTaking Care of Our Veterans – With the World’s Best Technology All of us at IBM share your gratitude and devotion to the men, women and families who serve our country. More must be done to give our vets the best medical care possible. So we recently announced a pilot program with the Department of Veterans Affairs to help its oncologists treat 10,000 veterans through the power of precision medicine and genomic analysis powered by IBM’s cognitive computing system, Watson. We hope to work with your VA Secretary to expand this collaboration. \nMr. President-elect, IBM’s roots are in the United States. We are investing, hiring, and continuing to reinvent our company for long-term competitiveness. At more than 50 major locations across the country, we hired more U.S. employees last year than in the previous five years. We are opening new innovation centers and business units across the country. We are proud of the work we do here in the United States, just as we are proud of the work we do in more than 175 countries around the world. \nIn the years ahead there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not. But as you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society. \nSincerely, \nChairman, President and CEO, IBM Share this:",

      "text": "In IBM's future, Watson will be your doctor The supercomputer will crunch your medical images and your records to work out what's wrong with you. Save IBM Watson Health \nIBM is working on a way to make its Watson supercomputer a far more effective medical tool for flesh-and-blood doctors. The company wants to use the platform to analyze medical imaging data to learn what a healthy set of insides looks like. It should then be able to identify when things have gone awry in scan images to direct doctors toward areas of concern. If this data is merged with each patient's medical records, it could mean faster and more effective treatment for serious conditions. \nThe company is desperate to turn a profit on all of the money it's crammed into selling Watson as a general-purpose supercomputing tool. The only problem is that is that IBM thinks every issue in the world can be solved with big data, but here it may actually work. After all, other companies are trying similar things -- including Zebra Medical , which does the same job with X-ray images. That firm is also letting patients upload their own CT scans and mammograms for a big data second opinion. \nOne of the systems that IBM is developing is a \"physician support tool,\" that seems to take much of the mental leg-work away from doctors. If a patient is diagnosed with a tumor, Watson will pull together data from various sources to develop a personalized health care plan. Another system will help emergency rooms detect a brain bleed by cross-checking scan data with their historical records to spot patterns. Although there's always a worry that Google -- via its DeepMind AI -- may have won the hearts and minds of clinicians across the world.",

      "text": "American Airlines Moves to IBM Cloud Storage American Airlines Moves to IBM Cloud Storage November 30, 2016 \nAmerican Airlines is preparing to move some of its legacy applications into the IBM cloud. \nAmerican Airlines has recently made the decision to move some of its legacy applications used to manage tasks to the IBM public cloud. The airline then will use IBM’s proprietary set of BlueMix tools to manage those applications. \n“The agreement runs the gamut from software and services to infrastructure and also will include data analytics and Watson going forward,” Patrick Grubbs, IBM’s vice president of travel and transportation, told Fortune . \nWatson is artificial intelligence software owned by IBM that can be customized for various industries. \nAmerican Airlines has noted that IBM will not have exclusive control as a sole cloud partner—the company plans to use various providers as it sees fit. \n“We use the best and newest tools for the right applications,” an American Airlines spokesperson told Fortune. \nThe move to IBM’s cloud has been a while in the making; back in September, American announced that it was evaluating three companies to determine cloud feasibility: Amazon Web Services, IBM, and Microsoft. \nMore and more large companies are seeing the need to move legacy applications to cloud systems, Fortune says, as the upkeep and operation of individual data centers becomes more strenuous. \nAs for American and IBM, the two companies have a long history of working together. They joined forces to create SABRE, a program that pioneered online reservation taking. \nDetails about the current deal for cloud storage, including what exactly will be stored and how much the agreement is costing American, were not disclosed. \n[Photo: Singkham/Shutterstock] Click to add a comment \nYou must be logged in on the FORUM to post a comment Login Leave a Reply",

      "text": "KIDinaKORNER Chart Beat Podcast: Alex da Kid The hitmaker also discusses how IBM's Watson program helped initiate the writing process of his new single, \"Not Easy.\" \n\"The way I create is based around me making fictitious partnerships up in my mind,\" says Alex Da Kid . \"Like, what would happen if Wu-Tang Clan and Kings of Leon made a song together? I love the idea of mixing things that haven't been mixed before. That, to me, is the fun part of making music.\" \nOn the latest Billboard Chart Beat Podcast , the British-born writer, producer and artist chats with Billboard co-director of charts Gary Trust about his chart-conquering career, which has been infused with genre-bending collaborations, from his first smash, B.o.B's \"Airplanes,\" featuring Paramore's Hayley Williams, to the recent Suicide Squad hit \"Sucker for Pain\" by Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa and Imagine Dragons (with Logic and Ty Dolla $ign and featuring X Ambassadors). The Grammy and Emmy Award-winning Alex Da Kid also crowned the Hot 100 for seven weeks in 2010 as producer and writer of Eminem's \"Love the Way You Lie,\" featuring Rihanna. \nNow, Alex Da Kid has released his first single as an artist, \"Not Easy,\" featuring X Ambassadors, Wiz Khalifa and Elle King. Along with his trademark blend of sounds, he crafted the song from a mix of human and electronic collaborators, as IBM's cognitive program Watson analyzed trends in pop culture, including social media posts, to help provide an overview of listeners' current mindsets and inform the song's lyrical angle. \n\"My creative process always starts with conversation,\" Alex Da Kid muses, \"so I was turned on by the fact that I could do that with Watson and understand human conversation, the human condition and thinking a little more in-depth.\" \nAlex Da Kid is also founder of the Kid on a Korner imprint and places immense value on the role that music can play commercially. \"Music is super-underleveraged in marketing,\" he says. \"Music is the language of emotions. And, research shows that when consumers are moved emotionally, it boosts product sales. [Music] can move people's emotions better than anything else.\" A sampling of previous episodes with host Gary Trust: Author Marc Myers / Anthony Head on the \"Buffy\" Musical Episode / Suzanne Vega / Bobby Bones (hosted by Jim Asker) / How Daya Broke Through on New Label Artbeatz / The Eagles' Timothy B. Schmit / Joel Whitburn / Debbie Gibson / Hit Songs Deconstructed on The Chainsmokers & Meghan Trainor / Lionel Richie (hosted by Trevor Anderson) \nEnjoy the entire latest Chart Beat Podcast and check back for more upcoming episodes with artists, label executives, radio programmers and personalities, songwriters, producers and more.

ITEXPO is the communications and business transformation event bringing together service providers, enterprises, government agencies, resellers, vendors and developers to discuss the latest innovations that are changing the marketplace. \nThomas’ keynote takes place at 4:30PM on Wednesday, February 8 th and her keynote will explore how cognitive computing is redefining and re-imagining how we interact with data. To succeed in the Cognitive era, businesses must deliver applications that collect and mine oceans of data for actionable insights to gain a competitive edge. To enable this, a next-generation hybrid cloud infrastructure must connect data from all sources, including traditional enterprise systems as well as mobile data. This infrastructure must dynamically and economically deal with an explosion in data volume and it must deliver the computing power necessary to perform the analytics flexibly and with high performance. \n\"Data is the new natural resource creating business opportunities and new type of workloads such as deep learning, natural language processing and others causing a shift to cognitive models,\" said Jamie Thomas, IBM Systems general manager for Strategy and Development. \"The industry has come to an inflection point in which a company's IT infrastructure must be ready for the cognitive era and take advantage of hybrid cloud infrastructure to optimize cost and performance.\" \n“When talking about a company who holds the record for the most patents twenty plus years in a row, to say IBM is a leader in innovation, is an understatement. There is no better company to shed insight into the future and best practices for cognitive computing and data management,” said Rich Tehrani, TMC CEO and conference chairman. “We are excited to welcome Jamie Thomas to ITEXPO and look forward to hearing her take on the quick changing industry.” \nITEXPO is supported by Diamond Sponsors Digium, RingCentral, Platinum Sponsors 888VoIP, Fiber Mountain, Grandstream, Sangoma, Sansay, Talkdesk Yealink, Gold Sponsors: ABP Tech, IBM, NetSapiens, Snom, Sonus, Speech Mobility, Teli, Vitelity, and Voxbone \nFor more information or to register for ITEXPO, contact at 203-852-6800 x131.

      "text": "IBM Tests Blockchain for Supply Chain With India’s Mahindra Group Stan Higgins ( @mpmcsweeney) | Published on November 30, 2016 at 16:42 GMT News \nIndian business conglomerate Mahindra Group is working with IBM to develop blockchain-based supply chain applications. \nAnnounced today, the partnership sees the two firms working on a prototype tool for tracking supply chain transactions via blockchain. Mahindra, a major business group in India, has operations in industries ranging from aerospace to automotives, as well as agriculture, finance and technology. \nThe collaboration comes as India’s business and finance sectors continue exploring the tech. Various banks in the country have been testing blockchain for use in cross-border payments and transaction settlement. Other firms, including IT consultancy Tata, have pursued various proofs-of-concept , while startups working in the bitcoin space have continued to develop products. \nFor now, Mahindra is testing the waters with the supply chain prototype, but the conglomerate says that it is looking at other applications across its various business lines, including agricultural technology and transportation. \nAnish Shah, Mahindra’s group president for strategy, said in a statement: \n“This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business.” \nThe company has been testing blockchain internally as part of a broader push to investigate new technologies. In June, Shah told Indian news source Mint that it was considering the tech for use in supply chain management.",

      "title": "IBM Named a Leader in Application Programming Interface (API) Management Solutions",
      "text": "ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE:   IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . \nForrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. \nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence.\nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\"\n\"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\" \nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. \nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance. \nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets.\nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix.   Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2 .2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018).  \nAbout IBM Cloud \nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \n1.

In mid-November 2016, IBM ( IBM ) announced a partnership with KYCK! \nKYCK! is a Singapore-based ( EWS ) financial technology startup that provides users with information and access to brokerage demo accounts with hassle-free onboarding opportunities. \nIn collaboration with IBM, KYCK! intends to provide a platform with blockchain technology that will have video conferencing and encrypted document submission abilities. This platform will offer improved identification validation through a committed blockchain-based business network, which is likely to include banking and government entities. \nOnce identity verification is established, KYCK! will input customer information into current bank-based checks or third-party systems before account onboarding. IBM’s KYCK! blockchain offering is based on HyperLedger \nThis blockchain project, based on the Hyperledger, will be supported by IBM’s Bluemix Garage. In collaboration with banks and technology players such as Intel ( INTC ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), CME Group, and DTCC, IBM is promoting the Hyperledger Project. Hyperledger, a Linux open-source project, is a collective effort to accelerate blockchain technology. \nIBM opened a blockchain innovation center in Singapore in July 2016. IBM opened Bluemix Garage in mid-2016 to focus on blockchain, financial services, and financial technology innovations. \nIn late June 2016, IBM, in collaboration with Japan-based ( EWJ ) Mizuho Financial Group, announced a blockchain test for putting the technology into use in settlement procedures. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"INTC\",\"JPM\",\"EWJ\",\"EWS\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Intel Corporation\",\"JPMorgan Chase & Co.\",\"iShares MSCI Japan Index (ETF)\",\"iShares MSCI Singapore Index Fund (ETF)\"]} X",

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 5 OF 14 Why IBM Partnered with NVIDIA By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM’ strategic partnership with NVIDIA \nIBM ( IBM ) has invested billions of dollars in machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence) through partnerships and acquisitions to develop its Watson platform, which is aimed at the AI space. On the heels of this strategy, IBM has partnered with NVIDIA ( NVDA ) to promote a computer’s capacity to “think and learn in more human-like ways.” \nNVIDIA GPUs (graphics processing unit) are seeing increased adoption by supercomputers and cloud companies for AI tasks. \nUnder this partnership, IBM aims to roll out a software toolkit, IBM PowerAI for IBM servers, which contains NVIDIA’s Tesla accelerator cards. NVIDIA’s Tesla processors are used in deep learning technology. Recently, Intel ( INTC ) unveiled the latest version of its Xeon Phi processors to compete with NVIDIA’s Tesla processors. \nIn September 2016, IBM launched a new server, the Power S822LC, primarily for AI deep learning and other HPC (high-performance computing) workloads. The new server will use IBM’s POWER architecture. IBM’s POWER architecture, a part of its OpenPOWER Foundation, was built and launched specifically for big data analytics, cloud, and HPC workloads. \nThe OpenPOWER Foundation is an open hardware technology initiative that was started in 2013 by Google ( GOOG ), IBM, NVIDIA, Mellanox Technologies ( MLNX ), and Tyan. \nIBM’s newest server is the only server available in the market that completely integrates NVIDIA’s NVLink technology. NVDA can use its NVLink fabric to accelerate the data transfer at a speed of up to 80 GBps (gigabytes per second) of bandwidth. Apart from NVIDIA’s GPUs, IBM’s Power8 is the only processor available that includes built-in NVLink support. Forecasts and expectations from AI and the deep learning space \nSalesforce ( CRM ) is set to become a $10 billion dollar company by 2018 . Its cofounder and CEO, Mark Benioff, recently stated, “What I see is an AI first world, and for every customer, going to be able to get a whole another generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.” \nTractica, a market intelligence company, expects AI to become a part of every industry, replacing existing business models with new ones that rely on deep learning. Tractica forecasts that global AI revenue could rise from $643.7 million in 2016 to $36.8 billion by 2025. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"CRM\",\"IBM\",\"NVDA\",\"INTC\",\"GOOG\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"salesforce.com, inc.\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"NVIDIA Corporation\",\"Intel Corporation\",\"Google Inc\"]} X",

      "text": "Argyle Capital Maintains Stake in IBM (IBM) By Daniel Kobialka | November 30, 2016 — 8:02 AM EST \nArgyle Capital Management maintained its stake in International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) in the second quarter of 2016. (See also: Liberty Capital Management Ups Stake in IBM .) \nDailyQuint reported Argyle owned 25,116 shares of IBM worth approximately $3.8 million in 2Q16. Also, Argyle's shares of IBM make up about 1.6 percent of the financial planner's stock portfolio. \nAlthough Argyle failed to add or subtract IBM shares in 2Q16, other institutional investors modified their stake in the multinational software company, according to DailyQuint. Some of the institutional investors to buy or sell shares of IBM in 2Q16 included: Round Table Services: Boosted its stake by 0.4 percent. Nadler Financial Group: Upped its position in IBM by 0.4 percent. Bremer Trust National Association: Bolstered its position by 0.4 percent. Alpha Windward: Increased its stake in IBM by 1.1 percent. \nIBM shares closed at a price of $164.52 per share on Monday. They feature a 52-week price high of $165.00 per share and a 52-week price low of $116.90 per share. A Closer Look at the Future of IBM \nIBM reported revenue of $81.8 billion last year, and the company looks poised to deliver strong returns to its shareholders in 2016 — and perhaps beyond. \nGinni Rometty, IBM's CEO, said her company recorded double-digit growth in its strategic initiatives — analytics, cloud, mobility and security — in 3Q16. In addition, IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter stated his company returned more than $6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases during the time frame. \nOverall, IBM generated $19.2 billion in revenue in 3Q16. Schroeter noted IBM's 3Q16 revenue was \"relatively flat\" year to year, but the company is prioritizing strategic investments that could help the business bolster its earnings both now and in the future. \"There's a tremendous amount of change in our industry, and we're continuing to invest where we see the best opportunities. With this, we're addressing new opportunity areas and building new markets, as well as delivering innovation in our existing businesses,\" he said.

      "text": "November 30, 2016 12:30pm Comments Share: IBM cited for supporting combined strategies for API management, PaaS, and integration \nARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . \nForrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. \nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence. \nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\" \n\"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\" \nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. \nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance. \nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets. \nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2 .2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018). \nAbout IBM Cloud \nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \n1.

      "text": "ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE:  IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . \nForrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. \nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence. \nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\" \n\"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\" \nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. \nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.",
