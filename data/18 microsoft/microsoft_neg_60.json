      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone Introduces Windows Surface Phone Pro 5 Features Microsoft Surface Phone Introduces Windows Surface Phone Pro 5 Features \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Pro Version 5, Studio Available In Spring Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Pro Version 5, Studio Available In Spring 3 \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone news is determined to be the ultimate mobile device, which people are waiting to preorder. With Windows, Pro 5 and Microsoft Studio, the company is heading into a direction that will make its products hot, and some skeptics say Amazon might be the way to order the Surface Phone once a shipping date has been announced. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Microsoft Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone Pro 5; Microsoft Surface Rumors Continue Windows Surface Phone Pro 5; Microsoft Surface Rumors Continue Jennifer Hong Dec 06, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone Pro 5; Microsoft Surface Rumors Continue 2 \nShoppers are still finding Windows Surface Phone deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio; Windows Surface Pre-orders To Ship Late Winter 2017 Microsoft Surface Studio; Windows Surface Pre-orders To Ship Late Winter 2017 Michael Stevens Dec 06, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio; Windows Surface Pre-orders To Ship Late Winter 2017 1 \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio, but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong —and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "Twitter \nEveryone knows what Microsoft Office is, right? Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote — simple. \nWell, that’s sort of true. But if you’ve ever heard of Office Online, Office Mobile, Office 2016, or Office 365, you know that it’s a very simplistic view of what is a complex and multifaceted ecosystem of apps and programs. \nA decade ago it was much simpler to explain what Office involved. But with the proliferation of smartphones, web apps, and software subscriptions, the number of options available to users has spiraled. Even to a seasoned Office user, it’s confusing 11 Frequently Asked Office 2016 Questions Answered 11 Frequently Asked Office 2016 Questions Answered Office 2016 is looming and raises many questions. Do you have to buy a subscription, can you upgrade now, and can you go back to Office 2013? We compiled frequently asked questions and provide the... Read More . \nIf you find it hard to make an informed choice about which package is best for you, don’t worry. In this article, I’m going to walk you through the all various options. Office 2016 \nOffice 2016 is the traditional version of the productivity suite. Most of you have used its predecessors in the past, whether at home, work, or school. \nMicrosoft offers the package in three versions: Office Home and Student 2016, Office Home and Business 2016, and Office Professional 2016. The three have some similarities, but also some important differences. The Similarities \nAll three can only be installed on one PC or Mac, they are all one-time purchases, none of them offer tablet/smartphone versions, they don’t include Microsoft Support (live text chat or phone), and they don’t offer any extra perks like OneDrive storage or Skype minutes. \nPerhaps most importantly, none of them offer free upgrades to future versions of Office 13+ Reasons You Should Upgrade to Microsoft Office 2016 13+ Reasons You Should Upgrade to Microsoft Office 2016 Microsoft Office 2016 is here and it's time for you to make a decision. The productivity question is -- should you upgrade? We give you the new features and the fresher reasons to help you... Read More . If you buy Office 2016 now, you’ll still be stuck on Office 2016 until you shell out another one-time fee for a new version. \nGiven the price points and the lack of extra features, it’s quite apparent Microsoft is trying to move users away from these products. Even finding the information on the Office website is becoming increasingly difficult. The Differences \nThe main differences are the price points and the software included in each package. \nThe most basic version (Office Home and Student) ships with Word 2016, Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and OneNote 2016. It’ll set you back $119.99 and can only be used on home computers. \nThe second tier (Office Home and Business) adds Outlook for desktop. The different versions of Outlook are confusing Microsoft Outlook Web Vs. Desktop: Which One Is Best for You? Microsoft Outlook Web Vs. Desktop: Which One Is Best for You? Outlook.com is a powerful online email client that comes free with Office Online. But can Outlook on the web compete with its desktop counterpart? Our Outlook comparison will help you decide for yourself. Read More in themselves, but they’re beyond the scope of this article. Luckily, we’ve covered them in detail elsewhere on the site. It costs $289.99 and can be used on home and office machines. \nThe most expensive package (Office Professional 2016) includes Access 2016 and Publisher 2016, as well as Outlook and the four basic apps. Like Office Home and Business, you can also use it on home and office PCs, but you’ll need to shell out an eye-watering $499.99 to buy it. Mac users do not have access to this package. Office 365 \nMost people consider Office 365 to be the future of the Office suite An Introduction to Office 365 -- Should You Buy Into the New Office Business Model? An Introduction to Office 365 -- Should You Buy Into the New Office Business Model? Office 365 is a subscription based package that offers access to the latest desktop Office suite, Office Online, cloud storage, and premium mobile apps. Does Office 365 provide enough value to be worth the money? Read More . The price points are much more competitive than the standalone Office 2016 suite, and Microsoft throws some goodies to sweeten the deal further. Home Users \nHome users have two choices: Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal. \nBoth subscriptions include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook. If you’re a PC user, you’ll also get Access and Publisher. \nAside from the extra software, the best part of a 365 subscription is the automatic updates . Microsoft is constantly rolling out mini-updates to add functionality and remove bugs, and anytime there is a major new release, you’ll be the first to get it. The next major Office update is scheduled for 2019. \nThe biggest difference between the two products is the number of licenses you’ll be given. Office 365 Personal only includes one license and can only be installed on one PC/Mac and one smartphone/tablet. \nOffice 365 Home increases this number to five. You can share those five installs between other people in your family. It means one subscription should be enough to give everyone in your household a copy of the software. \nLastly, both packages give you (and anyone you share your subscription with) 1 TB of OneDrive storage and 60 minutes of worldwide Skype calls every month. \nOffice 365 Personal costs $59.99 per year (or $5.99 per month). Office 365 Home is $79.99 per year (or $7.99 per month). \nRemember: if you’re a student, you can get Office 365 Education for free through your school Students Can Get Microsoft Office 365 for Free Students Can Get Microsoft Office 365 for Free Starting on December 1st, Universities that license Office Education for their faculty and staff can offer students Office 365 ProPlus for free. Read More . Business Users \nYou can only use Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal on home computers. If you want to run the software in a business, you’ll need a different package. \nYou have three options: Office 365 Business Essentials, Office 365 Business, and Office 365 Business Premium. \nThe cheapest package, Office 365 Business Essentials, only gives you access to the online versions of Office, as well as a 50 GB Exchange Online email inbox and video conferencing. It costs $5 per user, per month. \nOffice 365 Business lets you install the full Office apps on your computer, but it does not include Exchange Online or Skype minutes. It costs $8.25 per user, per month. \nOffice 365 Business Premium is the elite offering. You get all the apps, 50 GB of email, and Skype HD video conferencing. It’s $12.50 per user, per month. Office Online \nOffice Online (previously known as Office Web Apps) is a suite of lightweight, browser-based versions of the Office suite. \nThe personal edition of Office Online is entirely free to use , you just need a Microsoft Account. Available apps include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Sway, Mail, People, Calendar, OneDrive, and Docs.com. Users with a 365 subscription can easily switch between the two interfaces. \nThe holy trinity of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do have some important functionality like PDF rendering and real-time collaboration, but they are not the full-featured versions. For example, Word is lacking some key features for power users: The References and Mailings ribbons are missing. It cannot adjust a document’s orientation. It doesn’t support section breaks. The Outline, Draft, Web Layout, and Full Screen Reading views are unavailable. It doesn’t support the Navigation pane, side-by-side viewing, or split windows. Office Mobile Apps \nAmazingly, Office Mobile Apps have been around in some form since 1996. They started life as “Pocket Office” and supported the Windows CE 1.0 operating system. \nThe four main apps are Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, but products such as Sway, Skype for Business, and SharePoint Newsfeed are all available for download. \nThe apps are free to use for home users who have a screen size smaller than 10.1 inches, but they offer reduced functionality. The only way to a) get full functionality and/or b) use the apps on a screen larger than 10.1 inches, is to subscribe to Office 365. \nA subscription will add the ability to track and review changes, apply custom colors to text, insert section and page breaks, customize Pivot Tablets styles and layouts, insert and edit WordArt, and save ink annotations from slideshows, as well as a whole lot more. For the complete list of features, check the Microsoft Office website . Which Version Do You Use? \nI hope you now have a clearer understanding of the four main subdivisions of the Office suite: Office 2016, Office 365, Office Online, and Office Mobile Apps. There is no easy way to say which Office suite is right for you Which Office Suite Is Best for You? Which Office Suite Is Best for You? You'll be pressed to find an occupation that doesn't require word or number processing of some sort. And you may wonder, is Microsoft Office really the best solution? Here are your options. Read More — you need to establish which apps are most important to you, what environment you’ll be working in, and what device you’ll be using. \nI’d love to hear about which product you’ve chosen and why. Perhaps you’ll help a fellow reader establish which one they should buy. \nAs always, you can get in touch with your thoughts and opinions via the comments box below.",

      "text": "Brussels (AFP) - Internet giants Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are not doing enough to fight online hate speech despite \"moving in the right direction\", the European Commission said on Tuesday.\nAll four signed an EU code of conduct in May aimed at combatting internet hate speech.\n\"It is our duty to protect people in Europe from incitement to hatred and violence online,\" European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Vera Jourova said.\n\"This is the common goal of the code of conduct. The last weeks and months have shown that social media companies need to live up to their important role and take up their share of responsibility when it comes to phenomena like online radicalisation, illegal hate speech or fake news.\n\"While IT Companies are moving in the right direction, the first results show that the IT companies will need to do more to make it a success.\"\nThe four IT companies had committed to review notifications of potential hate speech within 24 hours.\nBut the Commission noted in a report published on Tuesday that among 600 notifications made, only 28 percent led to the removal of content while just 40 percent were treated within 24 hours.\nAnother 43 percent were reviewed in under 48 hours.\nThe notifications were sent to the IT companies by a group of 12 NGOs from nine different countries who analysed notification responses over a six week period.\nYouTube reviewed notifications within 24 hours on more than 60 percent of cases while Twitter managed that on just 23 percent.\nYouTube was also most active in removing content on 48 percent of cases compared to Twitter's 19 percent.\nFacebook reviewed 50 percent of cases within a day and removed content on 28 percent of notifications. Microsoft did not receive any notifications.",

      "text": "The European Union has given its blessing to Microsoft's pending $26 billion acquisition of professional-networking site LinkedIn, the software giant said Tuesday.\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive body, granted its approval on the condition that Microsoft allows rival professional networking sites to integrate its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. PC makers in the EU will also have the option of not installing LinkedIn's app, Microsoft said.\nMicrosoft made the commitments in November after EU regulators expressed antitrust concerns about the deal. The acquisition is now expected to close in coming days, Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief legal officer, wrote in a company blog post .\nMicrosoft announced plans in June to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion , its biggest-ever acquisition. For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal furthers its plan to become an essential provider to businesses of cloud-based services, including its Office 365. Salesforce was also reportedly interested in making a bid for LinkedIn.\nMicrosoft submitted its LinkedIn acquisition for EU regulatory approval in October , after already receiving approval from authorities in the US, Canada and Brazil.\n ",

Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Reuters, Brussels \nMicrosoft (MSFT.O) won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD.N), its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe US software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signaled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on November 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in program, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs. \nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. \nUS software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard. \n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement.

      "text": "Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, and YouTube will share data to fight extremism online By David Gilbert on Dec 6, 2016 Well that was quick. Just 24 hours after the European Union criticized them for failing to fulfil their promise to tackle the proliferation of extremist content on their platforms, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft and YouTube have announced a new initiative to do just that.\nDesigned to help curb the spread of terrorist material available online, the new project will see the creation of a centralized database of “hashes” — digital fingerprints — that can determine which images and video are extremist in nature.\nThe idea is that content flagged by one company will then automatically be reviewed by all the others and removed if it is deemed to violate their respective terms and conditions. Because each company’s interpretation of what is extremist content is different, the process will not be automated, but it will speed up the identification process.\n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms,” the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.\nInitially each company will share the “most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos” that they have already removed from their services – content that likely violates all of the companies content policies.\nOn Sunday, in an interview published in the Financial Times , the EU justice commissioner Vera Jourova criticized the Silicon Valley tech giants for failing to live up to a promise they made in May , when the signed a “voluntary code of conduct” agreeing to take some concrete steps toward dealing with racism and hate on their services.\n“The last weeks and months have shown that social media companies need to live up to their important role and take up their share of responsibility when it comes to phenomena like online radicalization, illegal hate speech, or fake news,” Jourova said in the interview.\nThe joint statement posted on Facebook’s site on Monday appears to have been a fast reaction to the criticism. Facebook didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how long this program has been in the works.\nThe four companies currently use a similar system, called PhotoDNA , to identify child sexual abuse images that might be posted on their services. Unlike the new system, the PhotoDNA database is maintained by law enforcement and companies are legally obliged to remove any content which matches those images and video listed in the database.\nHany Farid, one of the developers of PhotoDNA, has broadly welcomed the announcement, but says that he has concerns about the lack of transparency. He told the Guardian that unless experts in extremist content are in place to maintain the database, the announcement will be futile:\n“What we want is to eliminate this global megaphone that social media gives to groups like Isis. This doesn’t get done by writing a press release.”",

      "text": "The European Commission has approved the Microsoft acquisition of LinkedIn , subject to conditions. The approval follows an investigation by the European Commission into how Microsoft could use its strong market position to expand the userbase on LinkedIn. The commission was concerned about the effect on competing professional social networking supports if Microsoft were to pre-install LinkedIn on Windows PCs and combine the LinkedIn user database with that of Microsoft.\nCustomer Relationship Software services was another area of concern. The European Commission evaluated if Microsoft could shut out competition by bundling Microsoft Customer Relationship Management Software with Sales Intelligence Solutions from LinkedIn, and denying competing Customer Relationship Management solution vendors from access to the full LinkedIn database.\nThe investigation found out that the LinkedIn Sales Intelligence product is not a must have solution, and that access to the LinkedIn database is not necessary for competing in the Customer Relationship Software services market. Additionally, the European Commission has found that Microsoft is a relatively minor player in the market, with the market dominated by SAP, Oracle, and the clear leader, Salesforce.\nThe commission has approved the acquisition with a few conditions. The conditions are that Microsoft should not install LinkedIn by default on its operating system, and allow users to uninstall the service if it does choose to bundle it with the OS by default.\nCompeting professional social network service providers should be allowed to maintain current levels of integration with Microsoft products. The European Commission wants Microsoft to provide access to “Microsoft Graph” to competing Professional Social Networking service providers. Developers can use data available through this gateway to drive user adoption.\nThe post European Commission gives its approval for Microsoft acquisition of LinkedIn appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "0 A Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop rests on a tabletop at an event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nMicrosoft’s Surface Book was released in October 2015 and since then the company’s first laptop has garnered positive reviews. Naturally, fans are now excited about a possible Surface Book 2 that will have its specs and features upgraded. Microsoft recently released the Surface Book i7 with various improvements, better battery capacity and updated processor. \nHowever, the Surface Book i7 is not the Surface Book 2 and fans want the latter as soon as possible. As is the case with many other anticipated devices, Microsoft too is reportedly waiting for the Kaby Lake processors so that it can incorporate the chipset in the device. It can either include the i5 or i7 processor, reports Tech Times . \nThus, it is impossible to know the exact release date of the Surface Book 2 though it can be expected in 2017. An August Instagram post by Microsoft hinted at a new hinge system for the Surface Book 2. It will reportedly have fewer ridges compared to the current Surface Book. The current hinge creates a gap when the device is closed and it is because of this that Microsoft is looking to redesign the hinge. \nThe Intel Kaby Lake chipsets will definitely help in improving the overall performance of the device. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 will reportedly support 4K videos because of the chipset and the 13.5-inch display will have a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. Certain reports have also claimed that the device will be released with VR capability though the credibility of these reports is a problem. \nTech enthusiasts have already widely compared the Surface Book with Apple’s MacBook Pro 2016. In terms of battery life, screen resolution and pricing, the Surface Book stood out as the winner. An upgraded Microsoft Surface Book 2 will only widen this gap until and unless Apple also comes up with an upgrade.",

The disclosure came on a call with reporters after one asked about Trump’s stake in Boeing—a company that Trump criticized on Twitter Tuesday .\nCritics have argued that Trump’s stock holdings could be a conflict of interest for the president-elect after he steps in to the White House on Jan. 20. The president-elect held an interest in several financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, as well as energy companies such as Halliburton and ExxonMobil. Those holdings have worried onlookers, who say that it could skew the president-elect’s stance of Wall Street regulation and climate change. Trump had already gotten criticism for owning a stake in Energy Transfer Partners etp , the company trying to develop the Dakota Access Pipeline .\nIt’s unclear when exactly Trump sold out of those holdings, though the S&P 500 was up roughly 2% at the beginning of June, before falling following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union on June 24.\nGranted, Trump had a relatively small fraction of his overall wealth in the stock market, according to May filings with the Federal Election Commission. Roughly $40 million of his estimated $4 billion net worth was invested in the stock market, many of which were large-cap, value stocks, which generally do better than others when the market drops. But it also means that he hasn’t benefitted from the so-called Trump Bump. The stock market is up over 3% since Trump was elected president.\nThe bulk of Trump’s wealth is still tied up in his real estate development company, which will continue to create conflicts for the president-elect, and be an issue for critics.\nHere were Trump’s 14 biggest stock holdings, according to the May filing , including shares of companies that Trump criticized on the campaign trail . (Campaign finance disclosure laws only require candidates give a range of value for their investments.)\n14. Alphabet : $100,000 to $200,000\n13. Caterpillar : $100,000 to $200,000\n12. Phillips 66 : $100,000 to $200,000\n11. Celgene : $100,000 to $250,000\n10. Gilead Sciences : $100,000 to $250,000\n9. Visa : $100,000 to $251,000\n8. General Electric : $100,000 to $250,000\n7. Johnson and Johnson : $100,000 to $250,000\n6. Nike : $100,000 to $250,000\n5. McKesson : $100,000 to $250,000\n4. J.P. Morgan Chase : $100,000 to $251,000\n3. PepsiCo: $150,000 to $350,000\n2. Microsoft : $300,000 to $600,000\n1. Apple : $600,000 to $1.251 million\nTrump is also expected to discuss his business holdings, as well as plans for the Trump Organization, at a Dec. 15 news conference. Trump has said he plans to turn over operations of his company to his adult children, though he has not given details on that transition.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s $26 Billion LinkedIn Acquisition Gets EU Approval; Deal to Close in Coming Days The deal would close in the coming days following the EU clearance LinkedIn creates bulk of its annual revenue from job hunters, recruiters Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme \nMicrosoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal , which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe US software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion (roughly Rs. 20,375 crores) annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. The European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns.\n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on November 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programmes. \nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. \nUS software company Salesforce , which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard. \n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "title": "EU Clears Microsoft Deal to Buy LinkedIn -- WSJ",
      "text": " Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's$26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June. The EU's clearance was the final barrier to closing the deal, following approvals in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, and South Africa.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\n\"The Quote: -unQuote: concessions are minimal and very much in line with the openness that Microsoft has been pursuing in the last few years,\" said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\n--Jay Greene contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 160248ET ",

When there is a UHD version of a video in our catalogue, you’ll be prompted to purchase or rent the UHD version by default. You can now purchase and rent UHD videos inside the Movies & TV app. On Xbox One consoles, you can see how much of a movie you’ve already watched from your Homepage. \nThe news follows similar a announcement from Google, with the search giant recently bringing 4K movies to its Google Play store . \nPreviously, the Windows Store only offered HD and Full HD content. \nRelated: Best 4K TVs \nWATCH: All you need to know about TVs \nHave you hopped on the 4K bandwagon yet?

      "text": "Search Problem Notes Problem Note 59414: Column order might change when SAS速 Visual Analytics imports Microsoft Excel files into DBMS \nSAS Visual Analytics enables you to import local files into third-party database management systems (DBMS). For example, you might import a local Microsoft Excel file to Oracle. However, in some cases, the column order in the imported table might be different from the column order in the original file. \nSAS Visual Analytics uses PROC SQL code to import data from the local file to DBMS. The exact code that is executed depends on the length of the column names in the source file, and the maximum column name length supported by the target database. This maximum length varies depending on the DBMS type. \nFor example, the maximum column name length in Oracle is 32 characters. If you are importing an Excel file to Oracle, and all of the column names are fewer than 32 characters, then SAS Visual Analytics generates the following code: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE ORALIB.MYTABLE AS SELECT * FROM WORK.MYXLSX; \nHowever, if any of the column names exceed the 32-character limit for Oracle, then SAS Visual Analytics truncates those names, and runs a SELECT statement that lists all of the column names. When this SELECT statement is added to the code, the column order might be different from the column order in the Excel file. Here is an example of a SELECT statement: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE ORALIB.MYTABLE AS SELECT 'PRODUCT'n,'CUSTOMERFIRSTNAMELASTNAMEADDRES'n,'PROFIT'n FROM WORK.MYEXCEL; \nTo ensure that columns are imported into the DBMS in the same order in which they appear in the Excel file, make sure that none of the column names exceed the maximum length supported for the target DBMS.

Photo credit : Microsoft Accelerator.\nWipro, the third biggest Indian IT firm, has tied up with Microsoft Accelerator to give “enterprise-ready” startups a boost to grow their business.\nStartups are considered enterprise-ready when they have achieved product-market fit and are ready to service clients.\nMicrosoft Accelerator focuses on later-stage startups with a proven product-market fit. It already has a partnership with India’s biggest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services, where “an open innovation framework will be created to mentor and engage with startups.”\nWith Wipro, Microsoft Accelerator hopes to open business channels to the startups in its roster.\nSee: Microsoft Accelerator picks 13 startups for its latest batch. AI is a recurring theme\n\n“We have enterprise-ready startups, but they do not have access,” Bala Girisaballa, CEO of Microsoft Accelerator in Bangalore, said. Wipro is already helping startups with investment and clients, he said.\nWipro has invested in Altizon , an internet of things startup, he said. The companies did not reveal the quantum of investment.\nWipro, like other IT services companies in the country, has been looking for various ways to integrate startups into their work systems. Last year, the company’s corporate venture arm Wipro Ventures said it wanted to invest in early-stage venture capital funds based in the US. It is also buying minority stakes in startups to help fill gaps in its own range of offerings. \n“Startups are a big component of our innovation journey, and when you look at Microsoft’s [Accelerator] portfolio, we see great synergies,” K.R. Sanjiv, chief technology officer at Wipro, said.\nThis post https://www.techinasia.com/wipro-microsoft-accelerator-tie-up appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) AP Wednesday, December 07, 2016 04:31AM NEW YORK -- The Cavaliers have made other arrangements for players who do not want to stay at a New York hotel branded by President-elect Donald Trump.LeBron James and several teammates have decided not to stay at Trump Soho in lower Manhattan this week. The Cavs have booked rooms at the luxury hotel for two days as the team will play the Knicks on Wednesday.Cavs general manager David Griffin told The Associated Press that the team has made plans for a \"group that wants to be elsewhere to be together elsewhere.\" Griffin did not say where the players will be staying.James publicly endorsed and campaigned for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Trump. Several of his teammates, including Richard Jefferson, Iman Shumpert and others have expressed their disappointment over Trump's win.The defending NBA champions will arrive in New York on Tuesday after playing in Toronto on Monday night.The Cavs were honored by President Barack Obama last month at the White House for their title, the first for any Cleveland team since 1964.

      "text": "Microsoft’s Surface Phone Allegedly Revealed in Patent Drawings GO Patent is believed to provide us with early look at the Surface Phone, which according to sources should launch in 2017 Dec 7, 2016 08:55 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft’s rumored Surface Phone is one of the most anticipated products ever planned by the software giant, but without an official confirmation from the company, we don’t even know for sure that the they are still working on it. But a patent that was discovered recently by PatentlyApple (yes, an Apple blog) shows that Microsoft at least considered building a Surface Phone at some point in the last months, and the included drawings provide us with a hint at what it looked like. Before getting into details, here’s one thing that needs to be mentioned: this is just a patent for the time being, and it’s no confirmation that this is the Surface Phone, although it does have some features that seem to point in this direction. For the moment, however, it’s safer to consider it a patent and nothing more. Design First and foremost, if you analyze these drawings closely, they show a phone that looks very similar to the traditional Lumia models launched by Nokia and then by Microsoft. The same Lumia design language is being used, without a physical home button and, surprisingly, without a camera button. Microsoft has always claimed that the physical camera button was more or less a signature feature of its phones, so seeing it removed from the Surface Phone would certainly be surprising. The back of the phone shows what seems to be a camera and flash, but no fingerprint sensor, so Microsoft would most likely continue investments in Windows Hello, which means that a dedicated camera would be placed on the front side of the device for authentication purposes. On the other hand, it’s also possible the Surface Phone to adopt a strategy that is currently on the table for both the iPhone 8 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 and integrate the fingerprint sensor into the display. Of course, this would be the most logical step given that Microsoft wants the Surface Phone to be a revolutionary device from the very beginning, but Windows Hello would undoubtedly be a key feature as well. Features As far as features are concerned, these patent drawings do not reveal much, but they do show that the phone could support USB Type-C, and this perfectly makes sense, since the latest Lumia models have the same connectivity port. There is no headphone jack, so Microsoft will probably use the Type-C port for audio as well, and this is a trend that more and more phone manufacturers seem to adopt these days. And last but not least, the phone features what seems to be a Surface Pen slot that once again makes sense for a device included in the Surface series. Obviously, the Phone would come with its own Surface Pen, as the existing design cannot be used on such a small device, so Microsoft would most likely go for an approach that’s more similar to the stylus used by Samsung on its Note series. The Surface Phone, if it ever sees daylight, could launch in the fall of 2017, and Microsoft has already started trial production with partner Pegatron .

      "text": "Microsoft Announces New Security Features Coming in Windows 10 Creators Update GO Redmond wants to provide firms with enhanced security Dec 7, 2016 07:10 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​The upcoming Creators Update will bring lots of improvements for Windows 10 devices, and now Microsoft is revealing that it’s paying particular attention to the security offered to businesses with this new release. In a lengthy blog post today, Microsoft provides an in-depth look at some of the security improvements in the next Windows 10 OS update, explaining that the company’s goal is to help IT admins “to better protect, defend and respond to threats on their networks and devices.” First and foremost, Microsoft will introduce new tweaks for the Windows Security Center (first launched in the Anniversary Update in August), so it will link to Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection as well. New actions and insights in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) will also be added in the Creators Update, and Microsoft says that this should help investigate and respond to network attacks. “With the Creators Update we will expand Windows Defender ATP sensors to detect threats that persist only in memory or kernel level exploits. This will enable IT administrators to monitor loaded drivers and in-memory activities, and to detect various patterns of injection, reflective loading, and in-memory modifications indicating potential kernel exploits,” Microsoft explains. UEFI improvements The Windows Defender ATP will also be updated with new post-infection tools, so IT admins will have more tools to isolate systems, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes. Microsoft will also debut a new UEFI conversation tool that will be integrated into management solutions such as the System Center Configuration Manager to ease the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10. “For those customers who have already provisioned modern Windows PCs that support UEFI but installed Windows 7 using legacy BIOS, converting a device to UEFI required an IT manager to repartition the disc and reconfigure the firmware. This meant they would need to physically touch each device in their enterprise,” the company said. The Windows 10 Creators Update will go live in the spring of 2017, and sources familiar with the matter said the target date is March with Windows 10 version 1607.",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft Official) Shown in the photo is the current Surface Book. Rumors claim that the Surface Book 2 is to be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in February 2017. \nAfter the Surface Book 2, Surface Pro 5, and the Surface Phone failed to make an appearance at last October's Microsoft event, the latest reports claim that the Redmond-based technology brand is finally unveiling the three devices early next year. \nPrior to the October event of Microsoft, there were speculations claiming that the company will be unveiling the said devices in the then upcoming event. As the three devices were not even mentioned at Microsoft's event, the latest reports now claim that the Surface Book 2, Surface Pro 5, and the Surface Phone will finally be unveiled in February next year. \nWhile the latest reports do not specify the date of the alleged reveal of the said products, it is suspected that the unveiling will happen at the annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) happening in Barcelona, Spain from Feb. 27 to March 2, 2017 as the Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Phone were earlier alleged to be revealed at the said event. \nMeanwhile, it is said that the upcoming Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5 will deliver impressive upgrades to their current versions. For one thing, it has been strongly rumored that the said Surface devices will pack the latest Intel processor, the Kaby Lake, which will not only improve the speed and performance of the Surface Book 2 and the Surface Pro 5 but will extend their battery life, too, in the event that it will really be the case. Advertisement \nIt is also alleged that the Surface Book 2 will boast of 3,840 x 2,160 screen resolution, making it capable of 4K video. Rumors also claim that it will come with virtual reality (VR) support and GeForce GTX 980M for its graphics processing unit (GPU). \nOn the other hand, the Surface Pro 5 is rumored to come with another screen size variant of 12.3-inch screen. Additionally, rumors claim that it will boast of AMOLED 4K video output and an improved battery and Surface Pen, which, allegedly , recharges automatically when it docked to the device. \nMeanwhile, although Microsoft has yet to confirm the existence of its first-ever Surface Phone, it is said that it will be the ultimate mobile device that will surely challenge the more popular smartphones of Apple and Samsung. \nRumors claim that the alleged Surface Phone will run on Qualcomm's newest Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip and will have the capacity to display full desktop applications, thanks to Microsoft's Continuum feature.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 specs rumors: More built-in storage and improved features with Kaby Lake",
      "text": "  \n(REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton) Surface Pro 5 is speculated to be pre-packed with Windows 10 Redstone 3. \nThe highly anticipated Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to get some major iteration improvements such as a bigger internal storage and the latest processing chip with all the benefits that come with it. \nAccording to reports , the higher-end model of the next Surface Pro might come with a 512 GB internal storage out-of-the-box while rumors are still persistent that Microsoft will not settle for anything less than Intel's Kaby Lake processors. \nWith the Kaby Lake chip comes a few more important improvements, especially since the Surface Pro is one of the most competitive lines of productivity-focused tablets in the market. A significantly enhanced computing speed and battery life are also expected to come because of the Kaby Lake. \nAlso, it will not be a problem for Surface Pro 5 to sport both the USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt 3 ports with Kaby Lake's help. USB 3.0 is capable of a 10 GB/s data transfer speed while a Thunderbolt 3 can go as fast as 40 GB/s. Advertisement \nAn excellent processing chip can pave the way for a 4K resolution display screen while being able to support or play back native 4K videos. But as the saying goes, Surface Pro fans can't have it all because it is quite impossible for the rig to support ultra high definition display yet since it is speculated to wear out the hardware. \nHowever, there are also reports that Surface Pro 5 might possibly ship the PixelSense display technology that was utilized in the Surface Studio and allows multi-point touch. \nAs an important accessory, the Surface Pen is expected to get its own enhancement through a wireless charging technology. On the other hand, it is also possible for Microsoft to produce a Surface Pro 5 with an on-screen fingerprint scanner. \nSurface Pro 5 is highly anticipated to come out-of-the-box with the Windows 10 Redstone 3. If that is Microsoft's plan, then Surface Pro fans cannot expect the Surface Pro 5 to be released until the spring of 2017.  ",

      "text": "Satya Nadella visits a high school in Kenya that has Internet service provide by TV White Spaces. Technology giant Microsoft is urging the Kenyan government to consider zero-rating data used in e-learning and delivery of e-learning content. In an op-ed published in today’s Standard, the company says the move will reduce cost of accessing educational content. The company noted that while access to devices could be raised, the cost of data in Africa remained prohibitively high for students.\nThe firm further urged the government to seek public private partnerships in the scaling up of digital education, with the view of reaching more users. In the article, Microsoft cited information published from a survey in this year’s Innovation Africa Summit held in September at Safari Park Hotel Nairobi. The survey stated that less than 30% of schools in Africa have implemented e-learning, and those which have done so, have found great difficulty.\nThis is despite 92% of government decision makers in the field of education across Africa believing that e-learning was important in improving education. While Africa’s e-learning market doubled between 2011 and 2016 to reach USD 513m, African ministers cited challenges such as limited funding for devices and a lack of stakeholder and teacher support. The firm further called for collaboration between various players in the development of content to be accessed using e-learning devices. The government was further urged to take up the role of educating teachers on the value of e-learning as well as seeking the best model for the delivery of e-learning content.\nMicrosoft has been using white spaces seeking to deliver internet access to the under served places in Kenya . In the article, the firm cited the case of Limpopo in South Africa, where government support has allowed the firm serve rural students. TV white spaces offer immense advantages in that signals can travel longer distances and in less developed areas. It also allows for the underutilized spectrum to be put to good use as a low-cost alternative for broadband.\nRead On Web → Microsoft Seeks Backing of Kenyan Government in Zero-rating Data used for E-learning \n",

      "text": "MojoMan0427 The latest Rogue One dlc is awful. No it isn't. It isn't groundbreaking, but it's good nonetheless. I like the Scarif Jungle Map. Infiltration has a better balance (two FPS to one space battle), than the Death Star multi level mode. They ahve also addess Cargo and Droid Run to the death star DLC so that's better as well. The best game mode is Extraction from the Outer Rim DLC, and I hope DICE will continue to add game modes to exisiting maps in the future whilst they make Battlefront 2. When it hits EA access the player base will explode and you will easy get another good year out of this game. Yes the criticism of the base game was valid, but if you are a Star Wars fan, for £25 and EA access you can have a really kick ass game now. Ok, time to get to level 100. \"You gotta do what you gotta do.\"",

      "text": "| Follow How to integrate Microsoft Teams with other apps Microsoft’s new collaboration is more than messaging—it’s a platform with three choices for integration into a work hub InfoWorld | Dec 7, 2016 Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nBack in the late 1990s, as instant messaging became popular, you could tell who’d been on what team by seeing which consumer IM tools they’d been using. Eventually, of course, everyone had an account on every service, and the first decision a new project team had to make was which IM tool it’d use for group chats. \nThat problem is back, as teams decide between collaboration platforms like Slack and HipChat. Now, of course, there’s Microsoft’s entry in the collaboration space: Teams . [ Office 365 is now ready to deploy across all your clients. InfoWorld shows you: How to make document sharing really work in Office 365 . • What works and what doesn’t in Office 365 collaboration • What works in Outlook on Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android . • How to migrate to Office 365 . ] \nMicrosoft’s recently released service builds on its existing Office 365 and Skype for Business framework to give you a way to handle ad hoc collaboration and chat in existing teams. Like Slack, it’s a free-form channel-based app where Office 365 accounts are used to control access to team discussions, with easy options for adding new Teams members and sharing common documents and information. Users can dip in and out of threaded conversations, and they can quickly receive notifications from colleagues, with the option of changing to real-time video and voice where necessary. \nAlthough an ad hoc channel for conversation is useful, it’s only part of the story. Teams can also bring other applications and services into one informal team-focused hub. Like Slack and HipChat, it can connect to external services, working with web standards to simplify the development and integration process. \nTeams offers three options for integration: tabs, cards, and bots. Teams integration option 1: Tabs \nTab-level integration brings an entire site or service into Teams. This approach works well where you need to work with significant amounts of information, like a Kanban board in an agile development process, a sales funnel for marketing, or a list of outstanding tickets for a support team. Pages are displayed in an iframe hosted in Teams, and although you’re unlikely to have to redesign your content for use in Teams, it’s worth considering what information needs to be displayed and how you want to lay it out for use inside a collaboration app. \nTab-level integrations are simple enough; all you need to do is create an appropriate manifest for your content, which you host as normal. A link to a configuration page is included with the manifest to help users choose options, and you’ll also need to bundle small and large icons for use inside Teams. Manifests are simple XML files, and the whole package is delivered as a Zip file and added to a Teams gallery in your Office 365 tenant. \nAuthentication for tabs is an issue, and although Microsoft encourages you to take advantage of Azure Active Directory to give users a simple single-sign-on experience, you can also work with third-party authenticators. These can be handled via Teams-specific markup that is parsed by mobile, desktop, and web Teams apps to create appropriate iframe-based pop-ups for user logins. \nBuilding apps into Teams tabs is a useful option, but if you want to get the benefits of the ad hoc nature of working with collaboration tooling, the other two options Microsoft offer make a lot more sense, allowing you to embed interactions directly in channels, either using cards to display information or via chatbots. Teams integration option 2: Cards \nAdding cards to Teams is easy enough, especially if you’ve been working with Office 365’s Groups feature and its application connectors. Microsoft makes it easy to reuse connectors between Groups and Teams. If you employ Groups for more formal team collaboration, the same connectors can quickly be repurposed as part of a channel in a team; for example, developers can quickly see the output from a test or a build running a continuous integration tool like Jenkins, or a sales team can get its latest pipeline information from Salesforce. If you can create a webhook, you can build a connector. \nWebhooks are a simple way of building asynchronous connections into web applications, offering an easier route to integration than using JavaScript-based callback functions. Teams currently offers support for incoming webhooks as part of a publish-and-subscribe mechanism. Teams subscribes to a webhook URL, and services use it to publish content wrapped as a JSON-formatted document. \nConnectors can be manually configured in Teams or delivered from the Office Store. The latter option allows you to preconfigure images and icons, as well as making them available to other collaborators. Manually configuring connectors is currently more complex, but can be handled with a set of basic online documentation and the URL of an appropriate webhook. \nPutting a JSON payload on a webhook is easy enough; there are plenty of libraries and toolkits that can be used to add functionality to existing apps. The JSON document can be constructed to include different sections, including formatting and links. To keep it simple, they’re constructed with the common Markdown formatting syntax, which makes building and managing content relatively easy. Once formatted, cards let users click on links and hit action buttons to access external content from inside Teams. Other options let you build card sections from lists of images and from simple key/value pairs. Teams integration option 3: Bots \nIf you want to go further, you can connect Teams to a bot built using Microsoft’s Bot Framework . This lets you take advantage of a range of cloud-hosted machine learning services for natural language parsing. Going from chat to actionable data is relatively easy, and users can interact with bots in Teams with text or images. \nWorking with bots lets you start incorporating Teams into a chat ops strategy; users can interact with services via chat in Teams channels—for example, creating and launching virtual machines or subscribing to services. \nBut chat is only one way of working with bots in Teams. The can also deliver a richer card experience, with more interaction options. If you don’t want to have a free-form chat approach to your bots, this interactive card approach could be the basis of a more structured set of interactions between a user in Teams and an external application. \nMicrosoft needs to make its Teams service as much of a platform as its competition. Although its key differentiator is its integration with the Office graph that’s built around Office 365 users and their content, it needs to offer access to other tools and services. Using web standards like webhooks and Markdown makes a lot of sense, giving organizations an on-ramp to Teams from other collaboration platforms.

These platforms have formulated a means of discouraging any content that promotes terrorism. \nThis will be done through the creation of a shared industry database of “hashes”, that is, unique digital fingerprints for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images. By sharing this information with each other, they will be able to identify potential terrorist content on their respective platforms. \nRead more at TheCable",

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter And Youtube To Remove 'Terrorist Content Published by Nairaland on Wed, 07 Dec 2016 Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube today announced they would cooperate on a plan to help limit the spread of terrorist content online. The companies said that together they will create a shared industry database that will be used to identify this content, including what they describe as the 'most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos' that have been removed from their respective services.Facebook describes how this database will work in an announcement in its newsroom. The content will be hashed using unique digital fingerprints, which is how its identification and removal can be handled more easily and efficiently by the company's computer systems and algorithms.Using a database of hashed images is the same way that organizations keep child pornography off their services. Essentially, a piece of content is given a unique identifier. If any copies of that file are analyzed, they will also produce this same hash value. Similar systems are also used to identify copyright-protected files.However, where this new project differs is that the terrorist images and videos will not be automatically removed when content is found to match something in the database. Instead, the individual companies will determine how and when content is removed based on their own policies, and how they choose to define terrorist content.That could quell claims of censorship, but, on the flip side, if the companies aren't quick to respond, it could mean the images and videos have a chance to circulate and be viewed before they're pulled down.Facebook also notes that personal information will not be shared, though it didn't say that this information is not collected. The government can still go through legal means to find out from which accounts the content originated, and other info as before. The companies will continue to make their own determinations about how they handle those government requests and when those requests are disclosed.The new database will be continually updated as the companies uncover new terrorist images or videos which can then be hashed and added to this shared resource.While the effort is beginning with the top social networks, the larger goal is to make this database available to other companies in the future, Facebook says.'We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,' states the post.Given the recent discussions about the spread of fake news on social media, one hopes this new collaboration could potentially pave a path for the companies working together on other initiatives going forward.The problem of false news also damages all of social media, and has raised questions about what role should the companies play in battling that content. There are some who would claim that these companies have no business being arbitrators of the news or what's right and wrong ' and companies themselves would be glad to be 'dumb' platforms, as well, in order to escape their responsibility in the matter.However, because of their outsized influence on today's web, these companies are beginning to wake up to the fact that they will be held accountable for the content shared on their platforms, given that content has the ability to influence everything from terrorist acts to how people perceive the world and even politics on a global scale.http://www.firmtech1.com/2016/12/yes-facebook-microsoft-twitter-and.html'm=0",

      "text": "Microsoft Researchers Offer Predictions For AI, Deep Learning Published by Slashdot on Wed, 07 Dec 2016 An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Microsoft polled 17 women working in its research organization about the technology advances they expect to see in 2017, as well as a decade later in 2027. The researchers' predictions touch on natural language processing, machine learning, agricultural software, and virtual reality, among other topics. For virtual reality, Mar Gonzalez Franco, a researcher in Microsoft's Redmond lab, believes body tracking will improve next year, and then over the next decade we'll have \"rich multi-sensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceives reality.\" Haptic devices will simulate touch to further enhance the sensory experience. Meanwhile, Susan Dumais, a scientist and deputy managing director at the Redmond lab, believes deep learning will help improve web search results next year. In 2027, however, the search box will disappear, she says. It'll be replaced by search that's more \"ubiquitous, embedded, and contextually sensitive.\" She says we're already seeing some of this in voice-controlled searches through mobile and smart home devices. We might eventually be able to look things up with either sound, images, or video. Plus, our searches will respond to \"current location, content, entities, and activities\" without us explicitly mentioning them, she says. Of course, it's worth noting that Microsoft has been losing the search box war to Google, so it isn't surprising that the company thinks search will die. With global warming as a looming threat, Asta Roseway, principal research designer, says by 2027 famers will use AI to maintain healthy crop yields, even with \"climate change, drought, and disaster.\" Low-energy farming solutions, like vertical farming and aquaponics, will also be essential to keeping the food supply high, she says.

The upcoming Surface Book 2 is supposed to compete against Apple's new MacBook Pro. But the Surface Pro 5 will likely be a better comparison. The tech company is set to release the new Surface Pro next year with a major storage and battery upgrade. \nAccording to BGR , the new Surface Pro will be powered by the next-gen Intel Kaby Lake processors. Aside from an improvement in its performance, the device will have more storage and RAM. Microsoft will be rolling out a 2-in-1 Surface Pro 5 with a whopping 512GB of storage. Its Surface Pen stylus will be capable of wireless charging via the magnetic dock. It is a change from the previous Surface Pen that has a replaceable battery. \nOther specs upgrades include support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C ports. It is said to include a microSD slot, as well as a 3.5 mm audio jack. The Surface Pro 5 will probably have a better display and a fingerprint sensor. Furthermore, the hybrid device should run on Microsoft's other major update on Windows 10, the Redstone 3 out of the box, according to Bitbag . It is expected to have a 2K display with a 3860 x 2560 resolution. The bigger battery should be able to make it last around seven hours of use, according to Telegiz . \nUnless the Surface Book 2 will be as powerful as the Surface Pro 5, the 2-in-1 will be a better choice for those who are not a fan of the new MacBook Pro. The price is expected to be about $2,000. It will be a lot expensive than the Surface Pro 4 that costs $899. \nMicrosoft is yet to announce more details about the Surface Pro 5. The new device should hit the market in Spring 2017. It might be launched alongside the Surface Phone and Surface Book 2. Though other reports suggest that it will be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress 2017 event. \nIt should be noted that the 2017 date is not the initial planned release. Apparently, Microsoft was waiting for the Intel Kaby Lake processors. However, the next-gen Intel processor will not be available by December. The Surface Pro 4 is only powered by an Intel i7 processor. The Surface Pro 5 will surpass that. Hence, expect a more powerful device for Windows 10 users. ",

      "text": "Microsoft's director of program management, Windows Enterprise and Security Rob Lefferts, highlighted security related changes and improvements coming to the Windows 10 Creators Update due out in March 2017 recently in a blog post.\nMicrosoft focused on consumers for the most part when it revealed the Windows 10 Creators Update a couple of weeks ago.\nThis time, it focuses on what the future update for Windows 10 will bring to IT departments and the Enterprise, and here specifically IT security.\nThis does not mean that consumer editions of Windows 10 won't receive any security updates or features. The focus of the announcement however is Enterprise, and as such describes features that are limited to Enterprise customers for the most part.\nWindows 10 Creators Update IT Security improvements \nThe Windows Security Center portal , released in the Anniversary Update, integrates Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection through the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph. New actions and insights in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) : Enriched Detection to cover threats that persist only in memory or kernel level exploits. Enriched Intelligence to integrate custom indicators for alerts. Enhanced Remediation that allow IT administrators to \"isolate machines, collect forensic evidence, kill and clean running processes, and quarantine or block files\" with a single click in Windows Security Center. Additional resources are added to the Windows Analytics dashboard . This enables organizations to use their own telemetry data \"to provide new insights\". I n-place UEFI conversion . Microsoft plans to release a simple conversion tool that is integrated in the System Center Configuration Manager as part of the Windows 7 to 10 in-place upgrade process. Mobile application management. A new option to protect data on personal devices without enrolling devices in a mobile device management solution. \"As employees use their own devices at work more and more, we are providing IT with oversight to apply policies to the applications employees use to be productive.\" Windows as a service. Differential downloads are coming for mobile and PC devices to reduce the size of updates by approximately 35% according to Microsoft. System Center Configuration Manager express updates will be reduced by up to 90% as well. \nIt is still too early to judge the features, but from the looks of it, they may improve IT administration quite a bit when it comes to security.\nYou can check out the blog post for additional information and links that direct you to resources covering some of the mentioned products.\nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 emerging as option for Windows 10 MacBook Pro By Brian Ang Dec 07, 2016 05:30 AM EST A man passes a Microsoft office in New York on October 6, 2015. Microsoft introduced a pair of big-screen smartphones and a laptop during an event in New York on Tuesday. The company unveiled the Surface Book, a laptop with 13.5-inch detachable touchscreen, the Surface Pro 4 tablet and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL smartphones, which feature displays measuring over 5 inches. The Surface devices launch later this month, while the Lumias arrive in November. AFP PHOTO/JEWEL SAMAD / AFP / JEWEL SAMAD (Photo credit should read JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images) Advertisement \nWhile Apple has always taken the high ground when it comes to laptops, Microsoft is fast creeping its way up as the other alternative among efficient and convenient computer machines. The Redmond-based tech company has been patient in coming up with a highly-enhanced product. \nMicrosoft is coming out with its Surface Pro 5 brand that is likely to be loaded with more memory storage, higher RAM and an efficient next-generation Kaby Lake processor. Considering that Microsoft has pitted its items against Apple units, the Pro model will be no different. \nJudging from its capability to run Windows 10, this Surface model gets to be compared against the upcoming MacBook Pro which also carries a similar system. Having a small and light frame makes the Pro 5 even more enticing. \nReports reveal that the Surface unit contains a huge 512GB memory storage . More than that, battery sufficiency and functional performance are even better compared to the previous units. \nIts Surface Pen has also been improved. Through a magnetic port, the stylus can be charged wirelessly. \nNotable enhancements also include the presence of USB Type-C docks and Thunderbolt 3 accommodation. In addition, the 2-in-1 Surface Pro 5 laptop has an upgraded display surface with a fingerprint sensor underneath the screen. Advertisement \nIt is also perceived that the Pro 5 will have an improved PixelSense system. With the Kaby Lake video support in place, it is probable that this laptop will carry a 4K resolution. \nAlthough Microsoft's new laptop seems to follow the design of its predecessors, the tech group has instituted a fresh and engaging outlook into the machine. A couple of essential upgrades are introduced here. \nPrimarily, the Pro 5's battery life has been extended up to 16 hours. Aside from the power cell space, a re-engineered cooling system has been added. Second, the entry of the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU has further bolstered the graphics efficiency of the computer. Overall, Microsoft's unit is all about sustaining power and performance.",

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, YouTube Must Do More to Combat Hate Speech, Says EU \nInternet giants Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are not doing enough to fight online hate speech despite \"moving in the right direction\", the European Commission said on Tuesday. \nAll four signed an EU code of conduct in May aimed at combatting Internet hate speech. \n\"It is our duty to protect people in Europe from incitement to hatred and violence online,\" European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Vera Jourova said. \n( Also see: Web Giants to Cooperate on Removal of Extremist Content ) \n\"This is the common goal of the code of conduct. The last weeks and months have shown that social media companies need to live up to their important role and take up their share of responsibility when it comes to phenomena like online radicalisation, illegal hate speech or fake news . \"While IT Companies are moving in the right direction, the first results show that the IT companies will need to do more to make it a success.\"\nThe four IT companies had committed to review notifications of potential hate speech within 24 hours. \nBut the Commission noted in a report published on Tuesday that among 600 notifications made, only 28 percent led to the removal of content while just 40 percent were treated within 24 hours. \n( Also see: Curbs on Extremist Online Content Threatens Free Speech, Say Tech Firms ) \nAnother 43 percent were reviewed in under 48 hours. \nThe notifications were sent to the IT companies by a group of 12 NGOs from nine different countries who analysed notification responses over a six week period. \nYouTube reviewed notifications within 24 hours on more than 60 percent of cases while Twitter managed that on just 23 percent. \nYouTube was also most active in removing content on 48 percent of cases compared to Twitter's 19 percent. \nFacebook reviewed 50 percent of cases within a day and removed content on 28 percent of notifications. Microsoft did not receive any notifications.",

      "text": "Microsoft, Cray claim deep learning breakthrough on supercomputers Project could allow larger and more complex deep learning workloads on supercomputers. | Topic: Data Centers Image: Cray \nA team of researchers from Microsoft, Cray, and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) have been working on a project to speed up the use of deep learning algorithms on supercomputers . \nThe team have scaled the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit -- an open-source suite that trains deep learning algorithms -- to more than 1,000 Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU accelerators on the Swiss centre's Cray XC50 supercomputer, which is nicknamed Piz Daint . Read More \nThe project could allow researchers to run larger, more complex, and multi-layered deep learning workloads at scale on the supercomputers, Cray said. \nDeep learning is an emerging branch of machine learning, which uses multiple processing layers to work on complicated problems. And while researchers want to run larger deep-learning models, conventional systems and architectures limit the problems that can be addressed, as models take too long to train. \nBut by accelerating the training process, instead of waiting weeks or months for results, data scientists can obtain results within hours or even minutes. This could help researchers tackle new computing problems like stepping up from image recognition to video recognition, or from speech recognition to natural language processing with context. \nCray said that deep learning problems share algorithmic similarities with applications traditionally run on a massively parallel supercomputer, and that by optimizing inter-node communication each training job can leverage significantly more compute resources, reducing the time required to train an individual model. \nProfessor Thomas Schulthess, director of the Swiss supercomputing centre, said the work meant researchers and scientists will be able to use their existing Cray XC supercomputer to take on a new class of deep learning problems \"that were previously infeasible\".

      "text": "Comments VIRTUAL reality technology will soon be so powerful that it will cause drug-like hallucinations, Microsoft has predicted. \nOne of the tech firm’s top researchers said VR would be able to warp reality and catapult users into a new world. AP:Associated Press This is how billions of people may soon spend their time News Group Newspapers Ltd 3 The Prince of Wales wearing Virtual Reality Goggles \nIn the golden age of the 1960s, psychedelic adventurers used LSD to produce a similar effect, often getting naked and enjoying unabashed sex soundtracked by by some of the best music ever written. \nBut anyone looking to trip out on virtual reality will probably do so alone in their room, wearing a helmet and unlikely to be touched by another human being. \nMar Gonzalez Franco, a researcher at Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters, said: “By 2027 we will have ubiquitous virtual reality systems that will provide such rich multisensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceived reality. \n“Using this technology, humans will retrain, recalibrate and improve their perceptual systems.” \nThe technology will also be refined to incorporate “haptic” systems, which simulate touching or being touched. Cheap thrill … these LSD tabs can be sold for as little as 50p \n\nFranco added: “In contrast to current virtual reality systems that only stimulate visual and auditory senses, in the future the experience will expand to other sensory modalities including tactile with haptic devices.” \nThe tech expert was speaking out as part of a project which quizzed Microsoft’s female employees about their predictions for the future. \nMost of them said artificial intelligence would play a greater role in our lives, bossing us about and saving us from making “sub optimal decisions”. \nIf you think that sounds pretty miserable, wait until you hear what we’ll be doing instead of working.

Subscribe Are Snapchat Spectacles The New Air Jordans? \nWhile some people are focused on Microsoft's mobile ambitions with Windows 10 hardware, the real prize lies elsewhere. Microsoft is in a far better position to capture the cloud crown than fight for a foothold in the mobile OS market share charts. \nResponding to questions at Microsoft's recent shareholder meeting , CEO Satya Nadella stressed that the focus for Windows 10 Mobile will be on the points where it can stand apart from the crowd such as security and the capability of Continuum to allow the phone to act as a 'base' computer with external keyboards, mice, and monitors. \nThe question asked specifically about Windows 10 on mobile, and the answer focused on Microsoft's hardware-based solutions. If Microsoft was to consider that mobile is just about hardware and producing a standalone 'killer smartphone' on its own, it would lose. That's a strategy to fight the last technology war - one in which Microsoft did create a stunning mobile operating system coupled with hardware across a wide portfolio. We all know how that turned out. \nNadella's focus is on the next war - once where there is no differentiation between using a mobile device, a desk-bound computer and everything in-between. All of these devices require connective digital tissue to create a seamless user experience. That tissue is the cloud, and that's the war that Microsoft is focused on, not phones. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (image: Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) \nJust as Microsoft had dominance with Windows on PCs, Google has dominance with Android on mobile devices. Microsoft's goal is not to somehow replace Android in the marketplace, but to sit on top of the Android software stack and find value there. \nIt's the same strategy that many cloud-based providers are looking to implement - including Google's own play with individual Google accounts that can sit on top of the Android OS. Get a user into your cloud and they will potentially stay with that cloud even if they change devices. How many Google users carry iPhones but still work with Gmail. Google Maps, Google Calendar and Google Music? Although the traffic in the other direction is smaller, iCloud users can work with their calendars and mail on Android, alongside services such as Apple Music. \nThis is where Nadella is taking Microsoft, and rightly so. This is why the mobile version of Outlook is available for Android and iOS as well as on Window 10 mobile. This is why Office 365 has clients for all the major computing platforms, both mobile and on the desk. This is why OneNote can allow you to take notes on any device and read them on any other device. \nIt's an area where Microsoft has a strong skill set, has an attractive offering, and has a clear path towards sustainability and ongoing relevancy with the digital ecosystem. Microsoft advertises OneNote's cloud capability (image: Microsoft.com) \nMicrosoft will return to the mobile hardware game during 2017 - there is far too much momentum building up around the Surface Phone that its non-appearance would be a bigger story than the moment it is revealed. When that reveal does happen there is going to be a lot of focus on Microsoft's renewed ambitions both in hardware (with the actual device) and the use of Windows 10 as a smartphone operating system. \nJust remember that the real value in the mobile space is a little bit higher up the software stack. It's not who has mastered the hardware or the OS markets, it's about who has the strongest cloud, who has the confidence of the users, who can make a seamless environment so everyone can live in a connected world.

      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Samsung, Apple Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Samsung, Apple 3 \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Surface Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Mary Smith Dec 06, 2016 10 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Samsung, Apple ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft With New ‘Snapdragon RAM Processor’ Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft With New ‘Snapdragon RAM Processor’ 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "10 Comments There is only one reason a big company like Microsoft would try (again!) to launch an AI bot: to sell you stuff. \nMicrosoft has unveiled a new chatbot named Zo , but this time, she's available on Kik, instead of Twitter, where earlier this year, her predecessor—known as Tay—went on a rather racist tirade before being shut down . I've never heard a clear explanation as to why Microsoft is making chatbots, and I have to assume the worst: They are on track to deliver ads. \nIf you ever spend time on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), you run into these bot things all the time. Their purpose is to get you to visit various porn sites, which has got to be incredibly lame if you think about it. Why not instead put chatbots in place to get you to read an article in the Seattle Times ? Or lure you into listening to a specific podcast? Or sell you toothpaste? \nA lot of machines have been compromised by various spam mechanisms to send out everything from email to DDoS attacks while you sleep . Much of this is illicit and illegal. But chatbots have never been declared illegal; antispam legislation targets only email systems. \nSo anyone could develop servers that would \"attack\" an interactive chatroom or forum and deliver targeted advertising. It wouldn't have to be just for porn or of the normal spammy crap such as fen-phen or cheap Viagra. \nAny given network on the IRC has hundreds of channels. Generally speaking, there are around 20,000 users on any one network. According to the IRC Wiki page, the top 100 networks serve about half a million users at any point in time. Unless there is some serious throttling, a bot could solicit everyone there instantly with a message to buy Crest toothpaste. \nMost of the networks ban bots, but a good bot is indistinguishable from a person if correctly employed. I am sure that the developer will get caught because soliciting people one at a time probably shows up on some virtual bot scanner. \nBut come back later using a different name. If the IP is logged as a spammer, use a VPN service offering thousands of IP addresses. \nThere is some sort of lash-up like this working on Skype, but again, it is porn-oriented. I use Skype a few times a week to do a couple of different podcasts and each time I load it I find a number of unsolicited messages. I ban them out of hand, but did check in with one of them to see why I was being pestered. Indeed it was a bot",

      "text": "• Just Dance Disney Party 2• Rainbow Six Siege• Watch Dogs \nMicrosoft's 12 Days of Deals kicked off on Dec. 5. On Dec. 7 Microsoft aims to offer several games at 50 percent off, so that's a great time to seek out some of the best games on the Xbox One you couldn't afford to purchase at full price. \nGames such as Battlefield 1 , Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Recore are some of the few titles set to get a huge slash in price for a limited time. \nCome Dec. 11, Microsoft plans to cut the cost of the Xbox One down to $180. Bear in mind that this is the original Xbox One and not the newer version, the Xbox One S. Microsoft seems to be clearing out its inventory and may very well discontinue the original model to make room for the Xbox One S. \nMicrosoft shared a lot of information regarding the deal on its official blog . \nWhile Microsoft is busy working on its gaming deals, Sony has decided to rock the gaming world with the announcement of The Last of Us 2 and other cool titles at PlayStation Experience 2016, including Uncharted: The Lost Legacy and PaRappa the Rapper . \nAll games announced at PlayStation Experience are expected to support Checkerboard 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, while a handful will likely support HDR for more vibrant colors.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Phone Will Replace The PC And Is Set To Be The Ultimate Mobile Device",
      "text": "Nikki Valenzuela \nBoth the iPhone and the Galaxy have been dominating the mobile phone realm for quite some time now. But now, tech giant Microsoft is setting to challenge them as the Surface Phone is said to have the functionality of a PC and is set on becoming the ultimate gaming device. \nAccording to Forbes , the Surface phone will offer users something truly unique and will try to further blur the lines between a personal computer and a mobile phone. Microsoft’s own Satya Nadella had a lot to say about the Surface Phone as he spoke with to the Australian Financial Review . \n“We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device. Therefore we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.” \nFurthermore, the Microsoft Surface Phone is going to try something that has not yet been done. And that is the Windows 10 Mobile of the Surface Phone is going the route of accepting peripherals built for PCs. According to the CEO of Microsoft, the surface phone will have the feature called Continuum which is essentially something that can turn a mobile device into a PC and allows the user to connect peripherals like a mouse and a keyboard. The continuum feature can effectively mimic apps in the Surface Phone to appear as if the were used on a Windows 10 machine. Features to Expect from the New #Microsoft Surface Phone Series. They'll be much better than Lumia & Window Phones https://t.co/p6H7VxHn9T pic.twitter.com/JQ3DKeb0Vk \n— Pinchas Emerson (@CodeLucid) November 28, 2016 \nIf this turns out to be real, then the Surface Phone is already a sure fire game changer. If the Surface Phone does indeed become part of a seamless ecosystem of mobile phones and PC’s then the phone can give its rivals a run for their money. If leaks of Surface Phone specs are right, then the phone does indeed have the muscle to do this mammoth task. \nAccording to Trusted Reviews , the Surface phone could be unveiled early in 2007 and released in the same year. The Surface Phone is said to boast Qualcomm’s latest SnapDragon 835 Chipset. It is also rumored that the Surface Phone will come in three variants which are a 3 gig RAM with 32 GB storage, 6 gig RAM with 128 GB storage, and a beefy Surface Phone with an 8 gig RAM with a whopping 500 GB memory. This makes sense as Microsoft is attempting to lure high powered business users with the Surface Phone. \n— BOBYMBOB (@BobySPutra) November 27, 2016 \nThe Surface Phone will also focus on a service similar to Apple pay called the Microsoft Wallet. This seems like a good move from Microsoft as a lot of major phone makers are going this route and people should not expect less of the Surface Phone. Leaks have also placed the Surface Phone to have a 5.7-inch screen size. Additionally, the Surface Phone is rumored to feature an all-metal body which will be similar to what rivals Samsung and Apple is doing right now. \nThe Surface Pro is definitely looking to change the smartphone game by going big. It will try to make rivals quake with the might of the Surface Phone’s specs which is a similar tactic that they are employing with the Surface PC and tablet line. A lot of fans should definitely hold off on their smartphone purchases and wait until Microsoft releases the Surface Phone to really see what it has to offer. If the Surface Phone can indeed replace the PC, then it might just be worth the wait. \n[Featured Image by Richard Drew/AP Images]",

      "title": "Microsoft says virtual reality could make you HALLUCINATE like LSD",
      "text": "Share this article Share Ms Gonzalez Franco said: ‘By 2027 we will have ubiquitous virtual reality systems that will provide such rich multisensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceived reality. ‘Using this technology, humans will retrain, recalibrate and improve their perceptual systems. Advances such as improved haptic feedback and tracking of body movements emerge, virtual reality will be a multisensory experience, rather than just audio-visual, leading to hallucinations (stock image) COULD VR CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS? A researcher at Microsoft claims that by 2027, virtual reality could lead to hallucinations which ‘blend or alter’ our reality. Advances such as improved haptic feedback and tracking of body movements emerge, virtual reality will be a multisensory experience, rather than just audio-visual, leading to hallucinations. ‘In contrast to current virtual reality systems that only stimulate visual and auditory senses, in the future the experience will expand to other sensory modalities including tactile with haptic devices.’ Focusing on the near future, she also provided an insight into what we can expect next year. ‘In 2017 we will see the emergence of virtual reality devices that feature better body tracking. ‘A positive outcome of this will be the ability to experience embodiment of virtual avatars from a first-person perspective.’ Virtual reality has already made the link with the psychedelic drug-culture of the 1960s. Earlier this year, one firm tried to recreate the effect of LSD through HTV headsets, flooding the wearer’s vision with colours and shapes to virtually mimic the effects of the drug. But despite the free-love, bongo-bashing vibe of VR-induced hallucinations, reactions from other Microsoft researchers involved in the project may be set to harsh your mellow. They predict that as artificial intelligence improves, it will continue to harness data from every aspect of our lives. Read more:",

      "title": "Teaming up against terrorism, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter enter officially the…",
      "text": "Teaming up against terrorism, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter enter officially the political sphere In a soft public statement , four of the top tech companies in the world — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google — announced Today that they will partner in order to contrast the spread of extremist content on their platforms. In other terms: they are officially entering politics. Holding more capital than many leading Countries, the three companies have means to make an impact. Moreover, free from any political decision making system and bureacratic burden, they can put immediately in practice their intents. Finally, what is even more important after Today’s statement, “Fighting terrorisms” is one of the major concern for citizens (accordingly to polls held during the French primaires de droite in November, it is the priority n°1 ,) and a key point of the agenda of the Country these companies are based in, US. By announcing they will do something about it, they enter the political sphere: although it would be naif to claim they have been completely apart from it so far, it is the first time they are constituting an alliance and putting together concrete measures to tackle a challenge with so many political implications.\nThe pace of the application of this new shared program about ‘dangerous content’ is rocket science compared to the classic political institutions one: the European Commission started discussing it last year at the EU Internet Forum, and no conclusion has been made official. The Forum seems to involve only industry representatives, excluding civil society representatives and leaving unanswered transparency requests of civil and human rights organisations such as EDRi, prompting an Ombudsman investigation on EU Internet Forum .\nFighting terrorist content is certainly a good cause: social media and the Web played a major role in spreading extreme messages and enrolling new people to the Islamic State cause. But as much as they helped the ‘evil’ part, they also contributed to mobilise people for good causes. The argument is not new: the medium has few responsibilities in front of how people actually use it. Telegram encryption system made impossible to the police to detected Bataclan’s terrorists conversations, but I am still happy I can communicate with the people I care through a truly private application. We are in front of two opposite ethics scenarios, one of complete relativism , where media are just a medium that can’t be controlled in a centralised way without cutting liberty, and consequently these companies should do nothing — or as less as possible — about ‘terrorism’. But this is utopia for the time being, because the second, control through centralisation , is already happening. These companies will elaborate algorithms and launch new departments in charge of terrorisms, and most probably governments will force them to share these data. As much as the European Commission is teaming up with private companies in tackling terrorism, single states initiatives — such as the new UK law about personal data surveillance going under the name of Snoopers’ Charter  — get more pervasives, setting the scene for a new phase. If so far Google collected your data for commercial purposes (direct ones, positioning of ads, but also more subtile ones, like demographics), now it is officially gaining a censorship power over them, with the blessing of the State, which is doing the same on its side.\nWho is entitled to define ‘extremist content’? The task can be differently interpreted by the politicians we voted for, and surely we wouldn’t want some tech companies to do that. We already seen what happened a few months ago, when Facebook censored the famous picture of the girl running away from Napalm bombing because it violated its standards about nudity. We would tend to answer that defining extreme content is common sense, but to common sense (as we “commonly” intend it) most of the claims that make successful Trump or Marine Le Pen are extremists.\nI suspect efforts to limit the widespread of certain messages can not only be superficial (information always find a way, and big tech companies have still a long way to go before controlling the Deep Web as much as they control the Web), but also dangerous now that the biggest companies of the world are sharing data (the biggest currency) among themselves and putting into practice their own definition of good and evil.",

      "text": "  This session shows you how you can use Microsoft Azure to build a high-scalable solution for event-processing. You can use this approach for classical IoT-scenarios or if you want for example to capture telemetry-data of a widely distributed application. Then each application-instance will send data to Azure’s Event Hub. In this session you will not only get some insights into the Event Hub, but also into Stream Analytics. Stream Analytics is used to aggregate the millions of events coming from the Event Hub by using a SQL-like syntax. From Stream Analytics the data can be pushed into a database or for example into a Live Dashboard in Microsoft’s Power BI. ...",

      "text": "Translate \nThe European Union has given the green light to Microsoft’s acquisition of professional social networking site LinkedIn. \nThe Redmond firm has also received clearance from the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, handing the software giant all of the regulatory approvals it needs to complete the $26-billion transaction. \nThe EU’s regulatory arm, the European Commission, approved the deal this week, but only after Microsoft made a handful of minor concessions that protect competition between professional social networks in Europe. Brad Smith \n“As part of our discussions with the European Commission, we formalized several commitments regarding Microsoft’s support for third-party professional social networking services,” Microsoft chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in a blog post .“With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future.” \nMicrosoft promised the European Commission it would: Give its rivals access to its Office add-ins program, enabling developers to integrate their services into Microsoft Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel. As improvements are made to the program, the improvements will be available to third-party professional social networking services as well. Make promotional opportunities in the Office Store available to third-party professional social networking services. Ensure IT administrators and users can customize their Office experience by choosing if they wish to display in the user interface the LinkedIn profile and activity information that may be integrated in the future. Not force PC manufacturers to install any future LinkedIn application or tile created for Windows PCs. Users would also be able to uninstall the application if they wish. Not enter into agreements with European PC manufacturers for pre-installation of a Windows LinkedIn application or tile that would favor LinkedIn on an exclusive basis. \nCommissioner Margrethe Vestager said Microsoft’s concessions addressed all of the EU’s concerns. \n“A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks,” Vestager said in a press release. “These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today’s decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks.” \nThe European Commission’s decision to give the Microsft-LinkedIn deal the go-ahead will not make Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff happy. Benioff had been pushing for an official investigation into the proposed acquisition and advised regulators to block the deal. Benioff’s company, which also tried to acquire the professional social networking firm, has been one of the most outspoken parties against the transaction. Salesforce has been adamant that it and other rivals would not be given access to LinkedIn’s dataset of users. \nSalesforce’s concerns were obviously not shared by the European Commission, however, and may have been viewed as sour grapes for losing out to Microsoft on the deal. \nWith the last of the regulatory approvals under its belt, the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal will close “in the coming days,” Smith said. \n“With the combination of Microsoft and LinkedIn, we can take new steps to help people learn added skills and seek better jobs,” Smith wrote. “We readily recognize that no single company can come close to solving the many economic challenges that confront the world today. Perhaps more than anything else, governments will need to continue to innovate across a wide array of education, training and labor policies. And across the private and public sectors, we all will need to come together and act with a sense of shared responsibility. There’s no shortage of work – or opportunity – ahead of us.” \nJennifer Cowan is the Managing Editor for SiteProNews. Related Posts",

      "text": "\nWhile there are still more questions than answers about what Project Scorpio is going to bring to the table in the form of the next Xbox console, Microsoft says developers who have gotten their hands on the device have had positive things to say about it’s performance.\nAusgamers recently talked to Xbox’s Aaron Greenberg about what people have been saying to him when they’ve managed to see the console. Among other things, he said the reports back have been overwhelmingly positive.\n“We’ve put that into the hands of the developers and it’ll be exciting to see what they create but being able to have that ‘runway’ and being able to work with them so far in advance… I think gamers are going to be really, really pleased with what comes out [of Project Scorpio].”\nThat seems to mesh with what at least one developer said about Scorpio. That dev said he thought Scorpio would make the current consoles definitely feel like they were last generation.",

      "text": "( ANTIWAR ) According to a new statement by Facebook, they have joined with YouTube, Microsoft, and Twitter to create a shared database of “terrorist content” which they can all jointly use to identify further attempts to post such banned content. The database will create hashes of videos and images that they’ve already decided are related to terrorism, and then will allow them to single out any further content matching those hatches. Facebook says this will allow them to more quickly remove such content.\nThe move is an attempt to react to US government demands to “do something” against terrorist propaganda, with the companies apparently hoping that the voluntary crackdown will be enough to stave off any formal government efforts to regulate them.\nIt’s unclear exactly what the scope of this program is going to end up being, and how broadly defined “terrorist propaganda” will be. Company offiicals are downplaying concerns of censorship, however, insisting that they have to act quickly to take such content down so no one sees it.",

      "text": "Big Data Microsoft partners with Cray to run deep learning algorithms on supercomputers Microsoft and Cray recently unveiled a collaborative work scaling the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit to run on a Cray XC50 supercomputer, getting results faster then before. By Conner Forrest | December 7, 2016, 7:05 AM PST Google Plus Image: Cray \nThe latest collaboration between Microsoft and Cray could dramatically lessen the time it takes data scientists to train and run data models that play into deep learning technologies. On Wednesday, at the 2016 Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Conference in Spain, the two companies showed off their latest supercomputing work in broadening the usefulness and scale of deep learning algorithms. \nAccording to a press release announcing the combined work, the premise for the partnership came from the idea that conventional systems and architectures in deep learning take too long to train, and thus limit what can be accomplished with them. \nTo address the challenge, Microsoft and Cray teamed up, alongside the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), to explore how they could use supercomputing to expand deep learning. The result is that the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit was scaled to work on a Cray XC50 supercomputer, nicknamed \"Piz Daint,\" that resides at the at CSCS. \nSEE: IBM, NVIDIA partner for 'fastest deep learning enterprise solution' in the world \nThe end result is that the time it takes to get actual results from deep learning algorithms is shortened dramatically. According to the release, the combined efforts can get results to data scientists in minutes or hours instead of weeks or months. \n\"With the introduction of supercomputing architectures and technologies to deep learning frameworks, customers now have the ability to solve a whole new class of problems, such as moving from image recognition to video recognition, and from simple speech recognition to natural language processing with context,\" the release stated. More about Big Data Hiring kit: Microsoft Power BI developer \nThe reason this seems to work is because deep learning problems share similarities, on an algorithmic level, with some of the applications that are typically reserved for supercomputers like the Cray XC50. And, because of the increased compute resources available to the deep learning models, they are able to be trained at a much more rapid pace. \n\"What is most exciting is that our researchers and scientists will now be able to use our existing Cray XC supercomputer to take on a new class of deep learning problems that were previously infeasible,\" Thomas C. Schulthess, director of the CSCS, said in the press release. \nThe Cray supercomputer on which the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit was scaled to run had 1,000 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators. In addition to speeding up traditional deep learning processes, the collaboration also opens up options for more complex and in-depth deep learning workloads in the future, the release said. \nIn order to further support deep learning in supercomputing, Cray is supporting customers of its Cray XC series with deep learning toolkits, like the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit that was used in this collaboration. \n\"We are working to unlock possibilities around new approaches and model sizes, turning the dreams and theories of scientists into something real that they can explore.\" Mark S. Staveley, Cray's director of deep learning and machine learning, said in the press release. \nIn August, similar work began taking place at nonprofit   research company OpenAI. The company, backed by Elon Musk, became the first customer of the Nvidia DGX-1 , which is billed as the \"world's first deep learning supercomputer in a box,\" and could help accelerate Open AI's research. The 3 big takeaways   Microsoft and Cray have partnered to run the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit on a Cray XC50 supercomputer, to speed up training and running the data models that impact deep learning technologies. The Cray computer resides at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and runs 1,000 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators. The use of deep learning algorithms on supercomputers can speed up traditional deep learning workloads, and opens up possibilities for more complex workloads in the future.

      "title": "Microsoft gains EU approval for $26 billion buy of LinkedIn",
      "text": "  \nMicrosoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signaled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in program, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs. \nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. \nU.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard. \n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement.

Last, Microsoft must let rival networks access the Microsoft Graph for mining data. The U.S. has already approved the transaction, which can now move forward.",

      "title": "'Crackdown 3' Release Leaked On Stream: Sequel Could Be A Scorpio Launch Title",
      "text": "PS4 Pro Vs Xbox Scorpio: Microsoft Confirms Native 4K, Not Upscaling, For New Console Games \nThe Crackdown team may have revealed some important info, such as a release window and resolution, while streaming on Twitch . Thanks to NeoGAF user Chris1 , those tidbits of information have been saved for all to see. \nIn the first clip, we can see the development team sitting around playing WWE 2K17 and answering fan questions. When reading out the question “Are we looking for holiday 2017 for Crackdown release?” the team answered with “Yeah, or sooner.” \nWhile this isn’t a definite release date, we can probably expect to see Crackdown 3 between September and December of 2017. Seeing as how we also know the Xbox Scorpio will release in the 2017 holiday season, this could put Crackdown 3 as a launch title for the device. Game development can be troublesome, so this could get delayed further depending on how things go. \nIn the second clip, a developer read the question “4K on Scorpio?” This was answered with a thumbs up and the word “Check.” It’s not too surprising that a Microsoft-owned game would take the most advantage of the latest Microsoft console, but it still is exciting to know that Crackdown 3 will be in 4K on the Scorpio. This isn’t a confirmation for resolution on Xbox One, but probably means 4K support will be available for those gaming on an Xbox One S . \nSo what do you think? Are you still interested in Crackdown 3 ? Will you be getting a Scorpio, or are you waiting to hear more information on it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below. ",

Starting December 11, Sony will sell the Uncharted 4 PS4 Slim bundle for only $250 in the United States. That's the same price that the system was offered for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \n\"We first brought you this deal during Black Friday weekend, and it was incredibly successful for PS4 sales so we decided to bring it back this month,\" Sony said in a post on the PlayStation Blog . \nSony said today that the week of Black Friday was the most successful in the history of the PlayStation brand , though no sales figures were divulged. \nThe deal is available until December 24 in the US. In Canada, the bundle will be offered for $330 CAD until December 29. \nThis move makes the PS4 $50 cheaper than the rival Xbox One during the all-important holiday shopping season. It's something of an aggressive move on Sony's part, and it'll be interesting to see if Microsoft follows suit with an Xbox One price drop. \nThe Xbox One has been the best-selling in the US and UK for months now . We'll find out tomorrow, December 8, if the streak will extend for another month when the NPD Group releases its November report. Filed under:",

      "text": "In its more than 40 years, Microsoft has had a lot of “firsts.” Now, it’s the first tech company to explore working with cannabis. And somehow, it’s been able to pull it off without any issues. \nHow? Through certain software, without ever touching the plant. \nBack in June, it paired up with marijuana tracking software startup KIND Financial, which provided the infrastructure. \nAccording to a release , Microsoft chose KIND to create Microsoft Health and Human Services Pod for Managed Service Providers. Ultimately, that goal was to to provide states, counties and municipalities with solutions for track-and-trace (‘seed to sale’ in the cannabis industry) technology. \nWorking with pot growers, sellers and government entities, KIND coordinates the connections through that “seed-to-sale” method, collecting and analyzing the related data so that everything is in compliance with all current laws. What that means and includes is overseeing and ensuring that legally grown pot doesn’t abscond to the black market and those that need to pay taxes on it do. \nSome that have previously worked in government and close to the marijuana issue are involved and are already weighing in, positively. \n“As a regulatory expert in the legal cannabis industry, I have chosen KIND Government Solutions as my preferred choice for track-and-trace solutions,” said Matt D. Cook, former senior leader of Colorado’s Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division and KIND’s special advisor on government matters. “In my opinion, their technology offers the most advanced software solution available, and it provides government with critical tools to ensure transparency and accountability, which is imperative for government agencies managing a successful cannabis program.” \nThe software is a cloud-based host of tools that will be distributed to certain states, counties and other government entities. \nThat said, the partnership has yet to land a contract. \nExperts close to the deal say that Microsoft was interested in the KIND partnership because it doesn’t actually come near the plant, which may pose a legal risk considering that the drug is not legal in all 50 states. However, Seattle is marijuana-welcoming.",
