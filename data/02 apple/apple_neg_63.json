The answer: not nearly as much as Apple thinks.The 8-0 opinion (PDF) is a rebuke to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which held that the relevant \"article of manufacture\" for calculating damages was—in fact, had to be—the entire smartphone. That meant even though Apple's patents covered only certain design elements, it was entitled to $399 million in lost profits damages.\n\nRead More... ",

      "text": "0 \nOne year ago, Samsung filed an appeal with the US Supreme Court regarding its legal battle with Apple. Now the results of that appeal have come in. \nThe US Supreme Court sided with Samsung in the company’s appeal, ruling 8-0 in Samsung’s favor and sending the case back to the lower court. This decision gives Samsung the opportunity to get back $399 million that the company had been ordered to pay Apple . \nIn its appeal, Samsung argued that the amount that it must pay Apple for damages shouldn’t be calculated based on the entire profit it made from its smartphones, but rather only part of its profits since only part of its infringing design copied Apple. The Supreme Court agreed, ruling that the damages could be calculated this way. \nThis battle isn’t over quite yet, as the lower courts will now figure out where to go from here. This decision is still a notable one for Samsung, though, as it means that the company may not have to pony up nearly as much money to Apple for the previous ruling that said that Samsung infringed on Apple’s patents.

      "text": "While Cupertino’s unusually prompt reaction to relatively widespread iPhone 6 and 6s “bricking” issues in China was certainly praiseworthy, Samsung’s recent Galaxy Note 7 explosion fiasco and especially the confusion still surrounding the phablet’s discontinuation taught Apple quick answers were also imperative.\nHopefully, the “information about the iPhone accidental shutdown” just shared on the tech giant’s regional support webpages has been a little more thoroughly researched, checked and double-checked than the competition’s first Note 7 quality inspection findings.\nApparently, it’s not a “security issue” that caused a “small number” of iPhone 6s units produced between September and October 2015 to randomly freeze, halt all operations, and refuse to charge or boot back up.\nInstead, believe it or not, air was the culprit here. Specifically, a central battery component’s exposure to “controlled ambient air for too long” before said component was “loaded into the battery pack.” That sure sounds… unusual, so much so in fact that we believe it may well check out. It’s simply too weird to be fabricated.\nIt also means that, for the “affected” iPhone 6s range, everything should be a-okay after Apple’s voluntary free battery replacement program. But another “small number of customers” outside this “area” have been reporting unexpected shutdowns as well, and “more information” is needed ahead of a verdict, battery swap or recall, with an “additional diagnostic feature” coming as part of an iOS software update next week.\nThe post Apple blames ‘ambient air’ for unexpected iPhone 6s shutdowns, still looking into some complaints appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nWhile Apple fans are still waiting for the company’s next big move in the entertainment space, that is, its own Internet TV service, Apple is at least offering them some conveniences to keep their myriad cable and streaming services in order. Previously only available in beta versions of tvOS and iOS, Apple’s Single Sign-On feature is now rolling out to all users, at least in the US. Now these users will no longer have to be bothered by repeatedly entering their credentials to sign into mobile apps. They can just do it once and forget about it. \nMany cable and satellite service providers have embraced the mobile revolution, rather than go prehistoric on TVs. That, however, means that each provider has its own mobile app that you need to sign into to access. And if you happen to have multiple devices, you have to sign into each and every one of them. \nWith the Single Sign-On feature, you only have to do it once and never again. That is true whether you’re starting from an Apple TV, iPhone, or iPad. All you need to do is go to the Settings app on the device, navigate to the TV Provider section, and sign in with your credentials for that provider. The next time you open a supported app, you will be asked whether you want to use the stored credentials rather than having to input it every time. \nThat said, Single Sign-On is currently limited to a few providers, in addition to being limited to the US. That list includes CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telcom, Hotwire, MetroCast, and Sling. And not all apps support the feature either, with some working only on iOS or tvOS. The full list is kept updated on Apple’s support page for the feature. \nThe Single Sign-On is just a prelude to the upcoming new TV app that will hit when iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 goes gold. This TV app will replace the current Videos app and will not just be a hub for videos but also a TV guide for content coming from multiple devices and providers.",

      "title": "Apple's Music streaming service now has 20 million paid subscribers",
      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 5 minutes ago with 1 comment \nApple’s Music streaming service has reached 20 million paid subscribers, half as many users as its main rival, Spotify . Much of that growth has relied on exclusive content deals. \nEarly this year, Apple announced that its paid music service, which was launched back in 2015 , had reached 13 million users. Then, a few months later at the latest iPhone unveiling event , Apple said that number had grown to 17 million. Fast forward to today, and Apple Music boss Eddy Cue is celebrating the 20 million paid subscribers mark. \nA large part of that growth in Apple Music’s user base can be attributed to exclusive content deals that the company has signed with artists. However, these have been criticized by some artists and users alike. Cue, however, downplayed those criticisms in an interview with the BBC where he said: \nI don't think exclusives or promotions are anything new. They were done in the record business, they were done on iTunes, now they're being done on streaming. The exclusives are relatively short term - it's not something that stays on any one platform. But being able to do unique things with artists is a good thing and I think that'll continue. \nApple’s music streaming service grew at a rate of one million new subscribers per month since the launch of the iPhone 7, an impressive feat for sure. But that still leaves Apple with less than half of the number of paid subscribers that Spotify has, more than a year after Apple Music launched. For a company that was expected to quickly leverage its iTunes strengths, some industry watchers seem disappointed at the service’s rate of growth. \nStill, this is an important milestone for the company, and Cue said that exclusive content and promotions will continue in an effort to drive even more engagement and growth.",

Samsung prevails over Apple in patent appeal Wed, 07 Dec 2016 11:15 AM Share Your Email The Samsung Galaxy S7. Credit: Samsung \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. \nThe shorthanded justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component. \nA jubilant Samsung hailed the \"victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that \"doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \n- No clarity - \nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics, citing precedents like Coca-Cola's iconic soda bottle. \nReacting to the verdict, an Apple spokesman said in an email, \"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute... We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \nSamsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n- 'Sigh of relief' - \nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that \"large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now,\" even if the case is not settled. \nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. \n\"This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,\" Black said. \nThe lower court's interpretation of design patents, Black said, \"would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products -- especially in the tech sector.\" \nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. \n\"The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,\" Love said. \nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents. \n\"Interest in design patents spiked following Apple's first jury verdict in 2012,\" he said. \n\"Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.\" AFP",

      "title": "Discounts, advertising spur brisk Apple Watch sales",
      "text": "View photos\nApple CEO Tim Cook speaks about the Apple Watch during an Apple event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 9, 2014. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo More By Julia Love and Stephen Nellis\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Watch sales appear to have rebounded for the holidays from mid-year doldrums on a redesign, price cuts and strong promotions, but analysts say long-term demand has yet to be proven.\nThe Watch is Apple Inc's first new product under Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and is seen as a barometer of whether the company can find new sources of revenue to boost sales which now largely depend on the iPhone.\nCook told Reuters on Monday that Watch sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high during the first week of holiday shopping. Cook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC that painted a more alarming picture, estimating Watch sales fell 71 percent in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe sharp change in seasonal demand, also revealed in separate data from market research firm Slice Intelligence, amplifies some analysts' concerns that the Apple Watch may not be a formidable hit on the order of the iPhone or iPad.\n\"Let’s see if the demand carries through to the next quarter,\" said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.\nData from Slice Intelligence shows sales were tepid in July and August and then jumped in September, when the watch was updated.\nSlice reported that sales faded somewhat in October and strengthened again in November. Average selling prices of the watch fell to $353.19 in November from $393.39 in October, according to Slice.\nApple Watch prices experienced a similar dip last year, hitting $321.63 in December 2015, although the drop this year is notable because it comes in the wake of a product update.\nApple, which declined to comment on the Slice data, has cut the retail price of the entry level watch over the last year. The original Apple Watch debuted in 2015 with a starting price of $349, but Apple trimmed the price to $299 in March 2016. It dropped it again to $269 in September, when a new generation of watches was released.\nApple also raised the profile of the Watch this holiday season. That effort included a promotional deal with Nike and aggressive advertising. Researcher Market Track said that promotions of Apple watches in retailer circulars have risen to 14 percent of the wearables market this year from 6 percent last year.\nApple may also be getting a boost from sales of the original Watch. It no longer sells solely in its own stores, but some third-party retailers, such as Target and Best Buy offer it, often with deep discounts for older models. Some of those same retailers, and Apple itself, offered gift-card based discounts on the newer watches as well on Black Friday.\n\"Whether Apple can sustain this strength will be the key question and at what impact to margins,\" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote in a note to investors.\nWhile Apple has cut retail prices, it has cut costs as well. This year's entry-level 38-millimeter watch cost about $92.78 to make, compared with $98.79 for last year's model, according to an analysis by IHS, a technology research firm. Analyst Kevin Keller said that the difference between retail price and production price still left Apple with a \"substantial amount of money.\"\n(Reporting by Julia Love and Stephen Nellis; additional reporting by Deborah Todd and Nandita Bose.

      "text": "by IWB · December 7, 2016 Shanghai (AFP) – Apple has blamed “external physical damage” for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. Fresh on the heels of Samsung’s worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged. In a statement to AFP late Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced “thermal events”, but brushed off safety concerns. “The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” the statement said. “We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.”",

      "text": "ePaper Apple Watch sales hit record numbers in first week of holiday shopping Apple CEO Tim Cook says the holiday quarter is on track to be the best ever for the Apple Watch. This comes just as iPhone sales are beginning to level off. Published Copy \nCALIFORNIA (REUTERS) - Good time for Apple? \nReuters has learned that Apple Watch sales to consumers set a record in the first week of holiday shopping. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the gadget. He said the watch could be, in his words, \"one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.\" However, he did not say how many were sold. \nAnalysts say strong sales are to be expected during the holidays because the watch makes a more natural gift than a Mac or an iPhone. And the holiday quarter is usually Apple's strongest. But just Monday (Dec 5), research firm IDC estimated that Apple Watch shipments had fallen 71 per cent in the third quarter from a year ago. \nApple needs new sources of growth. Sales of its key product, the iPhone, have begun to level off. TECHnalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell doubts the Apple Watch can make up for that, saying, \"While I'm not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category.\" \nApple shares, which have underperformed the broader market with just a roughly 4 per cent gain this year, rose at the start of trading.

      "text": "Justices side with Samsung in dispute with Apple | Published: Wed, December 7, 2016 @ 12:00 a.m. \nAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung’s devices. \nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.”  ",

      "text": "Beijing: Foxconn Technology Group, the biggest assembler of Apple Inc devices, is in preliminary discussions to make an investment that would expand the company’s US operations.\nThe disclosure came hours after an announcement by US President-elect Donald Trump and SoftBank Group Corp’s Masayoshi Son to invest $50 billion (Dh183.5 billion) in the US and create 50,000 jobs. The money will come from SoftBank’s $100 billion technology fund, which was announced in October, a person familiar with the matter said. A document that Son held up after the meeting in Trump Tower also included the words “Foxconn,” “$7 billion” and “50,000 new jobs” in addition to SoftBank’s numbers.\n“While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials,” Foxconn said in a statement. “Those plans would be made based on mutually-agreed terms.” Move production \nFoxconn gave no further details. The Taiwan-based manufacturer assembles iPhones, iPads and other Apple hardware outside the US, in addition to computers and appliances for other global brands. Trump has publicly called for Apple to move production back to the US to create jobs. Most of Foxconn’s assembly force is currently in China.\n“Moving manufacturing is difficult and complicated,” said Bill Tsai, an analyst at Mega International Investment Services Corp, citing the need to find labour and build a supply chain. “Politics is temporary, business is permanent.”",

      "text": "\nApple left many fans disappointed back in October when their final event of 2016 failed to even mention the company’s iPad line. However, perhaps the most disappointing omission on Apple’s part is that of the iPad Mini 5. Apple last updated their smaller form factor tablet range in September 2015 with the release of the iPad Mini 4. With that in mind, Apple was widely expected to unveil the tablet’s successor in the latter part of 2016, however, that release now appears to have been pushed into 2017.\nWhen will the iPad Mini 5 be released? \nAs aforementioned, the release of the next iPad Mini tablet is now long overdue, with its predecessor released over 13 months ago. However, according to Macworld , fans of Apple’s smaller tablet may not have to wait much longer , with Apple expected to unveil a new iPad Mini alongside the iPad Pro 2 in March. In fact, considering the company’s decision to neglect the iPad range in the latter part of 2016, it’s widely expected that the company will all but dedicate their first showing of 2017 to tablets.\nhttps://t.co/Q03o2Sqi92 : #iPadMini5 #Tablet – iPad Mini 5 Rumored To Sport Different Size, #Storage Variants With 7000-Series #Aluminum … pic.twitter.com/Wh3mebDkZq \n— Anto IHQ (@AntoIhq) December 5, 2016 \n\nWith Apple releasing their most recent iPad Pro models in March 2016, it would appear that the company is looking to push all iPad releases into that window. In fact, many analysts are suspecting that Apple could even drop the Mini branding from their small tablet and title it the iPad Pro Mini alongside the rest of their tablet line-up.\nWhilst it’s pretty safe to assume that Apple plans to reveal a new iPad Mini in March 2017, that doesn’t necessarily signal when the new tablet will be released. According to the International Business Times , Apple typically releases a product between a week and a fortnight after being announced. With that in mind, if Apple holds their first event of 2017 towards the end of March, it could very well be the case that we don’t see the new iPad Mini on Apple Store shelves until sometime in April.\nRELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR:\niPhone 8 Rumours: Apple Set To Reinvent The Smartphone — Edge-To-Edge Curved OLED, Wireless Charging, And More \nApple Rumor: The 2017 iPad Could Be Redesigned \nHuawei Becomes World’s Third Largest Smartphone Manufacturer, Aims To Surpass Apple In Five Years \nHow much will the iPad Mini 5 cost? \nAs Apple’s smallest tablet offering, the iPad Mini is also well known as the cheapest way to pick up an iPad. With that in mind, Apple isn’t expected to alter the pricing of their 8″ tablet all too much. The current iPad Mini 4 is available starting from $399 – a price point which increases with extra storage and cellular capacity.\nHowever, as part of a number of Apple’s recent product launches, the company has also begun introducing subtle price increases and this could continue to be the case with the iPad Mini 5. What’s more, as aforementioned, Apple may choose to rebrand their smallest tablet as the iPad Mini Pro. If this is the case, the iPad Pro line-up is considerably more expensive than their standard counterparts, meaning that Apple could potentially be charging more for the iPad Mini from March 2017.\nNew 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 expected to launch in 2017, with bezel-free screen and no Home button https://t.co/vGEhJzSgHB pic.twitter.com/ioqbxj0bqP \n— Macworld UK (@MacworldUK) December 7, 2016 \n\nWill it be worth the upgrade? \nAs aforementioned, the previous iPad Mini model was released over a year ago – so will Apple’s new model be worth the upgrade? Apple typically keeps tight-lipped when it comes to the details of their new tech, however, the upcoming iPad Mini is expected to adopt many features from Apple’s newer products. It’s widely rumoured that the big new iPad Mini feature will be 3D-touch, with the new iPad Mini gaining a touch sensitive panel similar to that found on the newest iPhone models.\nWith the iPad Mini 4 over a year old, Apple is also expected to give the tablet a much-needed specs boost too. Whilst it’s safe to assume that the iPad Mini 5 won’t feature specs on par with Apple’s larger tablets, the company is expected to boost key specs, including the tablet’s processor and memory.\n[Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]\nApple’s iPad Mini 4 Successor: iPad Mini 5 Price, Release Date And Everything We Know So Far is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "title": "iPhone grabs a bigger slice of US phone market in wake of Note 7 debacle - The Verge",
      "text": "The US smartphone market is dominated by two big brands, Apple and Samsung, and when one of them flubs its lines, the other one stands to benefit in a substantial way. To wit, the latest quarterly data from Kantar Worldpanel, which breaks sales down on a country-by-country basis, shows Apple's iOS rising to a 40.5 percent share of US smartphone sales. That's up 7 percentage points, or more than a fifth, on the same quarter (ending in October) last year, and appears to be explained in large part by Samsung's disastrous Galaxy Note 7 release and subsequent recall.\nThe instrumental influence of the Note 7's demise is best illustrated by looking at what happened in markets where Samsung isn't as prominent. iPhone sales in urban China, for example, declined on a yearly basis, even with the new iPhone 7 models on sale. Facing stiffer competition from local Android rivals like the rising Oppo, Apple commanded 17.1 percent of Chinese sales in the third quarter, down from 22.5 the year before. And in Europe, where Samsung didn't even release the Galaxy Note last year , the absence of the new Note 7 was less prominently felt, with the iPhone losing some ground in Germany, falling 2.7 percentage points to 16.5 percent.\nIt's tough to be sure whether German consumers were left underwhelmed by the latest generation's upgrades or fuming about the removal of a headphone jack , but Kantar's analysts are certain that \"the lack of the headphone jack has proved to be a non-issue for US iPhone consumers.\" The iPhone 7 was the top-selling smartphone in Apple's native market, followed by the iPhone 6S, Samsung Galaxy S7, and the iPhone 7 Plus.\nGoogle's new Pixel smartphone also figured in Kantar's numbers, and even though it was only on sale for a few days at the end of the relevant quarter, it somehow managed to match Microsoft and Huawei's total US sales:\n\"Google achieved 0.5% of smartphone sales, a strong showing given that the Pixel was only widely available from October 20th. In that short time, Google has reached market parity with more established brands like Huawei and Microsoft, who are also at 0.5%.\"\nFor Huawei, which sells more phones under its Honor brand in the States, that's understandable, whereas for Microsoft it's illustrative of a company abandoning its efforts as a smartphone maker .",

      "text": "Yes, it’s that time of year again. The time Apple recaps all its great progresses and amazing feats of the past 12 months across many different (and not-so-different) areas of the tech industry, trying hard to downplay any commercial failures, growth stalls or outright stagnations making analysts and investors anxious.\nUnderwhelming iPhone and especially Apple Watch sales scores ? You just wait for the holiday season tally . Slow Apple Pay adoption? Why not focus on the respectable number of US retailers that already support the iOS-enabled digital wallet service? Spotify still outgrowing Apple Music ? Perhaps, but there’s room for everyone.\nBesides, we all know Cupertino likes hefty profit margins more than rapid expansion to the masses, and as long as rumored Apple Music subscription price cuts don’t materialize, recent growth rates will do. There are now apparently over 20 million paying users, up from 17 mil back in September, which by no means signals doom and gloom.\nThen again, Spotify did jump from 28 to 40 million subscribers in around nine months, and that’s arguably a superior hike pace.\nMeanwhile, Apple Pay has officially spread the contactless love from a measly 4 to 35 percent of all US retailers in two years, heading for clothing giant Gap sometime in 2017 to further boost a partner portfolio covering 4 million physical stores nationwide. Not too shabby, but let’s not forget arch-rival Samsung Pay works at magnetic-only terminals in addition to NFC-based points of sale.\nThe post Apple Music has 20 million paying subscribers worldwide, Apple Pay supported by 35 percent of US retailers appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

By: Reuters | Beijing | Published: December 7, 2016 9:52 AM Apple iPhone 6: The US tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. (Reuters) \nApple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted – handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n“The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe US tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung’s recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 – itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n“The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn’t necessarily equal a safe product,” said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council’s report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n“I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it’s not investigated,” said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n“The news did make me change my Apple habits,” he told Reuters. “For example, I don’t dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Published: December 7, 2016 6:18 AM Apple described its conduct as ”an oversight in paperwork” that didn’t affect its health and safety standards. (Reuters) \nApple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. The agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple’s Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators’ knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple’s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. Regulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. Apple described its conduct as ”an oversight in paperwork” that didn’t affect its health and safety standards. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly by Reuters Close icon Reuters \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Published: December 6, 2016 — 10:57 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Updated: December 6, 2016 — 7:51 PM EST Share SAM HANANEL The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" More Coverage ",

      "text": "Discounts, advertising spur brisk Apple Watch sales Updated: December 6, 2016 — 8:15 PM EST Share Julia Love and Stephen Nellis Reuters \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Watch sales appear to have rebounded for the holidays from mid-year doldrums on a redesign, price cuts and strong promotions, but analysts say long-term demand has yet to be proven. \nThe Watch is Apple Inc's first new product under Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and is seen as a barometer of whether the company can find new sources of revenue to boost sales which now largely depend on the iPhone. \nCook told Reuters on Monday that Watch sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high during the first week of holiday shopping. Cook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC that painted a more alarming picture, estimating Watch sales fell 71 percent in the third quarter of 2016. \nThe sharp change in seasonal demand, also revealed in separate data from market research firm Slice Intelligence, amplifies some analysts' concerns that the Apple Watch may not be a formidable hit on the order of the iPhone or iPad. \n\"Let’s see if the demand carries through to the next quarter,\" said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. \nData from Slice Intelligence shows sales were tepid in July and August and then jumped in September, when the watch was updated. \nSlice reported that sales faded somewhat in October and strengthened again in November. Average selling prices of the watch fell to $353.19 in November from $393.39 in October, according to Slice. \nApple Watch prices experienced a similar dip last year, hitting $321.63 in December 2015, although the drop this year is notable because it comes in the wake of a product update. \nApple, which declined to comment on the Slice data, has cut the retail price of the entry level watch over the last year. The original Apple Watch debuted in 2015 with a starting price of $349, but Apple trimmed the price to $299 in March 2016. It dropped it again to $269 in September, when a new generation of watches was released. \nApple also raised the profile of the Watch this holiday season. That effort included a promotional deal with Nike and aggressive advertising. Researcher Market Track said that promotions of Apple watches in retailer circulars have risen to 14 percent of the wearables market this year from 6 percent last year. \nApple may also be getting a boost from sales of the original Watch. It no longer sells solely in its own stores, but some third-party retailers, such as Target and Best Buy offer it, often with deep discounts for older models. Some of those same retailers, and Apple itself, offered gift-card based discounts on the newer watches as well on Black Friday. \n\"Whether Apple can sustain this strength will be the key question and at what impact to margins,\" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote in a note to investors. \nWhile Apple has cut retail prices, it has cut costs as well. This year's entry-level 38-millimeter watch cost about $92.78 to make, compared with $98.79 for last year's model, according to an analysis by IHS, a technology research firm. Analyst Kevin Keller said that the difference between retail price and production price still left Apple with a \"substantial amount of money.\" \n(Reporting by Julia Love and Stephen Nellis; additional reporting by Deborah Todd and Nandita Bose.

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations Updated: December 6, 2016 — 7:38 PM EST Share Close icon The Associated Press \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Published: ",

As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.\" \nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino, its home base, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them. \nThe department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013. \nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant's existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste. \nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.

      "text": "  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. The agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple’s Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators’ knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple’s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. Regulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. Apple described its conduct as “an oversight in paperwork” that didn’t affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. The complaint filed against Apple didn’t include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. Regulators say the “baghouse” dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn’t authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. Settling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.  ",

      "text": "Apple and Spotify are generating $7 billion a year in streaming music revenue 60 million subscribers a year. share Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for TAS It took the music industry more than a decade to embrace streaming music. Now it’s a thing. More precisely: It’s at least a $7 billion-a-year business. That’s what you get when you combine the 40 million paying subscribers Spotify reported earlier this fall , and the 20 million Apple announced Tuesday , and do some (very) basic math , assuming each subscriber is paying around $10 a month. We’ll have a better grip on those numbers if Spotify goes public next year, and we can see what it really makes per customer. But for now, let’s assume we’re in the ballpark. Here’s what we can say about the ballpark: Pro: Pretty good ballpark! For years, lots of people, including me, assumed it would be very difficult to find 60 million people around the world who would pay $120 a year for music. Not when music is so easy to get for free, and not when there are so many other things to spend $10 a month on. Con: We’re still a long way from the Napster era peak in 1999, when the music industry grossed $40 billion worldwide. And we will probably never get back there -- because music is so easy to get for free, and because there are so many other things to spend $10 a month on. Equally important: It’s unclear whether companies that only sell music — like Spotify — can be a going concern, given industry economics. Again, we may get an answer to that next year. recode_divider",

Share Samsung wins patent dispute with Apple - Yahoo New Zealand The Supreme Court has sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices on Tuesday threw out a $US399 million ($A535 million) judgement against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design. \nThe court said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nThe case now returns to a lower court for further proceeding in the case.",

      "text": "iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors: Apple iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors: Apple The Shanghai Consumer Council report detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted. By: Reuters | Beijing | Published:December 7, 2016 10:54 am “The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said. (Source: File) \nApple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. \nWatch What Else is Making News \nIt also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted – handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on November 20 to address the issue. \n“The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe US tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung’s recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 – itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n“The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn’t necessarily equal to a safe product,” said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council’s report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n“I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it’s not investigated,” said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. “The news did make me change my Apple habits,” he told Reuters. “For example, I don’t dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.” Best of Express ",

      "text": "Kahaani 2 Audience Reaction: Vidya Balan Starrer Thriller Gets Mixed Reviews \nSamsung told Reuters in a statement the ruling was a “victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.” \nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favoring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple’s iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone’s rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. \nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world’s top smartphone maker. \nTuesday’s ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world’s top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term “article of manufacture,” on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court’s ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term “article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,” she wrote. \nPeriod Of Uncertainty \nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products. \n“No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,” Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview. \nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone’s success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone’s look and many user interface features, Apple said. \nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. \nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. \nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777. Best of Express ",

      "title": "Tim Cook’s emails may not be good for Apple’s investors over time - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook once again chose this week to offset negative news with a selective disclosure of limited material information to a single member of the media, a move that flirts with the boundaries of financial regulations and values short-term stock reaction over long-term investors.\nAfter IDC, a tracker of consumer electronics trends, published a report Monday showing a 71% plunge in Apple Watch shipments last calendar quarter that nearly halved Apple’s AAPL, +0.77% share of the smartwatch market amid gains from competitors such as Garmin Ltd. GRMN, -1.17% Cook weighed in with an email to Reuters reporter Julia Love, claiming sales growth for Apple Watch has been “off the charts” . That selective disclosure came after a nearly 1% decline in Apple shares in the wake of the IDC report Monday, and helped to reverse that decline and send Apple’s shares higher in premarket trade and nearly 1% into the green on Tuesday.\nCook declined to give specific sales data, but did say sell-through—a niche metric that measures how much product was sold to consumers as compared with the total product shipped to stores—hit a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and projected “the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” While the statement seems to contradict the IDC report, the information is actually for two different quarters, with the period Cook is referencing coming after the release of Apple’s Series 2 watch late in the third quarter and during the busy holiday shopping season, whereas IDC’s report spans a three-month period ended Sept. 30, which includes the first two weeks of Series 2 sales.\nThe content of Cook’s statement seems positive for investors, leading to headlines with some combination of the words “record” and “Apple Watch sales,” but is part of a pattern of vague details about the only product category introduced since Cook took the helm at Apple from Steve Jobs five years ago. For long-term investors, this is a concern: Sales trends that matter in the long run are being sugarcoated for short-term gain.\nFor an example, look at the last time Cook reacted in a similar manner. Last summer, Cook emailed a statement to CNBC’s Jim Cramer on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.18% suffered its worst decline in four years amid concerns about China’s economy , claiming that Apple’s sales were showing immunity to the headaches of China’s economy. The email arrived as Apple was down more than 10%, but shares rallied into positive territory after CNBC publicized the statement, and investors hailed Cook as a hero saving them from outside factors.\nOnly investors planning to get out of the stock should have been cheering, though, because Apple wasn’t immune to China’s economic turn. Apple’s sales in China fell 30% year-over-year from the fiscal fourth-quarter of 2015 to the same quarter in fiscal 2016 and 18% for the full fiscal year, leading to Apple’s first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales . Apple’s stock, meanwhile, has barely budged since then, rising just 6.5% to $109.95 as of Tuesday’s closing price, from $103.12 on Aug. 24, 2015, the day of the Cramer disclosure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the 30-member index of which Apple is a part of, has climbed more than 21%.\nThe method of delivery for both these statements is worrisome as well. Apple did not follow Monday’s statement with a press release nor post the information anywhere else, leaving it up to Reuters to disseminate that information and properly make sense of it so that investors were given the full context of Cook’s statements in relation to the grim IDC data. Without full context, readers could be misled by the “record Apple Watch sales” headlines. Reuters, for example, did not point out that the IDC data and holiday sales data lauded by Cook reflect separate time periods.\nThat type of disclosure enters into hazy territory with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as MarketWatch pointed out after the email to Cramer .\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation FD, which governs fair disclosures, the media is exempt from rules overseeing fair disclosure if the issuer of such information believes the outlet is large enough to ensure the disclosure will be widely disseminated. However, another part of Regulation FD raises questions about whether this is the best method the world’s most valuable company should take when revealing potential market-moving information.\nAccording to the regulation, there is a “responsibility on the issuer to choose methods that are, in fact, ‘reasonably designed’ to effect a broad and non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public.” While delivering material financial information to one national media outlet may exempt Apple from SEC scrutiny because it will eventually be widely disseminated, its decision to disclose material information in an email without following up with a press release or an 8K filing may starve investors of context, thus potentially inflating the stock.\nLong-term investors should take these Cook emails with a grain of salt. Longer-term trends are much more an indication of how a product category is performing. IDC even made note of this in its report on Apple Watch shipments earlier this week, saying Apple’s success “will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged,” even though Apple Watch may benefit in the near term from Black Friday promotions and people gifting devices for the holidays.\nThe SEC declined the opportunity to comment on this story. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding why it chose this particular disclosure method.\nShares of Apple closed 0.7% higher to $109.92 on Tuesday as the market absorbed Cook’s comments regarding record holiday sales of Apple Watch. They’re down 7.6% in the past 12 months though, vastly underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.18% which is up 8%.\nRichard Branson: 'Thousands' will go to space soon (2:28) Two years after a fatal accident, Virgin Galactic launched its first successful test flight in September.

      "text": "The US smartphone market is dominated by two big brands, Apple and Samsung, and when one of them flubs its lines, the other one stands to benefit in a substantial way. To wit, the latest quarterly data from Kantar Worldpanel, which breaks sales down on a country-by-country basis, shows Apple's iOS rising to a 40.5 percent share of US smartphone sales. That's up 7 percentage points, or more than a fifth, on the same quarter (ending in October) last year, and appears to be explained in large part by Samsung's disastrous Galaxy Note 7 release and subsequent recall.\n\nThe instrumental influence of the Note 7's demise is best illustrated by looking at what happened in markets where Samsung isn't as prominent. iPhone sales in urban China, for...",

      "text": "Washington, DC Cork, Ireland \nThe untold story of Apple and its taxes wends its way from Cork, Ireland, to New York and then Reno, Nevada. But according to tax experts interviewed by Bloomberg News, the maker of iPhones is hardly unique. Many of the biggest U.S. multinationals have seized on the same exemption, which lets them avoid or delay repatriation taxes by buying Treasuries with their overseas cash. (The top 10 alone hold over $100 billion of the bonds.) That, in effect, enables the companies to turn billions of dollars in potential tax liabilities into millions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies—all while they publicly bemoan the sky-high taxes that make it impossible for them to bring the money home. \nFrom the government’s standpoint, “it’s as if you are paying someone to borrow a bike that’s actually yours to begin with,” said Reuven Avi-Yonah, a professor who specializes in corporate and international taxation at the University of Michigan Law School. “The whole thing is full of uneasy compromises in order to dance around the reality that most of the money isn’t actually offshore—it’s really here.” Blurred Lines \nThe maneuver is perfectly legal and no one is suggesting that it’s a big money maker for Apple or anyone else at today’s low interest rates. If the companies sold the bonds, the cash would still be considered foreign earnings and subject to eventual taxation. What’s more, the interest they earn from buying U.S. debt—which helps finance government spending—is taxable. \nBut if nothing else, the purchases reflect how the distinction between what’s foreign and what’s not for multinationals often exists only in the world of accounting. \nIn response to requests for comment, Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock referred Bloomberg to the company’s annual financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, without elaborating further. In the most recent filing, Apple said it paid $10.4 billion in worldwide income taxes for its last fiscal year. \nThe Internal Revenue Service declined to comment, as did the Treasury Department, which oversees the U.S. government tax agency. Tax Exemption \nThe issue of what to do with U.S. companies’ overseas earnings—which has vexed lawmakers for years—has become more urgent with the election of Donald Trump. As a candidate, Trump promised to get companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion they hold internationally by enacting a one-time repatriation tax of 10 percent (from the 35 percent rate). \nThe current exemption, spelled out in Section 956(c)(2) of the U.S. tax code, has been in place since 1962. But over the past two decades, global companies (particularly in technology and pharmaceuticals) began to use it aggressively as one way to reduce the tax bill on their burgeoning overseas profits. It states companies can repatriate income without paying a penny in taxes—as long as it is used to buy Treasuries or other U.S. securities like stocks and corporate bonds. \nIf a company decides to use the money for any other purpose, like capital spending, it would still be subject to a 35 percent tax. And the money reverts back to accounts designated for foreign cash if the securities are sold. (Part of the reason companies still earmark the cash as “held overseas” for accounting purposes.) ‘Honor System’ \n“It’s an honor system, a self-assessment system,” said J. Richard Harvey, a former top tax official at the IRS and Treasury Department, who now teaches law at Villanova University. “Many companies like Apple are very aggressive in taking advantage of arguably, loopholes in the law.” \nIt’s impossible to know precisely how much taxpayer money has been paid out to companies that have parked their cash in U.S. government debt, simply because the multinationals aren’t required to provide detailed breakdowns. However, based on a Bloomberg review of annual financial statements filed with the SEC, conservative estimates suggest the 10 U.S. companies with the most reported cash abroad have received at least $1.4 billion in interest payments over the past five years. Taypayer Contributions Treasury has paid at least $1.4 billion in interest to big multinationals since 2012 Estimated figures. See methodology below . \nApple, which has more than doubled those holdings of Treasuries to $42 billion since 2012, received the most in interest payments over that time, the data show. In the same span, the Treasury has paid Cisco Systems Inc. roughly $430 million, while Alphabet Inc. (Google’s parent) has gotten about $160 million. (The tally excludes Microsoft Corp., Qualcomm Inc., and Coca-Cola Co., which are in the top 10 but don’t provide a detailed accounting of their investments.) Ballooning Interest \nThe companies in the Bloomberg review, which also include Johnson & Johnson, Amgen Inc., Gilead Science Inc. and Oracle Corp., either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests seeking comment. \nThe interest payments have ballooned as they’ve amassed more and more Treasuries with their overseas profits. Together, these 10 multinationals, which control almost 20 percent of all the cash held abroad by American corporations, have boosted their investments in government bonds to $113 billion from $67 billion over the past five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \nBlaming U.S. companies for following the tax code, however complex or flawed, is misguided, says Richard Lane, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. \n“If these companies don’t need the money in the U.S., there’s no incentive to give Uncle Sam” that money in taxes, he said. “What sane chief financial officer, who’s doing their fiduciary duties to shareholders, would pay money to some entity for no good reason? If there’s a moral issue, I’m not sure whether there’s immorality to that.” Treasured Assets The top corporate holders of U.S. government bonds \nNevertheless, the purchases shed light on how multinationals have blurred the definitions of onshore and offshore earnings. \nIn Apple’s case, more than 90 percent of its $238 billion cash hoard is considered “overseas” in its accounting statements. Most of it belongs to the Cupertino, California-based company’s Ireland units. But like many multinationals, Apple’s cash sits in custodial accounts with U.S.-based banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and State Street Corp., said people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak on the issue. \nApple typically directs Wall Street bond dealers and big money managers like BlackRock Inc. and Pimco to buy Treasuries at debt auctions and in the secondary market on behalf of its Irish subsidiaries, all from a nondescript, three-story building in Reno, Nevada—a state with no corporate taxes, the people said. That’s where its internal investment firm, Braeburn Capital, is housed. Apple established the unit in 2005 to manage its cash and short-term investments. Tax Haven \nAs for Ireland, Apple isn’t alone. Nine of the 10 U.S. companies with the most cash abroad have foreign subsidiaries there. \nOver the years, lax Irish regulations have encouraged multinationals to pursue aggressive accounting practices that enabled them to shift much of their profits to those subsidiaries and minimize U.S. tax liabilities, according to tax experts. \nIn one of the more notable examples that’s drawn particular scrutiny, companies will book a disproportionate amount of revenue as “offshore” by claiming the underlying technologies are owned by their Irish units—even if the intellectual property originated in the U.S. \nApple went even further. According to a 2013 report by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, it exploited gaps in U.S. and Irish laws so that it didn’t have a tax home anywhere. \nThe company is already in hot water with the European Union. Regulators ordered Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes in August after concluding it paid an effective tax rate of 0.005 percent in 2014 because of preferential Irish treatment. Last week, Apple called the EU decision “seriously flawed.” Fundamental Disagreement \nIn November, Ireland filed an appeal against the ruling after repeatedly saying the country “fundamentally disagrees” with the analysis. \n“They don’t want to pay taxes, but they’re using the U.S. financial system to benefit from our laws, security, productivity and all the rest of it,” said Elise Bean, the former chief counsel who led the Senate probe into Apple’s tax practices. “They’re using the money to buy U.S. Treasuries, which is so ironic.” \nUsing Irish subsidiaries to funnel all that cash into Treasuries may help explain a bond-market curiosity that’s emerged in recent years: how Ireland, a nation of less than five million, managed to amass $271 billion of U.S. government bonds, based on data compiled by the Treasury, and become America’s largest foreign creditor, after China and Japan. \nWhatever the case, the need to address companies’ untaxed profits may be one of the few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on. During the campaign, both Trump and opponent Hillary Clinton proposed one-time tax breaks on overseas earnings (a so-called repatriation tax holiday) to help fund competing infrastructure plans. ‘Really Foolish’ \nYet absent a wholesale tax overhaul to close the repatriation loophole, such one-offs are Band-Aids that will only make things worse over time, according to H. David Rosenbloom, an attorney at Caplin & Drysdale and the director of the international tax program at New York University School of Law. \nHe pointed to a similar 2004 tax holiday under President George W. Bush, which ultimately led companies to accumulate more profits abroad after it expired. Almost all the repatriated cash during that time was used for shareholder rewards and executive bonuses—rather than investment and hiring in the U.S. that many companies promised. \nLast time, “it just encouraged companies to send more money abroad and wait for the next amnesty,” he said. “It would be really foolish to do.” With assistance from Yun Li and David Kocieniewski Graphics by: Blacki Migliozzi Blacki Migliozzi and Christopher Cannon Christopher Cannon Edited by: Michael Tsang Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Bloomberg reporting Methodology: Based on conversations with people with direct knowledge of the matter, estimates for the interest paid by the top 10 multinationals were made by taking the amount of Treasuries they held with their overseas cash during each fiscal year, and then taking the average interest rate on two-year U.S. notes sold at auction in each of those periods. The calculations assume the securities are held to maturity. The data exclude Microsoft, Qualcomm and Coca-Cola, which are among the top 10, but don’t provide a detailed accounting of their investments. Oracle, which holds $48 billion in cash abroad, has minimal investments in U.S. government debt. ",

The Taiwan-based manufacturer assembles iPhones, iPads and other Apple hardware outside the U.S., in addition to computers and appliances for other global brands. Trump has publicly called for Apple to move production back to the U.S. to create jobs.

      "text": "| 0 Comments \nGlobal wearables market grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2016 with fitness bands registering a double digit growth. The wearable shipments crossed the 23 million mark in the quarter, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker. \nFitness bands had a staggering 85% of the market share. The launch of newer models, increasing user base, gave a boost to the wearable sales, said the IDC report on Tuesday. With the holiday season kicking in, IDC foresees the sales momentum to continue for the remaining part of 2016. \n“It’s still early days, but we’re already seeing a notable shift in the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. “Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.” \nFitbit remains the leader in the wearables segment in this quarter with a 23% market share. It shipped 5.3 million units. Despite recent negativity surrounding the company’s long-term strategy and stock price, IDC expects Fitbit to continue leading the pack in the near term. \nNext in line, according to the data, is Xiaomi with 16.5% market share that has managed to ship 3.8 million units in the third quarter. The new Mi band that includes heart rate tracking and is priced well below the competition has helped its numbers grow. However, China-based Xiaomi, across all business lines, continues to struggle to gain any significant traction outside its home country. \nGarmin secured the third spot with its widest portfolio of wearable devices. It had a market share of 5.7% and shipped 1.3 million devices in the said quarter. With the launch of recent products like the Fenix Chronos, Garmin has also managed to improve its image as a company with a great fashion sense, the report said. \nEven as Apple struggles to re-invent the smartwatch segment, it has seen a 12.5% decline from the last quarter. The primary reasons for the downturn according to IDC’s report were an ageing line-up and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple’s success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged. \nSamsung secured the last spot amongst the top five companies. With the launch of two new wearables, Gear Fit 2 and the Icon X, Samsung registered a healthy growth of 89.9% thanks to bundling of new wearables with its Note 7 smartphone. Though the Note 7 was recalled, many consumers were allowed to retain their Fit 2 or Icon X, thereby artificially inflating Samsung’s growth. \nLike this report?

      "title": "Users Of MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Report Battery Issues: Here's What We Know So Far",
      "text": "MacBook Pro with Touch Bar users complain of battery drain issues with the latest Apple offering. It remains unclear if the issue is hardware- or software-related. ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nSeveral customers of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar complain of battery drain issues on their device. \nApple launched the fourth-generation MacBook Pro on Oct. 27 this year. Apple claims that the new MacBook Pro is the lightest and the thinnest ever. However, there is more to the latest Apple offering. The new MacBook Pro is different as Apple has replaced the function keys with an interactive Touch Bar and a Touch ID sensor in the power button. \n\"The Touch Bar places controls right at the user's fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more,\" says Apple. Battery Issues With MacBook Pro With Touch Bar \nAlthough the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has attracted many customers, the novel feature is also said to be causing battery issues with the laptop. Apple support community and social media sites are ablaze with customer complaints regarding battery drain issues with the new MacBook Pro. \n\"I just received my new 15\" MacBook Pro with touch bar. The battery life is horrible!!! I have Safari open with 6 tabs and with 95% battery, I am told that I have under 3 hours of battery life left! I thought these things were supposed to get 10 hours? I ran the battery down in 3 hours last night only browsing the web. I wasn't watching videos, just browsing,\" complained a MacBook Pro user. Is The Battery Drain Issue Hardware- Or Software-Related? \nIt is not clear if the battery drain issue with the new MacBook Pro is software or hardware-related. However, some observers believe that the issue is arising due to a problem with the Radeon graphics chip. \nApple is said to be working on a fix to address the battery drain issue. However, the company has not revealed the reason for the error, or an estimated fix release date for the problem. \nThe issue seems to have disappointed new owners as some of them have opted for a full refund or exchange for returning the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar . \nIt is likely that Apple will release a statement sooner than later to confirm the battery issue and probably release a fix as well.

      "text": "Apple Weighs In on Self-Driving Car Safety By PC Mag ME Team Dec. 6, 2016, noon Apple asked the feds to rethink safety certifications for self-driving car prototypes. \nSelf-driving car prototypes should not be subject to the same safety regulations as production vehicles, Apple argued in a letter last month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \nThe letter commends many other aspects of the agency's proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (FAV), but it offers few clarifications to the rumors that have been swirling in recent months about Apple's own self-driving car ambitions. \nFrom securing car-related domain names to hiring executives from Tesla , it's clear that Apple is at least exploring autonomous driving. But the company in September reportedly laid off dozens of employees working on the self-driving project, code-named Project Titan, in a sign that the tech giant is rethinking its efforts. \nIn the letter, sent by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner on Nov. 22 and spotted by the Wall Street Journal last week, the company said it agreed with many safety and certification rules for the production of self-driving cars, but suggested that prototypes should not be subject to all of them. Rather than requesting exemptions from the rules each time it makes a modification to a prototype, Apple wants to self-certify that its prototypes are safe. Related Articles Report: Layoffs at Apple as Car Project Hits the Skids \n\"Instead of applying for exemptions, all companies should be given an opportunity to implement internal safety processes summarized in a Safety Assessment,\" Kenner wrote. That's akin to the current process, which allows established manufacturers to test on public roads without pursuing exemptions from federal safety standards. But the proposed FAV policy has no such provision, a potential burden for Apple if it decides to test its own cars after the policy is enacted. \n\"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote faircompetition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" Kenner wrote.",

      "text": "Following eight reports of iPhone 6 fires in China, Apple has responded saying that tests showed that the fires were caused by ‘external factors’ rather than any issue with the phones themselves. \nThe BBC reports that Apple had carried out an investigation into each fire. Eight users have complained to Shanghai’s consumer watchdog that their iPhone 6 series handsets spontaneously combusted or exploded. The US tech giant said it had conducted tests on the devices and had found “no cause for concern with these products” […] Apple said the iPhones had external physical damage “which led to the thermal event”… \nAlthough a tiny percentage of lithium batteries will spontaneously catch fire – statistically, one in ten million will do so – the most common causes are counterfeit chargers, being subjected to extreme heat and impact damage . From the report, it appears that impact damage was responsible for all eight of the reported cases. \nAny smartphone fire is tending to attract more media attention than usual at present due to the disastrous launch, recall and abandonment of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 . It was recently suggested that the issue there was Samsung’s desire to make a thinner device without sacrificing battery life, leading to the company failing to allow the usual expansion space needed for a lithium battery. \nThe BBC notes that the Samsung disaster has led some Chinese consumers to be suspicious of all ‘foreign’ phones, even though most are actually manufactured in China.

      "text": "Apple’s iPhone Supplier Foxconn to Move Production to the US GO New report claims Foxconn is planning US investments Dec 7, 2016 13:02 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ One of the promises made by United States President-elect Donald Trump during his campaign was that more domestic manufacturers would start building their products locally, naming Apple as one of the companies that should make the iPhone in the States. And now it appears that Trump’s promise is close to becoming a reality, as Foxconn, one of the biggest Apple suppliers, is planning a multi-billion investment in the United States that could eventually lead to building iPhones in the country. Bloomberg reports that this disclosure came just after SoftBank Group announced that it would invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs locally after a meeting with Donald Trump. A document that was held up by SoftBank’s CEO after the meeting included references to Foxconn and a $7 billion investment. Foxconn originally said no In a statement for the aforementioned source, Foxconn said that it’s indeed pondering an expansion in the United States, but no specifics were available. “While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant U.S. officials,” Foxconn was quoted as saying. “Those plans would be made based on mutually-agreed terms.” Previously, it’s been reported that Apple discussed the possibility of moving production to the United States with its suppliers, but they all refused to do it, citing the increased costs as the main reason. Donald Trump, on the other hand, personally discussed the matter with Apple CEO Tim Cook and promised incentives that would allow the company to manufacture iPhones and other products in the United States. At this point, it’s not yet clear if Foxconn and Apple would indeed rely on US production plants to make the iPhone, but if this is the case, it’s an important switch from the Chinese operations responsible for the manufacturing and assembling of all iPhones, iPads, and other Apple hardware. An official statement in this regard is expected in the coming days, but neither Apple nor Foxconn wanted to share more details.",

      "text": "During its Worldwide Developers Conference in June this year Apple announced that it would give developers up to January 1, 2017 to switch on the company’s App Transport Security (ATS) feature in their apps. Yet, with less than four weeks to that deadline, a vast majority of the top iOS apps installed on enterprise devices have not yet implemented the feature. \nSecurity vendor Appthority recently reviewed 200 applications commonly found on iOS devices that connect to enterprise data and networks to see how many have enabled ATS and how fully. \nAppthoritys review found that just 3% of the top 200 iOS apps used in enterprises have implemented ATS without any exceptions. Nearly 83% of the apps, or 166 out of 200, have disabled ATS for all network connections, while some 55% allowed use of HTTP rather than requiring HTTPS connections. And nearly all (97%) of the apps reviewed specified changes or included exceptions that weakened ATS. \niOS apps that had not yet implemented 100% HTTPS at the time of Appthoritys review included Microsoft products like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote, messaging apps such as Facebook and Whatsapp, social network applications, and utility apps such as flashlight and barcode readers. \nATS is a security feature in Apples OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 operating systems that essentially forces an application to connect to Web services via HTTPS rather than HTTP. It also requires app developers to build in support in their apps for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher. \nATS is designed to enhance data security and privacy by ensuring that applications use strong encryption when communicating with app servers and services. \nIt comes enabled by default in iOS 9 and the El Capitan versions of Apples mobile and desktop operating systems. Application vendors have to explicitly disable the setting or set exceptions to it. \nFor example, there are many situations where an application might need to interact with a Web service that does not support encryption or has no need for it, says Robbie Forkish, vice president of engineering at Appthority. \nIn order for the application to be able to continue interacting with the Web service, Apple allows developers to request an exception to the ATS requirement in such cases. Similarly, app vendors can also seek to disable the setting when their apps have to handle certain types of media files, he says. \nApple has established a process where app developers can request exceptions to the ATS settings and it reviews those requests and decides whether to grant them or not. \nApple is one among several major technology vendors that have been leading the call for encryption everywhere as a security best practice. \nApples deadline requires all developers with apps in Apple Store to implement ATS or provide \"reasonable justification\" for not doing so by the end of the year. The company has said that after January 1, app developers will not be able to update their products in Store without switching on ATS first. \nWhat this means is developers will either need to somehow implement ATS in the next three weeks or face the prospect of not being able to update their apps until they do so, Forkish says. \nUsers themselves will be able to continue using the applications as usual. But anyone expecting a higher degree of security and privacy in the app use as a result of the ATS requirement will likely not have it in such cases. \nApple has said it will allow exceptions to ATS if developers have a good reason for it. So organizations can expect to see iOS apps with unencrypted data even after the Jan 1 deadline passes, Forkish says. \nRelated stories:",

      "title": "Apple’s iPhone Grabs 40 Percent Share Of US Smartphone Market",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone has become more popular in the US according to a recent report from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. \nApple managed to increase its iOS share across most countries except in Germany and Urban China. \nIn the US, iOS grew 7% points year-over-year, from 33.5% of smartphone sales to 40.5% in the three months ending October 2016. This represents the strongest rate of growth for the OS in more than two years, as well as the highest share seen since the three months ending January 2015 (42.8%). And while Android remains the dominant OS in the US, at 57.9% of smartphone sales, this latest data represents the 5th consecutive year-on-year period decline. \n“The lack of the headphone jack has proved to be a non-issue for US iPhone consumers, as iPhone 7 was the top selling device in the three months ending October 2016, achieving 10.6% of smartphone sales, despite not being available for the full three month period. iPhone 7 Plus was the 4th best-selling device at 5.3%, behind the iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S7,” said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. “Google achieved 0.5% of smartphone sales, a strong showing given that the Pixel was only widely available from October 20th. In that short time, Google has reached market parity with more established brands like Huawei and Microsoft, who are also at 0.5%.” \nApple’s new iPhone 7 appears to be a popular device for the company and especially in the US and Europe.",

      "text": "Up Next Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple Enlarge Image \nA Wi-Fi logo seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in 2014. Public Wi-Fi portals can be taken over by hackers. Photo by Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images \nEvan Robertson won his school science fair this year by proving just how thoughtless people can be on public Wi-Fi networks. \nEvan, now 11, programmed fake Wi-Fi portals and took them to food courts shopping centers across the Austin, Texas, area and waited to see how many agreed to some pretty outrageous conditions. For the love of free internet access, they'd have to their OK for the Wi-Fi owner to do things like \"reading and responding to your emails, monitoring of input and/or output, and 'bricking' of your device.\" \nMore than half of the shoppers shown these terms accepted them. \nAttention holiday shoppers: public Wi-Fi networks are dangerous, especially during the Christmas season when so many people in one spot make for easy pickings, says Don Duncan, a security engineer with NuData Security. \nThe past 12 months, full of cyberattacks, showed just vulnerable we all are. Yahoo, for example, revealed the worst data breach in history after hackers grabbed the names, phone numbers and birth dates from 500 million user accounts. Ransomware made headlines when people demanded $3.4 million to unlock a Los Angeles hospital's computer and tried to extort $73,000 from San Francisco's Municipal Transit Agency . And over the summer, electronic intruders made off with emails sent by members of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's election campaign. \nThink of public Wi-Fi as hackers' on-ramp to the rest of us, giving them free rein to collect our usernames and passwords and read our texts and emails. It's why Evan's fake terms and conditions might be the most honest out there, since hackers can do just about everything on his list. \nTake it from Amihai Neiderman, of Tel Aviv, Israel, who spent a day devising an attack that let him intercept the traffic of anyone connecting to the city's free Wi-Fi network. \n\"Every piece of data, I could potentially read it,\" he said. That research, which Neiderman did in his free time, helped him land a job with Equus, a company that helps governments hack individuals through Wi-Fi portals as part of their investigations. On guard Enlarge Image \nEvan Robertson, now 11, presented his findings at the R00tz Asylum conference in Las Vegas in August. Evan got shoppers to accept Wi-Fi terms and conditions that would have let him send email from their accounts, among other things. Photo by Courtesy of Stephanie Robertson \nWe get it. You're still going to use your phone at the mall, whether it's to look up product reviews, scout for the best sale prices or transfer a bit more money into a checking account. Even so, there are things you can and should do to stay safe. Here's what experts we spoke to recommend: \n* Recognize that the word \"free\" can be a trap. Cybersecurity firm Skycure analyzed fraudulent Wi-Fi networks around the US and found 10 percent of them had the word \"free\" in their names. \n* Know what's nearby. Before you click on that network named \"Apple_Store,\" look around to see if there's really an Apple Store close by. It could be a hacker pretending to be a legitimate network. \n* Drop off when things get weird. Disconnect from the network if your phone starts showing error messages or keeps crashing. \n* Pay attention to the top of the web page. Always look for a green lock symbol, which shows you're on an encrypted connection. That symbol means any login information or messages you send over the internet will be unreadable by anyone intercepting it over a public Wi-Fi network. \n* Use a VPN. It's an extra step, but it will encrypt all your data before it even leaves your phone. \n* Think about what's at stake. Some things just shouldn't be done over a public Wi-Fi network. Hold off logging into your bank's mobile app, for instance, until you have more secure connection later. \nAnd finally, don't forget for one minute that public Wi-Fi isn't dangerous. \n\"The most foolproof way to protect yourself is to turn everything off, but that is not always accessible,\" says Marc Laliberte, a research analyst at WatchGuard Technologies. \"It's just not as safe as plugging into your wired home network.\" Share your voice",

      "text": "Dec 07, 2016 06:37 AM EST Know Surface Pro 5 Excellent Features That Combine Both Apple's MacBook Pro Versions 2016 And 2017 By Grace Jones The Microsoft Surface Pro is already an excellent device that comes in a very small and light package with the current Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with Intel i7 and is paired with 16GB RAM - the Surface Pro 5 has even larger 512GB of storage capacity. (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 5's reported release in 2017 details its enhancements with the latest Intel Kaby Lake processor, 4K display and a rechargeable stylus. It is definitely a more powerful version of Apple's MacBook Pro, a combination of both 2016 and 2017 technologies. \nTechnology buyers did not anticipate Surface Pro 5's sudden market availability because they have not gotten over Surface Book i7's launch in October 2016. They were actually looking forward to the Surface Pro 5. Ralf Groene, head of Microsoft actually hinted on its production speeding up as announced here earlier by Jobs & Hire . \nSurface Pro 5 is basically equipped with more computing power with an efficiency boost altogether. The 7th-gen Kaby Lake's gearing up the SP5 is based on the promise that in 2017 the Intel processing chip will soon be mass produced. Surface Pro 5 also includes the fingerprint sensor embedded on its screen. \nSurface Pen stylus made the device directly rechargeable. It can be recharged while in a wireless mode, just be resting the Pen on the magnetic dock of the SP5. The 2017 connectivity tech using multiple USB Type-C ports also gear the product up. Microsoft confidently promises quick data transfer, speedy recharging and flexible provisions for keyboard, mouse accessories and hooking it up to an external monitor for expanded use. \nSurface Pro 5 runs on the updated system of MacOS Sierra which is expected to jive with Windows 10 Redstone 3. The OS enhancement is designed for optimal and uninterrupted computing process between mobile and traditional devices, according to Yibada . \nMicrosoft always does not compromise the performance of their new models despite the petite size. The Surface Pro 5's 512GB of storage capacity alone is already exceptional. It is definitely a tablet and not a laptop, but the storage capacity is something buyers cannot say no to, says News Every Day . You have already subscribed. Thank you.

      "text": "Apple does not reveal sales numbers of its wearable device. Instead, the company groups Watch revenues into the Other Products category which includes Beats, iPod, Watch, and more. With some reports indicating that Apple Watch sales have been declining despite the release of Apple Watch Series 2, Tim Cook has tried to set the record straight. Cook told Reuters that Apple Watch sales growth was “off the charts” during the first week of holiday shopping.\nImage Credit: ToomaCZ / Pixabay Apple Watch Series 2 a popular holiday gift this year Cook said the current quarter was on track to be the “best ever” for Apple Watch as the device’s sell-through reached an all-time high. Apple’s internal data shows that Watch “looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.” The Cupertino company has disclosed few details about the performance of the original Apple Watch or the latest Apple Watch Series 2.\nTECHnalysis Research analyst Bob O’Donnell said that the Apple Watch was a “more natural gift” than the iPhone or Mac. So, you can expect the Watch to perform well during the quarter. The tech giant has also lowered the price of its wearable device this year, which should help the holiday season sales.\nApple Watch sales plunged 71% in Q3: IDC However, a report released by research firm IDC on Monday painted a gloomy picture of smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 2. IDC said the third-quarter Apple Watch sales plunged 71% YoY to just 1.1 million units. Though Apple Watch still commands 41.3% share in smartwatch category, its share in overall wearable device market was just 4.9%.\nThe research firm pointed out that “basic wearables” such as fitness trackers accounted for 85% of wearable sales during the September quarter. Smartwatches are the devices that can run third-party apps, unlike basic wearables. Fitbit was the top-selling wearable device maker with 23% market share, followed by Xiaomi with 16.5%, and Garmin with 5.7%. Apple was ranked fourth with 4.9% market share, closely followed by Samsung with 4.5%.\nBasic wearables hurting Apple Watch sales IDC said the decline in Apple Watch sales during the quarter was due to an “aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface.” Apple’s Q3 sales numbers were largely unaffected by the release of Apple Watch Series 2 because the device became available only in the last few days at the end of the quarter.\nConsumer preference toward basic wearables does not bode well for the Apple Watch Series 2 going into the holiday season. IDC analysts believe that Apple Watch will “ continue to struggle in the near term,” because basic wearables – not smartwatches – now reign supreme. The Apple Watch Series 2 comes with a brighter display, a faster processor, GPS tracking, and waterproofing.\nThe post Apple Watch Series 2 Flying Off The Shelves: Tim Cook appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "title": "The iPhone 8 May Cost $50 More Than The iPhone 7",
      "text": "The iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple’s biggest upgrade ever because fans, investors and analysts are all expecting something huge for the device’s tenth anniversary. However, investors are understandably wary about whether Apple will be able to deliver on all those lofty expectations, and unsurprisingly, analysts are trying to calm those fears.\nImage Credit: iDropNews Investors may be too optimistic about the iPhone 8 Goldman Sachs analysts recently visited with some of Apple’s suppliers in Asia, and in a research note dated Dec. 4, they described those suppliers as being “optimistic” about the next iPhone. They believe much of the optimism comes from a major change to the design of the iPhone 8 because the last three iPhone models have all looked pretty much the same.\nHowever, they also warn that investors might be expecting too much from the iPhone 8 because it will come in a year with a “weaker upgrade cohort,” meaning a year that usually Apple offers a smaller S upgrade rather than a major overhaul in design.\nWhat analysts are predicting for the iPhone 8 After their field work, they suggest that the iPhone 8 may have a curved-edge OLED display , glass back that’s either transparent or translucent, and a stainless steel unibody frame. They also suggest that the display could be a little bigger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus, coming in at 5.8 inches due to the curved edges being extended to the sides of the handset. They also echoed the rumor about the Home button being removed.\nThe Goldman Sachs team also suggests that wireless charging could be included with a glass back, and the dual-lens camera may receive yet another upgrade to have two optical image stabilizers. They didn’t see any evidence that the iPhone 8 could have virtual reality or augmented reality capabilities, but they don’t discount the possibility.\nThey believe the design of the iPhone 8 must be finalized by the first quarter so that Apple’s suppliers could execute their capacity expansion and capital expenditure spending in plenty of design. Most of the suppliers expect a September launch, and most are looking for only some of next year’s iPhone models to have OLED displays.\niPhone 8 may cost $50 more There’s been much debate recently about whether suppliers would be able to supply enough OLEDs to outfit Apple’s full iPhone 8 lineup next year. However, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha and team believe the concerns about a shortage of OLED capacity are overblown. They said in a research note dated Dec. 6 that they’re confident that the growing investment in boosting OLED production capacity means that suppliers should be able to outfit up to 270 million iPhones with OLED displays.\nTheir biggest question is whether all that added capacity will be up and running at full speed in time for the iPhone 8 launch. Because of this concern, they see three potential scenarios. One is that Apple will offer two iPhone models, both with OLED displays. The second is that there will be three iPhone models, only one of which will have an OLED display, and the third possible scenario is that there will be three iPhone models all of which will have OLED displays.\nWill Apple sacrifice gross margins? Garcha said the other key concern investors appear to have about the iPhone 8 is the gross margin, and all those lofty expectations make it clear why margins are in focus. Because next year’s model is expected to be fully redesigned and have so many new features and improvements , investors are starting to worry that the gross margin for the iPhone business will start to decline.\nHowever, Garcha believes Apple could keep the margins intact. One way it could do this is by raising the average selling price of the OLED iPhone model by about $50. He also suggests that the company could keep the mix of the new phones to about 35%, which is close to current levels. He said these suggestions assume that the bill of materials on the device increases $25 due to the OLED display. The analyst also believes that growth in the services business could offset some of this impact.\nThe post The iPhone 8 May Cost $50 More Than The iPhone 7 appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "​One of the promises made by United States President-elect Donald Trump during his campaign was that more domestic manufacturers would start building their products locally, naming Apple as one of the companies that should make the iPhone in the States. And now it appears that Trump’s promise is close to becoming a reality, as Foxconn , one of the biggest Apple suppliers, is planning a multi-billion investment in the United States that could eventually lead to building iPhones in the country. Bloomberg reports that this disclosure came just after SoftBank Group announced that it would invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs locally after a meeting with Donald Trump. A document that was held up by SoftBank’s CEO after the meeting included references to Foxconn and a $7 billion investment. Foxconn originally s...",

Now, the Cupertino-based company released the feature in the US. Even though Apple's sign-on feature is useful, it currently supports only handful of cable and satellite providers. The rollout was reported by MacRumors, and Apple has updated its support site to detail how to use the single sign-on feature and the supported providers.

      "text": "The California Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said Apple Inc agreed to pay $450,000 to settle state claims that it had mishandled hazardous electronic waste at facilities in Silicon Valley. \nApple also agreed to increase inspections to settle allegations about facilities in Cupertino and Sunnyvale, the Agency’s Department of Toxic Substances Control said.\n“This matter involves an oversight in filing paperwork to close one of our recycling facilities as part of our expansion to a larger site,” Apple spokeswoman Alisha Johnson told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n“We’ve worked closely with [the Department of Toxic Substance Control] to ensure that going forward we have the proper permits for our current site. As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.” State regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino, its home base, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them.\nThe department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013.\nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant’s existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste.\nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.\nReuters \nThe post Apple pays California EPA $450,000 to settle alleged hazardous waste violations appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Reddit \nReSound has announced that it has launched a new hearing aid for kids called the ReSound Up Smart Pediatric Smart Hearing Aid. The device is the only pediatric Smart Hearing aid with Made for iPhone capabilities inside. The Made for iPhone capability allows support for speech and language development, educational skills, and social interaction. \nThe hearing aid has a battery-door lock and LED light that allows parents to check the status of the hearing aid and the battery quickly and easily. Audio can be streamed directly to an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. It can be used with the ReSound Micro Mic and Multi Mic and a choice of FM solutions to allow kids more opportunities to learn and discover. \nA ReSound Smart app gives control over hearing aid settings with the ability to make real time adjustments based on personal preferences and the listening environment. The app lets parents control the child’s hearing aid including stopping and starting streamliners like the micro mic, multi mic, and the ReSound TV Streamer 2. \nThe app also saves geotagged settings for school or home. The app is available in the App Store for iOS devices and on Google Play for Android. The hearing aid comes in several colors and uses a special iSolate nanotech coating inside on components to repel dust and water as well as earwax and sweat. The hearing aid is available now at an undisclosed price.",

      "text": "German-English-Translator - Details here Late November Apple started an exchange program to help iPhone 6s users who experience unexpected shutdowns due to a faulty battery. According to Apple, iPhone 6s models produced between September and October 2015 might have a faulty battery, causing the unexpected shutdown problems. Later, Apple explained , that exposing the batteries to too much air during production was the main reason for the problems. However, it seems like more customers are affected by unexpected shutdowns. To further investigate the problem, Apple recently announced, that they will integrate diagnostic tools into the coming iOS update 10.2 which is currently in beta. This will allow Apple to optimize battery performance and shutdown algorithms in a future iOS update, Apple says. Apple further explained, that some shutdowns may be intentional, even though customers did not expect them, for instance if it is too cold for the iPhone to operate inside normal parameters.

      "text": "Tags: Apple , Fortune , iPhone , iPhone 6S Image Credit: Apple \nA bug in Apple’s iPhone 6s battery that causes some phones to abruptly shutdown before their charge is exhausted is more widespread than the company initially thought. \nOn Tuesday the iPhone maker announced that the issue may affect some phones not manufactured in September or October of 2015, which it had previously determined as the only susceptible batch. \nIn the English translation of a message posted on the company’s Chinese support page , Apple said that a “small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown.” The bug — which the company put down to a battery component being “exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been” before assembly — is not a safety issue, Apple stressed. After a wave of complaints flooded Beijing-based regulator the China Consumers Association last month, Apple announced in November that it would offer free battery replacements for iPhone 6s units purchased in September and October 2015 that fell within an undisclosed serial number range. \nIn its latest announcement, the California-based tech company said that, as part of an information gathering effort, it would be incorporating additional diagnostic capabilities in an iOS software update, which would be available next week. It did not disclose how many phones might be affected. \nIt has been a tough year for smart phone makers. Earlier this year Samsung was forced to recall and cancel its Galaxy Note 7 after numerous users reported their phones exploding or catching fire. That bug was down to overheating lithium-ion batteries. \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016",

      "text": " Google+\nKim Hong-Ji/Reuters/File\nSamsung Electronics’ Galaxy S4 (left) and Apple’s iPhone 5.\nBy Adam Liptak New York Time December 07, 2016\nWASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Samsung may not have to give up $399 million in profits for copying parts of the distinctive look of Apple’s iPhone.\nA federal law says that companies found liable for infringing on design patents on an “article of manufacture” are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. turned on the meaning of the Quote: d phrase.\nAdvertisement\nWriting for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers — here, Samsung’s phones — and sometimes be the components found to have infringed on a design patent.\nApple’s patents covered specific design elements of the iPhone, including its black rectangular front face with rounded corners and its colorful grid of 16 icons. A jury found that Samsung had infringed on those patents.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. “All told,” Sotomayor wrote, “Apple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung’s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.”\nDesign patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in more than a century.\nLast year, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court that handles patent appeals, ruled that the federal law “explicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented design.”\nAdvertisement\nThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that “an award of a defendant’s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.” But it added that “those are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.”\n“We are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,” the court said.\nSotomayor’s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the entire phone or just parts of it.\nShe said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that “the relevant ‘article of manufacture’ must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.”\n“In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied,” Sotomayor wrote. “In the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.”\nThe Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration.\nSotomayor’s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries.\n“An ‘article’ is just ‘a particular thing, ’ ” she wrote, citing two dictionaries. “And ‘manufacture’ means ‘the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man’ and ‘the articles so made.’\n“An article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,” she concluded. “So understood, the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.”\nPatent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\n“The court basically punted,” said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. “It seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, ‘We’re not going to tell you what the right rule is.’”\nLemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney’s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated.\nCompanies that sold products with distinctive designs filed a brief supporting Apple and urging the justices to protect their investments. Technology companies filed briefs supporting Samsung, arguing that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.",

      "text": "China’s Consumer Council, which is a consumer group that’s linked to the Beijing government , revealed that it received a total of 8 complaints from Apple customers across the country that their iPhone 6 models caught fire due to what they believed to be faulty batteries. Details are sketchy for the time being, but the consumer group says that all devices “spontaneously” burst into flames, according to a report by Bloomberg, even though they were in perfect condition. On the other hand, Apple says that it already investigated these phones and it found external physical damage on all of them, so the fire is a direct result of this factor. “We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,” Apple said in a statement, adding that those experiencing issues with their iPhones should c...",

      "text": "By Stephen Nellis | December 7 2016 \n(Reuters) The California Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said Apple Inc agreed to pay $450,000 to settle state claims that it had mishandled hazardous electronic waste at facilities in Silicon Valley. \nApple also agreed to increase inspections to settle allegations about facilities in Cupertino and Sunnyvale, the Agency’s Department of Toxic Substances Control said. \n“This matter involves an oversight in filing paperwork to close one of our recycling facilities as part of our expansion to a larger site,” Apple spokeswoman Alisha Johnson told Reuters in an emailed statement. \n“We’ve worked closely with [the Department of Toxic Substance Control] to ensure that going forward we have the proper permits for our current site. As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.” \nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino, its home base, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them. \nThe department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013. \nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant’s existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste. \nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.

      "text": "on Wednesday December 07, 2016 @09:00AM from the business-moves dept. Foxconn, the biggest assembler of Apple devices, is in preliminary discussions to make an investment that would expand the company's U.S. operations. From a report on Bloomberg: The disclosure came hours after an announcement by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and SoftBank Group's Masayoshi Son to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs . The money will come from SoftBank's $100 billion technology fund, which was announced in October, a person familiar with the matter said. A document that Son held up after the meeting in Trump Tower also included the words \"Foxconn,\" \"$7 billion\" and \"50,000 new jobs\" in addition to SoftBank's numbers. \"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant U.S. officials,\" Foxconn said in a statement. \"Those plans would be made based on mutually-agreed terms.\"",

      "text": "If you’re looking for some distractions over the coming Christmas holiday, you could do a lot worse than checking out Apple’s annual best-of lists. Each year the company names its favorite apps, games, music, movies, and more. This year’s top pick in the category is AI-powered art filter Prisma , with Supercell’s card-based battler Clash Royale taking best game. (Pokémon Go gets a nod as “breakout hit” of the year, but nothing more than that — perhaps it wasn’t polished enough for Apple’s liking.) \n10 Best Apps of the Year Prisma - AI-powered art filters MSQRD - Live selfie filters like you already get in Snapchat Quartz - News delivered like a conversation Vogue - It’s Vogue the magazine but on your phone Meditation Studio - Meditation guides including audio and background sound Detour - GPS based audio walking tours of cities Credit Karma - Free credit scores and reports Glasses by Warby Parker - Order glasses, pay with Apple Pay Hyper - Curated social videos, sharing one an hour Tinycards - Flashcards with plenty of pre-made decks 10 Best Games of the Year Clash Royale - Medieval card-based arena battler Reigns - Choose how to rule your kingdom, try not to die Plants vs Zombies - It’s plants. Versus zombies. twofold Inc. - Whimsical, colorful puzzle game Riptide GP - 3D rocket-bike racer FIFA Mobile Soccer - The world’s most popular sport Rodeo Stampede - Endless runner with animals “klocki” - Minimalist puzzler based on geometric trickery Steppy Pants - A cross between Flappy Bird and Crossy Road The Trail - Someone made a game about hiking and being at peace As well as apps and games, Apple also selected best movies, books, and more. The company picked “One Dance” by Drake as its song of the year, and the album that single came from ( View s, by Drake too, obviously) as its best album. \nNow, this isn’t an undeserved pick (Drake was also Spotify’s most streamed artist this year, and his influence on pop culture in 2016 has been massive), but it’s worth pointing out that Apple has a long-standing relationship with the rapper. They’ve reportedly signed promotional deals together, and Drake has been one of the most visible spokespeople for Apple Music. Undoubtedly, Apple benefits when it promotes Drake, and vice versa. \nApple also picked a whole bunch of other favorite albums , including Rihanna, Adele, Frank Ocean, twenty one pilots, and the Hamilton soundtrack. And it created a playlist of “Top Songs of 2016” for Apple Music right here . You can also check out its picks for best movies and TV shows below: \nBest Movies of 2016 Best Blockbuster: Deadpool ($14.99) Best Comedy: Sausage Party ($14.99) Best Romance: La La Land ($19.99) Best Animated Movie: Kubo and the Two Strings ($14.99) Best Documentary: Weiner ($9.99) Best Feel-good Movie: Sing Street ($14.99) Best Breakout: American Honey ($14.99) Best New Filmmaker: Moonlight ($14.99) Best TV Shows of 2016 This Year’s Obsession - American Crime Story Most Thought-Provoking - O.J.: Made In America Late Night Rule-Breaker - Full Frontal with Samantha Bee Best New Comedy - Atlanta Most Original Kids Show - Steven Universe Extravaganza of the Year - RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars Most Consistently Great - The Americans Best New Drama - This Is Us",

      "text": "A bug in Apple’s iPhone 6s battery that causes some phones to abruptly shutdown before their charge is exhausted is more widespread than the company initially thought.\nOn Tuesday the iPhone maker announced that the issue may affect some phones not manufactured in September or October of 2015, which it had previously determined as the only susceptible batch.\nIn the English translation of a message posted on the company’s Chinese support page , Apple said that a “small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown.”\nThe bug — which the company put down to a battery component being “exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been” before assembly — is not a safety issue, Apple stressed.\nAfter a wave of complaints flooded Beijing-based regulator the China Consumers Association last month, Apple announced in November that it would offer free battery replacements for iPhone 6s units purchased in September and October 2015 that fell within an undisclosed serial number range.\nIn its latest announcement, the California-based tech company said that, as part of an information gathering effort, it would be incorporating additional diagnostic capabilities in an iOS software update, which would be available next week. It did not disclose how many phones might be affected.\nIt has been a tough year for smart phone makers. Earlier this year Samsung was forced to recall and cancel its Galaxy Note 7 after numerous users reported their phones exploding or catching fire. That bug was down to overheating lithium-ion batteries. \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016 \n",

      "text": "Apple supplier Foxconn may increase U.S. jobs Banker has name on paper during Trump meeting Author: By Jethro Mullen \nOne of Apple's biggest suppliers is in talks to invest in the United States. Related Content Chipotle's E. coli woes might not be over \nTaiwan-based Foxconn is a giant contract manufacturer that plays a key role in assembling iPhones for Apple, employing hundreds of thousands of workers in mainland China. \n\"We are in preliminary discussions regarding a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations,\" Foxconn said in a statement provided to CNNMoney. \nThe company was responding to the appearance of Foxconn's name on a document carried by a top Japanese tech CEO in a meeting Tuesday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. \nAfter the meeting, Trump took credit for a planned $50 billion investment in U.S. startups by the Japanese company, Softbank, that he said would create 50,000 jobs. \nPhotos showed SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son holding a document with the logos of both his company and Foxconn's. \n\"Commit to: Invest $50bn + $7bn in US, generate 50k + 50k new jobs in US in next 4 years,\" the document said. \nThat led to speculation that Foxconn could be planning to invest $7 billion in the U.S. to create 50,000 jobs. \nBut Foxconn declined to provide any further information. \n\"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant U.S. officials,\" it said. \nFoxconn declined to comment on whether the possible investment is linked to Trump's election. \nTrump tweeted that Son told him Softbank's investment would not have happened if Trump hadn't won the U.S. election. After the meeting, Son said he told Trump he would like to \"celebrate his presidential job\" because Trump has made deregulation part of his platform. \nBut it wasn't clear how much of the money Son pledged might have ended up in the U.S. anyway. \nIn October, weeks before the election, SoftBank and the government of Saudi Arabia announced plans to form a $100 billion fund to invest in technology companies around the world. Son told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that the money he promised Trump would come from the huge fund. \nIt wasn't clear why Son was carrying a document with Foxconn's name on it. The two companies are separate, but they have partnered on robotics. Son is known to be friends with Foxconn's founder, Terry Gou. \nThe role that Foxconn and other foreign firms play in manufacturing iPhones and other Apple products became a theme for Trump on the campaign trail. \n\"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" he said in January. \nBut he was oversimplifying the situation. \nSome iPhone and iPad parts are already made in the U.S. And moving all the assembly jobs from China would be almost impossible under current conditions. \nFoxconn has talked in the past of increasing its U.S. presence to meet the needs of its American customers. It said in 2013 that it would spend $30 million on a new factory in Pennsylvania, adding to plants in Texas and Indiana. \nThe company declined to provide updated information Wednesday on what operations it currently has in the U.S. or where things stand with the Pennsylvania project. \n-- Jill Disis and David Goldman contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller has tweeted that November has set an all-time record for App Store sales. November 2016 was a record breaker for the #AppStore – the highest monthly sales ever in App Store history! \n— Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 7, 2016 \nSchiller didn’t give any numbers for either sales or downloads. \nThe holiday season usually sees the highest sales of the year, Apple announcing back in January that it had achieved more than $1.1B sales in just two weeks, the largest holiday app revenue achieved to date. With app sales showing no sign of slowing, it’s likely that we’ll see a similar announcement in the new year. Data from App Annie suggests that global mobile app revenue will hit $50B this year, and $101B by 2020. Apple yesterday shared its annual ‘ Best of ‘ lists highlighting top apps, movies, music, TV and more of 2016. P hoto editing app Prisma was named iPhone App of the Year. Guides",
