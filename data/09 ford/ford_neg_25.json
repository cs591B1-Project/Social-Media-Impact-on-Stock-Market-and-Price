      "title": "The Ford Mustang GT Is Germany's Greatest Ever Cop Car",
      "text": "Comparison Comprehensive database of all models Research Tool Search vehicles by make, style, price, specs and more The Ford Mustang GT Is Germany's Greatest Ever Cop Car by Michael Hines Share on Facebook Share on Twitter If only the police would use it to chase down speeding Audis and BMWs. Germany’s police motorpool is slowly but surely being invaded by American cars . Last year we saw a Corvette get the “polizei” treatment and now the Mustang GT has been added to the force. Just like the aforementioned ‘Vette, this Mustang was created for promotional purposes and made its debut at the Essen Motor Show. Wolf Racing was behind this project, which sees the GT getting more power and an adjustable coilover suspension in addition to its sharp new livery. Thanks to a new exhaust and ECU tune the GT now makes 455 horsepower. Note that the Euro-spec GT is down on power compared to the version sold in America; it makes 421 horses as opposed to 435. Other additions include that spoiler (nicely sized) and roof-mounted lights which will never be used to chase bad guys down. The reason being is that the Mustang GT, like all the cop cars that debut at the Essen Motor Show, will be a spokecar for safety. In this case the cause is safe tuning. The polizei Mustang GT will dedicate 12 months of its life to the campaign, hitting events and car shows to raise awareness. After the Mustang was deemed unfit for service by the Australian police we thought it would never be issued a badge and a gun. It’s nice to see that the Germans gave the Ford a second shot at serving and protecting.",

      "title": "Ford nearly runs out of cylinders to deactivate on 1.0-liter engine",
      "text": "Ford launches Fiesta Red and Black Editions with 140 PS 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine \nAvailable at engine speeds of up to 4,500 rpm, cylinder deactivation for the three-pot turbocharged unit represents the joint effort of Ford’s engineers based in three countries: Germany, U.K., and United States. They worked together with Schaeffler Group to perfect the technology, which required the development of new software capable of detecting when it’s the right time to turn off/on the cylinder. \nTo increase the 1.0-liter EcoBoost’s refinement especially when running on just two cylinders, Ford has developed new engine mounts, drive shafts, suspension bushes, as well as a dual-mass flywheel and a vibration-damping clutch disc. In addition, a revamped camshaft chain and valve rockers were necessary to increase the unit’s durability. \nLaunched back in 2012 on the Focus, the three-cylinder mill is currently available in three outputs: 100, 125, and 140 hp. No less than eleven models sold in Europe are available with the 1.0-liter EcoBoost, including the new Fiesta introduced yesterday. \nSource: Ford   2017 Ford Fiesta Hide press release Show press release FORD TO OFFER FUEL-SAVING CYLINDER DEACTIVATION TECH FOR 1.0 LITRE ECOBOOST; GLOBAL FIRST FOR A 3-CYLINDER ENGINE Ford to launch variable displacement for the multi-award-winning 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine using cylinder deactivation technology from early 2018 Technology will be a global first on a three-cylinder engine; can stop or restart combustion in 14 milliseconds and improve CO2 and fuel efficiency by up to 6 per cent Ford engineers across Europe defy industry opinion by further enhancing three-cylinder engine’s fuel efficiency with no compromise on performance or refinement \nCOLOGNE, Germany, Nov. 29, 2016 – Ford today announced that the multi-award-winning 1.0‑litre EcoBoost petrol engine is to be offered with innovative cylinder deactivation technology for further reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency. \nFord’s compact and powerful 1.0-litre EcoBoost will in early 2018 become the first three-cylinder engine in the world to feature cylinder deactivation. The accomplishment is delivered through innovative engineering by Ford engineers across Europe, and defies industry opinion that a three-cylinder, variable capacity engine could not deliver the refinement needed for passenger car applications. \nCylinder deactivation will deliver reduced running costs for 1.0-litre EcoBoost customers by automatically stopping fuel delivery and valve operation for one of the engine’s cylinders in conditions where full capacity is not needed, such as when coasting or cruising with light demand on the engine. \nAn example of the advanced engineering that enables Ford to deliver the power of choice to customers with fuel efficient petrol, diesel and electrified powertrains, the technology can disengage or re-engage one cylinder in 14 milliseconds – 20 times faster than the blink of an eye. Combined with advanced solutions to counteract vibrations, cylinder deactivation will be imperceptible to drivers in terms of operation and engine performance. \n“Ford has pushed back the boundaries of powertrain engineering once again to further improve the acclaimed 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine, and prove that there is still untapped potential for even the best internal combustion engines to deliver better fuel efficiency for customers,” said Bob Fascetti, vice president, Global Powertrain Engineering, Ford Motor Company. \nMaking the best even better The cylinder deactivation system developed by Ford engineers in Aachen and Cologne in Germany, Dagenham and Dunton in the U.K, and Dearborn in the U.S., in collaboration with Ford’s engineering partners at the Schaeffler Group, improves fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions by reducing friction and pumping demand inside the engine. \nSimple in concept but featuring advanced engineering that enables it to operate at engine speeds of up to 4,500 rpm – when valves are each opening and closing almost 40 times per second – the system uses engine oil pressure to activate a special valve rocker and interrupt the connection between the camshaft and the valves of cylinder No. 1. \nSophisticated software determines the optimum moment to deactivate the cylinder based on factors including speed, throttle position and engine load. A new single-piece camshaft module – similar to the design debuted earlier this year for the all-new Ford EcoBlue diesel engine – frees space within the cylinder head for new oil channels and valve-switching componentry. \n“With the variable capacity delivered by cylinder deactivation, drivers get the power and performance of the whole engine when they need it, and the enhanced fuel efficiency of a smaller engine when they don’t,” said Denis Gorman, powertrain engineer, Ford of Europe. “Our research shows that in most driving scenarios the system will be active for just a few seconds at a time, making fast and seamless operation crucial, and has the potential to improve fuel efficiency by up to 6 per cent.” \nFord’s single-cylinder deactivation design reduces complexity to make volume production achievable, but also presented significant challenges in maintaining the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine’s acclaimed refinement – delivered using innovations including an offset crankshaft configuration and deliberately “unbalanced” flywheel and pulley that counteract vibration. \nA new dual-mass flywheel and a vibration-damping clutch disc help neutralise engine oscillations when running on two cylinders, especially at lower rpm, and enable a wider operating range. Intake and exhaust valves are closed when the system is active, trapping gasses to provide a spring effect that helps balance forces across the three cylinders for refinement, and also retain temperatures inside the cylinder that maintain fuel efficiency when reactivated. \nNew engine mounts, drive shafts and suspension bushes also will be specially tuned for refinement. The 1.0-litre EcoBoost will feature enhanced durability to cope with the different loading forces resulting from cylinder deactivation, including a new camshaft chain, and valve rockers formed using advanced metal injection moulding. \n“Cylinder deactivation adjusts the effective engine capacity to maximise fuel efficiency, and to deliver the greatest benefit to customers, needs to be triggered in as many driving scenarios as possible,” said Carsten Weber, manager, Powertrain Research & Advanced Engineering, Ford of Europe. “We intensively tested the system in real world conditions using a range of deactivation strategies to develop a system that maximises the fuel efficiency without compromising driving comfort.” \nGame-changing 1.0-litre EcoBoost Ford’s 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine was launched in the Ford Focus in 2012, and uses Ford EcoBoost technologies including high-pressure direct fuel injection, Twin-independent Variable Cam Timing and turbocharging to deliver optimised fuel efficiency alongside the power and performance of a naturally aspirated 1.6‑litre engine. \nThe 1.0‑litre EcoBoost was earlier this year voted best in class at the International Engine of the Year Awards for the fifth year in a row. In 2014, the 1.0-litre EcoBoost became the first engine to be named overall International Engine of the Year for a third time in a row, and also was in 2012 named “Best New Engine.” \nThe compact engine – with a block small enough to fit into an aeroplane’s overhead locker – is available with 100 PS, 125 PS and 140 PS – delivering a greater power-per-litre ratio than a Bugatti Veyron supercar. \nEleven Ford models, including Fiesta, EcoSport, B-MAX, Focus, C-MAX, Grand C‑MAX, Tourneo and Transit Connect, Tourneo and Transit Courier, and Mondeo are available in Europe with the three-cylinder engine. One in five all-new Ford vehicles sold in Europe in last year were equipped with the 1.0-ltre EcoBoost, including almost two in five Fiestas. About this article",

      "text": "Europe Ford Ford packs new Fiesta with advanced tech; adds Vignale, crossover variants Ford will add a Fiesta Vignale variant with upmarket features including large alloy wheels and a hexagonal front grille. Automotive News Europe November 30, 2016 06:01 CET \nCOLOGNE, Germany -- Ford of Europe is adding upscale and crossover versions of its new Fiesta, along with advanced safety technologies, to boost the car’s competitiveness in the tough subcompact segment. \nFord unveiled the new-generation Fiesta at its European headquarters here today. The Fiesta will go on sale in Europe next summer. The U.S. version is expected to launch in 2018. \n\"Our next-generation Fiesta will deliver an option for every driver -- from downsizing customers who want big-car quality in a small car package, to growing numbers of crossover consumers,\" Ford of Europe CEO Jim Farley said in a statement . \nFord said the new Fiesta has the most sophisticated range of driver assistance technologies and connectivity features offered to date in a volume small car in Europe. It has technology that small-car customers \"could only have dreamed of just a few years ago,\" Farley said. \nThe Fiesta’s 15 driver assistance technologies include a number of firsts for Ford or the segment, such as: \n• Enhanced pedestrian detection technology that can help prevent collisions at night by detecting people who are in or near the road ahead, or who may cross the vehicle's path. \n• A parking assistant that helps drivers find suitable spaces and park hands-free nose-to-tail and side-by-side with other cars. It can also apply the brakes to prevent low-speed bumps if drivers do not respond to system guidance and proximity warnings while maneuvering. \n• A \"Cross Traffic\" system that warns drivers reversing out of a parking space of vehicles that may soon be crossing behind them. \nThe Fiesta, which will have three- and five-door variants, has grown in size to distance it from Ford’s new Ka+ , which targets European customers seeking budget cars. At 4040mm, the Fiesta is 71mm longer than the current car. It is also 21mm wider. \nRegistrations of high-specification subcompact models have grown 24 percent year-on-year while demand for entry level models has grown 11 percent, Roelant de Waard, Ford of Europe’s sales and marketing chief, said in the statement. Ford now offers a \"greater choice\" for subcompact segment customers, he said. \nUpscale, crossover variants \nWhile the Ka+ battles in the lower regions of the segment, Ford has added upscale styling and interior features to the Fiesta. \nFor a more premium look the car now has parking sensors flush with the body panels. The shut-line between the roof and tailgate by has been reduced by more than 30 percent and road noise is reduced by 7 percent, Ford said. \nThe Fiesta’s top model will be the Vignale version and it extends the brand’s premium trim into subcompacts for the first time, joining the Mondeo, S-Max, Kuga and Edge Vignale models. Upmarket features include 18-inch alloy wheel designs, quilted leather seats and a hexagonal front grille. \nHigh-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Mercedes-Benz and Audi. Ford now wants to take further advantage of the desire of some customers for upscale cars. \"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Farley said. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" \nFarley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. \nThe Fiesta also will have a new crossover-styled variant named Active, which will be the first in a new lineup of Active vehicles to be rolled out across the Ford range. The Fiesta Active has SUV-inspired styling that includes raised ride height, roof bars and additional body cladding. The Fiesta Active has a raised ride height, roof bars and additional body cladding. \nThe Fiesta's sporty ST-Line model takes its styling cues from a likely future ST sports version to include a rear spoiler, sports seats and a stiffer suspension. Other model trims include a Titanium model with a unique front bumper and grille. \nFord described the Fiesta’s interior as \"revolutionary\" in part because of its new floating touchscreen. Three different screen sizes are offered, with 8-inch and 6.5-inch screens using the latest Sync 3 version of Ford's infotainment system. Ford said the new system reduces the number of buttons on the center console by half. The smallest 4.2-inch screen is backed up with a smartphone dock to allow customers to use phone-based navigation systems. \nPowerful diesel \nLaunch models in Europe will come with a choice of three versions of Ford’s 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost gasoline engine, with the most powerful delivering 138 hp. A new six-speed manual transmission and active grille shutters cut CO2 emissions to 97 grams per kilometer. A 1.1-liter naturally aspirated version of the EcoBoost engine replaces the 1.25-liter entry gasoline unit. \nThe Fiesta will also offer a 118-hp 1.5-liter diesel, the highest powered diesel Ford has included in Fiesta’s engine range to date. An 84-hp diesel will also be offered with 10 hp more than the current equivalent engine and CO2 emissions of 82g/km. \nThe Fiesta will continue to be built for European sales in Cologne, Germany. It uses an updated version of the platform used by EcoSport small SUV and Ka+ hatchback. \nPricing is likely to stay competitive with that of the current car, a Ford spokesman said. However the Fiesta’s starting price has increased because Ford has dropped Fiesta’s two entry trim levels to make way for the new the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+, which competes for subcompact customers like the Fiesta after moving out of the minicar segment. \nThe Fiesta is Ford's top-selling passenger car in Europe and was the second best-selling subcompact car in the region through October, according to data from JATO Dynamics market researchers (see chart below). \nReuters contributed to this report VW Polo in lead Top 5 best-selling subcompacts in Europe in first 10 months, with % change 1.

      "text": "show chapters Ford CEO: Free trade is a high priority for us      5 Hours Ago | 01:37 Keeping free trade with the European Union must be the priority for the upcoming Brexit negotiations, the chief executive of Ford told CNBC. \n\"What's really important to us is a stable trade environment between obviously the U.K. and the EU and that's our big priority, because we want to continue to build a profitable business and also secure a stable future for our over 14000 employees that we do have in the U.K,\" Mark Fields, president and CEO at Ford Motor Company, said. \nThe U.S. carmaking giant is one of the best examples of how firms based in the U.K. could be impacted from Britain's departure from the EU. Ford's factory in Dagenham supplies diesel engines to the rest of Europe and any hurdles to such supply could affect the business across the member-bloc. \n\"We are obviously monitoring the environment and the developments so we can factor that in our scenarios and at the same time we're being very forward in going to the various governments in the UK and the EU…about what our priorities are and what the impacts this could mean to the economy,\" Fields added.\n\nMark Neuling | CNBC Mark Fields, president and Chief Executive Officer of Ford Motor Company. Data released Tuesday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed that tariffs related to Brexit could add up to £1,500 ($,1871) to the average cost of an imported car. \nJohn Leech, head of automotive for KPMG in the U.K., said in a statement accompanying the SMMT report that \"the UK automotive industry is already the most productive in Europe but faces increasing competition from lower cost countries and uncertainty following the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU.\" \nRecently, the Japanese carmaker Nissan struck a deal with the British government to ensure it would continue investing in the U.K. despite the uncertainty around the Brexit vote. Nissan was unsure whether to proceed with investments in Sunderland after the Brexit vote. \nBoth Nissan and the U.K. government have been criticized for not making public the \"reassurances\" given to the carmaker in exchange for its investment commitment. \n\"I don't know what was given to Nissan,\" Fields told CNBC, indicating that Ford is willing to keep investing in the U.K. but at the expense that free trade with the EU is not disrupted. \n\"We want to contribute to economic development but what is a high priority for us is free trade between the EU and the U.K.,\" he said.",

      "text": "BMW, Daimler, Ford, And Volkswagen Sign JV For Brand-Independent Charging Network In Europe BMW, Daimler, Ford, And Volkswagen Sign JV For Brand-Independent Charging Network In Europe By CarAndBike Team View Photos In a landmark to ramp up electric mobility and push mass-market battery electric vehicles (BEV) adoption, BMW Group, Daimler AG , Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche recently signed a joint venture to create the highest-powered brand-independent charging network in Europe. The companies have come together to facilitate the quick establishment of a substantial number of charging stations to enable long-range travel for battery electric vehicle drivers. \nThe aforementioned network, based on Combined Charging System (CCS) standard technology, will expand the existing technical standard for AC- and DC charging of electric vehicles. BEVs devised to accept this full power of the charge stations can recharge brand-independently in a fraction of the time of today's BEVs. The network is intended to serve all CCS equipped vehicles in Europe. \nThe planned ultra-fast high-powered charging network with power levels up to 350 kW will be decidedly faster than the most powerful charging system deployed today. The formation is envisaged to start in 2017 with an initial target of about 400 sites in Europe. Furthermore, the JV intends to offer access to thousands of such charging points by 2020. \nThe goal of the JV is to empower long-distance travel through open-network charging stations along highways and major thoroughfares, which is currently not feasible for most BEV drivers. And with the advancement of battery-powered cars across the world, it is imperative that charging experience becomes as convenient as refueling at conventional fuel stations. \nThe carmakers involved in the JV intend to make substantial investments to create the network, thus highlighting each company's conviction in the future of electric mobility. While the founding partners - BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen Group - will be equal partners in the Joint Venture, other automobile manufacturers will be encouraged to participate in the network to help establish convenient charging solutions for BEV customers.

      "text": "\nWhile electric cars like the new Chevy Bolt are curing some of the range anxiety issues that plagued earlier EVs, there's still one other issue - charging times. Today it takes about 30 minutes to almost fully charge some electric cars, but BMW , Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen have announced a new partnership that will dramatically cut down that time.\n\n\nThe four major automakers announced they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create the highest-powered charging network in Europe. The goal is to quickly build a sizable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for electric vehicles, which will make them even more desirable. The idea of a charging network isn't entirely new, since Tesla and Chargepoint have built similar networks in the U.S., but the big news is how much power these chargers will pack.\nRelated: VW’s new electric car goes further and costs less than the Tesla 3 or Chevy Bolt \n\nToday's DC Fast Chargers max out at 50 kW of power, which can charge an electric car's battery up to 80 percent in as little as 20 minutes. The new chargers that will comprise this new partnership will pack up to seven times more power at 350 kW, which will significantly drop the amount of time it takes to recharge an electric car to around 10 minutes.\nThe first chargers will arrive in 2017, with an initial target of about 400 charging sites in Europe. By 2020, the plan is to have thousands of high-powered charging points in operation. The announcement doesn't include any networks outside Europe, like in the U.S., but this summer the White House announced that the Department of Energy is researching the feasibility of 350 kW fast chargers.\n+ Daimler \nAll images © Volkswagen and Daimler \n\n",

      "text": "Ford will begin testing its self-driving cars in Europe in 2017 (F) Published by Business Insider on Wed, 30 Nov 2016 Fords self-driving cars are coming to Europe. The Detroit automaker plans to begin testing its autonomous cars in European countries next year, the company announced Tuesday.Because rules of the road, traffic signs, and road layouts differ from country to country in Europe, it's important that the company test in the region, Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of automated driving at Ford of Europe, said in a press statement.Ford has a bold vision for its driverless future.The company currently has about 30 self-driving cars in its fleet, but it plans to triple that number in 2017, bringing the total number of cars in its fleet to about 100.What's more, the company also plans to launch a fleet of autonomous taxis for public use in at least one city in the US by 2021. But, unlike other automakers, Fords self-driving cars won't have a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals.Most major car companies have said that they are planning to roll out a self-driving car sometime during the next five years, but the levels of autonomy vary. Many car companies have committed to semi-autonomous systems that enable the car to be completely autonomous in certain driving situations, but that still have a steering wheels so that the driver can take back control of the vehicle when needed.However, Ford wants to make its cars fully autonomous because it sees these semi-autonomous systems as a possible liability. This is because people begin to trust the systems too much and fail to re-engage control of the vehicle when needed.We are not in a race to be first, but we are in a race to do the right thing, which is why we are building on more than ten years of experience on how to responsibly deliver a ride service that is fully autonomous that does not require a driver to re-engage, Ken Washington, vice president of advanced research and engineering, told Business Insider during an interview in August.Our research has led us to understand that it [re-engagement] is very difficult to do and we dont know how to enable that, so that is what led us to pursuing a full level four autonomous vehicle and this re-engagement issue goes away, Washington said.SEE ALSO:Ford is building cars without steering wheels, gas or brake pedalsJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: A $1 billion city is being built in New Mexico ' but no one will be allowed to live there",

      "text": "Ford To Start Testing Self-Driving Cars In Europe Next Year 30 November 2016, 6:56 am EST By Aaron Mamiit Tech Times Automobiles: A Brief History Of Cars Now Playing Ford is planning to start testing its self-driving cars in Europe next year in facilities in the United Kingdom and Germany. The program will contribute to the company's plan to begin mass production of fully autonomous vehicles by 2021. ( Robert Cianflone | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nFord is planning to start testing its self-driving cars in Europe next year, the automobile manufacturer told TechCrunch. \nThe news comes a few months after the company announced a 2021 target to mass produce fully autonomous vehicles that will be utilized for ride-sharing services. European Tests For Ford Self-Driving Cars \nAccording to the TechCrunch report, Ford will start the testing of its self-driving cars at its engineering center in Essex, United Kingdom, and in its research and advanced engineering facilities in Cologne and Aachen, Germany. \nFord said that it will be revealing more specific details of its planned testing in Europe soon. However, it noted that the facilities are knowledgeable of the current and upcoming initiatives of the company regarding driver assistance technology, which means that they are in a good position to also be in charge of the self-driving projects that Ford will launch in Europe. \n\"It is important that we extend our testing to Europe,\" said Ford Europe's manager for Automated Driving Thomas Lukaszewicz. This is because road regulations and rules change for each country in Europe, with different road layouts and traffic signs. The likelihood of cyclists traveling alongside cars is also higher in Europe. Ford's Self-Driving Technology Plans \nCurrently, Ford has around 30 self-driving cars, though the company is planning to triple the fleet next year to around 100 vehicles. \nFord has made several investments into self-driving technology, with two recent ones being the $6.6 million investment that it made into 3D mapping startup Civil Maps and the joint $150 million investment with Chinese search company Baidu in Velodyne LiDAR . \nThese investments are part of the long-term plan of Ford to be able to get self-driving cars into mass production by 2021. In addition to these investments, Ford CEO Mark Fields said that the company will be doubling the size of its research team in Palo Alto, while also expanding its facilities in Silicon Valley by 150,000 square feet. Ford European Survey On Self-Driving Cars \nIn relation to its planned testing of self-driving cars in Europe, Ford also commissioned a survey among Europeans on their opinions regarding the technology and the benefits that they see from utilizing it. \nAmong the 4,000 respondents, 16 percent said that they would trust self-driving cars to serve as the transportation of their children to and from school. The survey also found that 72 percent are planning to use the time freed up by riding self-driving cars for telephone conversations and 64 percent would use the time to eat while in transit.  ",

      "text": "View Slideshow \nWhile electric cars like the new Chevy Bolt are curing some of the range anxiety issues that plagued earlier EVs, there’s still one other issue – charging times. Today it takes about 30 minutes to almost fully charge some electric cars, but BMW , Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen have announced a new partnership that will dramatically cut down that time. \nThe four major automakers announced they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create the highest-powered charging network in Europe. The goal is to quickly build a sizable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for electric vehicles, which will make them even more desirable. The idea of a charging network isn’t entirely new, since Tesla and Chargepoint have built similar networks in the U.S., but the big news is how much power these chargers will pack. \nRelated: VW’s new electric car goes further and costs less than the Tesla 3 or Chevy Bolt \nToday’s DC Fast Chargers max out at 50 kW of power, which can charge an electric car’s battery up to 80 percent in as little as 20 minutes. The new chargers that will comprise this new partnership will pack up to seven times more power at 350 kW, which will significantly drop the amount of time it takes to recharge an electric car to around 10 minutes. \nThe first chargers will arrive in 2017, with an initial target of about 400 charging sites in Europe. By 2020, the plan is to have thousands of high-powered charging points in operation. The announcement doesn’t include any networks outside Europe, like in the U.S., but this summer the White House announced that the Department of Energy is researching the feasibility of 350 kW fast chargers. \nAll images © Volkswagen and Daimler View Comments \nYou must be logged in to post a comment.

      "text": "Top automakers in Germany have agreed to jointly invest in thousands of ultra-fast charging sites across Europe to boost mainstream acceptance of electric cars, the companies said.\nSpurred on by the success of U.S. rival Tesla which has received huge pre-orders for its Model 3 car, German rivals such as Volkswagen vlkay and Daimler’s dai Mercedes are accelerating their own electric car programs.\nBut scarce charging points and sticker prices for electric cars that still exceed those of comparable combustion models stifle mass-market demand despite sales incentives.\nTo help turn the tables, VW, its Audi and Porsche luxury brands, BMW, Daimler, and Ford’s European division are planning a joint venture to fund the setting-up of charging sites starting next year, the six automakers said in a joint statement published on Tuesday.\nThe manufacturers want to create about 400 charging sites in a first step and, by 2020, ensure that customers have access to thousands of charging points, they said, citing a memorandum of understanding. The network will be based on so-called combined charging system (CCS) technology, enhancing existing AC and DC charging standards and allowing for ultra-fast power levels of up to 350 kilowatt hours.\n“The availability of high-power stations allows long-distance electric mobility for the first time and will convince more and more customers to opt for an electric vehicle,” Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said.\nHere’s All We Know About GM’s All-Electric Chevy Bolt\nIn September, BMW and Volkswagen partnered with California startup ChargePoint to install nearly 100 public electric vehicle fast-charging stations along two of the busiest stretches of highway in the United States. The collaboration, dubbed the Express Charging Corridors Initiative, is aimed at meeting demand for fast-charging stations and to help encourage consumers to make the switch from gas to electric-powered cars.\nThe efforts in Europe and the U.S. aim to help automakers better compete with Tesla, which has built its own vast network of fast-charging Superchargers along highways throughout North America, Europe, and Asia that are available to Roadster, Model S, and Model X owners for free. Tesla recently changed the terms of its free-for-life supercharger access. Tesla announced this month that customers who buy cars after January 1, 2017 will have 1,000 miles of free charging . After those miles are used up, customers will have to pay for charging.\nExecutives across the industry predict electric cars will become increasingly popular thanks to advances that make batteries get cheaper and more powerful and the Volkswagen emissions scandal , which has sparked a regulatory backlash against diesel-engine vehicles.\nThe six automakers said they will be equal partners in the initiative and also asked other competitors to participate in the project, adding the joint venture will cooperate with regional partners.",

      "text": "LONDON   BMW, Daimler, Ford and VW to create super-fast charging network (https://www.autovolo.co.uk/latest-news/299) Four of the largest and most influential car makers have joined forces to build a new electric vehicle charging network for Europe.Ford, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen claim that they will \"create the highest-powered charging network in Europe\", achieving up to 350kW of power – far more than the most powerful existing power points.The project will be rolled out in 2017, and the companies plan to build an initial network of 400 sites. Three years later, in 2020, the aim is to have \"thousands\" of charging stations.Ford has said that situating the new charging points on a range of motorways and main roads will make electric vehicles easier to use on longer road trips.The American company has also said that electric car charging \"is expected to evolve to be as convenient as refueling at conventional gas stations\".The new joint venture will offer super-fast charging to drivers of any electric vehicle equipped with Combined Charging System technology, no matter which manufacturer has built the vehicle.Dr. Dieter Zetsche, chairman of the board of management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, said: \"The breakthrough of e-mobility requires two things: convincing vehicles and a comprehensive charging infrastructure. By 2025, our portfolio will include more than ten fully electric passenger cars. \"Together with our partners, we are now installing the highest-powered charging infrastructure in Europe. The availability of high-power stations allows long-distance e-mobility for the first time and will convince more and more customers to opt for an electric vehicle.\" Read More: BMW, Daimler, Ford and VW to create super-fast charging network | Latest News | AutoVolo.co.uk ( https://www.autovolo.co.uk/",

(EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, November 30, 2016, 9:50 AM \nThe election of Donald Trump, with his promises to rid Washington of establishment politics, slash regulations, bust up trade deals and generally shake up the status quo, brought with it a great many questions about the future of the automotive industry. \nWith his appointment of a D.C. insider to the head of the Department of Transportation, it appears that when it comes to the stability that automakers so dearly crave, the soon-to-be Commander in Chief’s bark is worse than his bite. \nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. \nThat’s not to say things won’t change, but it seems unlikely that any worst-case scenarios will be realized. \nI’ve got a lot more on Trump’s DOT pick as well as electric chargers in Europe, a new Ford Fiesta and more in this Wednesday edition of the Daily Drive-Thru. Trump taps Chao for Transportation Elaine Chao became the first Asian-American woman to serve in a presidential cabinet when she was confirmed as President George W. Bush's secretary of labor. (VCG via Getty Images) \nFormer George W. Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao has been tapped by President-elect Trump to head the Transportation Department. From this position, Chao would oversee highway safety, air travel, international transportation agreements and more. Top priorities for the agency will likely include the oversight of autonomous driving technology and fuel consumption standards. \nChao is no stranger to the swamp candidate Trump promised to drain. She headed the Labor Department during all eight years of President George W. Bush’s tenure and served as a deputy secretary in the Transportation Department under the elder President Bush. In recent years she’s held a fellowship at Heritage Foundation, a conservative D.C. think tank, and occasionally contributes to Fox News. She’s also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \nBased on her tenure with the Labor Department, it’s likely that Chao will bring a more hands-off approach to safety regulations, which begs the question: what will become of the self-driving guidelines released by the DOT earlier this year, which call for prior review of new technology before it’s made available to the public. \nShe also will play an integral role in the proposed trillion-dollar infrastructure overall that Trump touted on the campaign trail. Will this investment include sensors for autonomous vehicles? Will she continue the Obama administration’s push for more EV chargers? Only time will tell. Ford introduces next generation Fiesta Ford introduced four versions of its new Fiesta subcompact car in Germany last year. (Ford) \nFord has restyled the Fiesta for the 2017 model year, giving the subcompact car significant styling updates, new trim levels and significant technological improvements. Ford introduced the seventh generation Fiesta during an event at its factory in Cologne, Germany, where the Fiesta is made. \nThe Fiesta is, first and foremost, a European car, having been sold in that market continuously since 1976 while it has only recently been available in North America, making its return to the States in 2010 after a 30-year hiatus; that in mind, it’s not clear how closely the Fiesta displayed yesterday will match the one that ultimately makes it to U.S. dealerships. \nIn Europe, trim levels include Titanium, the sporty ST-Line and the premium Vignale, while the U.S. versions will likely be limited to the same S, SE, Titanium and ST that we’ve seen in the past. Ford also introduced a crossover variant called the Active and I wouldn’t be surprised if that made its way to North America as well. \nNew Fiestas, at least in Europe, will come available with Sync 3, an 8-inch infotainment screen, 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine equipped with cylinder deactivation and a Bang & Olufsen speaker system. \nDuring yesterday’s Go Further event, Ford also announced that it would begin testing autonomous vehicles in Europe starting next year, adding to efforts currently under way in the U.S. \nSource: Ford Automakers invest in quick charging in Europe BMW, Daimler, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen will all contribute to the construction of a super-charging network in Europe starting next year. (Ford) \nIn other European auto news, several top automakers have committed to building a high-powered network of quick-charging electric vehicle power stations throughout the continent. BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen, along with its Audi and Porsche brands, will finance the construction of up to 400 fast charging sites to serve their various new battery-only and plug-in hybrid vehicles. \nWith power capacities of up to 350 kilowatts, the direct current, or DC, chargers will be significantly more powerful than the chargers of today. The ultimate goal is a network consisting of thousands of charge stations throughout the continent that will allow for long-range EV travel, thus potentially driving up interest in the vehicles. \nThe collaborative project also should ensure some uniformity in terms of power port design from the various brands, something that will be critical as vehicle electrification becomes more prevalent. The project will commence next year. \nSource: Ford Judge delays VW’s 3.0-liter diesel hearing Porsche will be able to sell diesel-powered Cayennes, but it will have to do so with steep discounts. (Porsche) \nOwners of emissions-hiding, 3.0-liter diesel-engine Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen vehicles will have to wait a little longer to get their buyback deals. Earlier this month, Volkswagen reached a tentative agreement on the roughly 80,000 affected vehicles in the U.S., most of which are premium SUVs. The automaker agreed to buy back 20,000 older vehicles and fix the remaining 60,000. \nYesterday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer postponed a hearing to discuss the deal until December 16, giving the German company time to hammer out the final details of the agreement with U.S. regulators and customers. Look for the deal to resemble the accord struck this summer over Volkswagen’s 2.0-liter diesel engine vehicles in which the company agreed to pay owners between $5,100 and $10,000 each as compensation for selling them cars outfitted with illegal software. \nIn the meantime, Porsche has said it will be able to sell the 1,300 to 1,500 Cayenne TDI models that are currently stuck on dealer lots with steep discounts. Once these new vehicles receive the software fix, Porsche will be able to sell them at used car prices, so if you don’t mind the guilt of pumping out as much as 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide, this might be the time to get yourself a Porsche. \nSources: Reuters , Jalopnik EV startup to open Arizona plant \nYet another Bay Area EV startup will set up shop in the desert. Following in the footsteps of electric car makers Tesla Motors and Faraday Future, both of which are working on factories in Nevada, Lucid Motors announced yesterday that it would build a plant of its own in southern Arizona. \nThe Silicon Valley startup, which plans on rolling out a car with 400 miles of driving range by 2018, settled on the 500-acre site in Casa Grande in part because of its proximity to rail lines, freeways, ports and training facilities, but also because of its proximity to the company’s Menlo Park headquarters and the northern Mexico state of Sonora, from which it will source many of its vehicle parts. \nLucid, formerly known as Atieva, plans on breaking ground on the facility next year with the hope of beginning production in 2018 and reaching full capacity by 2022. \nSources: Automotive News , Autoblog \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Tuesday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "text": "  1:03 am Ford has announced it will begin testing self-driving cars on European roads as early as next year.Details about what Ford's European testing program will look like haven't been made public yet. However, executives pointed out that testing autonomous cars in Europe is important because the Old Continent presents unique challenges that aren't found on our side of the pond.\"Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists,\" explained Thomas Lukaszewicz, Ford of Europe's autonomous driving manager, in an interview with British magazine Autocar .The Blue Oval is already testing self-driving cars in the United States; notably, it became the first automaker to test autonomous vehicles at night and in the snow. Engineers test cars in real-world situations on the roads of Arizona, California, and Michigan, as well as on a closed-off 32-acre site located next to the University of Michigan. Ford's first self-driving vehicle might not be offered to the general public. The company recently announced plans to build a high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle by 2021, but it will be part of a ride-sharing or ride-hailing program. When the technology will reach showrooms on either side of the Atlantic Ocean hasn't been announced yet. \n ",

      "text": "COLOGNE, Germany -- Ford of Europe CEO Jim Farley will call for a level playing field for automakers when he meets with the British chancellor this week to discuss the financial implications of Britain's exit from the European Union.\n\"We think it would be really unwise to disadvantage one company over another,\" Farley said in reference to the apparent deal secured by Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn in October that led to the Japanese automaker promising increased investment in its plant in Sunderland, England.\n\"We've got more employees than Nissan in the UK and half those are engineers, high intellectual property jobs, very important jobs,\" Farley told Automotive News Europe at the sidelines of the launch of the new Fiesta small car here on Tuesday. He said that Ford was the UK's No. 2 automaker in terms of employees after Jaguar Land Rover. Ford builds engines in two UK plants, as well carrying out r&d in the country, but has no vehicle manufacuring.\nFarley will meet with UK chancellor Philip Hammond this week. \"We're really excited to talk to the UK government. It's really important to get clarity around the tariff situation,\" he said.\nBritain would lose its free trade agreement with the EU if it failed to agree terms to stay in the single market, something Farley said he was keen to avoid.\nThe local manufacturers' association, the SMMT, said on Tuesday that applying tariffs could push up the cost of an imported car by 1,500 pounds . It quoted analysis saying EU tariffs on cars could add \"at least\" 2.7 billion pounds annually to imports and 1.8 billion pounds to exports.\nFarley said that UK car sales have remained unexpectedly buoyant since the country voted to leave the EU in June. Ford has \"modestly\" increased European production again after reducing it in anticipation of falling sales after the vote. However Ford is seeing more discounting. \"We have seen some deterioration in pricing and the mix of the sales - more Mobility [discounted sales to registered invalid customers], rental and self registered, which we didn't follow,\" he said.\nHe said Ford hasn't revised its total predicted $1.2 billion impact in the next years because of depreciation of the pound against the euro. \"We were hedged to the first quarter of 2017 but then we’re going to feel the force of a weaker sterling,\" he said. Ford imports 75 percent of its 450,000 UK-sold vehicles from EU countries, he said.\nYou can reach Nick Gibbs at ngibbs@crain.com .",

      "title": "Getting to Know the 2017 Ford Fiesta: Details and Specifications",
      "text": "/ Home / News / Car Profile Last night, Ford revealed the all-new Fiesta , a supermini dubbed by the manufacturer as being the “world’s most technologically advanced small car.” The first thing you need to know about the 2017 Ford Fiesta is that the automaker dubs it as the eighth generation, not seventh. The reason for that is not surprising: the facelifted sixth-generation Fiesta is flaunted by FoMoCo’s marketing department as being a generation in its own right. Now that we settled that this is the eighth seventh-generation Fiesta, let’s get down to business. Before the facelifted sixth-gen Fiesta made way for the new kid on the block, Ford deleted lower trim levels (Studio and Style) as an excuse to ramp up the starting price from £10,345 to £13,395 . Why? That’s because the Ford Motor Company intends to push the well-equipped Trend as the lowest trim level available for the Fiesta. Higher up, we have the Titanium, ST-Line, Active, and Vignale. The biggest surprise of this five-trim lineup is the Fiesta Active (pictured), which employs crossover-like styling. With the European market launched planned for next summer, the new Fiesta will be available with 3- and 5-door body styles. Later on, Fiesta will gain an ST variant for those in the market for a hot hatchback with world-class handling dynamics. Until then, however, three humdrum engines will have to suffice. The first of the lot is a naturally aspirated petrol displacing 1.1 liters, available with either 70 PS or 85 PS. Then there’s the 1.0-liter EcoBoost, which will be offered in 100 PS, 125 PS, and 140 PS forms. Be that as it may, only the 100 PS variant of the 1.0-liter turbo will be available with an auto. Rear disc brakes are reserved only for Fiesta models with engines more powerful than 100 PS. For those interested in getting the most miles per gallon from the 2017 Ford Fiesta, there are two 1.5-liter TDCi diesel on the menu, with 85 PS or 120 PS. Size-wise, the Fiesta measures 4,040 mm (159 inches) in length, 1,734 mm (68.2 inches) in width without the side mirrors, 1,483 mm (58.3 inches) in terms of height, and sports a wheelbase of 2,493 mm (98.1 inches). Thus, it’s longer (71 mm), wider (12 mm), and roomier (16 mm more rear legroom) than the seventh facelifted sixth-generation Fiesta. Wheels start with 15-inch steelies and go up to 18-inch alloys like the 10-spoke rollers available on the Fiesta ST-Line . If the panoramic glass roof isn’t to your liking, Ford of Europe will gladly sell you the new Fiesta with contrasting roof finishes: white, black, Bohay Bay Mint or Chrome Copper. Regarding comfort, Ford promises better soundproofing (7 percent better than before at 100 km/h / 62 mph) and doors that are 20 percent easier to close than before. I kid you not, but even the wipers are said to cover 13 percent more windshield area compared to the former-generation Fiesta. On the technological front, SYNC infotainment is available in three flavors: 4.2-, 6.5-, and 8.0-inch units. The instrument cluster now features a digital color screen flanked by analog gauges. Phone mirroring functions such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also available, as is a B&O Play sound system with 10 speakers and a total output of 675 bangin’ watts. Last but not least, safety. For 2017, the Fiesta can be equipped with two cameras, three radar sensors, and 12 ultrasonic sensors to monitor what is going on around the car. Also, the all-new Fiesta can “see” up front at up to 130 meters. Pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection, automatic perpendicular parking, auto braking , auto high beam headlights, rear cross traffic alert, and traffic sign recognition are also featured on the options list. More preliminary technical specifications for the 2017 Ford Fiesta can be reviewed in the PDF attached right under the adjacent promo video.",

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on at 8:59 am Share \nImages courtesy Early Ford V-8 Foundation. \nThe once-backburnered plan to build a replica of Ford’s famed Rotunda as part of the Early Ford V-8 Museum has now returned to the forefront after an anonymous donation that will allow the museum to more than triple in size. \n“This is a huge undertaking but one the V-8 Museum is confident of achieving,” foundation officials wrote in the group’s most recent newsletter. \nPlans for a replica of the Rotunda – the 214-foot wide and 10-story tall structure that Albert Kahn designed for Ford’s exhibit at the 1934 Chicago World’s Fair and which burned down in Dearborn in 1962 – have been discussed since 2007 when the Early Ford V-8 Foundation began work on establishing a permanent facility in Auburn, Indiana, work that resulted in the existing museum’s construction in 2009-2010. \nFoundation members had initially planned to begin building the Rotunda replica (though downsized to roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of its original size) in the museum’s second phase of construction, but by last fall the foundation’s trustees decided to shelve the Rotunda plans – by that point estimated to cost as much as $9 million – in favor of a more modest 8,700-square-foot addition to the museum’s existing 8,040-square-foot space. \nA recent anonymous donation to the museum, however, has allowed the foundation to take those plans down off the shelf. Just as the foundation trustees were ready to finalize plans for that 8,700-square-foot addition, a Ford V-8 collector approached the foundation to offer not only his 17-car collection, but also the funds necessary to build a 10,000-square-foot addition to the museum to house the collection. \nAccording to Josh Conrad, the museum’s collection coordinator, the anonymous donor’s contribution didn’t specifically include the Rotunda replica, “but it made that project a little easier for us to swallow.” \nTo accommodate the donation, the foundation decided to revise its plans. Rather than build its already-planned addition to the west of the existing museum, the foundation would build that addition and the 10,000-square-foot addition – which will include the 98-foot wide Rotunda replica – to the south. Included in those plans are a restoration shop and new entryway to the existing museum as well as a turntable for the Rotunda replica. \nWhile groundbreaking for the additions took place earlier this month and construction is set to begin in the spring, the foundation still needs to raise another $750,000 to complete the funding for the already-planned addition, now measuring in at 9,200 square feet. \n“We’re optimistic we’ll raise the remaining amount by the spring,” Conrad said. “But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. We’re pretty open ended on the timeline for completing construction.” \nThe museum already has the last remaining piece of the Rotunda: the original entrance sign , which foundation members restored and placed out front of the museum in 2013. In addition, the museum has 21 vehicles and 35 engines currently on display, with another 93 vehicles in its legacy program – that is, waiting for display space. \nConrad said eventually the foundation plans to expand the museum to the northwest. “In the long haul, we have plenty of room to expand,” he said. \nFor more information on the Early Ford V-8 Museum and Foundation, visit FordV8Foundation.org .",

      "text": "Kurt Ernst on at 8:00 am Share \nSebring 1966 – Ken Miles and Lloyd Ruby piloted this Ford GT40 Mk II to victory. Photo courtesy of Ford Motorsports History. \nAuto racing has been going on in Sebring, Florida, ever since Miles Collier and Alec Ulmann organized The Sam Collier Memorial Grand Prix of Endurance, run on December 31, 1950. Vintage events at the track aren’t exactly uncommon, but this weekend Historic Sportscar Racing (HSR) will debut a new classic car endurance event with the launch of the Classic 12 Hour Pistons and Props . \nLike HSR’s Classic 24 Hour at Daytona, six categories of cars will compete in a series of four hour-long races, held on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, December 2-4. While not true to the original endurance-themed 12 Hours of Sebring, limiting wear and tear on vintage hardware (and in some cases, vintage drivers) isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and it allows spectators to enjoy closer racing with a wide variety of cars. As if the main event races weren’t enough to keep spectators entertained, the long weekend will also feature the Classic RS Cup Race, the Global GT Race and the Bob Woodman Tires International/American Challenge on Thursday, followed by a series of sprint races on Saturday and Sunday morning. \nThe six car categories include Group A, which covers racing and production cars from 1952 to ’72; Group B, which covers cars from 1973 to ’82; Group C, which covers cars from 1983 to ’93; Group D, which covers cars from 1994 to 2002; Group E, which covers cars from 2003 to ’12; and Group F, dedicated to HSR cars not covered by the other five categories. Look for the entries to include a 1966 McLaren M1B; a 1969 Lola Mk IIIb; a few Ford GT40s; numerous Corvettes, Porsche 911s and BMW CSLs; prototypes from 1986-2010; and a variety of other interesting endurance race cars from the past 65 years. A total of 103 cars are currently signed up to compete, along with 155 drivers. \nSince Sebring was built as a bomber training facility during World War II, it’s fitting that this event will include an aviation component, with a vintage plane display and judging set for Saturday and Sunday. Judging will be conducted by the racing drivers, a list that’s set to include Jochen Mass, Andy Wallace, Butch Leitzinger, Chris Dyson, Frank Stippler and Randy Pobst. \nFor complete information on this weekend’s scheduled events, visit HSRRace.com . For those unable to attend this Sebring soiree on such short notice, fear not: HSR opens its 2017 season with an exhibition race during the 65 th annual 12 Hours of Sebring, scheduled for March 15-18, 2017.",

      "text": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, November 30, 2016, 11:29 AM \nWhile there are plenty of pickup drivers out there who know what they’re doing behind the wheel of their behemoths, as we saw in our last video , there are plenty who really don’t. Today’s video gives us another one of those who would be better off with a small 4-door sedan. While taking his monstrous F-150 off road, our dummy spots what he thinks is a puddle and decides to test what his pickup can handle. \nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. \nNow the everyday driver with the correct amount of brain cells will tell you that before you take a vehicle through a questionable amount of water, it never hurts to do a depth check. However, this genius decides to eye it out and take a guess and ends up being very wrong. Maybe he was trying to impress his friend with the camera, or perhaps he was trying to have fun, but I can’t imagine he did much of either when it turned out that this “puddle” was a lot deeper than two or three feet. When that big puddle turns out to be a six feet deep river. \nDespite having to watch his car sink to the bottom of that “puddle”, and probably having an irreparable amount of water damage once it finally got fished out, he hopefully learned a great lesson. More importantly though, he set a record for our shortest video yet, encapsulating that much stupidity in only eight seconds. Bravo, sir. \nCheck out the rest of our viral videos here . Tags:",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIt’s highly unusual for a stock, showroom-spec vehicle to compete in a race, let alone drive straight home afterward. But that’s exactly what the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor did earlier this month. \nThe latest generation of Ford’s performance truck competed in the 2016 Baja 1000 , a legendary off-road race held in Baja California, Mexico. Entered by Foutz Motorsports with Ford support, the Raptor completed the 830-mile race in 35 hours, 59 minutes, and 8 seconds. Foot team members then loaded their gear into the truck, and drove it back to their home base near Phoenix, Arizona. \nThe truck was virtually identical to the version people will actually be able to buy, retaining the stock engine, transmission, brakes, and tires, plus niceties like air conditioning and satellite radio. The suspension was stock as well, although Foutz Motorsports recalibrated it to account for the extra weight of the roll cage it had to fit because of safety rules. A puncture-proof fuel cell and racing harnesses were fitted as well. \nMore: Ferrari may stop selling retired Formula One cars to customers \nBecause Baja also includes purpose-built race vehicles with greater performance capabilities, the Raptor was never in contention for an overall win. But the race was a valuable public relations opportunity for Ford, giving it a chance to show off the Raptor doing exactly what it was designed to do. Unlike most off-road models, the Raptor is designed not only for tackling rough terrain, but also for driving at high speeds. \nOff-road racing is one of the last places where a virtually stock vehicle can be competitive in a high-level event. Ford has raced other versions of the Raptor and its F-Series Super Duty pickup truck at Baja before. In 2014, a nearly-stock Toyota Tundra TRD Pro entered the race, and even won its class, although it only needed to beat three other competitors to do that. \nThe 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor goes on sale in December, nearly two years after its public debut at the 2015 Detroit Auto Show. Pricing starts at $49,250. Also watch:",

      "text": "ford self driving cars europe autonomous car More Stephen Edelstein/Digital Trends\nFord is planning to take its self-driving car technology onto European roads next year as part of its ambitious plan to launch a fully autonomous car for ride-hailing services by 2021.\nTrials will start at its Engineering Center in Essex, U.K., followed by additional testing at its Research & Advanced Engineering facilities in both Aachen and Cologne in Germany, the car giant told TechCrunch this week.\nFord said the teams at the testing locations are already up to speed with the company’s autonomous driving technology, which made choosing the new sites easy.\nCommenting on the announcement, Ford’s Thomas Lukaszewicz said the broad range of traffic conditions in countries across the pond will help the company to hone its technology.\n“It’s important that we extend our testing to Europe,”Lukaszewicz said. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here; traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.”\nMore: Volvo is planning to let families in London test its self-driving cars\nThe American automaker is already testing its autonomous technology in the U.S. with the aim of launching a self-driving car for ride-hailing services five years from now. The company hopes the Europe-based testing will help pave the way for similar services on the continent soon after.\nThe grand plan is to mass produce an SAE Level 4 self-driving vehicle within five years. For those unfamiliar with SAE levels, “0” is for a car with no automation at all while “5” is fully automated. So Ford’s car will be pretty much completely autonomous, though driver intervention may be required in particularly adverse weather conditions or unusual environments.\nFor its on-road tests the company has been using Ford Fusion Hybrid cars kitted out with a slew of sensors and cameras. The vehicle looks pretty much like any other Fusion Hybrid but for the spinning lidar units on its roof.\nDT’s Stephen Edelstein recently experienced a ride in Ford’s autonomous prototype – find out what he made of it here .\nCanada finally joins the self-driving club, with a car called ‘Autonomoose’ Place your bets: BMW is running one heck of an innovation race Detroit may be the next stop for Uber’s self-driving cars",

      "text": "Westworld: Ford's New Narrative To Be Revealed In Finale Amy Awesome Tweet This \nWith the Westworld season finale just a few days away, fans are eagerly awaiting what could be the most shocking and explosive episode of the season. \nWhile we don't know what mysteries or questions will be answered, Showrunners Lisa Joy and Jonathon Nolan have already said, \" Most of the questions viewers have will be resolved in the final episodes, except for the most important one: What happens next .\" \nHopefully the extended 90-minute episode doesn't leave fans hanging until Season 2 comes around in 2018. \nOne thing we know about the finale for sure is that Ford's new narrative will be revealed. Through most of the season, his work has been kept mostly secret. \nOther than a few scenes of huge bulldozers and construction vehicles digging a massive hole in the ground and the sound of explosions, we have not seen one tiny detail and no one knows what Ford is really up to. \nBeing such an evil man, as we learned in the last episode when he basically tortured Bernard and had the creepy Ghost Army attack Stubbs, we can assume that his new narrative won't be a story of hopes and dreams. \nHe did mention that he is taking the park \"back to what it was meant to be\" so that does give us a few hints. \nHowever, as clearly stated, both Ford and his late partner Arnold (the human one) did not see eye to eye on this. Ford lacks empathy because he is so set in his ways that the entire park is completely fake. \nBut for Arnold, Westworld was very real. \nAt least we know one question that will be answered in the finale! We'll know what Ford's new narrative is, no matter how terrifying it may be. \nHBO officially released the synopsis for the extended 90-minute season finale that you can read below: \nFord (Anthony Hopkins) unveils his bold new narrative; Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) embraces her identity; Maeve (Thandie Newton) sets her plan in motion.",

The model script “Fairlane” appeared ahead of the taillight…unlike the Fairlane 500 where the script “Fairlane 500” appeared at the top of the fender. Also it had only an abbreviated, perhaps 18” wide, chrome “V” between the backup lights.",

      "title": "Comment on Early Ford V-8 Foundation plans re-creation of Ford’s famed Rotunda by Garry Reese",
      "text": "Daniel Strohl on Sep 16th, 2013 Share \nPhotos courtesy Early Ford V-8 Foundation. \nMore than 50 years after the Rotunda, a Ford icon and one of the most-visited locations in the United States, burned to the ground, the Early Ford V-8 Foundation has proposed a plan to re-create the building as part of its museum complex. \n“It’s pretty exciting that we’re finally at a point where we have the ability and the land to do this,” said Bill Tindall, the foundation’s strategic planner. “Ford Motor Company will never rebuild it, and gazillions of people still remember it.” \nOriginally built as the centerpiece of Ford’s display at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1934, the 12-story-tall open-center building featured a striking design by Albert Kahn meant to represent a concentric set of gears. At the close of the fair, rather than leave the Rotunda in place, Henry Ford had it dismantled, shipped to Dearborn, and then re-assembled across from Ford’s Administration Building as a welcome center for visitors touring the River Rouge factory complex. It re-opened in May of 1936 with displays that showcased Ford’s production process and technological prowess – sort of a stationary version of the General Motors Parade of Progress mobile displays. \nThe Rotunda remained an open-center design until 1953, when Ford both remodeled the displays within and installed one of Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic domes over the top of the center courtyard, allowing the entirety of the Rotunda to be used year-round. It was that dome that proved the Rotunda’s undoing: While workers were re-sealing the dome with tar in November 1962 in preparation for the Rotunda’s popular annual holiday show, the tar caught fire and quickly spread, destroying the Rotunda within an hour. Nobody got hurt in the fire, but it caused $15 million in damage and destroyed several one-of-a-kind show and concept vehicles, including the Gyron . \nPretty much all that the fire spared were Ford’s archives and the sign at the entrance to the Rotunda. After Ford decided to level the remains of the Rotunda in March 1963, it sold the sign to Jerome-Duncan Ford in Sterling Heights, Michigan, which in turn donated it to the Utica, Michigan, school district, which used the sign to promote school and community events for several years before putting it into storage. In 2010, the sign was then donated to the Early Ford V-8 Foundation, which spent the last few years enlisting volunteers to help restore the sign and place it out front of the foundation’s museum in Auburn, Indiana. \nOne reason the foundation worked hard to preserve the Rotunda’s sign was because its members already had a replica of the Rotunda in mind for a number of uses: to display cars and exhibits, as a meeting and banquet space, and to host fundraisers and other foundation events. Tindall said that plans for the Rotunda replica actually began to materialize in about 2007 as the second phase of the foundation’s plans to establish a permanent home in Auburn. At the time, however, the foundation was most concerned with finishing the first phase – putting up the existing museum building adjacent to the old Kruse Foundation complex – which has since completed and given the foundation a place to exhibit about a dozen cars and trucks and some displays. \nTindall said the plans for the Rotunda replica don’t call for an exact faithful re-creation of the original, however. “To save money, it’ll probably be about two-thirds to three-quarters size, but even then, it’ll still be the tallest building between Auburn and Indianapolis,” he said. Nor will the replica Rotunda use Indiana limestone facing as the original did; instead, the foundation will likely use pre-cast concrete, another cost-saving move. \nWhile rough estimates for the replica range from $1 million to $5 million, Tindall said he anticipates the project will cost the foundation about $2 million and take about three years to complete. A commemorative coin program that the foundation began earlier this year has already started raising funds for the Rotunda replica project, and Tindall said he expects corporate memberships, grants, donations, and proceeds from events at the museum to help cover the rest. The foundation now needs to convert its architectural renderings of the Rotunda replica into mechanical drawings and put the project out to bid, steps that should result in a definite cost for the project (as well as a better idea of the size of the replica) and provide a goal for the foundation’s pending capital campaign.",

      "text": "\n\nDETROIT (WOOD) — Officers from across the Midwest gathered at Ford Field Wednesday to pay tribute to a Wayne State University police officer killed in the line of duty last week.\nOfficer Collin Rose was posthumously promoted to sergeant during a candlelight vigil at the Detroit school Tuesday night.\nThis undated photo provided by Wayne State University shows university police officer Collin Rose, who was shot in the head while on patrol near a university campus in Detroit on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. (MJ Murawka/Wayne State University via AP) Rose graduated from Gull Lake High School in 2006. The 29-year-old took his first job in law enforcement as an officer in the Kalamazoo County village of Richland , but spent a great deal of time at Ford Field, working games and other events as a K-9 handler.\nAuthorities say Rose was shot in the head on Nov. 22 while trying to arrest DeAngelo Davis, who now faces murder and gun charges. Rose died nearly 24 hours later at a hospital.\nUniversity President M. Roy Wilson says a $25,000 endowed scholarship is being created in Rose’s name.\nRose’s visitation will continue through 5 p.m. Wednesday at Ford Field. A second visitation and funeral Mass will take place Thursday morning at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church in St. Clair Shores.\nIn West Michigan, St. Ann Catholic Church in Augusta will hold a memorial Mass for Rose Friday at 11 a.m. The service will be open to police, public safety officers and the public. The church is located at 12648 E. D. Ave.\nAmong those traveling to Wednesday’s memorial at Ford Field are several officers from Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. We’ll hear from them on 24 Hour News 8 at 5 p.m.",

In comes a 1964 Ford Mustang, which has been designed and painstakingly built by Lego Masters in collaboration with LEGOLAND Florida. Pic Credits: morethanamomofthree \nOkay so maybe it isn’t a working model, it certainly looks like the real deal. The iconic Ford 1964 Mustang’s 1:1 model was created for children ages 2-12 at the auspicious occasion of Mustang Club of America’s 40th-anniversary celebration. The model made its public debut at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sept. 1, much to the amazement and astonishment of the onlookers. Pic Credits: morethanamomofthree \nThe finished car weighed a mind-boggling 1,712 pounds, and it was over 15 ft long and 4 ft tall. Just to top everything off, the designers even programmed a real Ford Mustang engine sound. The team claims that the whole project took 1,200 hours to complete, and roughly over 194,900 Lego bricks were used to create this masterpiece. Advertisement \n\nChloé Boehm, public relations executive at LEGOLAND Florida Resort, said on occasion, \n“We’re delighted to show off our version of an American classic during MCA’s 40th-anniversary celebration. We can’t think of a perfect place to reintroduce the car that redefined cool in a fun, creative way.” Pic Credits: morethanamomofthree \nJeff Mays, president, Mustang Club of America said: \n“It’s an honour to partner with LEGOLAND Florida Resort to unveil the ‘1964½’ LEGO Mustang over Labor Day weekend. The Ford Mustang and LEGO toys are classic American icons that appeal to enthusiasts of all ages. We look forward to a fun-filled weekend and helping the resort kick off the LEGO Mustang’s publicity tour at the MCA 40th anniversary celebration.” Pic Credits: morethanamomofthree \nAfter the initial appearance in Indianapolis, the LEGO Mustang has been making tours around the country before it will be placed permanently at the popular LEGOLAND Florida Resort. You can visit resort’s official blog at http://www.llfblog.com to learn more about the car, and follow it on Twitter using the hashtag #BrickPony.

Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. \nBenefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said. \nFarley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. \nFord has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said. \nStill, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market. \nFord sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' (GM.N) Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit. \nSeparately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year. Ford has said it plans to offer a mass-market fully autonomous car by 2021. \n($1 = 0.9395 euros) Oil jumps over 10 percent as OPEC finalises output cut deal Reuters - 10 minutes ago Oil prices soared more than 10 percent on Wednesday to the highest in a month as some of the world's largest producers agreed to curb production for the first time since 2008 in a bid to support prices.

      "text": "Ford will begin testing autonomous vehicles in Europe next year as it races other automakers and tech companies to develop and commercialize the technology.\nFord made the announcement in Germany in conjunction with a survey it commissioned on European views about the future of autonomous vehicles. The survey, conducted by Penn Schoen Berland, asked consumers in France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and the UK how they would spend their time in a self-driving car. Of the 5,000 who were surveyed, 80% say they look forward to relaxing and enjoying the scenery, 72% expect to use that time to talk on the phone, and 64% plan to eat.\n“People are really beginning to think about exactly what autonomous vehicles could mean to their day-to-day lives,” Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of the automated driving unit at Ford of Europe, said in a statement. “Many of us neglect time for ourselves and for our loved ones in the face of other demands. Self-driving cars will revolutionize the way we live, as well as the way we travel.”\nFord has been testing its self-driving car technology at various locations in the U.S., including at its proving grounds in Romeo, Mich., Wittmann, Ariz., and at Mcity, a 23-acre simulated urban environment at the University of Michigan. Ford announced in January plans to add 20 Fusion Hybrid autonomous vehicles, bringing the company's autonomous fleet to about 30 vehicles that are being tested on roads in California, Arizona, and Michigan. Ford enrolled in the California Autonomous Vehicle Testing Program last December, a program that already includes companies like Nissan, Volkswagen vlkay , and Google .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's daily newsletter about technology \n“It is important that we extend our testing to Europe,” Lukaszewicz said. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.”\nFord announced in August plans to make self-driving cars for commercial ride-sharing or on-demand taxi services by 2021. The company has said it’s focused on developing a fully autonomous vehicle, or Level 4, a classification by the Society of Automotive Engineers that means the car can handle all aspects of driving in some conditions or driving modes. For example, the cars may only operate under certain environmental conditions or a specific area within a city. It would be one step short of the highest rating, Level 5, when a car can handle all driving tasks in all road and environmental conditions normally controlled by a human.\nFord’s Venture Into Self-Driving Taxis \n\nSelf-driving cars are part of the company’s so-called Ford Smart Mobility plan, an initiative introduced nearly two years ago that involves building cars with additional Internet connectivity, experimenting with different forms of transportation such as car-sharing as well as using big data analytics like grabbing information from in-vehicle sensors to learn more about how people travel.",

      "title": "Ford Unveils New Fiesta, But Will U.S. Get It?",
      "text": "Ford Unveils New Fiesta, But Will U.S. Get It? \nBy Kelsey Mays \nEuropean Ford Fiesta Manufacturer image \nCARS.COM — At an event in Germany, Ford unveiled the next generation of its global Fiesta subcompact, but it's unclear when, or even if, the car will hit U.S. showrooms. The new Fiesta combines a lot of styling cues from the current generation with a similar interior to the EcoSport subcompact SUV , which Ford just introduced for the U.S. market. That's not surprising, since the two cars have historically shared the same platform. \nRelated: 2018 Ford EcoSport Video Review \nLike its predecessor, the Fiesta still wears a prominent six-sided grille below its headlights, though the grille's raised midpoint makes for a less hexagonal outline. The headlights are the same general shape, but they get some snazzy three-dimensional LED piping that recalls the prior-gen Hyundai Elantra . The bumpers have unique configurations depending on the variant. Ford unveiled four of them for its global car: the Titanium and uplevel Vignale editions, as well as a performance-lite Fiesta ST-Line and a cladded-up Fiesta Active crossover. \nIt's easiest to see the changes in the rear, where the Fiesta hatchback wears horizontal taillights versus the current model's vertical ones. (The existing Fiesta also comes as a sedan, but the redesign appears hatchback-only, at least for now.) It's longer and slightly wider, too, with length up 2.8 inches and width up 0.5 inch. \nIf you saw the EcoSport, the Fiesta's cabin should look familiar. A tablet-like display perches above the center air vents. Screens measure 4.2 to 8 inches, with higher versions sporting Ford's Sync 3 system plus Android Auto and Apple CarPlay . Below it are the climate controls and gearshift. The Fiesta's dashboard wraps around the air vents in a way the EcoSport's stacked design does not, but it's an otherwise similar layout. \nOther features include brake intervention with the Fiesta's automatic parking system to mitigate low-speed collisions, plus a panoramic moonroof and a bevy of sensor and camera systems capable of scanning up to around 427 feet ahead. The global car will offer a range of pint-sized three- and four-cylinder engines. \nThe Fiesta's global roots go back 40 years, but the nameplate missed 30 of those years in the U.S. after it vanished in 1980, only to return in early 2010 amid a wave of subcompact popularity in an era of high gas prices. But gas is relatively cheap again, and subcompact sales have stagnated as shoppers snap up small SUVs instead. \nIt's unclear whether Ford will bring the new Fiesta here or let the current generation wither on the vine while it bets on the EcoSport. Dan Jones, the automaker's U.S. car communications manager, declined to say whether Ford has any plans to bring the redesigned version to North America. \nSenior Consumer Affairs Editor Kelsey Mays likes quality, reliability, safety and practicality. But he also likes a fair price. Start Shopping",

      "text": "The Trend variants of the Ford Figo and Aspire now get anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brake-force distribution (EBD) as a standard feature. This variant gets even safer as it was already equipped with dual airbags.\nEarlier, it was only the high-end Titanium and Titanium+ trims that were equipped with ABS and EBD. Now with this update, it's only the Base and Ambiente variants that miss out on these features. These new features will be available on the upcoming new batch of vehicles. Ford hasn't announced any price revisions for the variants as of yet.\nFord's move is similar to what many automakers have recently done. Many manufacturers are either standardising safety features in their models or providing passive and active safety equipment. This is mainly because the Indian Government is planning to make airbags and ABS as a standard fitment in cars in the coming years. Recently, Volkswagen announced to offer ABS and airbags in every model that they sell.",

      "text": "ford fiesta news specs performance pictures eu spec More Ford has introduced the extensively updated 2018 Fiesta during an event held in Germany. The city car isn’t entirely new, but nearly every part of it has been improved in one way or another.\nThe most obvious changes are spotted by simply looking at the Fiesta. Its front end receives softer-looking headlights, a thinner, wider grille, and a new-look bumper. Out back, the outgoing model’s vertical tail lamps are replaced by elongated horizontal units, a styling cue that emphasizes the Fiesta’s width. Surprisingly, the two-door body style hasn’t been axed yet.\nIn Europe, the Fiesta lineup has been expanded with three new versions named Vignale, Active, and ST-Line, respectively. The Vignale is the long-rumored upscale variant that comes standard with features such as 18-inch alloy wheels, a specific chromed grille, and tuxedo-stitched leather upholstery on the seats. Inspired by SUVs, the Active model boasts black plastic cladding and roof rails, and it sits a little taller than normal. Finally, the ST-Line wears a sporty-looking body kit inspired by the hot-rodded ST model. It’s worth noting that none of these three models have been confirmed for the United States yet.\nMore: Ford’s 2018 Mustang could get a trick suspension, lose an engine option\nFord promises the Fiesta’s cabin is a nicer place to travel in than before thanks to additional soft-touch material on the dashboard, and a much bigger touchscreen that runs a new infotainment system called Sync 3. The Fiesta also inaugurates an enhanced version of the pedestrian detection tech that prevents collisions even when it’s dark outside. The system will gradually make its way to bigger, more expensive members of the Ford lineup in the coming months.\nThe big news under the hood is that the Fiesta’s popular 1.0-liter EcoBoost three-cylinder engine is available with a fuel-saving cylinder deactivation system. The triple automatically turns into a twin when extra power isn’t needed, and the third cylinder re-engages in just 14 milliseconds — faster than the blink of an eye — when it’s needed again. Cylinder deactivation has never been offered on a three-cylinder engine before; Ford says its implementation can improve gas mileage by up to six percent in real-world driving conditions.\nThe Ford Fiesta introduced in Germany is a Euro-spec model. The U.S.-spec version is widely expected to make its debut in January during the Detroit Auto Show, and it will go on sale in time for the 2018 model year.\nFord's EcoSport mini SUV makes its North American debut in LA, will go on sale in 2018 Can the new Hyundai i30 lure Europeans out of Volkswagen showrooms? Volkswagen’s Paris-bound concept will put the EV segment on notice",

      "text": "ford f raptor at baja race truck More It’s highly unusual for a stock, showroom-spec vehicle to compete in a race, let alone drive straight home afterward. But that’s exactly what the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor did earlier this month.\nThe latest generation of Ford’s performance truck competed in the 2016 Baja 1000 , a legendary off-road race held in Baja California, Mexico. Entered by Foutz Motorsports with Ford support, the Raptor completed the 830-mile race in 35 hours, 59 minutes, and 8 seconds. Foot team members then loaded their gear into the truck, and drove it back to their home base near Phoenix, Arizona.\nThe truck was virtually identical to the version people will actually be able to buy, retaining the stock engine, transmission, brakes, and tires, plus niceties like air conditioning and satellite radio. The suspension was stock as well, although Foutz Motorsports recalibrated it to account for the extra weight of the roll cage it had to fit because of safety rules. A puncture-proof fuel cell and racing harnesses were fitted as well.\nMore: Ferrari may stop selling retired Formula One cars to customers\nBecause Baja also includes purpose-built race vehicles with greater performance capabilities, the Raptor was never in contention for an overall win. But the race was a valuable public relations opportunity for Ford, giving it a chance to show off the Raptor doing exactly what it was designed to do. Unlike most off-road models, the Raptor is designed not only for tackling rough terrain, but also for driving at high speeds.\nOff-road racing is one of the last places where a virtually stock vehicle can be competitive in a high-level event. Ford has raced other versions of the Raptor and its F-Series Super Duty pickup truck at Baja before. In 2014, a nearly-stock Toyota Tundra TRD Pro entered the race, and even won its class, although it only needed to beat three other competitors to do that.\nThe 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor goes on sale in December, nearly two years after its public debut at the 2015 Detroit Auto Show. Pricing starts at $49,250.\nFaraday Future unveils specs for its Formula E race car Ford’s 2017 F-150 Raptor will be put to the test in the Baja 1000 Behind the scenes with Toyota at a NASCAR race",

      "text": "Ford takes Fiesta upmarket to lift profitability Tue Nov 29, 2016 10:34pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nCOLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Ford (F.N: Quote ) wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said. \nHigh-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's (DAIGn.DE: Quote ) Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE: Quote ) Audi. \nBut Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too. \nThe next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants. \n\"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" \nBut Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. \nBenefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said. \nFarley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. \nFord has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said.

      "text": "First 2017 Ford Ka+ Review Says It's Practical But not Cute / Home / News / Car Profile Going from laughingstock straight to number one is nearly impossible, but Ford might do it with the all-new Ka+. Recently launched across Europe, it aims to make us forget all about that dreadful Fiat-based car , if we still remember it that is. With the new Fiesta being slightly larger and aiming towards a more premium buyer, it's up to the Ka+ to lure in people who are on a tight budget but want to stick to the mainstream brands. So, do you want to know what a car that's as much as £4,000 cheaper than the Fiesta is like? Of course, you do, which is why we're bringing you the first review from YouTube. According to CarBuyer's James Batchelor, the interior is far below the old Fiesta regarding the quality of design, which isn't saying much. Remember, the old Fiesta had a dash inspired by phones that had rows of buttons. But you do get quite a lot of room for this amount of money. It seems that both head and kneed room are better than on rivals like the Vauxhall Viva/Opel Karl or Skoda Citigo. Ford only offers one engine with the Ka+, a 1.2-liter Duratec four-cylinder unit. The naturally aspirated mill churns out 70 PS and 142 lb-ft and 105 Nm. There’s a more potent alternative available, though, packing 85 PS and 112 Nm of torque. How does 0 to 62mph in 15.3 or 13.3 seconds strike you? As far as the above-mentioned rivals are concerned, the Vauxhall Viva only manages to get 75 PS from its 1-liter engine, and it's less economical, while the Skoda Citigo is as frugal as the Ka+ with its 75 PS 1-liter but less fun. We're talking real-world numbers, not what the manufacturers say. The good news is that this reviewer found it to be joyful to drive, which is exactly what people expect when they look at that manly grille. Having said that, the suspension is softer, and the Ka+ thus rolls around more in the corners. Clearly, it's aimed at female drivers and the elderly. Ford Ka 2017 Ford Ka Ford",

TownNews.com Content Exchange \nThere was a time when the acronym SUV conjured images of behemoths — Chevy Suburban, Ford Excursion, even the Hummer H1. \nToday, the sport-utility segment is thriving, but its core has evolved from a collection of truck-based bad boys to a group of more domesticated car-based \"crossovers.\" The smallest of these CUVs comprise an SUV sub-segment that's growing. \nAmong the competitors in the burgeoning category of subcompact crossovers are Honda's HR-V, Chevy's Trax, Mazda's CX-3, Fiat's 500X and Jeep's Renegade. Ford — at least in the U.S. — has been noticeably AWOL from the party. \nUntil now. \nSet to arrive stateside a tad over a year from now is the Ford EcoSport, a micro-ute the Blue Oval has been offering in global markets for some time. \nAltered somewhat for our Yankee sensibilities, the U.S version of EcoSport, to be offered in S, SE, SES and Titanium trims, will nonetheless retain its Fiesta foundation, diminutive dimensions, mini-Escape styling — although EcoSport's side-hinged cargo door is an intriguing departure — and modest engine displacement. \nRegarding engine choices, there will be two offered to U.S. customers: a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost I-3 and a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated I-4. The turbo 3 powers EcoSport's front wheels only, the four-banger comes standard with all-wheel drive. Regardless, a six-speed automatic is the transmission. \nOf course, automakers these days are designing vehicles — particularly small vehicles — for the smartphone generation and the U.S.-spec EcoSport is no exception. \nAmong this micro-ute's available perks will be a 10-speaker, 675-watt B&O PLAY audio system — a system, Ford says, that's tuned specifically for the EcoSport cabin by Harman acoustic engineers. Standard on the top-trim Titanium, that system also boasts HD Radio, a satellite-radio receiver and a \"dual FM radio antenna\" said to boost range and clarity. \nOwners longing to stay connected to distant friends, not to mention their own EcoSport should it be in the distance, will find a variety of ways to do so via Ford's SYNC 3, hands-free capable communications and entertainment system. \nIn EcoSport, SYNC 3 gets mated to a touch screen designed to be familiar to users of smartphones and tablets. The 8-inch screen provides access to Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and to various audio settings, among other things. \nDrivers also have the ability to start, lock, unlock and locate their EcoSport from remote locations using the available SYNC Connect with FordPass app. That mobile app also lets owners view vehicle information, such as the fuel level and odometer reading, when not in the vehicle. \nLook for the diminutive EcoSport to arrive in early 2018. Although Ford has not designated a model year yet — vehicles built after Jan. 1, 2018, qualify to be designated 2019 models — we're guessing it'll be a 2018 EcoSport that arrives stateside. \nDan Wiese is a freelance automotive writer.

      "title": "Ford EcoSport Facelift: 5 features that India is likely to miss | Zee News",
      "text": "Follow @ZeeNews \nThe EcoSport has been a vital ingredient in Ford’s recipe of resilience in India. Just like most Ford cars, it is fun to drive, comfortable to be in and isn’t too heavy on the pocket. Launched in 2013, it has been one of the best selling cars for Ford and in the sub-4 metre SUV segment. But with the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza coming into the options list for customers, Ford has witnessed a steep decline in the EcoSport’s sales figures. \nIt is time for the American automaker to fight back. Ford unveiled the facelift of its EcoSport SUV in Los Angeles, California, on November 14, 2016. It is slated to go on sale in Brazil in the early part of 2017, before it comes to India, where it will be manufactured and exported for the American market as well. Ford released a list of features that will be offered on the American version of the EcoSport facelift. No doubt the feature list is mouth-watering but to keep the costs in check, the Indian version of the sub-4 metre SUV is likely to miss some of them. Here’s a list of features that, in all probability, won’t be offered on the EcoSport facelift in India. 2.0-Litre Engine \nImagine a car that costs less than Rs 10 lakh and is powered by a 2.0-litre engine. Apart from being a powerhouse, a 2000cc engine will simply outgun everything in its segment and a segment above as well. Not even the bigger SUVs, such the Renault Duster, Honda BR-V and Hyundai Creta feature an engine that big. Well, there are two reasons behind it. One - big engines are jolly expensive to build and, two - the fuel-economy figures aren’t impressive. In a country like India, which is extremely price conscious, Ford is expected to stick with engine options which have smaller cubic capacity. 4-Wheel Drive \nFor the US market, Ford will mate the 4-Wheel Drive (4WD) system with the 2.0-litre engine only. The reason behind it is simple - a 4WD system requires more power from the engine to work its magic on the move. When engaged, a 4WD system brings the top speed and the fuel efficiency of a vehicle considerably down. While higher top speed isn’t a priority for the Indian market, good fuel-economy definitely is. Moreover, the smaller engines won’t have enough power to support a 4WD system effectively. Bang & Olufsen Play Audio System \nIn the revamped EcoSport, Ford showcased an updated dashboard, with a bigger 8-inch infotainment system that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Mated to the screen is a 675-watt Bang & Olufsen (B&O) Play music system with 10 speakers. To get the best possible music experience, the entire sound system is installed by Harman acoustic engineers. While it would be a great addition, it is highly unlikely that the Indian version of the updated EcoSport will get it. B&O music systems are beautifully engineered and jaw-droppingly expensive. While India is expected to get the bigger screen and the phone-mirroring compatibility, powered by Google and Apple, the B&O Play will be too expensive to keep the final price competitive. Sporty Interior Trim \nFord EcoSport’s main target audience in the US is the youth and therefore a sporty dual-tone interior trim works well to attract prospective customers. However, this isn’t the case in India. Here the EcoSport serves several types of customers and a major chunk comes from customers with two-plus-two families. While a dual-tone treatment on the inside is welcome, bright and sporty colours such as the one on the revamped EcoSport are expected to remain in the western hemisphere for the time being. New Tailgate Design \nFord has got rid of the boot-mounted spare wheel and redone the styling of the tailgate. The spare-wheel now sits underneath the rear of the baby SUV. This new change is for the American market but Ford is expected to keep the boot-mounted spare wheel design at the rear for its Indian customers. The reason is simple - we like it. It gives a more masculine feel of the entire car, although it is the tiniest SUV with a Ford badge on it that money can buy. But who cares, right? As long as it looks butch, we don’t really care how big the really is. \nJust like the Ford Figo, which is built in India but specced generously, renamed as Ford Ka and is exported to markets in Europe, the updated EcoSport will be built here and then exported to the US from 2018. \nSource: CarDekho.com ",

      "text": "BMW, Ford, VW And Daimler Join Forces To Challenge Tesla With EV Charging Network In Europe 30 November 2016, 3:08 pm EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Autonomous Cars - Five Things To Know About Self Driving Cars Now Playing BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen formed a joint venture to install a fast-charging EV network in Europe to counter \"range anxiety.\" The automakers will roll out 400 EV charging stations at first, with thousands of charge points to follow by 2020. ( Daimler ) Advertisement \nFour major automakers just formed a new joint venture to build an electric vehicle charging station across Europe. \nFord, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler have joined forces to create a network of chargers with a charging capacity of up to 350 kW, aiming to make it easier to move around Europe using electric vehicles. The team aims to start installing the fast-charging stations next year. Europe's Highest-Powered EV Charging Network \n\"BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create the highest-powered charging network in Europe,\" reads the press release. \"The goal is the quick build-up of a sizable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for battery electric vehicle drivers. This will be an important step towards facilitating mass-market BEV adoption.\" \nThrough the joint venture, the automakers initially plan to roll out fast-charging stations in 400 sites across Europe, but the automakers want to install thousands of charge points by 2020. The network will employ Combined Charging System technology, which uses an AC/DC connector combo known as the \"Combo Coupler\" to provide a fast-charging solution that delivers a maximum charging rate of 350 kW. \nA number of automakers including BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, GM, Hyundai and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles support CCS and more will likely join the fray as electric vehicles continue to gain ground. Tesla, meanwhile, is reportedly working on an adapter that would enable it to support the standard CCS chargers use. Range Anxiety \nThe new joint venture to create a European EV charging network aims to ease up the so-called range anxiety, which refers to the fear of running out of power in an electric vehicle before reaching a charging station. \nThis range anxiety plays a major role in consumers' reluctance toward electric vehicles, which have so far catered only to a niche market. With a broader network of fast-charging stations, however, automakers could combat range anxiety and make electric vehicles more ubiquitous. \nThe project for Europe follows a similar venture from earlier this year, when BMW, Volkswagen and ChargePoint teamed up to install 100 EV charging stations along coastal highways in the United States. \nTesla already has its Supercharging network of EV charging stations, albeit it will no longer provide free unlimited charging for new Tesla owners come 2017. \nElectric vehicles are nonetheless gaining ground and are expected to make up a much more significant portion of the auto market by 2020. Some cities have already started to be more EV-friendly and authorities are working on creating more EV charging corridors to counter range anxiety, so things are looking up. Moreover, BMW is reportedly working on a redesigned i3 model with a longer range for 2017. \nWith such efforts under way, does the prospect of getting an electric vehicle sound more appealing?  ",

      "text": "November 30, 2016 — American / Project / Truck & 4x4 / Under $20k | 12 Comments COE Oil Tanker Project: 1951 Ford F-6 \nThis 1951 Ford F-6 COE is offered as a non-running project, and though the truck isn’t without rust, the seller claims that its frame and cab are relatively solid, and that the whole rig rolls and steers freely. Looking quite complete as well, this includes its original L-head straight-six and what’s believed to be a five or perhaps 6-speed gearbox. Cleaned up and painted in any number of cool period oil company color schemes, this one could be really special. Find it here on Craigslist near Minneapolis, Minnesota for $6,800. Special thanks to BaT reader Bob L. for this submission. \nPure used a blue and white color scheme at the time, and this truck appears to have had navy fenders and lower rear bodywork incorporating the storage boxes and “quarter panels” for lack of a better term. The remainder, including the cab body and tank were probably silver or gray. Rust has taken hold in a pretty big way in some places, but by and large things look pretty good. \nHere’s a look from the rear, really highlighting what looks to be the worst of corrosion around the right rear wheel opening. Unfortunately, no frame shots are provided to back up claims of relatively solidity. The seller explains that the off-looking fitment seen here is due to one of the right side’s rear dually wheels being removed–fortunately it’s included. \nThe red interior likely doesn’t mean much, as the truck could have easily been delivered in any number of factory offered colors, probably as a cab and chassis on which an outside supplier would have fitted tanker bodywork. \nThe truck retains what the seller describes as a 115 horse flathead six, mated to what they believe is either a five or 6-speed gearbox. \nRear doors open to reveal the tank’s inner workings. Fortunately, even a thorough, good-quality restoration could skip restoring it for use–no one’s going to be inspecting it from the inside, and the truck’s fuel hauling days are all in the past. \nA nicely built 351W, power discs, power steering and A/C would be nice, but even fully stock–meaning slow, ungainly and low on creature comforts–this one could still be a lot of fun.

      "title": "2018 Ford Expedition",
      "text": "by Mark McNabb + \nFord worked tirelessly to improve the current F-150 by reducing mass and adding efficient turbocharged engines all mounted on a high-strength steel frame. It’s now likely those same advancements will make their way onto the heavily, if not all-new 2018 Expedition SUV. And as our spy photographer caught, the Expedition is currently in development. \nThe Expedition has traditionally been based on the F-150, though the relation has grown distant over the last few years. Since the second generation, the Expedition has used an independent rear suspension system rather than the F-150’s solid axle and leaf spring setup. Exterior and interior styling also drifted apart from the F-150 for the second generation, which debuted for the 2003 model year. Nevertheless, the two vehicles have shared a close relationship since the Expedition’s introduction for the 1997 model year. \nVast improvements were made for the 2007 model year when Ford introduced the third generation Expedition. It borrowed the then-current F-150’s fully-boxed frame, updated suspension components and geometry, and Ford’s six-speed automatic transmission. A mid-cycle update for 2014 brought Ford’s 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 into the picture, making it sole engine choice. The twin-turbo V-6 replaced the 5.4-liter Triton V-8, which had replaced the 4.6-liter Triton V-8 before it. \nNow as the Expedition moves toward 2018, Ford is reportedly giving this three-row, body-on-frame SUV a full parts list form the F-150, including the updated 3.5-liter EcoBoost, the rumored introduction of the 2.7-liter EcoBoost, an all-aluminum body, a stronger yet lighter high-strength steel frame, and styling that mirrors that of the F-150. These improvements will be for both the Expedition and its long-wheelbase brother, the Expedition XL. \nLet’s have a closer look at these spy shots of the long-awaited 2018 Ford Expedition. \nUpdate: 11/30/2016 We have created a rendering showing what we suspect the 2018 Ford Expedition might look like. Check out the “Rendering” section for all the details. Let us know what you think in the comments below. \nContinue reading for more information. continue reading Rendering \nFord had previously moved the Expedition further way from sharing styling cues with the F-150 pickup truck. That might change for the 2018 model year. The reason – many buyers are looking for a truck-like vehicle with the people-hauling capacity of a three-row SUV. This return to shared components with the F-150 would solidify the next-generation Expedition as a tough, do-anything vehicle that’s still leather-lined and comfortable for eight people. Granted, we understand Ford is giving the F-150 a mid-cycle refresh in the near future, so this rendering probably won’t be completely accurate in the grille and headlight area since the Expedition will follow the F-150’s design styling. \nWe strongly believe Ford will use the same cab section that’s found in the F-150 and Super Duty pickups. Of course, the cab would be modified to fit the rear roof and window sections, but the doors and roof pillars will likely be shared. This not only cuts manufacturing costs, but also instills a level of congruity between the models. We’d also bet good money the Expedition will wear aluminum skin for this very same reason, not to mention the weight savings. \nFord will likely continue using the single rear liftgate design found on the current Expedition. This allows for the hands-free kick-to-open feature, while still accommodating the separate lift glass. \nFord will also keep both wheelbase options – the Expedition and Expedition EL. Like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the wheelbase stretches for extra room in the second and third rows. The EL will have a full rear door while the standard length Expedition will have a wheel well cut-out just below the door handle. \nThe 2018 Expedition will also come loaded with available luxuries like power-folding running boards, LED exterior lighting, those LED spot lights on the side mirrors, tow hooks, a two-inch trailer hitch receiver, and large wheel that could range between 17 and 22 inches. \nOnce Ford releases the official images of the Expedition, we’ll update you here. Exterior \nThe Expedition is getting a completely new look that should mirror the design styling of the current F-150 pickup. Expect the front grille and headlights to carry the chiseled look with chrome accents and LED lighting fixtures. The doors and side profile will likely share the same styling as well, with the Expedition getting the same door handles, blacked out pillars, and driver side numbered keypad. \nMore specifically, horizontal chrome bars can already be seen at the front grille behind the camouflage. The headlights are also visible, but less detail is discernible. It appears most the of engine’s cooling takes place with the lower grille, as Ford has kept the camo cut clear to allow for airflow. A large air dam down below undoubtedly helps improve aerodynamics and therefore fuel economy of this big bruiser. \nThis test mule’s overall proportions indicate it’s a standard-length Expedition. It also seems to have a more aggressively raked windshield, likely helping aerodynamics. Roof rails are clearly seen covered up by camo, indicating Ford is keeping the utility aspect of the Expedition alive and well. \nAround back, Ford is hiding a sloping rear window with a tent-like structure attacked to the Expedition. The rear glass appears to have its own lift handle, indicating it can be opened separate from the main liftgate hatch. Expect LED rear lighting as well. The bumper also seems to have a bulge, indicating a hitch cover for the standard two-inch receiver hitch. \nThis tester is rolling on matte-black wheels wrapped in all-season rubber with a street-biased tread. Fixed running boards on the sides will likely be an option for lower to mid-level trims, while power-retractable running boards will come with the upper trim levels. The Competition \nTwo of the Expedition’s main competitors are the Chevrolet Tahoe and the GMC Yukon XL Denali. Sure, both are of the same corporate lineage, but the two SUVs represent the polar opposites in terms of wheelbase length, luxury, power, and price. The Tahoe is more the everyday SUV and the Yukon XL Denali is far more luxury minded. \nAs for the Tahoe’s exterior, the current generation Chevy wears a very classy yet modern look that still seems fresh despite its two-year age. Everything ahead of the A-pillars is unique to the Tahoe, while things rearward are largely shared with the Yukon. The Tahoe can be had in the “base” LS trim or the range-topping Premier trim. \nThe GMC Yukon XL Denali is a different beast from the Tahoe. Because it’s an XL, it has a longer wheelbase that affords more interior room. The extra length is evident by the full rear door rather than the Tahoe’s cut-out rear door. The Denali line brings the chrome, cheese grater-like grille and other chrome accents. LED headlights and daytime running lights give the GMC a very upscale presence at night. Interior \nUnfortunately for us, the spy photographer was not able to snap a full photo of the 2018 Expedition’s interior, leaving us to speculate. There is, however, one shot of the exterior showing a hazy view of the passenger side A-pillar grab handle and the top section of the dashboard. The large grab handle looks just like those from the current F-150, but parts-bin sharing is expected. The passenger side outboard air vent is also seen, and appears to have a chrome bezel wrapping its parameter. Besides that, the rearview mirror is seen, but no discernable changes or new technology can be seen. \nNevertheless, we’d bet very strongly that Ford will give the Expedition’s interior the same treatment found in the F-150 and Super Duty. This will not only reduce production costs, but will help create continuity between the three products. It will also help dealerships and customers with familiarity between the dashboards’ controls. \nWe expect the Expedition to offer three rows of seating with space for eight. Selecting the second-row captains chairs results in a seven-passenger configuration. The seats will likely offer an optional power-fold-flat option, making it easy to lower and raise both the second and third rows. Manual folding will come standard on lesser trim levels. Either way, both rear rows will fold flat, allowing for a tremendous amount of cargo room. \nExpect Ford to pack the Expedition full of its latest equipment and technology. Sync3 will undoubtedly make its way into the dashboard and a large driver information screen is expected between analog gauges in the cluster – just like the F-150. The latest safety equipment will also be present, including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, blind spot monitoring, and a 360-degree camera system. The Competition \nThe Tahoe and Yukon share the same basic interior, thought the Yukon XL Denali has more refinements and luxury items. Let’s look at them separately. The Chevy Tahoe in the LS trim comes standard with cloth seats, but features items that would be considered high-end even five years ago, including a standard eight-inch infotainment system with optional navigation, dual-zone climate with rear controls, a color diver information screen, multiple USB ports, and power-operated everything. Utility wise, the Tahoe offers standard seating for eight with the option to have second-row captains chairs. \nThe Yukon XL Denali takes things to the next level. It comes with leather seating with heated and vented front seats; a larger, full-color driver information display that incorporates the four auxiliary gauges; and of course, more legroom for third-row passengers with more cargo room behind that. Like the Tahoe, the second row can be had as either a bench or captains chairs. \nBoth the Tahoe and Yukon XL’s seats fold flat to create a large cargo hold. The Yukon XL Denali does the folding via power-actuated seats, making it much simpler than levers or pull straps. Drivetrain \nFord will surely give the 2018 Expedition the same upgraded 3.5-liter EcoBoost that’s found in the 2017 F-150. This new engine is the EcoBoost’s second generation and it now makes 375 horsepower and a V-8-like 470   That’s more than General Motor’s 6.2-liter V-8 that powers the Cadillac Escalade and some versions of the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL. \nThe engine will come mated for Ford’s new 10-speed automatic transmission. Co-developed with GM, this is the first volume-production 10-speed automatic in the world. Ford, in a statement regarding the transmission in the 2017 F-150, says it will help deliver improved acceleration and performance compared with the previous six-speed automatic. That’s thanks to a lower first gear for acceleration and towing, while several overdrive gears allow the EcoBoost to settle into low revs on the highway. Both RWD and 4WD will be available. Perhaps even an FX4 version will be offered, coming with Ford’s electronically locking rear differential. \nIn addition to the upgraded 3.5-liter EcoBoost, rumors suggest Ford is making the F-150’s 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 the Expedition’s standard engine. Packing 325 horsepower and 375 pound-feet of torque, the small EcoBoost is no slouch. It would surly be more than capable of pulling the all-aluminum Expedition along. \nLastly, rumors suggest Ford is developing a small turbodiesel option for the F-150. Though unconfirmed, this engine could see duty in the Expedition. That would also explain this test mule’s overly large exhaust pipe. The Competition \nThe Chevy Tahoe comes powered by GM’s 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V-8. It features three technologies (hints the name) to help with power and efficiency. They include variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust sides, direct fuel injection, and Active Fuel Management, otherwise called cylinder deactivation. The 5.3-liter produces 355 horsepower and 383   It comes mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. It comes standard in RWD and 4WD is available. The rear solid rear axle also features the Eaton G80 Automatic locking differential, giving the Tahoe extra traction in slippery terrain. \nThe Yukon XL Denali utilizes GM’s 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V-8. Like the 5.3-liter, it has variable valve timing, direct injection, and Active Fuel Management. What the 6.2-liter has over the 5.3-liter is power. In fact, the 6.2-liter is a handful of parts away from being the same V-8 used in the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. In this application, it generates an impressive 420 horsepower and 460   \nIt comes mated to GM’s eight-speed automatic transmission and can be optioned with 4WD. The G80 is also standard equipment here. Prices \nFord will keep the Expedition competitive in the market against its long-time rivals at GM. Nevertheless, pricing will definitely rise to compensate for the added technology. Currently the 2017 Expedition carries a starting price of $46,225. Ford will probably keep the current trim levels, meaning the XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum versions will return. Decked out, a current Expedition can cost upwards of $70,000 – matching that of GMC’s range-topping Yukon XL Denali. Competition Chevrolet Tahoe \nThe Tahoe has long been Chevy’s hot-selling, two- and three-row SUV with truck-like capabilities and handsome good looks. It’s also turned into the brand’s most premium truck product, with prices shooting northward over the years. Still, it represents the least expensive version of GM’s full-size SUVS. \nThe Tahoe can be had with seating for five in two rows, seven with three rows, or six with three rows and second-row captain’s chairs. It comes powered by Chevy’s venerable 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V-8 with variable valve timing, direct injection, and active fuel management. It’s all-aluminum construction saves weight while its cam-in-block design saves on space. It’s plenty powerful, too, making 355 horsepower and 383   \nPrices start at $47,000 for a LS trim in RWD. Opt for a 4WD version decked out in the Premier trim, and prices jump to $73,000. \nRead our full review on the Chevrolet Tahoe here. GMC Yukon XL Denali \nOkay, so the GMC Yukon is basically the same vehicle as the Chevrolet Tahoe, but the XL version is longer, matching up with the Chevy Suburban. The Denali trim is GMC ’s super popular high-end trim line that brings a more posh interior, the more powerful V-8, and a unique exterior appearance. This matches up with the Expedition’s Platinum trim, if not more in line with the Lincoln Navigator. \nAs mentioned, the Yukon XL Denali comes powered by GM’s 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V-8. It uses the same technology as the 5.3-liter V-8 to achieve efficiency, power, and compactness in one package. It generates 420 horsepower and 460   \nPricing for the GMC Yukon XL Denali starts at $68,000. Check every box and the price grows into the low $80,000 area. \nRead our full review on the GMC Yukon XL Denali here. Conclusion \nThe Ford Expedition has always been behind the Tahoe and Yukon XL Denali in terms of sales, but Ford could very well close the gap with this new iteration of the Expedition. If Ford includes all the swanky tech and safety features modern buyers are looking for – all at a fair price – there’s no reason this new 2018 Expedition shouldn’t be a runaway success. \nAnd while the Expedition is Ford’s bread-n-butter American SUV, its Lincoln cousin, the Navigator, should be receiving these same updates for the 2018 model year as well. They both share the same platform, powertrain, and other components, so Ford will likely use this chance to revamp Navigator into a lighter, more powerful machine with all the class Matthew McConaughey can roll between his fingers. \nThe 2018 Expedition is expected to debut at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit before going into production in July of 2017. Sales will begin a few weeks after production commences. LOVE IT",

      "text": "[caption id=\"attachment_37542\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Designs by Nick DeSantis, Forbes staff[/caption]For the new JUST 100 List of America’s Best Corporate Citizens, Forbes partnered with Paul Tudor Jones’ Just Capital to identify the companies in each industry that excel at serving all stakeholders, beyond just the bottom line. The doctrine of maximizing shareholder return has become religion in most of Corporate America’s C-suites over the last half century or so, but the companies we highlight have found a way to deliver strong investor returns without giving short shrift to employees, customers, suppliers and the environment.The JUST 100 List scores companies on a variety of components that feed into 10 drivers of corporate integrity, and 32 companies were named the leaders in their particular industry. Here’s what 8 of those CEOs had to say about how and why they act as good corporate citizens. Among Ford Motor’s community outreach efforts: a Thirty Under 30 program that connects tech-minded millennial employees with nonprofits. Eastman Chemical partners with societies for women and minority engineers; it also supports employees who serve in the armed forces, making up pay differences while reservists are on active duty. NVIDIA doesn’t just win high marks for favorable worker perks like generous vacation time, it also stands out for limiting its environmental impact in an industry not known for being especially green. Varian Medical Systems makes devices that help treat cancer patients, so it’s a natural fit for mission-driven employees with a charitable mindset, but the company also has an eye on sustainability. It plans to divert 80% of solid waste from landfills by 2020. Colgate-Palmolive accounts for 40% of the toothpaste tubes sold in the world, so it’s little surprise that it targets dentistry for corporate philanthropy efforts. It has provided free dental screenings for 850 million children in 80 countries. Accenture PLC expects 40% of its North American new hires in 2017 will be women, and almost half of its workforce are minorities. The company held a company-wide town hall in July to discuss race amid the ongoing dialogue over police shootings, Discovery Communications provides 12 weeks of paid family leave, reimbursement for adoption and surrogacy services and has an on-site health and wellness center to keep employees happy and productive. Microsoft gets high marks for worker treatment and diversity, and Nadella particularly cares about enhancing opportunities for underserved groups. One unique effort is a hiring program for people with autism.",

      "title": "Ford F-150 Pickup Serves as Marketing Platform for Car Products",
      "text": "Jonathon Brothers' Ford F-150 that debuted at the 2016 SEMA show The retail trade can be intense for the manufacturers who make products and the stores that sell them. Competition between companies is expected to be tough. However, every once in awhile someone comes up with a way to benefit several companies who are not competing with one another, but who target the same market. \nOne such person is Jonathon Brothers, Regional Sales Manager for Metra Electronics, a company that manufactures products for the 12-volt industry. Brothers travels to shops in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas selling Metra products. \n“I visit car audio stores, truck accessory stores, automotive performance dealers, and marine and powersports stores. I show off new innovative products and provide dealer support and training,” he explained. \nA Metra Electronics motorized actuator raises and lowers the Undercover Ridgelander bed cover His employer, Metra Electronics, based in Hollyhill, Florida, manufactures light bars, installation dash kits for aftermarket radios, backup sensors and cameras, wiring, connectors and more. \nBrothers came up with the idea of creating a demonstration vehicle that showcases products from different companies that don’t compete with one another and target the same stores and consumers. Having been in the industry for more than 12 years, he is familiar with these companies and the products they sell. \n“We all have a similar dealer base, but we don’t compete with each other as far as products are concerned,” said Brothers. “So I thought of coming up with a vehicle that showcases everyone’s products to help each other out.” \nBrothers brainstormed the idea, selected a few companies to work with as well as some of the products they offer and he decided that a 2016 Ford F-150 pickup truck would serve as the perfect platform. \nThe rear bodyguard bumper is home to an array of Heise LED lights and a massive Monster hook “I had an idea of how I wanted the truck to be built,” he said. “So I reached out to Keg Media, a company that does vehicle renderings, told them exactly what products I wanted in and on the truck and they did a rendering.” \nBrothers then used the rendering to sell the concept to other manufacturers who he thought would want to participate in the project. It wasn’t long before he had commitments from Metra, K&N Engineering, Brenthel Industries, Sony, Magnaflow, Bodyguard Bumpers, Heise Lighting, M-Racks, Fiber Tech Performance, Undercover, Rhino Racks, Monster Hooks, Addictive Desert Designs, DropStar Wheels and Hercules Tires. \nBrenthel contributed a Baja suspension kit, a pre-runner kit with a 4.5-inch lift that provides 12-inches of wheel travel and widens the stance of the truck 3-inches on each side. King 3.0 coilovers and upper and lower pre-runner control arms were used for the front set up. The rear suspension includes Deaver leaf springs and King 2.5 piggyback shocks. \nK&N provided a 71-2591 Blackhawk induction air intake system that includes a free-flowing, mandrel-bent aluminum tube, a washable and reusable air filter that has an oil-free synthetic filter media that can be used for up to 100,000 miles before cleaning is necessary, depending on driving conditions, and a heat shield that blocks hot air from the engine compartment from getting into the intake. The intake system offers an estimated 11.39-horsepower boost on the F-150 EcoBoost engine. \nThe K&N 71-2591 Blackhawk air intake system offers an estimated 11.39-horsepower to the F-150. Magnaflow contributed a cat back performance exhaust system to help the 5.0 liter Coyote engine exhale a little better. Bodyguard Bumpers up front and rear help to give the truck a meaner stance and provide better approach and departure angles. \nHeise LED lighting 30-inch blackout series light bar, cube fog lights, and spotlights, and flush mount cubes that all fit into Bodyguard front and rear bumpers help to light the way. In addition, a Heise 50-inch LED blackout series light bar for the M-Racks stealth roof rack and four LED single row lights for the four corners of the roof and a 40-inch Slim line on the rear ensure that Jon is never left in the dark. Metra also supplied their newest Turbo Touch installation kit for a Sony 6.4-inch Media Receiver with CarPlay. \nJust like the rear bumper, the front is filled with Heise lights and Monster Hook shackles Fiber Tech Performance donated a Ram air hood and Brothers added Heise LED lights into the hood vents. An Undercover Ridgelander bed cover tilts up via a Metra Electronics install bay motorized linear actuator and control module for easy bed access. For added storage capability, a Rhino Racks Xtray was mounted seamlessly to the Ridgelander bed cover along with a mountain trail bike rack system. \nMonster Hooks front Reaper forged shackles and rear mini shackles attach to the Bodyguard bumpers, while Addictive Desert Designs Baja XTR fenders and bedsides offer added wheel clearance. \nSpeaking of the wheel and tire package, Jon had a set of DropStar wheels wrapped in Hercules Terra Trac M/T tires from ATD wheels. \nExtreme Off-Road in Katy, Texas, was responsible for the majority of the build. Brothers noted that he and six employees of Extreme Off-Road worked for one month straight on the vehicle after hours from 6 p.m. until 3 a.m. some nights to have things ready in time for the SEMA show. \nWhile this may be Jon's daily driver, he is still confident in the products to get a little wild “We chose Extreme Off-Road to build the truck because they are a dealer for the manufacturers who supplied all of these amazing products; they built a total of nine SEMA vehicles that included Metra products and have a great reputation for building some of the nicest show trucks in the industry,” said Brothers. \nBrothers, who lives in Houston, Texas, has control of the vehicle. In fact, it is his daily driver as well as his business vehicle. \nThe truck was featured in DUB Magazine’s LFTDxLVLD booth outside the South Hall at the 2016 SEMA show. It will be exhibited at many Texas and surrounding states’ events including the Austin Texas Heatwave Show, DUB Show Tour, the Keystone Big Show, Meyer Distributing Show, and the Lifted Truck Nationals. It will also appear in LFTDxLVLD magazine. \nThe truck has been built for off-road driving, but also for practical everyday use visiting dealers. \n“I’ve taken it out and have had a lot of fun with it in the desert during our photo shoots,” Brothers concluded. \nDale Martin and Mountain Motion Media snapped the pictures.",

      "text": "  BMW, Ford, Mercedes, And VW Have Joined Forces To Destroy Tesla's Superchargers by Gabe Beita Kiser   For years, Tesla was poking a sleeping giant. That giant has just woken up. As of November 18, 2016, there were 264 Tesla supercharging stations throughout Europe, a fair number for an automaker that’s going above and beyond to single-handedly change the expectations of what an electric car manufacturer should deliver. As impressive as the feat is, Tesla can only do a fraction of what an auto giant can do when it takes initiative. Unfortunately for Tesla that’s exactly what’s happened, but it’s more than just one automaker, it’s four of the largest auto giants in existence. That’s because Daimler, BMW, Ford, and the Volkswagen Group have joined forces to electrify Europe by installing hundreds of fast charging stations. The network of DC chargers would enable owners of electric vehicles to take a road trip across Europe without range anxiety thanks to strategically placed charging stations. These would be unconventionally fast, using high kilowatt ratings to rapidly push juice into batteries. The proposed network would feature a capacity of 350 kW, blowing past the 145 kW currently offered by Tesla's supercharger network. This would likely allow for charging times that put Tesla’s superchargers to shame, although new vehicles would need to be designed for such a high capacity. The plan details the construction of 400 charging stations that, if finished quickly enough, will put Tesla behind the competition, which is already approaching fast in its rear view mirror . Chargers would be based off of the Combined Charging System technology developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and already in use in electric Volkswagen, Ford, and BMW models. Construction is slated to begin in 2017 and by 2020, these automakers hope that the addition of thousands of charge ports will help European customers on the fence about electric vehicles to finally buy one. It isn’t mentioned if these charging stations will cost money to use, but we can assume so. With plans for Europe taken care of, North America and Asia are the two regions we can expect these partners to focus on next. The main benefit of the expansion plan is to help usher in the era of the electric car and the fact that these massive auto giants have managed to agree on a standardized charging method shows how seriously each company is taking it. Maybe Porsche really will sell 20,000 Mission Es now that Europeans can take it on a road trip.",

      "text": "Ford, GM on Quest to Bring High-End Pickups to China Motor Trend 6 hrs ago Motor Trend Staff Ford, GM on Quest to Bring High-End Pickups to China Pickups make up a small portion of vehicle sales in China, and that's not surprising given these vehicles have long been restricted in urban areas throughout the nation. But the tide is changing, and Ford and General Motors are pushing to bring pickups to premium buyers in the world's largest auto market.\nResearch 2017 ford f-150 See Full Specs See Pricing Chevrolet said this month that it will sell Colorados and Silverados in China starting next year. In the same vein, Ford is shipping over the F-150 Raptor from Michigan to China in 2017. It's possible Ford will also introduce more mainstream F-150s to China as well, depending on demand and regulations, reports Reuters.\n\"The people who buy the Raptor maybe own some other premium vehicle already. This is another toy,\" Wesley Liu, Ford's Asia-Pacific sales director, told Reuters. Buyers for the truck will fall into four categories, he says: the wealthy, business owners, drivers who want an all-purpose vehicle, and \"gearheads.\"\nParts of China are starting to encourage more pickups on the road. Although most cities in China restrict trucks to overnight driving, four different provinces have launched pilot programs bringing pickups to urban areas to stimulate the economy and promote vehicle sales.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford F 150 Raptor at Auto China 2016 \"China's pick-up truck market will be very large in the future,\" predicts Yan Ningya, an official involved in the pilot project in the Hebei province.\nChinese automakers including Great Wall and Jiangling already sell pickup trucks, but models from GM and Ford promise to attract more premium buyers. Imported pickups should command a 25 percent import tax, making them a bit of a luxury purchase.\nEven before U.S. automakers arrive to take a piece of the pie, the pickup movement is starting to catch on in China. Sales this year are expected to reach 368,791 pickups, an increase of 14 percent, according to data from financial services company IHS Markit. That means pickups will account for 1.4 percent of the market in China. That's still a far cry from the 2.7 million pickups expected to be sold in the U.S. this year, making up 15 percent of the vehicle market on our shores.\nSource: Reuters\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Medium Large \nVolkswagen , Ford and BMW plan to set up a European network for speedy charging of electric cars and their batteries as automakers seek to overcome customer resistance to the vehicles. \nThe partnership, which will also include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG, aims to establish “thousands” of stations along European highways by 2020, the automakers said Tuesday in a statement. With an initial target of about 400 sites, the group plans to start the rollout in 2017, deploying technology that will be “significantly faster” than current setups. \n“A reliable, ultra-fast charging infrastructure is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said in the statement. \nThe rare broad-based cooperation shows the strains on automakers as they invest billions of dollars to develop battery-powered vehicles to comply with tighter environmental regulations. Buyers have so far shown little interest in the models because of limited driving range, the time needed for recharging and the high price of vehicles. \nBMW, for instance, sold fewer than 24,100 copies of the i3, out of the company’s total 2.2 million deliveries, while Renault-Nissan has only handed over 350,000 electric vehicles to customers since 2010, versus a target of 1.5 million by the end of 2016. \nGermany’s government agreed earlier this year to a US$1.06 billion financing package to encourage EV purchases, with about two-thirds of the figure slated for developing roadside charging stations. Tesla ’s network of 744 Supercharger-branded stations includes outlets across Europe. You may also like... ",

Subscribe Rate Of Female Fund Managers Has Not Improved Since 2008 Financial Crisis Designs by Nick DeSantis, Forbes staff \nFor the new JUST 100 List of America’s Best Corporate Citizens, Forbes partnered with Paul Tudor Jones’ Just Capital to identify the companies in each industry that excel at serving all stakeholders, beyond just the bottom line. \nThe doctrine of maximizing shareholder return has become religion in most of Corporate America’s C-suites over the last half century or so, but the companies we highlight have found a way to deliver strong investor returns without giving short shrift to employees, customers, suppliers and the environment. \nThe JUST 100 List scores companies on a variety of components that feed into 10 drivers of corporate integrity, and 32 companies were named the leaders in their particular industry. Here’s what 8 of those CEOs had to say about how and why they act as good corporate citizens. \nAmong Ford Motor’s community outreach efforts: a Thirty Under 30 program that connects tech-minded millennial employees with nonprofits. \n\nEastman Chemical partners with societies for women and minority engineers; it also supports employees who serve in the armed forces, making up pay differences while reservists are on active duty. \nNVIDIA doesn’t just win high marks for favorable worker perks like generous vacation time, it also stands out for limiting its environmental impact in an industry not known for being especially green. \nVarian Medical Systems makes devices that help treat cancer patients, so it’s a natural fit for mission-driven employees with a charitable mindset, but the company also has an eye on sustainability. It plans to divert 80% of solid waste from landfills by 2020. \nColgate-Palmolive accounts for 40% of the toothpaste tubes sold in the world, so it’s little surprise that it targets dentistry for corporate philanthropy efforts. It has provided free dental screenings for 850 million children in 80 countries. \nAccenture PLC expects 40% of its North American new hires in 2017 will be women, and almost half of its workforce are minorities. The company held a company-wide town hall in July to discuss race amid the ongoing dialogue over police shootings, \nDiscovery Communications provides 12 weeks of paid family leave, reimbursement for adoption and surrogacy services and has an on-site health and wellness center to keep employees happy and productive. \n\nMicrosoft gets high marks for worker treatment and diversity, and Nadella particularly cares about enhancing opportunities for underserved groups. One unique effort is a hiring program for people with autism. \n",

      "text": "Ford packs new Fiesta with advanced tech; adds Vignale, crossover variants November 30, 2016 @ 6:15 am Comments \nHave an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nCOLOGNE, Germany -- Ford of Europe is adding upscale and crossover versions of its new Fiesta, along with advanced safety technologies, to boost the car’s competitiveness in the tough subcompact segment. \nFord unveiled the new-generation Fiesta at its European headquarters here today. The Fiesta will go on sale in Europe next summer. The U.S. version is expected to launch in 2018. \n\"Our next-generation Fiesta will deliver an option for every driver -- from downsizing customers who want big-car quality in a small car package, to growing numbers of crossover consumers,\" Ford of Europe CEO Jim Farley said in a statement . \nFord said the new Fiesta has the most sophisticated range of driver assistance technologies and connectivity features offered to date in a volume small car in Europe. It has technology that small-car customers \"could only have dreamed of just a few years ago,\" Farley said. \nThe Fiesta’s 15 driver assistance technologies include a number of firsts for Ford or the segment, such as: \n• Enhanced pedestrian detection technology that can help prevent collisions at night by detecting people who are in or near the road ahead, or who may cross the vehicle's path. \n• A parking assistant that helps drivers find suitable spaces and park hands-free nose-to-tail and side-by-side with other cars. It can also apply the brakes to prevent low-speed bumps if drivers do not respond to system guidance and proximity warnings while maneuvering. \n• A \"Cross Traffic\" system that warns drivers reversing out of a parking space of vehicles that may soon be crossing behind them. \nThe Fiesta, which will have three- and five-door variants, has grown in size to distance it from Ford’s new Ka+ , which targets European customers seeking budget cars. At 4040mm, the Fiesta is 71mm longer than the current car. It is also 21mm wider. \nRegistrations of high-specification subcompact models have grown 24 percent year-on-year while demand for entry level models has grown 11 percent, Roelant de Waard, Ford of Europe’s sales and marketing chief, said in the statement. Ford now offers a \"greater choice\" for subcompact segment customers, he said. \nUpscale, crossover variants \nWhile the Ka+ battles in the lower regions of the segment, Ford has added upscale styling and interior features to the Fiesta. \nFor a more premium look the car now has parking sensors flush with the body panels. The shut-line between the roof and tailgate by has been reduced by more than 30 percent and road noise is reduced by 7 percent, Ford said. \nThe Fiesta’s top model will be the Vignale version and it extends the brand’s premium trim into subcompacts for the first time, joining the Mondeo, S-Max, Kuga and Edge Vignale models. Upmarket features include 18-inch alloy wheel designs, quilted leather seats and a hexagonal front grille. \nHigh-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Mercedes-Benz and Audi. Ford now wants to take further advantage of the desire of some customers for upscale cars. \"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Farley said. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" \nFarley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. \nThe Fiesta also will have a new crossover-styled variant named Active, which will be the first in a new lineup of Active vehicles to be rolled out across the Ford range. The Fiesta Active has SUV-inspired styling that includes raised ride height, roof bars and additional body cladding. The Fiesta Active has a raised ride height, roof bars and additional body cladding. \nThe Fiesta will also have an ST-Line model that takes its styling cues from a likely future ST sports version to include a rear spoiler, sports seats and a stiffer suspension. Other model trims include a Titanium model with a unique front bumper and grille. \nPowerful diesel \nLaunch models in Europe will come with a choice of three versions of Ford’s 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost gasoline engine, with the most powerful delivering 138 hp. A new six-speed manual transmission and active grille shutters cut CO2 emissions to 97 grams per kilometer. A 1.1-liter naturally aspirated version of the EcoBoost engine replaces the 1.25-liter entry gasoline unit. \nThe Fiesta will also offer a 118-hp 1.5-liter diesel, the highest powered diesel Ford has included in Fiesta’s engine range to date. An 84-hp diesel will also be offered with 10 hp more than the current equivalent engine and CO2 emissions of 82g/km. \nThe Fiesta will continue to be built for European sales in Cologne, Germany. It uses an updated version of the platform used by EcoSport small SUV and Ka+ hatchback. \nPricing is likely to stay competitive with that of the current car, a Ford spokesman said. However the Fiesta’s starting price has increased because Ford has dropped Fiesta’s two entry trim levels to make way for the new the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+, which competes for subcompact customers like the Fiesta after moving out of the minicar segment. \nThe Fiesta is Ford's top-selling passenger car in Europe and was the second best-selling subcompact car in the region through October after the Volkswagen Polo with sales of 253,180 through October (down 5.8 percent), according to data from JATO Dynamics market researchers. \nReuters contributed to this report You can reach Nick Gibbs at Tags:",

      "text": "0 Comments \nDespite being away from each other for decades, the tension between Ford and Ferrari never fully ceased. After all, the hatred between the two was about more than racing itself, it was about two men—Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II. \nYou may know that in the early ’60s Ferrari was days away from being owned by Ford, but you may not know what happened behind closed doors that halted the transaction. If you’re hungry for racing history, there’s only place I’d recommend you search. Sure, you could read a ton of books, watch a bunch of YouTube videos, or even try to piece many stories together and make your own conclusion, but that’d be silly. You could also just watch “The 24 Hour War,” and hear first-hand from the most respected sources in the motorsport industry. \n“The 24 Hour War” was produced and directed by Adam Carolla and Nate Adams, and includes commentary from Henry Ford III, Edsel Ford II, Piero Ferrari, Mario Andretti, Dan Gurney, David Hobbs, Bob Bondurant, Peter Brock, John Surtees, Mauro Forghieri. \nAs with most 1966 Le Mans documentaries, a portion of the story is dedicated to the controversy regarding Ken Miles and Denny Hulme losing their victory to Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon, despite leading the closing stages of the grueling race. “The 24 Hour War” sheds new light on this controversy, and it’s, well… controversial to say the least. \nThe roughly 1 hour and 40 minute film will take you deep into the intense negotiations that happened between the two powerhouses, as well as the superhero-like efforts that took place on both garages to beat each other at the world famous “24 Hours of Le Mans.” Some of the stories told by the likes of Piero Ferrari and Edsel Ford, both who were just children when this took place, will help you understand how these two men directed their racing teams and efforts with one goal in mind. Victory. \nYou can purchase the film at Chassy Media , and iTunes right now.",

      "text": "We’ve finally got our hands on a Focus RS to find out if this fast Ford can live up to its five-star road test billing in day-to-day use\n\nEveryone loves a fast Ford, right?\n\nIndeed, this year has arguably been the year of the fast Ford, with a glorious return to Le Mans , the arrival of the Fiesta ST 200 and the addition of right-hand-drive Mustangs to the UK line-up. For enthusiasts, Ford and its Ford Performance sub-division are very exciting brands right now.\n\nBut it’s the Focus RS that’s of the most interest, for a number of reasons. On top of following its two iconic predecessors (plus all manner of legendary classic fast Fords), the Focus RS also enters a fiercely competitive sector. For around £30,000, rivals include the Honda Civic Type R, Seat Leon Cupra 290, Audi S3, Volkswagen Golf R, BMW M135i and Peugeot 308 GTi 270. All are great cars, packing more technology, speed and enjoyment into the C-segment than would have been thought possible a decade ago.\n\nMuch has been said already about the Focus RS’s advanced fourwheel drive and torque vectoring, attributes that helped it to earn a five-star road test rating. On top of that, it brings adjustable dampers, launch control and a 2.3-litre Ecoboost engine making 345bhp. To pack all this into a £30,000 car is remarkable, so it will be fascinating to explore each and every part of it as a longer-term prospect.\n\nFirst things first, though, because ours isn’t quite a £30,000 car. Having been launched at £29,995, the base retail price for an RS is now £31,250 (or £31,000 when this one was registered). On top of that, our car comes with a few choice options that will most likely be added by many buyers. Most obvious is the Nitrous Blue paint, a £745 option that gives a much more vibrant look. The RS can appear a little plain in grey or black, and certainly so in the company of its brutish predecessors, so expect to see a lot of the Mk3 RSs in blue to restore the visual drama.\n\nIn addition, we have matching painted brake calipers (£100), the Luxury Pack (including power mirrors, rear parking sensors and cruise control) for £1000 and the £1145 Recaro front seats. Previous experience suggests the seats are very supportive but mounted too high, so it will interesting to see how that manifests itself day to day.\n\nYou’ll also notice the black forged wheels, which add another £595. To these eyes they’re another musthave, suiting the car better than the standard wheels. Both are 19in in diameter, a size that still seems rather barmy on a Ford Focus.\n\nThat lot makes this RS a £35,000 car, which is a somewhat pricier proposition but still competitive, given the performance. An Audi RS3, remember, with barely another 20bhp and a less advanced four-wheel drive system, is £40,000 before any options are added.\n\nGiven the demand for the Focus RS, we’ve had to wait quite a while to get hold of one. It also means this car already has just under 11,000 miles on the clock. Still, at least we don’t have to worry about running it in…\n\nBecause when you have three months with a Focus RS, it really is imperative to drive it at every opportunity. Inevitably it will be compared with its contemporaries and will most likely find its way onto a track on occasion, but it also needs to work day to day on the road. Can it feel special at ordinary speeds? And as a more mature hot hatch than the Focus RS has ever been, can it still entertain on those cheeky B-road blasts that define the modern fast Ford?\n\nInitial impressions are largely positive. These will be investigated more thoroughly over the coming weeks, of course, but there’s no doubting the Focus’s tremendous speed and thuggish character. There’s a sense of aggression and purpose to the car, from the way it rides to the way it sounds. Certainly it feels like a more serious prospect han the relatively soft ST, as you would expect.\n\nEarly downsides? The seats are most certainly set too high, although there are rumours of a dealer-fit option to address that – and being perched so high up means you spend less time looking at the low-rent dashboard. Interestingly, Ford has already introduced an updated Sync 3 infotainment system that supersedes the £465 Sync 2 in this car; we’ll aim to try a car so equipped to see how they compare. The boot seems a little pokey, too.\n\nDespite all that, there’s strong demand for the Focus’s key, to the point that it will be out of my hands by the time you read this. Whoever’s behind the wheel looks set to have a great time, though – but just how great we’ll aim to answer soon.\n\n*Matt Bird*\n\n*FORD FOCUS RS*\n\n*Price* £31,000 *Price as tested* £35,135* Options* RS Recaro seats £1145, Luxury Pack £1000, Nitrous Blue paint £745, 19in forged black alloys £595, Ford Sync2 multimedia system £465, painted calipers £100, door edge protectors £85* Economy *30.6mpg *Faults *None *Expenses* None",

      "text": "COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Ford (F.N) wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said. High-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi.\nBut Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too.\nThe next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants.\n\"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\"\nBut Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976.\nBenefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said.\nFarley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June.\nFord has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said.\nStill, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market.\nFord sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' (GM.N) Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit.\nSeparately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year. Ford has said it plans to offer a mass-market fully autonomous car by 2021.\n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

      "text": "But we'll fit them all for the American market!\n\nThe EcoSport has been a vital ingredient in Ford’s recipe of resilience in India. Just like most Ford cars, it is fun to drive,omfortable to be in and isn’t too heavy on the pocket. Launched in 2013, it has been one of the best selling cars for Ford and in the sub-4 metre SUV segment. But with the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza coming into the options list for customers, Ford has witnessed a steep decline in the EcoSport’s sales figures.\nIt is time for the American automaker to fight back. Ford unveiled the facelift of its EcoSport SUV in Los Angeles, California, on November 14, 2016. It is slated to go on sale in Brazil in the early part of 2017, before it comes to India, where it will be manufactured and exported for the American market as well. Ford released a list of features that will be offered on the American version of the EcoSport facelift. No doubt the feature list is mouth-watering but to keep the costs in check, the Indian version of the sub-4 metre SUV is likely to miss some of them. Here’s a list of features that, in all probability, won’t be offered on the EcoSport facelift in India.\n\n \n2.0-Litre Engine \nImagine a car that costs less than Rs 10 lakh and is powered by a 2.0-litre engine. Apart from being a powerhouse, a 2000cc engine will simply outgun everything in its segment and a segment above as well. Not even the bigger SUVs, such the Renault Duster, Honda BR-V and Hyundai Creta feature an engine that big. Well, there are three reasons behind it. One - big engines are jolly expensive to build, two - the fuel-economy figures aren’t impressive and three - to avail the excise benefit of a sub-4 metre SUV, the EcoSport can't feature an engine bigger than 1.5-litres. In a country like India, which is extremely price conscious, Ford is expected to stick with engine options which have smaller cubic capacity.\n\n  \n4-Wheel Drive \nFor the US market, Ford will mate the 4-Wheel Drive (4WD) system with the 2.0-litre engine only. The reason behind it is simple - a 4WD system requires more power from the engine to work its magic on the move. When engaged, a 4WD system brings the top speed and the fuel efficiency of a vehicle considerably down. While higher top speed isn’t a priority for the Indian market, good fuel-economy definitely is. Moreover, the smaller engines won’t have enough power to support a 4WD system effectively.\n\n \nBang & Olufsen Play Audio System \nIn the revamped EcoSport, Ford showcased an updated dashboard, with a bigger 8-inch infotainment system that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Mated to the screen is a 675-watt Bang & Olufsen (B&O) Play music system with 10 speakers. To get the best possible music experience, the entire sound system is installed by Harman acoustic engineers. While it would be a great addition, it is highly unlikely that the Indian version of the updated EcoSport will get it. B&O music systems are beautifully engineered and jaw-droppingly expensive. While India is expected to get the bigger screen and the phone-mirroring compatibility, powered by Google and Apple, the B&O Play will be too expensive to keep the final price competitive.\n\n\nSporty Interior Trim \nFord EcoSport’s main target audience in the US is the youth and therefore a sporty dual-tone interior trim works well to attract prospective customers. However, this isn’t the case in India. Here the EcoSport serves several types of customers and a major chunk comes from customers with two-plus-two families. While a dual-tone treatment on the inside is welcome, bright and sporty colours such as the one on the revamped EcoSport are expected to remain in the western hemisphere for the time being.\n\n\nNew Tailgate Design \nFord has got rid of the boot-mounted spare wheel and redone the styling of the tailgate. The spare-wheel now sits underneath the rear of the baby SUV. This new change is for the American market but Ford is expected to keep the boot-mounted spare wheel design at the rear for its Indian customers. The reason is simple - we like it. It gives a more masculine feel of the entire car, although it is the tiniest SUV with a Ford badge on it that money can buy. But who cares, right? As long as it looks butch, we don’t really care how big the really is.\nJust like the Ford Figo , which is built in India but specced generously, renamed as Ford Ka and is exported to markets in Europe, the updated EcoSport will be built here and then exported to the US from 2018.\nRead full article at cardekho.com",

      "text": "COLOGNE, Germany -- Ford will roll out SUV-styled variants of its cars under the label Active to attract customers looking for high-riding vehicles.\nThe new Fiesta will be the first Ford to have an Active variant with a raised ride height, roof bars and additional cladding. Other Active variants will be launched over the next few years, Ford said.\nFord of Europe's product development chief, Joe Bakaj, said people are buying crossovers and SUVs because they like the design so the automaker is responding to market demand. \"We came to the conclusion that for many people this is their idea of a stylish Fiesta,\" he said today at the unveiling of the latest-generation Fiesta at Ford's European headquarters here.\nCrossover styling is typically more popular for larger vehicles than subcompact cars but previous examples in the segment have included the Rover 25 Streetwise and the Citroen C3 XTR.\nFord hinted that it was planning rugged versions of its core cars in Europe such as the Fiesta, Focus and Mondeo earlier this year. \"We see a big growth area in vehicles that are a bit rugged. They're not SUVs but they still have this more active look to them,\" Ford of Europe's former chief operating officer, Barb Samarzdich, told Automotive News Europe in March.\nThe style was popularized by the Audi A6 Allroad and has since been embraced by other European brands. Models include the VW Passat Alltrack, Skoda Octavia Scout and Opel Insignia Country Tourer.\nYou can reach Nick Gibbs at ngibbs@crain.com .",

      "text": "  \nPickups make up a small portion of vehicle sales in China, and that’s not surprising given these vehicles have long been restricted in urban areas throughout the nation. But the tide is changing, and Ford and General Motors are pushing to bring pickups to premium buyers in the world’s largest auto market. \nChevrolet said this month that it will sell Colorados and Silverados in China starting next year. In the same vein, Ford is shipping over the F-150 Raptor from Michigan to China in 2017. It’s possible Ford will also introduce more mainstream F-150s to China as well, depending on demand and regulations, reports Reuters . \n“The people who buy the Raptor maybe own some other premium vehicle already. This is another toy,” Wesley Liu, Ford’s Asia-Pacific sales director, told Reuters . Buyers for the truck will fall into four categories, he says: the wealthy, business owners, drivers who want an all-purpose vehicle, and “gearheads.” \nParts of China are starting to encourage more pickups on the road. Although most cities in China restrict trucks to overnight driving, four different provinces have launched pilot programs bringing pickups to urban areas to stimulate the economy and promote vehicle sales. \n“China’s pick-up truck market will be very large in the future,” predicts Yan Ningya, an official involved in the pilot project in the Hebei province. \nChinese automakers including Great Wall and Jiangling already sell pickup trucks, but models from GM and Ford promise to attract more premium buyers. Imported pickups should command a 25 percent import tax, making them a bit of a luxury purchase. \nEven before U.S. automakers arrive to take a piece of the pie, the pickup movement is starting to catch on in China. Sales this year are expected to reach 368,791 pickups, an increase of 14 percent, according to data from financial services company IHS Markit. That means pickups will account for 1.4 percent of the market in China. That’s still a far cry from the 2.7 million pickups expected to be sold in the U.S. this year, making up 15 percent of the vehicle market on our shores.",

      "text": "From Road & Track The Ford Fiesta is easily one of our favorite hatchbacks on sale , and now there's a new one. This new Fiesta made its debut at a launch event in Germany, and while the car you see here isn't U.S.-spec, it gives us a good idea of what to look forward to.\nThe car pictured above is trimmed out in Ford's so-called ST-Line, which apes the look of the hotter Fiesta ST. It's not quite the hot hatch we're all waiting for , but it foreshadows handsome things to come.\nView photos\nPhoto credit: Ford More Ford also debuted three other trims for the Fiesta, the Titanium, luxurious Vingale, and the SUV-like Active. It's unclear which of these trims (if any) will come to the U.S., but the Titanium seems like a safe bet. A Ford spokesperson told Road & Track that it'd have more to reveal on the U.S.-spec Fiesta at a later date.\nAuto Express reports that the next-generation Fiesta shares its platform with the current model, which is a good thing since the current Fiesta has a superb chassis . Ford has moved the Fiesta more upmarket with a stylish, better equipped interior as well.\nView photos\nPhoto credit: Ford More Previously, we reported that Ford is considering using a version of its 1.0-liter three-cylinder for the Fiesta ST, but that's yet to be confirmed. That three-cylinder will almost certainly be available in lower trims, though. Interestingly, Ford announced that it will offer cylinder deactivation in its three-cylinder EcoBoost, which temporarily turns the motor into a parallel twin.\nView photos\nPhoto credit: Ford More The new Fiesta looks promising, but we just want to see the ST.\nThis story was updated at 3:45 p.m. ET with new information from Ford.\nYou Might Also Like\nNine of the Fastest American Cars to Ever Lap the Nurburgring Ten of the Most Outrageous Pickup Trucks Ever Produced These Concepts for Le Mans 2030 Give Us Hope for the Future of Motorsports",

The Ford Figo and Aspire carlines are offered across a total of five and four trims, respectively, and the anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electronic brake-force distribution (EBD) feature was earlier being offered only on the top-end Titanium and Titanium+ trims. 4.94 Lakh * On Road Price (New Delhi) FIND OUT MORE \nWith car safety quickly climbing the priority list in India and across the world, the government of India is said to be planning to make airbags and ABS a mandatory provision on all trims of all cars. In view of the future safety norms , several manufacturers have initiated introduction of a myriad of safety features to their respective model line-ups. Maruti Suzuki also recently made ISOFIX mounts a standard provision across the Ciaz carline . \nVolkswagen recently introduced ABS and dual front airbags as standard fitment across the entire Polo and Vento range , thus making the two safety features standard for all its models in India. As far as Ford goes, while it has introduced ABS with EBD on the Trend trim of Figo and Aspire, it already offers driver airbags as standard across its entire model range in India, that comprises Figo, Asipre, EcoSport , Endeavour , and Mustang .",

      "title": "Ford's $1B profit in Europe so far this year could vanish following Brexit",
      "text": "By : Adrian Padeanu , Editor Ford of Europe has been doing great this year, but the Brexit is already eating into the company's profits. \nAfter cutting many jobs, shutting down three factories and revising its European lineup, Ford earned $259 million on the old continent last year, its first profit since 2011. It has already managed to greatly improve last year’s results as through the first nine months of 2016 the Blue Oval company posted a $1 billion pre-tax profit, thus beating Ford’s objective for this year to make $600 million. \nFord's president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Jim Farley, said “we are overachieving because of our people,” but unfortunately it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. That’s because the repercussions of the vote on Brexit are already taking a toll on Ford’s earnings, with CFO Bob Shanks saying United Kingdom’s June decision to leave the European Union cost Ford $60 million in Q2 2016. Not only that, but it will likely have a $140-million impact in the second half of the year as a consequence of a decreased demand in U.K. Bob Shanks says Ford is preparing to lose as much as $400-$500 million per year in 2017 and 2018, with the total Brexit impact estimated to stand at $1.2 billion by the end of 2018. \nOn the flip side, new products such as the recently introduced Fiesta and the all-new Focus coming next year should offset some of the losses. In addition, Ford now also has the Ka+ five-door city hatchback as its entry-level offering in Europe and it should prove to be more successful than its smaller, three-door predecessor based on the Fiat 500. \n2017 will be the year when Ford will kick off testing of autonomous cars on European roads, something which it’s been doing in United States for a while with Fusion Hybrid prototypes . All these efforts are being made to prepare for the introduction of an entirely autonomous car for ride sharing slated to arrive in 2021 without pedals or a steering wheel.

      "text": "Story highlights Ford Vox: For future HHS Secretary Tom Price, your pre-existing condition isn't a priority \"Empowering Patients\" begins to look a lot more like \"Empowering Insurance Companies,\" writes Vox. Ford Vox is a physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist. He is a medical analyst for NPR station WABE-FM 90.1 in Atlanta. He writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. \n(CNN) You might remember President-elect Donald Trump telling us that he'd like to keep some parts of Obamacare. That was two weeks ago. With his announcement Tuesday that Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, will be his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, any type of preservation is highly unlikely. Price is one of the law's archenemies. \nFord Vox Seven years ago, during the heat of committee debates over the ACA, Price delivered a blistering speech condemning Democrats for an unwillingness to negotiate with him and other Republicans amid their harried push to get the Affordable Care Act through Congress. Price didn't have a fully articulated alternative back then, but he knew what he didn't like about Obamacare. \"What you all are planning is to increase drastically the intrusion of the federal government into the practice of medicine and the care of patients,\" he said. Of course Price was right. But we needed that \"intrusion\" of the federal government due to the crisis precipitated by the failures of medical professionals, the health care industry and the insurance industry to get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who had no access to care. Individual clinicians and hospitals may not be public utilities, but the system as a whole requires oversight to make sure it serves that function. Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are by no means elegant solutions, but they get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who didn't have coverage before, and offer important new protections for everyone else. Read More Donald Trump keeps DC swampy Price didn't just sit and fester over the years. He's got a plan now But it's not written with the uninsured and the poor at the forefront. No, the driving concept behind Price's Empowering Patients First Act is protecting the choices of patients who have money. If you have the money to shop around, you'll be able to choose from a broad national market of insurance plans. There's no mandate to buy insurance at all, unlike Obamacare, and if you do buy insurance, you can pick from a threadbare plan that's cheaper because it excludes large categories of care -- like maternity care, reproductive care, or rehabilitation, for example. Obamacare required holistic health insurance covering all the major categories of events that we know can happen to anyone. Price is also looking out for any well-to-do patients on Medicare who would like to be able to use Medicare dollars to offset more expensive fees from doctors and clinics who don't participate in Medicare. This rule change alone would rock health care by encouraging an exodus of providers out of Medicare's core cost-containment bargain: to treat Medicare patients, providers have always had to agree to take whatever reimbursement Medicare offers for the privilege of serving its beneficiaries. What about coverage for pre-existing conditions? Trump told \"60 Minutes\" and the Wall Street Journal he really liked that aspect of Obamacare, but for Price, your pre-existing condition isn't a priority. Price's plan will allow sick patients to stay in the regular market so long as they can keep paying their premiums. If a patient gets so sick she can't work to pay her premiums, insurers can jack up her rates 150%. If she becomes too poor to afford that, then she is relegated to high risk pools that will vary in quality state by state. These are small markets that need federal subsidies to work, and those subsidies are capped. If the high risk pools fill up, using up all its funds, then new patients simply can't enroll. What to know about the future of Obamacare Suddenly, \"Empowering Patients\" begins to look a lot more like \"Empowering Insurance Companies.\" Indeed, insurers can charge what they like for the one pre-existing condition we all may be so fortunate to develop: old age. As you get into the age brackets where you're more likely to need health care, you'll pay whatever insurers think the market can bear. Price wants our health care access to depend on how much competition we can foster between insurance companies to get new customers. In other highly regulated markets, like the airline industry , that concept isn't working out too well. Your only protection against those extra costs will be a capped tax deduction. In contrast to Price's efforts to empower insurance executives, I think Obamacare erred in large part by not regulating insurance companies even more tightly (the law could have forced them to participate in the exchanges to stay in business at all, for example). Price's law even acknowledges some insurance plans will have to come with an asterisk and a warning. \"This policy may be less expensive than others because it is not subject to all of the insurance laws and regulations\" of your home state, shoppers are told , and \"this policy is not subject to all of the consumer protection laws or restrictions on rate changes\" of your home state. But all the skimpy plans Price could potentially offer would still be better than the void we had before Obamacare. It's my sincere hope that we won't see a repetition of the errors Democrats made while crafting the Affordable Care Act. Having experienced the other side of a legislative fiat, I hope that an HHS Secretary Price will bring Democrats to the table as he participates in crafting legislation behind the scenes with congressional Republicans. And everyone in Congress needs to keep in mind that the health care industry, particularly clinicians and hospitals, can only endure so much radical change within a short period. Hill GOP split on how to roll back Obamacare It certainly does no good if Republicans implement a whole new health care reform that will only be wiped away in a few years if the other party takes charge. To that end, the ideal course of action is revising Obamacare to inject more of the freedom and choice Republicans prioritize, both for patients and providers, while preserving and strengthening the law's requirements that insurance companies offer holistic coverage to everyone. But our toxic politics won't allow for such sensible, professional legislating. The best we can hope for from Price and his cohort are policies that manage to achieve the same ends in markedly different ways. I live in Price's district of northern Atlanta suburbs. The value of these suburbs as places to live comes not from their being 70% white. The value of Atlanta's suburbs comes entirely from their proximity to a more cosmopolitan urban center. We have to think of health care the same way, it can't work just for the rich. Indeed if anyone in Price's district has a serious enough injury, they'll go to a publicly funded hospital on the south side of downtown Atlanta, where the demographics are quite different. Price knows it well. Besides founding a private orthopedic practice that is now the largest in the state, he also spent time training orthopedic residents at Grady Memorial Hospital, the region's safety net. Hospitals like Grady do the work the private hospitals up north don't want to do. Grady would be a stronger institution if Georgia had expanded Medicaid as Obamacare intended, but Price even calls for taking that option away from other states who want to continue using the expansion.

      "text": "Four by Ford: through rivers, lakes, dikes and trails Text: Jenna Genio / Photos: Jenna V. Genio, Ford   15:50 Experiencing the EcoSport, Escape, Everest and Explorer With four SUVs — each with a unique personality and purpose — deciding which Ford off-roader is right for you can be a pretty difficult task when done just in the showroom. At the Ford SUV Experience, the decision was made easier when each was put in its element. Ford Philippines organized a pretty major sampler of their off-road vehicles in Pampanga. We tested four different cars over two days in realistic driving conditions. The trip was meant to simulate the exploits of common consumers — the target markets and eventual buyers of certain vehicles. From open highways and narrow provincial roads to rocky rivers of lahar and tedious traffic jams, the weekend was practical and true to life for all intents and purposes. The idea was to make Midori Hotel and Casino in Clark, Angeles our base. We’d then hop into each of the four test units, drive in a convoy along designated routes, and do some activities that Ford PH had in store for us. The first morning, we met for a safety briefing and listened to the presentations of a couple of guys from Ford Asia Pacific. Nick Eterovic, the Interior Design Strategy Manager of Ford Asia Pacific, stressed Ford’s philosophy in evoking capability, versatility, and modernity via aesthetic cues. Communicating inherent robustness is key. He talked about how things such as bold horizontal lines and strategic plating give the image of ruggedness. A lot of thought and care is put into the design of Ford’s vehicles; it isn’t all about looks but also function. Space is strategically expanded for ease in loading cargo and family-oriented tasks such as putting kids into car seats. Lines direct airflow around Ford’s vehicles for optimal aerodynamics. They want their cars to perform well and look good in the process — as Eterovic put it, “tough but not rough.” Nick Allen was up next. As the Attribute Lead Engineer for Off-Road Capability for Ford Asia Pacific, he’s tasked with assuring that the requirements for off-road vehicle classification are met. Ford’s SUVs were meant to attack rough terrain, while maintaining a car-like feel with creature comforts that keep the drive rewarding. Approach, departure, and rampover angles were planned with purpose, as well as damage-avoiding placement of intakes and sensors. When it comes to river crossings and flash floods, water wading capability was considered; for example, the Ford Everest can wade through water up to 800mm while the EcoSport can up to 550mm. Mr. Allen also helped test and develop Ford’s intelligent off-roading electronic mode suite — the Terrain Management System (TMS). Ford EcoSport The first car my partner and I got to drive was the Ford EcoSport. The itinerary had us take the Mega Dike Access Road to a lantern making shop in San Fernando. That was a cute detour highlighting the festive city’s more famous, seasonal industry. We then made our own halo-halo at Susie’s Cuisine, and did a fun souvenir shopping challenge at Nepo Mart that entailed loading coconut crates into the EcoSport’s roomy back as well as some haggling. The subcompact EcoSport is a looker with its subtly curved fenders and matte cladding, to me at least. While others may find its styling awkward I think that the outside is quite appealing — especially in the youth-oriented color choices it comes in. The interiors were all right. To me, the center console seemed a bit collegiate (a word I’ve been using more and more the older I get)… But then again the funky button layout was made to appeal to younger folks. The front-wheel-drive EcoSport manages to still deliver a little punch and handling, although not that much even with its 1.5L four-banger making 142 Nm of torque and almost 110 PS. Perhaps it was the control of the convoy or the populated roads, but the pull of its acceleration made me go, “well that felt smooth” instead of “well that was fun”. Then again, who’s to complain with the small engine, right? It felt economical because it is, but maybe try the Fiesta first. 200mm of ground clearance will help the EcoSport in unpaved territory, but it’s not going to make a rutty wilderness trail easy or pleasant. You’re better off sticking to well-maintained, flat, and tame paths to the resort or to the farm. Having said that, there’s still a lot of fun to be had exploring in a car that’s so small and relatively good-looking. It’ll look great in old travel photos when you reminisce about the carefree days. Ford Everest Right after, it was time to bring the Ford Everest Titanium out of town and off-roading. I’d never driven on soft, sandy lahar before. Luckily, having Mr. Allen riding shotgun (acting as an instructor of sorts) left no room for anxiety. Who better to show me the ropes as the head engineer, right? Turning the Everest’s TMS dial on the fly between “Sand” mode and “Rock” mode was a cinch (other modes are “Normal” and “Snow/Gravel/Grass”). We were also tipped off when to electronically lock the rear differential and when to switch to low-range four-wheel-drive. You can take most dirt roads with ease in the Everest, but I still recognize choosing the right combination of settings for more challenging terrain an art form I have yet to adequately grasp. That off-roading part was the highlight of the trip. Carrying speed through sandy rivers, making huge waves, and crawling over rocks was as fun as it sounds. We were driving between jagged moss-covered rock formations and picturesquely tall grass — kicking up volcanic ash and listening to music in protected comfort. Enjoying the scenery and the air conditioning, I listened intently to Mr. Allen recount his experiences in the Australian desert. His team spends a week at a time researching, developing, and testing cars out in the middle of nowhere. He’d sleep under the Milky Way at night, after long days putting vehicles through the wringer — often trying to break them. Roughing it up is part of the job after all, and it’s what’s required for him to be able to go back and tell Ford what the cars need and where. Ford SUVs like the Ranger-based Everest have been through this development process and hearing about that creates trust, although experience is all the proof one needs. This wasn’t the first time I’d been in an Everest doing some remarkable things that the average customer probably didn’t realize was that easy. I’ve become a big fan. The Everest’s got great connectivity, feels right, and its intelligent four-wheel-drive control system is ace. All around, it’s a great and intuitive SUV package. I feel kind of bad for the markets where the Ranger and Everest aren’t available. Then again, you never know what the future has in store. The US can cross their fingers at the rumors. Ford Explorer After some lovely overnight recuperation at Midori, it was time for more driving the next day. We got into the Explorer Sport with its 3.5 V6 EcoBoost engine and hit the highway. Now, that was rolling in style. As soon as I sat in the car I let out a satisfied sigh. The immediate sense was that of pride and luxury with all the sense and without any silliness. It has the passing power, technology, terrain settings, and premium amenities with road presence to boot. My partner even gave the smart cruise control a go, and the Explorer managed to appropriately slow down and speed up based on the behavior of the car in front. I’m the type that still likes to maintain full control while driving, but I do give props to that safety feature. We took the Explorer on some rocky dirt trails around Green Canyon Resort and, just as expected, it was a piece of cake… A big, beefy, twin-turbocharged cake that makes 370 PS and 470 Nm of torque. In a convoy of Explorers, I made some fed-y jokes and the other journalists cracked some about VIPs and politicians. These seriously handsome SUVs just make one feel powerful — like you’ve done good for yourself. If you can shell out for an Explorer Sport, you’ll probably be able to afford the fuel consumption too. We found out firsthand that it’s rather thirsty whichever way you drive it. Ford Escape Our Ford SUV Experience ended with the Ford Escape Titanium, which was the perfect conclusion. We took it to the Lakeshore through pretty horrendous traffic that eventually gave way to some clear back roads. After slowly inching through those painfully “realistic” bits through town, the leisurely respite by the man-made lake was welcome. Back to downsizing, this compact crossover was a joy. To me, personally, it was the Goldilocks Zone. My daily is a sedan, so driving the Escape just felt right. It was more mature than the EcoSport and more maneuverable than the bigger SUVs. The fact that the 241 PS and 366 Nm of torque its turbocharged 2.0L makes was being delivered to all four wheels at every given moment just inspired confidence. I’ve always considered it far from sexy, but the drive itself brought such ease and joy that what the car looked like on the outside didn’t even matter anymore. The ride was smooth and it wasn’t sluggish. The interiors were neither distracting nor gimmicky. This is the car for the young professional who isn’t getting any younger — who might be starting a family but also places value on good old adventure time. I can see the Escape taking forest roads to trailheads, braving a bit of snow and ice, or even towing a trailer with a motorcycle or small camper on top. Although off-roading in the Everest was the best part of the trip, piloting the Escape gave me the best driver-car connection; I just wished it had a cooler appearance. It really is something you could choose to upgrade from if you were able, but you might never even need to because you might never feel like growing out of it. It was a great weekend hanging out with fellow journalists and getting to know the Ford Asia Pacific guys on the side. The two Nicks were awesome guys and true enthusiasts. We can lament the waning interest in power-cruising muscle sedans while praising the industry’s direction towards fuel efficiency, innovation, and practicality. The market’s demands shape the industry, and Ford’s SUV lineup is predicted to make up 40% of its sales by 2020. Utility vehicles and crossovers dominate the present desire and still will in the foreseeable future. With half a century of SUV manufacturing experience, Ford’s determined to stay ahead of the curve. IMAGE GALLERY",

      "text": "Ford Will Pay $62 Million To Brazilian State Due To 1999 Factory Cancelation | By Share At the end of the 1990s, Ford decided to build a new car factory in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. However, the automaker changed its mind shortly after and went for the state of Bahia instead. Selecting the new location for the facility set the basis of a lawsuit , filed by the local authorities of Rio Grande do Sul against the automaker. After 17 years, the two parties have, according to Reuters , reached a settlement, which sees the company paying 217 million reais ($61,9 million) in compensation. The money will be used by the country's southernmost state to help pay state employees. The Camacari plant in Bahia, on the other hand, celebrated its production kickoff back in 2001, and currently counts 8,753 employees, who are putting together the Fiesta RoCam and EcoSport .

      "text": "Ford, Renault, Tata, Honda Car sales report for November 2016 \nExcept for Renault India, all three other car manufacturers have posted a decline in sales. \nHonda \nHonda Car India continues to report a negative growth in sales for yet another month. For the month of November 2016, Honda has registered sales of 8,029 units as against 14,712 units which were sold in November 2015. This is a massive decline of 44%. Exports for Nov 16 stood at 697 units. \nThough the company did not reveal any specific reason for decline, the reason we can guess is the launch of new cars in the segment which has taken the share away from Honda. For example, Honda City has been dethroned by Maruti Ciaz as the No 1 selling car in the segment. \nFord \nFord domestic sales posted decline once again. Ford India registered sales of 6,876 units last month as against 8,416 units sold in November 2015. This is a decline of 18.3%. EcoSport continued to be the company’s best-selling car. Exports continued to outperform domestic demand. Ford India exported 14,128 cars last month as against 8,416 units exported in November 2015. \nTata Motors \nTata Motors registered cumulative (passenger + commercial + exports) sales of 38,900 units in Nov 2016, as against 38,918 units sold in Nov 2015. This is a marginal decline. \nSpeaking about their passenger car segment, thanks to the new Tiago, the company continues to post positive sales growth. For Nov 2016, Tata sold 12,736 units as against 10,470 units sold last year same month. This is a 22% growth in sales. \nRenault \nThanks to Kwid, Renault continues to post impressive sales growth. For November 2016 Renault India sales stood at 9,604 units as against 7,819 units sold in Nov 2015.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Despite an OPEC oil production cut, the stock market did not follow oil’s surge higher on Wednesday, and Thursday morning is looking to open soft to flat in early trading indications. What remains in place at this point is the theme of investors proving at every opportunity that they will buy stocks on any real pullbacks. Those same investors are also looking for new ideas to generate gains or income.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other analyst calls cover stocks to sell or to avoid.\nOn a brief note on oil, many of the secondary and third tier oil companies rallied 15% to 30% — could it have been too much considering OPEC’s history of not sticking to quotas and cuts?\nThese are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Thursday morning:\nAlcoa Corp.

      "text": "Trump's HHS pick hates Obamacare 01:51 Story highlights Ford Vox: For future HHS Secretary Tom Price, your pre-existing condition isn't a priority \"Empowering Patients\" begins to look a lot more like \"Empowering Insurance Companies,\" writes Vox. Ford Vox is a physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist. He is a medical analyst for NPR station WABE-FM 90.1 in Atlanta. He writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) You might remember President-elect Donald Trump telling us that he'd like to keep some parts of Obamacare. That was two weeks ago. With his announcement Tuesday that Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, will be his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, any type of preservation is highly unlikely. Price is one of the law's archenemies. Ford Vox Seven years ago, during the heat of committee debates over the ACA, Price delivered a blistering speech condemning Democrats for an unwillingness to negotiate with him and other Republicans amid their harried push to get the Affordable Care Act through Congress. Price didn't have a fully articulated alternative back then, but he knew what he didn't like about Obamacare. \"What you all are planning is to increase drastically the intrusion of the federal government into the practice of medicine and the care of patients,\" he said. Of course Price was right. But we needed that \"intrusion\" of the federal government due to the crisis precipitated by the failures of medical professionals, the health care industry and the insurance industry to get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who had no access to care. Individual clinicians and hospitals may not be public utilities, but the system as a whole requires oversight to make sure it serves that function. Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are by no means elegant solutions, but they get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who didn't have coverage before, and offer important new protections for everyone else. Read More Donald Trump keeps DC swampy Price didn't just sit and fester over the years. He's got a plan now But it's not written with the uninsured and the poor at the forefront. No, the driving concept behind Price's Empowering Patients First Act is protecting the choices of patients who have money. If you have the money to shop around, you'll be able to choose from a broad national market of insurance plans. There's no mandate to buy insurance at all, unlike Obamacare, and if you do buy insurance, you can pick from a threadbare plan that's cheaper because it excludes large categories of care -- like maternity care, reproductive care, or rehabilitation, for example. Obamacare required holistic health insurance covering all the major categories of events that we know can happen to anyone. Price is also looking out for any well-to-do patients on Medicare who would like to be able to use Medicare dollars to offset more expensive fees from doctors and clinics who don't participate in Medicare. This rule change alone would rock health care by encouraging an exodus of providers out of Medicare's core cost-containment bargain: to treat Medicare patients, providers have always had to agree to take whatever reimbursement Medicare offers for the privilege of serving its beneficiaries. What about coverage for pre-existing conditions? Trump told \"60 Minutes\" and the Wall Street Journal he really liked that aspect of Obamacare, but for Price, your pre-existing condition isn't a priority. Price's plan will allow sick patients to stay in the regular market so long as they can keep paying their premiums. If a patient gets so sick she can't work to pay her premiums, insurers can jack up her rates 150%. If she becomes too poor to afford that, then she is relegated to high risk pools that will vary in quality state by state. These are small markets that need federal subsidies to work, and those subsidies are capped. If the high risk pools fill up, using up all its funds, then new patients simply can't enroll. What to know about the future of Obamacare Suddenly, \"Empowering Patients\" begins to look a lot more like \"Empowering Insurance Companies.\" Indeed, insurers can charge what they like for the one pre-existing condition we all may be so fortunate to develop: old age. As you get into the age brackets where you're more likely to need health care, you'll pay whatever insurers think the market can bear. Price wants our health care access to depend on how much competition we can foster between insurance companies to get new customers. In other highly regulated markets, like the airline industry , that concept isn't working out too well. Your only protection against those extra costs will be a capped tax deduction. In contrast to Price's efforts to empower insurance executives, I think Obamacare erred in large part by not regulating insurance companies even more tightly (the law could have forced them to participate in the exchanges to stay in business at all, for example). Price's law even acknowledges some insurance plans will have to come with an asterisk and a warning. \"This policy may be less expensive than others because it is not subject to all of the insurance laws and regulations\" of your home state, shoppers are told , and \"this policy is not subject to all of the consumer protection laws or restrictions on rate changes\" of your home state. But all the skimpy plans Price could potentially offer would still be better than the void we had before Obamacare. It's my sincere hope that we won't see a repetition of the errors Democrats made while crafting the Affordable Care Act. Having experienced the other side of a legislative fiat, I hope that an HHS Secretary Price will bring Democrats to the table as he participates in crafting legislation behind the scenes with congressional Republicans. And everyone in Congress needs to keep in mind that the health care industry, particularly clinicians and hospitals, can only endure so much radical change within a short period. Hill GOP split on how to roll back Obamacare It certainly does no good if Republicans implement a whole new health care reform that will only be wiped away in a few years if the other party takes charge. To that end, the ideal course of action is revising Obamacare to inject more of the freedom and choice Republicans prioritize, both for patients and providers, while preserving and strengthening the law's requirements that insurance companies offer holistic coverage to everyone. But our toxic politics won't allow for such sensible, professional legislating. The best we can hope for from Price and his cohort are policies that manage to achieve the same ends in markedly different ways. I live in Price's district of northern Atlanta suburbs. The value of these suburbs as places to live comes not from their being 70% white. The value of Atlanta's suburbs comes entirely from their proximity to a more cosmopolitan urban center. We have to think of health care the same way, it can't work just for the rich. Indeed if anyone in Price's district has a serious enough injury, they'll go to a publicly funded hospital on the south side of downtown Atlanta, where the demographics are quite different. Price knows it well. Besides founding a private orthopedic practice that is now the largest in the state, he also spent time training orthopedic residents at Grady Memorial Hospital, the region's safety net. Hospitals like Grady do the work the private hospitals up north don't want to do. Grady would be a stronger institution if Georgia had expanded Medicaid as Obamacare intended, but Price even calls for taking that option away from other states who want to continue using the expansion.

      "text": "Ford F-150 Raptor, Chevy Silverado Headed to China World's largest auto market wants pickups By: Kelly Pleskot November 30, 2016 \nP ickups make up a small portion of vehicle sales in China, and that’s not surprising given these vehicles have long been restricted in urban areas throughout the nation. But the tide is changing, and Ford and General Motors are pushing to bring pickups to premium buyers in the world’s largest auto market . \nChevrolet said this month that it will sell Colorados and Silverados in China starting next year. In the same vein, Ford is shipping over the F-150 Raptor from Michigan to China in 2017. It’s possible Ford will also introduce more mainstream F-150s to China as well, depending on demand and regulations, reports Reuters . \n“The people who buy the Raptor maybe own some other premium vehicle already. This is another toy,” Wesley Liu, Ford’s Asia-Pacific sales director, told Reuters . Buyers for the truck will fall into four categories, he says: the wealthy, business owners, drivers who want an all-purpose vehicle, and “gearheads.” \nParts of China are starting to encourage more pickups on the road. Although most cities in China restrict trucks to overnight driving, four different provinces have launched pilot programs bringing pickups to urban areas to stimulate the economy and promote vehicle sales. \n“China’s pick-up truck market will be very large in the future,” predicts Yan Ningya, an official involved in the pilot project in the Hebei province. \nChinese automakers including Great Wall and Jiangling already sell pickup trucks, but models from GM and Ford promise to attract more premium buyers. Imported pickups should command a 25 percent import tax, making them a bit of a luxury purchase. \nEven before U.S. automakers arrive to take a piece of the pie, the pickup movement is starting to catch on in China. Sales this year are expected to reach 368,791 pickups, an increase of 14 percent, according to data from financial services company IHS Markit. That means pickups will account for 1.4 percent of the market in China. That’s still a far cry from the 2.7 million pickups expected to be sold in the U.S. this year, making up 15 percent of the vehicle market on our shores.",

Discounts as a share of vehicle price rose 13% over a year earlier, according to TrueCar. Incentives now average $3,475 per vehicle industry-wide. \nOne contributing factor was Black Friday promotions, which are having an increasingly sizable effect on the month's output. \nThat will cut into profits as automakers jockey for market share. But on the whole, November was still quite lucrative for the industry. \nOverall U.S. auto sales increase projections ranged from 2.7% at Edmunds.com to 4.2% at Kelley Blue Book. \nHere's the breakdown for the major domestic automakers: \nGeneral Motors \nGM outperformed expectations, as overall sales rose 10.2%. That included an 8% gain in retail sales, which are more profitable than sales to fleet customers. \nAnalysts at Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book projected overall GM sales increases of 8.4% and 8.6%, respectively. \nThe automaker's four U.S. brands recorded increases, with Chevrolet up 8.1%, GMC up 14.1%, Cadillac up 14.5% and Buick up 16.1%. \nThe company said it is ahead of its planned pace of selling down 2016 inventory, an encouraging sign for pricing and therefore profitability. \nGM stock jumped 3.6% to $35.76 at 9:54 a.m. \nFord Motor \nFord's sales increased 5.2% for the month to 197,574 vehicles, easily beating expectations. That included a 10% increase in retail sales, bolstering the bottom line. \nThe company's flagship Ford brand was up 4.6%. Its luxury Lincoln brand continued its hot streak, rising 19.1%. \nFord stock rose 4% to $12.44 at 9:57 a.m. \nAnalysts at Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book had projected overall Ford sales increases of 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively. \nFiat Chrysler \nFiat Chrysler was the exception to the industry rule in November. Its sales fell 14.3%. \nAnalysts at Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book projected sales decreases of 14.2% and 4.5%, respectively. \nThe company said its retail sales fell 2%, but a massive 42% slide in its fleet sales reflected what Fiat Chrysler said was an effort to cut less lucrative sales to rental car companies. \nJeep brand sales declined 12.3%, Chrysler tumbled 46.8%, Dodge fell 20.7% and Fiat declined 14.5%. The only bright spot was the Ram truck and van brand, which rose 12%. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .

      "text": "Photo: @violette_fr/Ford \nYou’ve heard that French women practice everything in moderation, only go to the gym when they feel like it, love not being ‘perfect’ and always say yes to a red lip. Beauty lore aside, there’s something wonderfully insouciant about the French woman’s attitude to health and well-being. And who better to delve into the country’s unofficial wellness mottos than Paris-based editorial makeup artist Violette. Yes, THE violette_fr, of social media and Instagram fame . You’ve likely seen her jaw-dropping artistry in print and on screen, but what sets her inspiring work apart, is that somehow, it always harks back to magic and her main cinematic inspiration: The Wizard of Oz. I f like me, you’re partial to a bit of sparkle, then Violette’s way with pigments will set your heart a’ flutter. \nCircumnavigating the globe countless times a year does wonders for a woman’s beauty repertoire, which is why Violette’s personal rituals and health outlook resonates. From unique tips and tricks, to local indigenous secrets picked up along the way, there’s a whole lot of innate je ne sais quoi to be gleamed. \nHere, her well-being philosphy that focuses on feeling good, with generous dollops of self-care and fun. What’s not to love? \nI can't talk about wellness without talking about my inside-out, outside-in beauty routine. To me, one can't go without the other. I try and follow an alkaline and macrobiotic way of eating since I started to learn more about how the body functions—I am 100 percent into helping my body and working with it! Acidity is pollution to our organs, and since I've been eating alkaline , my skin, complexion, hair, everything really, has been so much better. I also respect my digestive system and eat to nourish and enhance it. In the morning and afternoon, you digest food differently. So, for example, I eat good fats like avocado or smoked salmon (all organic) first thing, and something protein or vegetable-rich in the afternoon. Photo: Violette Serrat Well-being philosophy \nWhen I wake up, the first thing I do is brush my teeth and my tongue—it's super important to remove the toxins that your liver cleansed all night and left on your tongue. You definitely don't want to swallow them! Then I drink a warm (not hot) glass of water. I used to drink it with lemon juice, but my Ayurvedic doctor Pratima told me that lemon wasn't right for my dosha. Then I blend my \"Holy Green\" herb juice that I buy at Stephan Jaulin in Paris with water—it cleanses and removes acidity. I am also obsessed with all the ingestible skin elixirs from CAP Beauty and add them into my drinks. I take some turmeric supplements with black pepper in them ( for better absorption ), vitamin D, and Bluebonnet Kosher Fish Oil , which is so good for the skin. \nFor breakfast, it's all about pleasure. I never diet, but I'll eat more healthy (but never eat less) if produce available isn't as fresh or natural as possible. That doesn't fit my epicurean personality! I love food, life, and pleasure. I drink rosemary herbal tea as it's very good for the liver—add in some fresh thyme in the winter and you won't get sick. I avoid gluten and dairy for the most part, but I drink good wine. It's important to me to listen to my desires—I am not a saint, so you will totally see me eating Camembert, baguettes, and drinking the good grape. Beauty routine Photo: Violette Serrat \nI love using products from French pharmacies —a classic of mine is the milky makeup remover from La Roche Posay . I use Pratima products, too, especially the turmeric mask , and I'm pretty obsessed with La Mer Renewal Oil and Soft Lotion . A trick is to apply Kypris Antioxidant Dew just before the lotion—my skin loves it. There are so many more niche brands nowdays that are not only about amazing ingredients, but really helping local communities and the environment. Stores like CAP Beauty have created showcase for this new wave of company, and I support it fully. Luckily too, social media has been shining a light on game-changing brands breathing fresh air into the way women look after themselves. This makes me feel so much more free in being able to explore than when I first started out on this path. Inspirations Photo: Violette Serrat \nBeauty is a way to show who you are or who you want to be. There are two directions that are almost opposite. I choose the \"show who you are\" path. I don't care about perfection; I actually love imperfection because that is what makes you you. The other path is fun, you change yourself, be someone else for a day, but it's not my thing. And I can't wear 45 products on my face! Makeup, my day-to-day job, is creative and fun. I love that I can paint on vivid lips and glittery eyes as a way to express myself or whomever I'm working on. I'm inspired by women who try to make a difference, women artists especially. I'm actually in the process of doing beauty stories about that right now. \nViolette's Wizard of Oz-inspired lips for the holidays : \nI'll never stop coveting Violette's signature-look: An always-enviable application of red lipstick. Here's her take on Dorothy's sparking red shoes, except this is just for your pout! Trace your lips with a red lip pencil of choice. I like to do it with my mouth closed, as it helps with making the shape luscious. Fill-in lips with the same colored pencil. Layer a creamy matte red lipstick on top. Finally with your finger, apply red glitter to finish. It'll turn your lips into a metallic and shimmery fantasy that's perfect for the season. SHARE:",

      "text": "International Business GM, Ford, Toyota post strong November US auto sales Hefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. Posted 01 Dec 2016 22:30 Updated 01 Dec 2016 23:25 Toyota Prius automobiles are shown for sale at a dealership in Carlsbad, California, U.S. May 2, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake A \nDETROIT: Hefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. \n“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co. “The U.S. auto industry is well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.” \nEach month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. \nThe robust sales helped push automaker and auto dealer shares up. In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4 percent, Ford jumped 6.6 percent, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3 percent. \nMarket leader GM's sales rose 10.2 percent to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the U.S. market was nearly US$35,800, about US$4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. \nToyota Motor Corp narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co, by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford sales rose 5 percent, outpacing expectations, while Toyota nearly matched estimates with a 4.3 percent gain over the year earlier. \nUsually, Ford is No. 2 in U.S. sales behind and Toyota is third. \nFord said retail sales rose 10 percent as fleet sales fell 9 percent. Retail sales count vehicles sold directly to individual consumers, while fleet sales are multiple-vehicle transactions to rental agencies, businesses and government. \nGM said retail sales rose 8 percent in November. \nNissan Motor Co beat expectations with a 7.5 percent rise in U.S. sales to 115,136 vehicles. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States.
