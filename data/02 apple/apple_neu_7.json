      "text": "Apple making iPhones in the United States? Do not hold your breath Apple making iPhones in the United States? Do not hold your breath Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Editorials - Editorials + An exclusive report from Nikkei Asian Review a week ago claimed that Apple was looking at ways it, and its manufacturing partners, Foxconn and Pegatron, might move some iPhone assembly operations to the United States.This is all conjecture, as none of the companies mentioned in the article responded to comment, but you can count on theories like this being floated thanks to the “Trump effect,” a reference to the recent elections in the United States. These “winds of change” were further carried by a conversation Mr. Trump apparently had with Apple’s CEO , Tim Cook, signaling a desire to have Apple build more of its products in the US. Of course, the president-elect also wants to place a tariff (tax) on foreign-made products of American companies.I am not trying to enflame anyone’s political feelings, but facts do not care about your feelings, and there are some realities that need to set-in quickly if you think there will be a remigration en masse of American manufacturing over the next four or eight years. \nPegatron assembly workers line up before knocking out a 10-12 hour shift putting together iPhones. Such a scene is not so viable in the US. Photo credit - Bloomberg 20th Century and American manufacturing Anyone that is old enough to consider themselves part of the first two or three post-WWII generations will remember that vast array of products that were “Made in the U.S.A.” I have a few of these relics, most of which still work great. Indeed, Americans were, and still are, good at making stuff.Once the war was over, and nations began to pick up the pieces, there was only one manufacturing center left, the United States, left virtually untouched by the fires of war that destroyed all of Europe, the Pacific Rim, and significant portions of Asia. In short, the US was the only show in town, and it was the engine that would rebuild the world – everything from basic circuits to zippers – “Made in the U.S.A.” A world rebuilt Many people do not realize the scale of what was required to rebuild everything. It took decades, and much of that progress was hampered by emerging geo-political realities, like the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, ad infinitum.Despite those variables, the past 75 years are, in broad terms, considered an era of post-war peace. As countries began stabilizing their economies, they emerged as investment opportunities for affordable labor, and new consumer markets. Right now, China and India are the two hot markets, and they alone also represent more than 35% of the world’s population, making them a potent economic hub, and massive consumer base. \nI am by no means like Milton from Office Space, but I have had this Acco 30 stapler for at least 20 years. Made of steel, made in the USA, and shipped around the world until less expensive manufacturing venues became available. Try and find a stapler not made in Asia nowadays. From building to servicing The US economy made a pretty dramatic shift since 1980. Manufacturing began to “off-shore” as cheaper opportunities presented themselves. This impacted a lot of skilled labor, but it was more than offset by the larger economic growth from 1983 through 1999.That was when the “service” economy evolved, and when the internet began to open up to the world (beyond the dial-up days of TELENET, Prodigy, or Compuserve) and create unprecedented growth in international commerce.All of that developed into an economy which is now 80% comprised of “services.” Many heavy and technological industrial elements remain, but where cheaper labor was available, China and India easily grew to take on manufacturing at a scale that is physically not possible anywhere else in the world due to a simple lack of people. The previous tech migration The United States has seen this type of industrial migration before. As nations rebuilt and economies grew, competition in all sectors of commerce began to heat up. Through much of 1970s and 1980s, Americans begrudgingly accepted the increasing supply of electronics (and cars), made in Japan. Sony became a powerhouse with the Walkman, and would soon do the same with televisions. Stereo systems would reshape “high fidelity” sound, thanks to Sony, Onkyo, Aiwa, et al. Within a veritable blink of an eye, “Made in Japan,” became not only the norm, but a sign of quality for many great products, from electronics to automobiles.Mobile phones at the time? Those bricks, like the Motorola DynaTAC of the 1980s, were initially made in the good old USA (accessories elsewhere). \nThe first cell phone, the Motorola DynaTAC Simple math The rhetoric to bring manufacturing back to the United States brings distant memories of the salad days of America’s dominance in the world economy. Make no mistake, the US is still the big boy on the block, but it must contend with “first world” problems – higher wage and benefit expectations, competent and sometimes overbearing regulations for labor, safety, environmental considerations, and navigating through an ever-more-complicated tax system that punishes success in ways not imagined a century ago.Simply put, a skilled, or unskilled, worker in the US costs many times more than their counterparts in Asia. Moreover, everything else is more expensive too. That is a hard reality when dealing with a purchasing power of $55,000 per capita in the US, versus $14,000 in China, or only $6,200 in India. Do not buy the political rhetoric None of these realities are helped by some of the bloviating of president-elect Trump. His promises to place tariffs on goods made overseas for American-based companies will have limited impact, particularly in the manufacture of electronics. Of course, the president does not have the power to unilaterally invoke a tariff, that is done by Congress, and they have not been very productive lately.Mr. Trump is also thinking about incentives to make Apple, and other companies, bring more operations to the US. A relaxation of the corporate income tax rate is likely part of that picture, but that does little to abate actual costs of doing business in the US, especially when it comes to manufacturing. To even think of operations on the scale of Foxconn or Pegatron, there would have to be subsidies on a scale that would rival the GDPs of small nations, and that would be just for Apple, never mind other enterprises that contract with manufacturers overseas.A 35% ad valorem tariff on something like the iPhone will not increase the retail price from say, $650 to $875. Rather, it is a levy applied against the cost of the product, not the sale price. In the case of an iPhone, which costs Apple roughly $225 per-unit to make, that would raise the unit-cost to about $300. Some would argue that still leaves Apple and its retail partners plenty of room to make money with, and indeed, these businesses are more than capable enough to manage the narrower economic path a tariff would impose. However, there is another factor that must be considered, China. \nThe fine print of a tariff? It raises prices across the board, whether an iPhone is made in the US or not. Image credit - Assignment Point China Like a game of chess, there are moves and countermoves in the world of trade. Though, for purposes of the current global climate, it probably feels a bit more like backgammon, each player has a strategy, but the world is tossing the dice, and no one knows what moves they may be forced to make. Such as it is (or would be) with China.What many people are not taking into account is that China will not sit sublimely by while its largest economic partner begins invoking trade barriers on products that are the fruits of its manufacturing engine. What an engine it is too, in less time than it took for Americans to accept Japanese-made goods, we have seen tremendous strides in build quality of many products made in China, not the least of which is, the iPhone. We have also seen amazing levels of quality reaching far less expensive products from ZTE, Huawei, and BBK (parent of OnePlus, Oppo, and Vivo).Some may think that China would just go tit-for-tat, but I would expect moves that are more subtle, if not more manipulative. China, at its whim, could simply readjust the value of its currency. Or, perhaps just as likely, it would subsidize manufacturing costs so that companies would not have to bear as high a cost for goods made, thus canceling the ad valorem tariff premium. Perhaps an even more “in your face” move by China would be to re-peg its currency to the dollar the way it used to.In any instance, the world’s two largest economies would find themselves being checked at every move. While that would make for some interesting drama, and for all the warts and debt the United States has accumulated, China has weathered the economic turmoil from the past several years be literally building cities and leaving them empty. That is hard-asset debt (estimated in multiple trillions of dollars) that ostensibly stays off the books. Nope, China is not going to simply give up its manufacturing base that powers over 30% of its economy. The same can be said for any emerging market with growing productivity.Where arguments for \"free market adaptation\" fail, is the assumption that China is truly a free market. It is not. It is an open (well, open-ish), centrally planned economy that grows based on mandate, not market conditions. Think long, and change how people see the big picture The point is not about the United States not manufacturing stuff anymore. It is about leading the way of manufacturing. Solid state silicon-based technology is a big boom, with room for high margins and making money. However, it is a commodity. Smartphones are inescapably in that downward price spiral as components get perpetually cheaper.No, the key is for the United States to continuously re-invent how people grow and participate in this world. From Ford inventing the assembly line, to the Grigg brothers inventing tater-tots, to BBN developing the ARPANET, these creations changed how people bought cars, ate potatoes, or conducted communications and commerce.The scale of production involved in making something like the iPhone is not necessarily beyond the ability of the current US market, but I would argue it is beyond the threshold of a generation raised in \"safe spaces\" and \"participation trophies.\" The effort exerted by Apple's contract manufacturers to build tens-of-millions of devices each quarter, strains all western ideals of \"good jobs,\" as evidenced by the exhaustion experienced by workers in China.Making phones, or staplers, or textiles is not the future. The American market must be driven to create, not simply manufacture. That is something worth holding your breath for. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

      "text": "Top Story: iPhones secretly send your data to Apple By Robert Isenberg, Komando.com photo courtesy of shutterstock We have all wondered at some point: Is someone listening in on our phone calls? Does someone keep track of all our calling data? And if so, what do they use that information for ? Monitoring phone calls has always spooked conspiracy theorists, especially in the digital age, when pretty much every kilobyte of data seems to be documented somewhere. Now there may be substance to those fears. The digital forensics firm Elcomsoft claims that Apple is collecting data from iPhones, including phone numbers, dates and times of calls, and duration. Customers have no idea this is happening. The Russian firm explained that data is automatically transmitted to Apple when iPhones are connected to the Cloud service. The tech giant allegedly keeps call histories for up to four months. FaceTime calls are also recorded in the Apple database. Collecting call logs has been standard practice for telecommunications companies for years. These histories are especially vital for law enforcement, to develop chronologies of a crime and test the credibility of a witness. But Apple is not a telecom company, and many customers may be surprised to know that the iPhone manufacturer harvests this kind of information. An Apple representative confirmed that cell data is collected through the Cloud, and that this type of data-sharing is helpful for customers who want to access call logs on multiple devices. Many iPhone users already suspected something was wrong, especially when two customers shared an Apple ID and were receiving each other’s calling data on their separate iPhones. Apple’s policies have become controversial as more and more customer information is exported to the Cloud. Critics assert that iCloud is vulnerable to hacking and even a company like Elcomsoft sells software that can break into Cloud-based data without the owner even realizing it. Indeed, Elcomsoft software was used to steal nude photos from numerous celebrities in 2014 . The discovery also follows reports that the data from 700 million smartphone users was being sent to China. Although these phones were not Apple products, legions of startled callers are now on high alert. Apple has given no indication that it will change its policy or make the data-sharing possible.

      "text": "Apple Users Are Being Spammed With Calendar Invites. Here's What to Do If You Get One Whatever you do, don't click \"decline.\" Co-author, 'The Geek Gap' @ MindaZetlin   \nLarge numbers of Apple users are reporting that they've received spam calendar invitations and/or photo-sharing invitations, many of them to dubious Black Friday sales events. And those who decline the invitations will likely find themselves getting much more such spam in the future, experts say. \nNot much is known so far about the source of the spam invites, many of which are in Chinese and offer deals on Ray-Ban sunglasses or Ugg boots. A spokesperson for Ugg's parent company told CNBC that it does not do promotions by calendar invite. Ray-Ban's parent company and Apple have not yet commented. \nAlthough most people have become accustomed to receiving spam in their email and sometimes via text message, the practice of sending out spam calendar invites is relatively new and highly unsettling to many of the users who've received it. \nIf it happens to you (or someone you know) here's what to do about it: 1. Don't worry that your security has been compromised. \nSome Apple users tweeted their worries that having spam invites appear in their calendars meant their passwords had been compromised. That's not the case. Most calendar software is set so that calendar invitations automatically appear as events that can be accepted or declined. That's a setting that can be changed. 2. Don't click \"decline.\" \nIf you do, you'll be letting the spammers know that yours is an active account, and you'll most likely get even more calendar spam. 3. Move the event to a different calendar. \nIf you don't decline the invite, are you stuck with it on your calendar forever? Not if you don't want to be. 9to5Mac offers a clever workaround: Create a second calendar for unwanted appointments, move the invites there, and then delete that second calendar. (Here's a more detailed description of how to do this.) Unfortunately, you will have to do this on a computer; it's very awkward to do on an iPhone or iPad. 4. Change your settings. \nAn Apple user who comments on the 9to5Mac story also suggests a simple way to stop spammy invites from appearing in your calendar: Set your preferences to email notifications rather than in-app notifications. (Read the first comment for his full explanation of how to do this.) \nIt will mean giving up the convenience of having event invites appear in your calendar but if you're getting spam invites on a regular basis, you're probably happy to make that trade. Unfortunately, there's no similar option for photo sharing, so if you're getting spam photo-share invitations, the only way to make them stop is to disable photo sharing altogether. \nIt's just one more useful thing that spammers will have ruined--unless Apple finds a way to fix it.

      "text": "Holiday shopping? Bring these 4 money-saving apps with you  00 am All are available for Apple and Android devices and are free to download. Share story JOSEPH PISANI The Associated Press \nNEW YORK — If you’re looking to save a few bucks at the mall while holiday shopping, charge up the smartphone and bring these apps with you. The four apps can help find you coupons, compare prices or price match. All are available for Apple and Android devices and are free to download: \nAmazon: While in a store, you can scan the bar codes of items you want to buy and see how much they cost on Amazon. This is handy because many stores, including Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us and Wal-Mart, will match prices if an item sold and shipped by Amazon is cheaper. You’ll need to show the cashier the app with the price of the item. And make sure to check each store’s price-matching rules, which are posted online. Many, for example, won’t allow you to price-match from Thanksgiving Day through the following Monday. \nCartwheel by Target: If you plan to shop at Target, download this separate coupon app. You can browse through the hundreds of coupons or use the app to scan the bar code of every item you throw in your cart. When you do that, Cartwheel will tell if you if there’s a coupon you can use or suggest a similar product that does have a deal. \nWhen you get to the register to pay, just show the app; there’s a bar code the cashier will scan to apply the discounts. Other stores, such as Macy’s and Kohl’s, post deals in their apps too, so it may be worth downloading apps for other stores you shop at often. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "Apple’s deal with India ride-hailing firm Ola hints at bigger car ambitions  00 am Apple adds to its roster of overseas ride-hailing deals, signaling it may have wider plans in the auto industry. Share story Tracey Lien Los Angeles Times (TNS) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Apple may have scrapped its plans to build self-driving cars, but if its recent deal with Indian ride-hailing firm Ola is anything to go by, the tech giant’s auto ambitions are far from over. \nOla, India’s largest ride-hailing company, announced this week it is partnering with Apple to offer Apple Music as part of the in-car experience. The firm, which also announced partnerships with Sony, Qualcomm and Audio Compass, said the service will be made available in some of its vehicles as part of a platform called Ola Play. When passengers book an Ola ride, they will be able to interact with an in-car tablet to control the vehicle’s air conditioning, music, watch videos and even read e-books. \n“Cars were initially built for the driver,” Ola Chief Executive Bhavish Agarwal said during a news conference reported on by India media outlet YourStory. “But with ride-sharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.” \nThe partnership is similar to a 2014 deal between Uber and Spotify, in which Uber passengers were given control of the car’s music through the Spotify app on their smartphone.

Save 90% on digital access. \nBut analysts were quick to note this is the second overseas ride-hailing company Apple has either invested in or partnered with, suggesting the Cupertino, Calif., company may have plans to develop software or services for ride-hailing companies or even automakers. \n“Apple invested $1 billion in (Chinese ride-hailing giant) Didi, so it has access to all their data. Now Apple will have access to Ola’s Apple Music data,” said Grayson Brulte, president of technology consulting firm Brulte and Co. “So you start to put the pieces together. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Apple try to gather all the data in the food chain.” \nWhat Apple might do with this data is anyone’s guess. The notoriously secretive company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nBrulte said he could see Apple shift from working on self-driving cars to working on the services and interfaces with which drivers and passengers interact. Think: The sleek and simple design of iOS, for cars. \nThe question is what Apple’s next move might be, as this will be a clearer indicator of what Apple is betting on, Brulte said. \n“What’s the next relationship?” he said. “We’re waiting for the third domino to fall, and when it does, we’ll understand where this is going.” Tracey Lien Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

      "text": "Marvel's Jessica Jones Now Available On Itunes Matthew Mueller Tweet This \nIf you own an Apple TV and have thus far resisted the urge to dive into Netflix's Marvel Universe, you now have a perfect excuse to give it a chance, and just in time for the holiday season. \nThe acclaimed first season of Jessica Jones is now available on iTunes, and since you've most likely got some additional days off over the next few weeks, you can binge on the show's 13 episodes in no time. Jessica Jones also builds the foundation for the recently released Luke Cage , so if you plan on giving that a watch you'll want to give some time to Jones first. \nPlus, you'll then be ahead of the game for the second season of Jessica Jones , which doesn't have a release date yet but will likely be coming sometime in 2017 or early 2018. You can view the season on the iTunes store here , and it will cost you $29.99. \nJones will next be seen in Marvel's big team-up series The Defenders , which will bring Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), Daredevil (Charlie Cox), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) together to face the combined forces of The Hand. The show will also bring plenty of supporting characters from all four shows together, and will likely add a few to the mix as well. \nOther characters making an appearance include Trish Walker (Rachel Taylor), Malcolm (Eka Darville), Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Ann Moss), Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), Misty Knight (Simone Missick), Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), and more than likely the Punisher (Jon Bernthal). \nDaredevil seasons 1 and 2, Jessica Jone s season 1, and Luke Cage season 1 are all available on Netflix. Iron Fist will premiere on March 17, 2017. The Defenders expected later in the year. The Punisher, Daredevil season 3, and Jessica Jones season 2 do not have release dates yet.",

      "text": "Rejoice, people who hate Apple and anything with their logo on it! Google has announced its own music festival, and it sounds GOOD with a capital G (and two Os and a D). That's because the festival is actually called GOODFest, and it's happening in just a few days' time – Tuesday November 29, to be precise. Don't worry if that's a bit short notice and you can't get tickets – everything is going to be streamed live because it's Google, why wouldn't it? Here's a very colourful, if very vague, video to tell you a (very) little bit more: Google describes the 'first of its kind' shows as \"a celebration of progress, positivity, and the power of people to push the world forward. \"In five live streamed shows, we're bringing together music, community, and technology to raise funds and connect with fans across the world.\" The first show will take place in New York City on November 29, continuing in New Orleans on December 9, Seattle on December 12 and in San Francisco and Los Angeles on dates yet to be announced. Confirmed acts include Glass Animals, Shilpa Ray, Gogol Bordello, Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and D.R.A.M. Okay so it's not as star-studded as the Apple Music Festival but ain't nothing wrong with a bit of positivity. Lord knows we need some in 2016. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Although it may seem strange, Apple’s MacOS is at heart an open-source system. Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the world and yet the core components of the operating system driving its Mac line is made up of freely available software.\nCalled Darwin, these open-source components include major parts of the MacOS kernel, portions of Linux BSD, and various drivers. As such, Apple has always made these open-source software bits available for download ever since OS X 10.0 was released, and now the company has made MacOS 10.12 Sierra’s Darwin available as well, according to 9to5Mac .\nMore: Microsoft open sources PowerShell, makes it available on Linux and MacOS\nDarwin isn’t the only Apple software that the company open-sources. Java for Mac is also available for download via the OpenJDK project created in partnership with Oracle. Also, the company’s newest programming language, Swift, also has an open-source version , increasing its appeal to students and others who otherwise might not have access to the language. Efforts such as these demonstrate that Apple is well aware of the competition it faces in application development and the PC market in general.\nOther major technology companies are also heavily involved in open source. Microsoft, in particular, has numerous initiatives in the last few years to work more closely with the open-source community. That company recently joined the Linux Foundation as a premium member , along with adding Bash support to Windows 10 and offering a version of SQL Server for Linux. Clearly, for-profit companies are finding free open-source software increasingly important for maintaining their profitability.\nGoing forward, Apple will likely continue offering open-source components of MacOS. You can download MacOS Sierra Darwin here and it will show up soon on the Apple open-source website soon.\nSpotify launches in Japan, its mobile lyrics feature makes global debut Apple is reportedly making progress on its Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor MacOS Sierra review",

Nonetheless, the iPad Mini 5 might be off the shelves as soon as early 2017. \nFans of the iPad Mini chose to overcome their disappointment towards Apple when it kept mum on details about the iPad Mini 5, mainly through citing all possible feature improvements and other forecasts. Such has been the substance of rumors surrounding the iPad Mini 5, many of which expect to be a highly-compact version of the iPad Pro. \nPC Advisor reported that the iPad Mini 5 will be unveiled around the first quarter of 2017 alongside the iPad Pro 2. Reports have insinuated that the iPad Pro 2 will have three display variants - 9.7 inch, 10.5 inch, and 12.9 inch. Althougb Apple has yet to confirm those reports, rumors continue to emerge that the iPad Mini 5 should serve as an introductory passage for the iPad Pro 2, as it's equipped with an Apple A9X chipset, 3 GC RAM, and 32 GB storage. Advertisement \nSpeculations abound that Apple is now working to scrap the 16 GB minimum gadget space. A 128 GB version of the iPad Mini 5 is set to be unveiled, and the device itself may feature the iPhone 6s' 7000-series aluminium design. \nAccording to HotAppleNews , the iPad Mini 5 is coming to hit stores right on time around early next year, and may come alongside the iPad Pro 2. The iPad Mini 5 may serve as an entry level gadget that may have some features the iPad Pro 2 has. \nApple fans need not to wait for much longer, as their much-beloved \"little iPad\" is set to take on a brand-new rendition as soon as early 2017. With terrific features on a more portable body, what's not to love about the iPad Mini 5? Advertisement ",

Apple teases secret Black Friday sale one year after dropping retail holiday TWEET Shoppers looking for truly special, one-of-a-kind discounts on Apple goods may be in luck this year. While major retailers often slash prices on products and debut steep savings ahead of the shopping holiday Apple is one of the few stores that often opts out of direct sales altogether ... at least, that is, until now . Read more: • Black Friday 2016: The best iPhone deals from Target, Walmart and more The tech giant recently teased its plans to offer a limited-time only Black Friday event this year, which comes one year after the company decided to forego the retail tradition altogether. In a 2015 interview Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts told Fast Company 's Rick Tetzei the company dropped its holiday promotions in order to give its employees a break, saying \"being good to your employees will always be good for business.\" This meant shoppers were forced to look at third-party retailers, like Best Buy, Walmart and Target, for product offers. The company's dedicated web page offers few hints about promotions or savings so it's not known how deep these discounts will be, although the store does suggest shoppers download its official app online for the \"fastest way to shop\" and notes that it will offer two-day free shipping on orders placed by 5 p.m. Mic Essentials brings you handpicked deals, reviews, recommendations and gift ideas.

      "text": "How AI will influence media Siri on Apple’s Apple TV 50 years ago “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) was just present in movies. Color television was just introduced to the public. But talking with computers probably seemed impossible outside of movies. In 2016 we talk to Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant. But AI is so much more than just programs we talk to. It is already among us. We can rest our hands on the screen while we draw with digital pens on it. Thank machine learning. We can search persons in our picture collections on our phones if we marked the person once. Again: Thank machine learning. But not only operating systems are optimized and supplemented by machine learning. News”paper” will have an amazing future, too. If they are willing to think about AI.\nHow AI could improve quality Providing high-quality and reliable content seems to be a problem for newspapers seeking their luck on the internet. War pictures are assigned with conflicts they weren’t taken in. Even videos are faked even by TV shows in order to be funny or whyever. Actually, journalists should check the pictures they’re showing for their authenticity, but why do they fail so often? This is an area in which the human is overwhelmed by the amount of data. Nobody can check every single one of the 2.073.600 pixels shown in one frame of HD-video. In opposite to that a computer is great in handling lots of data. So, why shouldn’t you use machine learning to prevent fake news? Of course, even systems based on machine learning can be overcome, but it is not as easy as fooling a human in this special discipline.\nFurthermore algorithms can search the internet or databases in order to check if a picture was already used in another context. Just like this one, which was used for three different conflicts.\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/zgcF8.jpg Even when writing for printed newspaper journalists are under time pressure. But covering a fast developing-situation is much more difficult in view of linguistic quality. Depending on the language, grammar and vocabulary can be very complex. Here machine learning can correct texts live while the journalist is, for example, twittering about an event or writing a short information which has to be published instant. Even for longer texts, machine learning could be a great measure to improve quality while improving speed. No lecturer is as fast as a computer.\nNew York Times publishes several hundred articles a day. Which one should I read? Some of the articles on the startpage of www.nytimes.com Not everyone wants to read everything. This is a problem newspaper are facing since their foundation. Especially bigger newspapers like the New York Times or USA Today publish so much no one can read everything. Newspapers try to help the reader in printed editions with different categories. Online are much more possibilities which aren’t nearly used as much as possible. Often it just looks like “recommended” articles are just random linked articles. Machine learning can improve the capability of a computer to understand the actual content of a text. If it gets the content, it can recommend truly matching articles. It actually could do better than a human. For example the New York Times publishes several hundred articles online per day. No human can recommend for every existing and new published article the best options. Again: Humans are really bad with large amounts of data in opposite to computers.\nBut not only matching articles could be recommended, but also the optimal way to get information. For each single person depending on the situation. Fast developing situations or basic coverage is easy shown in a short video clip. But for extensive background information often a text is the better choice. The challenge will be to provide the right way to get the best information at the right time as good as possible. Depending on whether a person is at home, in a plane or walking through the streets.\nA sneak peak into the cool future The coolest features won’t come in the next three years, but here you have a sneak peak into what would be possible with artificial intelligence. When a computer understands the intent of a text, it can reproduce new texts based on that intent. This will make it possible to show a text in different ways to different persons. A professor of linguistics probalby can read more complex sentences while persons without college education are better with shorter sentences. This could make it possible to provide the same information understandable and enjoyable for every person based on one original.\nBut not only texts will be more individual but also videos. Some people prefer to get just the pure facts while others want to be entertained, too. In some situations a video should be only a minute long, in another situation ten minutes with more information are just needed. Artificial intelligence can do pretty good clips based on our personal photos. When this technology is more advanced, video editors will just edit one video and ten versions will be published based on the edited one. Making it possible to choose between background music and no background music, effects and less effects and whatever you can imagine. Even the speaker could differ from the original.\nAI is revolutionizing technology companies. It will do the same with media! Artificial intelligence will be one of the future key technologies. It will influence everything. How we communicate, how we use our devices and, yes, how we will inform ourselves. Media shouldn’t insist on the good old times, but at least discuss about using artificial intelligence. Otherwise, tech companies will use AI to build up own media platforms, without asking the current media.",

      "title": "Where Are Those AirPods We Were Promised by Apple?",
      "text": "When Apple announced new wireless earbuds in September, called AirPods, the company positioned them as representing the future of audio. In fact, they were so important to Apple's strategy that they became the main reason for Apple eliminating the headphone jack in their new iPhone 7 series, announced at the same time. The AirPods would free us of tangled cords and allow us to enjoy great audio, wire-free. There was simply no need for the headphone jack that's been with us for more than a half-century.\nWell, the iPhone 7 has been on sale for two months, but there’s still no sign of the AirPods. The biggest shopping day, Black Friday, has come and gone. What does Apple say? \"We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.\"\nIt's Official: Apple is Ditching Headphone Jacks\nWhat that means in PR-speak is that they can’t make them work reliably, they're trying to change the design, or, possibly having second thoughts.\nBased on the reviews of early samples by the tech press, Apple may have been surprised by the extremely negative reaction, including complaints about how difficult it is to adjust the sound, the poor audio quality, and their weird appearance.\nIn their announcement, Apple described the AIrPods as effortless and magical. They come with a case for storing and keeping the buds charged and use a proprietary chip to make pairing simple. Take them out of the case, put them into your ears, and they’re ready to use. Put them back in the case and they turn off.\nBut simplicity is not one of their attributes. Unlike the wired earbuds they replace, you can’t control the volume or music play. You need to double-tap on one earbud to activate Siri and ask her to adjust the volume.\nCnet refers to the AirPods as “dorky as hell” and calls them ridiculous looking with the long tubes protruding from your ears like earrings. Business Insider complains about the audio cutting out and the microphone not working when answering a call. Not an auspicious beginning for a showcase product intended to represent the future of audio.\nThis has become another in a string of embarrassments for Apple in their product decisions and execution, beginning with Apple Maps that often provided wrong directions. The latest miscue has been the newly introduced line of MacBook Pro notebooks that have been roundly criticized for being underpowered, overpriced, and for losing many of their useful ports. They now require buying optional wire dongles to bring back the lost functionality, inconsistent with their new wireless strategy.\nOnce the issues are addressed with the AirPods: will people be willing to spend $159 for audio no better than that from $20 buds, and be willing to trade wireless for the inconvenience of having to keep them charged? We'll have to wait and see. In the meantime, for $159 you can buy great sounding wired earbuds with audio quality that's far superior.\nApple Offers Program to Fix iPhones with 'Touch Disease'; Customers File Class Action Suit\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/26/where-are-those-airpods-we-were-promised-by-apple/",

So far nobody really knows the benefits of the bar and why we actually need it in our lives, but that is about to change. The KnightTouchBar 2000 has released this past week and it makes the touch bar look and function exactly like the red light bar on the front of the KITT 2000 Pontiac Trans Am of the TV series, starring David Hasselhoff.

      "text": "Flip \nApple’s iPhone 7, which was launched in September, boasted various new features such as water and damage resistance when submerged in water for more than 30 minutes. However, there were no details on what happens to these phones when they are submerged in boiling water. So to find it out, a YouTuber just did that. Image Source: YouTube channel Smart Technology (screenshot) Apple’s iPhone 7 passes boiling water test \nA YouTuber recently posted a video of an iPhone 7 submerged in boiling water. In the video, an iPhone on which a YouTube song is being played is submerged in the water for almost a minute. The song being played on the iPhone stops and the screen goes dark, but don’t jump to any conclusions yet. \nTo the surprise of everyone, almost all the phone’s features started working after it was taken out of the water. The second time, the phone was submerged for over 5 minutes. Again, there was no damage or smoke after it was taken out. There was a temperature warning though, suggesting that it needed some time to cool down. After 10 minutes passed, the iPhone resumed normal functions without any signs of problem. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Apple’s most water resistant phones \nApple has launched several ads highlighting different features of the iPhone 7 and i Phone 7 Plus such as water resistance, a better camera that takes improved low light images, and extended battery life. Earlier this month, Apple released a video ad in which a man plays dramatic music on his iPhone 7 while at the pool. Later on, he takes it up where he dives from a height as the music on the iPhone climaxes. Even though the iPhone is splashed with water in the process, it worked perfectly normal. \nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are projected to be the most water resistant phones by the company, with IP67 water and dust resistance. Also the water resistance feature works best when the water is not too sudsy, even though the phone is expected to survive in chlorine water, salt water, or even beer. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus can withstand being submerged in water for more than 30 minutes. \nHowever, users should not try to intentionally expose the phones to water, as Apple’s warranty does not cover water damage. Further, it is advised not to charge the phone when it is wet. Apart from water resistance, changes made to the Home button are among the most notable changes made to the latest iPhone. The company has also fitted the iPhone 7 with a capacitive touch area similar to the Force Touch trackpads found on the latest MacBooks .",

      "text": "\nWhat do you want to see in Apple's Magic Trackpad 3, Magic Mouse 3, and Magic Keyboard 2?\nApple makes a series of accessories for the Mac that includes the Magic Keyboard and second editions of both the Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse . They were last updated last year, the big new feature being built-in lithium-ion batteries and, for the keyboard and trackpad, new wedge-shaped designs. That meant they could be charged and re-charged over USB to Lightning cables all while sitting flush on your desk. Well, except for the Magic Mouse, whose old design prevented use while charging...\nSo, if Apple came to you and asked what you wanted to see from their Magic accessories in 2017, what would you tell them?\nRedesign the Magic Mouse so it can be used while charging. Add Force Touch and Force Click to Magic Mouse. Add Touch Bar and Touch ID to Magic Keyboard. Split/ergonomic version for Magic Keyboard. Retro deep travel clickety-clackity version of Magic Keyboard. Magic Number Pad (or extended option) for Magic Keyboard. Space Gray option on all Magic accessories. Ahem. Black, jet black, gold, and rose gold options on all Magic accessories. Switch from Lightning to USB-C connectors on all Magic accessories. Extra USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 connector for daisy chaining additional accessories. Those are just a few ideas — what are yours? What would you like to see in the next generation of Apple Magic accessories for Mac? (And, of course, the next generation of iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro that go with them!)\nMacBook Pro MacBook Pro review Touch Bar: The ultimate guide MacBook news MacBook forums Buy at Apple ",

      "text": "It made headlines back in August this year and now the possibility of Apple setting up its $1 billion data centre to run its services (for European users) seems a bit dicey. Little did anyone know that Apple’s grand plan to set up a data centre in a tiny village called Athenry would see so much opposition, not so much from its own people, but from the European Union (EU), which has been after the Cupertino company with pitchforks ever since.\nAnd now there are some more problems. According to Bloomberg , the citizens of Athenry are with the idea of Apple setting up a data centre near the village. While this would bring in plenty of jobs, this would also give Apple plenty tax benefits, one that the company has been enjoying for more than a decade now.\nWind back to the time when the EU slammed a $1.1 billion tax bill on Apple and it is clear to see why many other tech giants wanted to have a slice of the pie. According to the previous report from Reuters, the Apple investigation was opened in 2014 which was much before Apple announced that it was to set up a data centre in Ireland (and Denmark). The Commission told the Irish government that tax rulings it agreed to in 1991 and 2007 with the iPhone maker amounted to state aid and might have broken EU laws. So this is little to do Apple’s data centre and more to do with Apple as whole.\nIreland has been allowing for these special tax rules (sweetheart deals) for companies for years and the reasons for the same would be creating more jobs, which is fair. But it’s just that the EU was left out of it and now its biting back. In fact, the European Commission (EC) clearly stated that it was Apple’s home country, the US, which inspired them to take the first step . It was a US Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant’s deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the EC to launch its own inquiries the following month.\nWhile Dublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational companies (that bring plenty of new jobs). The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. Thanks to the back and forth, the people of Athenry are starting to lose hope, because it has been a year and there have been plenty of delays with Apple yet to make its first move at setting up its data centre in the Derrydonnell Forest. At the time of its announcement, the Cupertino giant promised that the project will also provide an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community.\nThe post Apple’s $1 billion plan is stirring up one too many problems for Ireland: Report appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Published: Mon, November 28, 2016 @ 12:00 a.m. \nRegrets? I’ve had a few. \nNot buying Apple stock in the 1980s: But I’ve made up for that by spending countless dollars on the company’s products. \nFalling in love with the Kardiac Kids in 1980: It was great at the time and I still know all the words to “The 12 Days of a Cleveland Browns Christmas,” but what has that done for me lately? \nThe nice nice thing is that the Jimmy Haslam-owned Browns are only five drafts and four front-office bloodlettings from being competitive. \nNot developing better study habits: I still have that recurring dream that I have a huge test right now and haven’t spent a single minute studying. Or that it’s finals week and I somehow skipped every class to play basketball and tennis. \nIs that a dream or a memory? Both, as I recall. \nThere can be regrets in this business, too. \nWriting first and asking questions later: If I could go back 30 years or so, I’d never have suggested that a girls basketball game consisted of more bricks than a construction site and more turnovers than a bakery. \nFor the record, the teams combined to shoot 11 percent from the floor and had 82 turnovers between them, so maybe I was right. \nBut for the most part, if it appears in this space under my smiling face, you can be sure I’ll stick by it. \nWe don’t tend to revisit columns a lot, but thanks to social media and followers with long memories, sometimes we’re reminded of things we wrote, whether we want to be or not. \nA few Nebraska fans were feeling their oats last week — before Friday’s game against Iowa, of course — and decided to check in on Twitter to see if I still felt the Cornhuskers’ loss of Bo Pelini was Youngstown State’s gain. \nI wrote just that — and more — in a column after Pelini’s first season with the Penguins. \nShort answer: Yes. \nLonger answer: With a few more timely plays, YSU could have made the FCS playoffs in 2015. As it turns out, the Penguins arrived a year later, but the point is that they’ve arrived. \nYSU (9-3) qualified for the playoffs by winning its final two regular-season games after an up-and-down ride and some offensive struggles. \nMost of those were related to an unsettled quarterback situation, but Hunter Wells — who started the last two years — regained his job and appears to have eased concerns about the passing attack. \nYSU has always had a strong running game and its defense has been stellar all season. The downfield threat and some consistency in the passing game was all that was missing. \nNow the Penguins are preparing for a second-round game at Jacksonville State on Saturday. I felt good about YSU’s situation with Pelini a year ago and — if anything — the Penguins are in even better shape now. \nBeating third-seeded Jacksonville would only cement that for even more observers. \nSome Nebraska fans are just never going to move on from the program’s divorce from Pelini, but that says more about them than it does about him. \nOr the rest of us here in Youngstown. \nWrite Vindicator Sports Editor Ed Puskas at and follow him on Twitter, @EdPuskas_Vindy.

      "text": "Recode’s future of commerce event is next week. What we want to learn from Jack Dorsey, Kate Hudson, Apple and Wish. You can still be there if you register today. Next Tuesday, December 6, Kara Swisher and I are hosting a special one-night event focused on the future of commerce . Code Commerce , taking place in San Francisco at Westfield’s bespoke event space, will feature Recode ’s usual brand of no-BS interviews with the entrepreneurs and business leaders who are shaping where commerce and payments are headed. We’ll sit down with Square CEO Jack Dorsey , Fabletics co-founders Kate Hudson and Adam Goldenberg , Apple Pay head Jennifer Bailey , and Wish CEO Peter Szulczewski . If you value candid, unscripted conversations that include the chance for you to ask questions, too, you should be there . We’ll also give you time to get to know a group of your smartest peers over some food and adult beverages at the start of the night. But we have limited seating, and the event is just a week away. You should register today . \nCode Commerce Series is coming to SF on Dec. 6 \nDon't miss interviews with Jack Dorsey, Kate Hudson and Apple Pay Register Now Here’s some of the things Kara and I are hoping to learn: Jack Dorsey has built a $4 billion payments company by giving small merchants modern software at an affordable price. But Square continues to invest considerably in Square Cash, a money-transfer app for consumers, not business owners. Dorsey’s long-held belief that Square can eventually become a two-sided payment company has yet to become reality. So we’ll press him for the rationale of investing in a money-losing, non-core product. It’s taken just three years for Kate Hudson and Adam Goldenberg to build Fabletics into a $250 million apparel brand. Getting customers to sign up for subscriptions is a big reason why. But I’m still not convinced that a subscription business for clothing -- stuff you don’t need to buy on a monthly basis like razors or diapers -- can be a lasting model over, say, a decade or more. I’d love to hear why I’m wrong. The benefit of using Apple Pay in apps and on the web is clear. The benefit of using your phone to pay in a store? Not as much. How does Apple plan to convince mainstream iPhone users that tapping a phone to pay makes a lot more sense than just using a credit card? We’ll have the chance to ask Apple Pay chief Jennifer Bailey next week. In less than four years, Wish was able to build a multi-billion-dollar shopping app with a predominately international customer base right from San Francisco. That growth was fueled in part by aggressive advertising on Facebook that at one point made Wish the social network’s largest advertiser. I want to know what co-founder and CEO Peter Szulczewski learned from all that spending and why he thinks it’s sustainable.",

      "text": "\n\nAdam Geitgey offers an alternative take on Apple's new MacBook Pros , which were poorly-received when announced two weeks ago. Geitgey argues that, thanks to the finally-maturing USB-C ecosystem (and there being multiple USB-C ports), it's a miniature interoperative power-toy that hackers will love. For example, you can charge it with a drugstore power adapter: no more $80 bricks to lug around. \nUniversal sharing of accessories between devices is a hacker’s dream. It’s the exact opposite opposite of vendor lock-in. You can just plug anything into anything and it (mostly) works. ... \nIf you get any of the new USB-C compatible monitors (pretty much every vendor has at least one now), you only need to plug one single cable into your MBP: You can then plug all your other devices into your monitor and everything flows over one USB-C to your laptop — power, video, data and even sound. Your monitor is now your docking station and breakout box!... \nI/O-wise, the new MacBook Pro is possibly the most open device Apple has ever built. There is literally not a single proprietary port on it. You get four universal high-speed ports that can each draw or supply power, send and receive data and transfer video and audio. It’s really pretty neat. \n(Odd to think, though, that none of the clever mobile tricks he lists will work with iPhones, beacause iPhones don't use USB-C.) \nI finally checked out the new MacBook Pros in person over the weekend. The 13\" model with a function row is an almost-perfect laptop; if you don't need a cutting-edge mobile workstation, it has a lot of juice for such a tiny machine. Did anyone else notice that, at 3 pounds, it's same weight as the original MacBook Air? After all the negative reviews I was ready to hate it, but I loved it. \nThe Touch Bar strikes me as a flashy gimmick, like something Sony would have put on a fancy Vaio before it quit the business. \nI also checked out the Surface Book; gorgeous, but the need to be a \"tablet too\" means it comes with the limitations and subtle look-and-feel oddities of the class. If you're wanting a slim Windows/Ubuntu ultra-portable you can really spec out, the Dell XPS series seems to be where it's at—especially the Special Editions that Microsoft sells, which have faster CPU options.

      "text": "Israel's Cellcom launches app for Apple TV service Reuters \nTEL AVIV (Reuters) - Cellcom, Israel's biggest mobile phone operator, said on Monday it will offer Apple TV as it launched its new Cellcom TV app. \nCellcom said it will be the first in Israel to offer its multi-channel television, including broadcast channels and video on demand content, on Apple TV's streaming service at no extra charge. \nCellcom is a newcomer to the Israeli television market. Seeking new streams of revenue, it launched a low price, Internet-based service last year that competes with cable company HOT and satellite TV firm YES, a subsidiary of Bezeq. \nCellcom has now surpassed 100,000 subscribers, still well below YES and HOT. But Cellcom added 12,000 subscribers in the last quarter while the other two services lost clients. \n\"We had a mission to change the TV market,\" Cellcom Chief Executive Nir Sztern told a news conference. \"This move enables clients to disconnect from the set-top box. We need to bring broadcast over IP (Internet protocol).\" \nIn the United States, Time Warner offers some customers the option to swap their cable box for a Roku streaming player. \n(Reporting by Tova Cohen)",

      "text": "Apple may have finally gotten too big for its unusual corporate structure Vox.com 1 day ago Matthew Yglesias © Provided by Vox.com Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\nMark Gurman reported for Bloomberg on Monday that Apple is ceasing development of its Airport line of wifi routers as well as its Time Machine wireless backup disks. That comes hot on the heels of an October public announcement that the company would no longer be making external displays, and will instead partner with LG to create a sort of Apple-blessed display manufactured and branded by the Korean company.\nQuote: s in the article Apple Inc AAPL\n▲ 111.79 +0.56 +0.50% Microsoft Corp MSFT\n▲ 60.48 +0.08 +0.13% LG Corp 003550\n▼ 57,000.00 -200.00 -0.35% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B\n▲ 158.18 +0.07 +0.04% Less officially, the sheer amount of time that has passed since the last release of a Mac Pro desktop computer has users of high-end workstations convinced that Apple has effectively exited that market as well. Professionals in the market for muscular computers, after all, are almost by definition only going to be interested in buying machines that come with the latest and most up-to-date chips and hardware. A line of “pro” computers that isn’t updated regularly simply doesn’t work as a pro computer at all. Even if Apple does make a new Mac Pro at this point, buyers wary of the possibility of years-long gaps between updates will still find themselves thinking that people in the market for desktop workstations may need to look beyond the Mac.\nThe state of Apple’s semi-withdrawal from the professional grade computer market even has some die-hard Mac fans daydreaming about the idea of bringing back operating system licensing so that some other company can put in the time and effort needed to build Mac compatible workstations without Cupertino needing to worry about it.\nEven Apple’s more popular laptop products show some signs of the same kind of neglect. The latest iteration of the MacBook Pro offers a number of impressive features, but it maxes out at a relatively low level of RAM, doesn’t offer many ports, and isn’t equipped with truly top-of-the-line internal chips. The computer is impressive in many ways — certainly the innovative new TouchBar looks cool — but, like most of Apple’s other products, it appears to be optimized for lightness and thinness rather than for true professional use .\nBut this all raises a more fundamental question. If GE can build jet engines , tidal energy farms , freight rail data systems , mining equipment , and medical devices , how is it that the world’s most valuable company can’t find the time to make a full line of personal computers and PC peripherals alongside its market-leading smartphones and tablets? The answer goes back to Apple’s corporate structure, which, though fairly common for a startup, is extremely unusual for an enormous company.\nFunctional versus divisional structures Any large organization needs to have an organizational structure.\nThere are two main ways to structure a business. You can build divisions that are built around particular lines of business or you can build functional groups that are built around particular kinds of expertise.\nAn extreme case of a divisional company would be Warren Buffett’s Berkshire-Hathaway conglomerate. Buffett famously maintains a corporate headquarters in Omaha that only employs 25 people, who work supporting him personally and compiling paperwork from the company’s various divisions to submit to government regulators.\n© Provided by Vox.com Like Berkshire’s comically inept website , the bare-bones home office is in part a philosophical statement. It shows that Buffett is in the business of making investments in companies and corporate leaders he believes in. No management is happening in Omaha. Instead, the company’s various divisions — whether it’s a freight railroad or a mobile home manufacturer — have their own corporate functions, including things like HR and legal.\nBerkshire is extreme in this regard, but a basic divisional backbone is the main way to organize a big company. Most people work for units that are responsible for particular lines of business, while a few functional groups (maybe public relations or accounting) provide support to all the business divisions.\nApple is extremely functional Apple isn’t like that. If you look at their executive team you’ll find that there’s no senior vice president for iPhone who works alongside a senior vice president for Mac. Nobody is in charge of Macs or iPhones or iPads or really anything else, because Apple is almost entirely functional.\nThere’s a chief design officer and a senior vice president of software engineering and a senior vice president of hardware technologies who is different than the senior vice president of hardware engineering. Of course there are also more traditional senior functional executives like a general counsel and a chief financial officer. But the closest thing Apple has to a divisional chief with responsibility for a specific line of business is Angela Ahrendts, the senior vice president for retail.\nBut Ahrendts’s role actually illustrates the strength of Apple’s functional model. In a traditional divisional structure, each division head would be responsible for their own profit and loss line on the corporate balance sheet. In that divisional context, Ahrendts’s job would be to optimize for the profitability of Apple’s retail stores. But Apple doesn’t want its retail stores to be optimized for profitability. The stores do bring in money, but they are also important marketing statements whose existence, design, and operation is supposed to project the Apple brand in specific ways.\nFunctional structures, more broadly, allow for collaboration. Apple is able to develop features like continuity across multiple Apple devices or use a chip developed for the Apple Watch to power the new TouchBar in part because its top executives are responsible for things like “software engineering” and “hardware technologies” (i.e., chip development) rather than for specific products.\nDivisional backbones make management easier Collaboration, unity of purpose, and synergies across groups are things that every company wants. But most CEOs do not attempt to manage enormous global companies with purely functional structures, because even though it sounds good, it’s extraordinarily difficult to make it work in practice.\nMicrosoft has an executive vice president who’s in charge of Office, a different one who’s in charge of Windows and Devices, and a third one who’s in charge of Microsoft Cloud. There are software engineers working in all three groups, but nobody is in charge of “software engineering” — they are responsible for specific lines of business. That way if something goes wrong with a particular product, it’s a specific person’s fault and there are clear lines of accountability.\nThis is particularly useful when it comes to managing a line of business like Windows, which is in long-term structural decline but remains enormously profitable and important. It matters to Microsoft — a lot — whether the Windows business is run well even though Windows is not part of the sexy and interesting future of computing. Making sure that someone specific is in charge of running the Windows business, and that the people who work on Windows know that they are accountable to a Windows-specific executive, ensures that focus is maintained even though the world’s attention has moved elsewhere.\nFunctional Apple struggles to walk and chew gum at the same time Which brings us back to the poor Mac.\nApple is an enormous company with vast revenue, huge cash reserves, and a strong global brand. Objectively speaking, it should not be struggling to put out regular updates of its highly profitable Mac desktop and laptop computers. Of course, it might be hard to bring radical redesigns and breakthrough innovations to the Mac. But what existing Mac customers really want is something more basic: confidence that Apple will regularly update the Mac to incorporate new chips as they become standard in the rest of the computer industry.\nInstead, Apple has a situation where they rolled out a radical redesign (including breakthrough innovations) of their desktop pro computer and then haven’t updated it at all in three years. When that innovative computer was new, Phil Schiller scoffed at critics with the line, “can’t innovate any more my ass,” and he was right. But a well-managed line of business doesn’t try to subsist on sporadic breakthroughs. It requires ongoing work.\nBut on any given day, the iPhone is far-and-away the most important product Apple ships. The company needs to be incredibly focused on making sure that each year’s new iPhone is meaningfully better than the previous one. The iPad shares enough hardware and software DNA with the iPhone that putting in the extra work to keep it updated is a no-brainer. The Watch is supposed to be Apple’s effort to break through into a growth market. Apple is trying to play catch-up with its online services to bolster the iPhone’s position. The entire Mac business isn’t that important. And within the Mac universe, the consumer-grade laptop is the most important product.\nThe upshot is that even though regularly updating desktop Macs should not be that difficult, objectively speaking, it tends not to happen in part because it’s not anyone’s job to make it happen. The functional organization values collaboration on top corporate priorities above all else, and that means basically everything comes ahead of desktop Macs. Admitting that they can’t work at all on peripherals is, in that context, a step in the right direction.\nBut it does raise the question of whether persisting with functional organization is really compatible with the company’s growth aspirations. After all, monitors — large objects that you connect to computers — seems like a genuinely promising market for a company that makes digital devices and is known for its strength in industrial design. The Mac’s share of the PC market has steadily grown over the past few years, and it genuinely could be a growth business if it had an executive to focus on it. And Apple’s strategically significant online services businesses would arguably benefit from clearer accountability.\nMoving away from pure functional organization would, obviously, carry some real costs. In the past, functional structure has allowed Apple to retain much of the nimbleness of a startup. The iPod was originally launched as a Mac accessory, but Steve Jobs rapidly changed course and made it a cross-platform hit — a feat that was much easier to pull off because there was no “Mac division” to wage bureaucratic warfare against the idea. Launching new products like the iPhone and iPad without fear of cannibalizing resources or market share has helped Apple stay ahead of the curve, while the more divisional Microsoft was never able to plunge headfirst into mobile.\nBut Apple’s market exits are a clear sign of severe growing pains inside the existing structure. Apple is already huge, but it wants to be bigger. To get there, it may need to finally start acting like a big company.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Apple’s $1 Billion Irish Data Center Delayed 2:05 pm By Roland Hutchinson \nBack in August we heard that Apple’s $1 billion Irish data center had received approval from the planning regulators in Ireland. \nNow it looks like the construction of the data center has been delayed, the reason that it has been delayed is because there have been some objections to the project. \nThe hole project has been delayed because three people have contested the potential environmental impact of the project, and now local residents are concerned that Apple may move their project somewhere else. \n“This doesn’t just affect Athenry, but it affects Ireland as well,” said Paul Keane, 39, whose family has lived in the area for generations. “If Apple is turned away, what does it say about Ireland? It’s right that we have a fair and open system, but it can’t be dragged out.” \nApple’s Irish Data Center was originally expected to start running some time in 2017, but delays have meant that it wont go into operation until 2019.",

      "text": "Reddit When Apple announced an iPhone 6s battery replacement program last week, identifying select models that might be eligible for a free repair due to unexpected shutdowns, it only specified manufacturing dates for potentially affected devices. It recommended customers take a trip to an Apple store or authorized reseller if they are experiencing issues to check if they are eligible for a repair. But there’s a quick and easy way to check if your device is eligible at home, using the same process that Apple repair staff will be using in stores… Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015…. Your iPhone will be examined prior to any service to verify that it is eligible for this program and in working order. Apple is replacing batteries for what it said is “a very small number of iPhone 6s devices” that were manufactured between September and October of 2015 in a limited serial number range. Here’s how to check your device: Locate your iPhone’s serial number (you can find the serial number on the back of your iPhone and in Settings>General>About ). Check for the following characters located in the 4th and 5th position of your iPhone’s serial number: Q3",

      "text": "Apple brings the new update 9.0.2 On Cell Phone Forums 5 Not long ago we announced that a new update 9.0.1 will be rolling out. Now we know that history likes to repeat itself, but just one week after the 9.0.1 Apple is giving us a new actualization 9.0.2. The company claims thatb is was developed to fix some major problems with iMessage, iCloud Backup, and screen rotation, as well as improvements related to the stability of Podcasts. It all sounds great, but why the changes were not brought in the previous update. Should we expect that when we buy a new, not cheap product, we must wait for new updates after every week. The world is not perfect we know that but giving an update for an update to fix the problems that should appear in the first place, seems like a joke. Many users think that it is better to wait for a major update that fixes majority of important problems, not a single fixed that will be again fixed in a different update. When we take into consideration the 9.0.2 version this is what it gives us fix for an issue related to the setting to turn off/on app mobile data usage. The issue that prevented iMessage activation, issues that prevented iCloud Backup during manual backup and incorrect screen rotation when receiving notifications are also fixed in this update. It all sounds great, but it should be done sooner. In order to downlaod this actualization you need to downalod a file that weights 62.1 MB. As usuall when you install the new software, there is no way to get back to the old one, so please make sure, that you want the update to be installed.",

      "text": "Mark Gurman reported for Bloomberg on Monday that Apple is ceasing development of its Airport line of wifi routers as well as its Time Machine wireless backup disks. That comes hot on the heels of an October public announcement that the company would no longer be making external displays, and will instead partner with LG to create a sort of Apple-blessed display manufactured and branded by the Korean company.\nStephen Lam | Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook smiles during a product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Less officially, the sheer amount of time that has passed since the last release of a Mac Pro desktop computer has users of high-end workstations convinced that Apple has effectively exited that market as well. Professionals in the market for muscular computers, after all, are almost by definition only going to be interested in buying machines that come with the latest and most up-to-date chips and hardware. A line of \"pro\" computers that isn't updated regularly simply doesn't work as a pro computer at all. Even if Apple does make a new Mac Pro at this point, buyers wary of the possibility of years-long gaps between updates will still find themselves thinking that people in the market for desktop workstations may need to look beyond the Mac.\nMore from Vox:\nWhat the Touch Bar says about Apple's approach to innovation\nThe Touch Bar is cool, but Mac innovation has slowed to a crawl\nThe productivity paradox: why we're getting more innovation but less growth\nThe state of Apple's semi-withdrawal from the professional grade computer market even has some die-hard Mac fans daydreaming about the idea of bringing back operating system licensing so that some other company can put in the time and effort needed to build Mac compatible workstations without Cupertino needing to worry about it.\nEven Apple's more popular laptop products show some signs of the same kind of neglect. The latest iteration of the MacBook Pro offers a number of impressive features, but it maxes out at a relatively low level of RAM, doesn't offer many ports, and isn't equipped with truly top-of-the-line internal chips. The computer is impressive in many ways — certainly the innovative new TouchBar looks cool — but, like most of Apple's other products, it appears to be optimized for lightness and thinness rather than for true professional use.\nBut this all raises a more fundamental question. If GE can build jet engines , tidal energy farms , freight rail data systems , mining equipment , and medical devices , how is it that the world's most valuable company can't find the time to make a full line of personal computers and PC peripherals alongside its market-leading smartphones and tablets? The answer goes back to Apple's corporate structure, which, though fairly common for a startup, is extremely unusual for an enormous company.\nFunctional versus divisional structures Any large organization needs to have an organizational structure.\nThere are two main ways to structure a business. You can build divisions that are built around particular lines of business or you can build functional groups that are built around particular kinds of expertise.\nAn extreme case of a divisional company would be Warren Buffett 's Berkshire-Hathaway conglomerate. Buffett famously maintains a corporate headquarters in Omaha that only employs 25 people, who work supporting him personally and compiling paperwork from the company's various divisions to submit to government regulators.\nLike Berkshire's comically inept website, the bare-bones home office is in part a philosophical statement. It shows that Buffett is in the business of making investments in companies and corporate leaders he believes in. No management is happening in Omaha. Instead, the company's various divisions — whether it's a freight railroad or a mobile home manufacturer — have their own corporate functions, including things like HR and legal.\nBerkshire is extreme in this regard, but a basic divisional backbone is the main way to organize a big company. Most people work for units that are responsible for particular lines of business, while a few functional groups (maybe public relations or accounting) provide support to all the business divisions.\nApple is extremely functional Apple isn't like that. If you look at their executive team you'll find that there's no senior vice president for iPhone who works alongside a senior vice president for Mac. Nobody is in charge of Macs or iPhones or iPads or really anything else, because Apple is almost entirely functional.\nThere's a chief design officer and a senior vice president of software engineering and a senior vice president of hardware technologies who is different than the senior vice president of hardware engineering. Of course there are also more traditional senior functional executives like a general counsel and a chief financial officer. But the closest thing Apple has to a divisional chief with responsibility for a specific line of business is Angela Ahrendts, the senior vice president for retail.\nBut Ahrendts's role actually illustrates the strength of Apple's functional model. In a traditional divisional structure, each division head would be responsible for their own profit and loss line on the corporate balance sheet. In that divisional context, Ahrendts's job would be to optimize for the profitability of Apple's retail stores. But Apple doesn't want its retail stores to be optimized for profitability. The stores do bring in money, but they are also important marketing statements whose existence, design, and operation is supposed to project the Apple brand in specific ways.\nFunctional structures, more broadly, allow for collaboration. Apple is able to develop features like continuity across multiple Apple devices or use a chip developed for the Apple Watch to power the new TouchBar in part because its top executives are responsible for things like \"software engineering\" and \"hardware technologies\" (i.e., chip development) rather than for specific products.\nDivisional backbones make management easier Collaboration, unity of purpose, and synergies across groups are things that every company wants. But most CEOs do not attempt to manage enormous global companies with purely functional structures, because even though it sounds good, it's extraordinarily difficult to make it work in practice.\nMicrosoft has an executive vice president who's in charge of Office, a different one who's in charge of Windows and Devices, and a third one who's in charge of Microsoft Cloud. There are software engineers working in all three groups, but nobody is in charge of \"software engineering\" — they are responsible for specific lines of business. That way if something goes wrong with a particular product, it's a specific person's fault and there are clear lines of accountability.\nThis is particularly useful when it comes to managing a line of business like Windows, which is in long-term structural decline but remains enormously profitable and important. It matters to Microsoft — a lot — whether the Windows business is run well even though Windows is not part of the sexy and interesting future of computing. Making sure that someone specific is in charge of running the Windows business, and that the people who work on Windows know that they are accountable to a Windows-specific executive, ensures that focus is maintained even though the world's attention has moved elsewhere.\nFunctional Apple struggles to walk and chew gum at the same time Which brings us back to the poor Mac.\nApple is an enormous company with vast revenue, huge cash reserves, and a strong global brand. Objectively speaking, it should not be struggling to put out regular updates of its highly profitable Mac desktop and laptop computers. Of course, it might be hard to bring radical redesigns and breakthrough innovations to the Mac. But what existing Mac customers really want is something more basic: confidence that Apple will regularly update the Mac to incorporate new chips as they become standard in the rest of the computer industry.\nInstead, Apple has a situation where they rolled out a radical redesign (including breakthrough innovations) of their desktop pro computer and then haven't updated it at all in three years. When that innovative computer was new, Phil Schiller scoffed at critics with the line, \"can't innovate any more my ass,\" and he was right. But a well-managed line of business doesn't try to subsist on sporadic breakthroughs. It requires ongoing work.\nBut on any given day, the iPhone is far-and-away the most important product Apple ships. The company needs to be incredibly focused on making sure that each year's new iPhone is meaningfully better than the previous one. The iPad shares enough hardware and software DNA with the iPhone that putting in the extra work to keep it updated is a no-brainer. The Watch is supposed to be Apple's effort to break through into a growth market. Apple is trying to play catch-up with its online services to bolster the iPhone's position. The entire Mac business isn't that important. And within the Mac universe, the consumer-grade laptop is the most important product.\nThe upshot is that even though regularly updating desktop Macs should not be that difficult, objectively speaking, it tends not to happen in part because it's not anyone's job to make it happen. The functional organization values collaboration on top corporate priorities above all else, and that means basically everything comes ahead of desktop Macs. Admitting that they can't work at all on peripherals is, in that context, a step in the right direction.\nBut it does raise the question of whether persisting with functional organization is really compatible with the company's growth aspirations. After all, monitors — large objects that you connect to computers — seems like a genuinely promising market for a company that makes digital devices and is known for its strength in industrial design. The Mac's share of the PC market has steadily grown over the past few years, and it genuinely could be a growth business if it had an executive to focus on it. And Apple's strategically significant online services businesses would arguably benefit from clearer accountability.\nMoving away from pure functional organization would, obviously, carry some real costs. In the past, functional structure has allowed Apple to retain much of the nimbleness of a startup. The iPod was originally launched as a Mac accessory, but Steve Jobs rapidly changed course and made it a cross-platform hit — a feat that was much easier to pull off because there was no \"Mac division\" to wage bureaucratic warfare against the idea. Launching new products like the iPhone and iPad without fear of cannibalizing resources or market share has helped Apple stay ahead of the curve, while the more divisional Microsoft was never able to plunge headfirst into mobile.\nBut Apple's market exits are a clear sign of severe growing pains inside the existing structure. Apple is already huge, but it wants to be bigger. To get there, it may need to finally start acting like a big company.",

      "text": "What will the iPhone 8 look like? Apple might not even know yet.\nApple is reportedly testing \"more than 10 prototypes\" of the iPhone 8, according to The Wall Street Journal .\nSEE ALSO: Apple's 'spaceship' campus looks like a futuristic, solar-powered fortress in new drone video\nThe Journal claims its checks with display suppliers suggest next year's flagship iPhone could come with a curved screen with greater resolution than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus . The curved screen echoes a Barclays Research note that reported the iPhone 8 would have a curved screen that extends to the edges.\nThe report also corroborates earlier rumors claiming Apple could release a new top-tier iPhone 8 with an OLED display that'll cost more. Though as many as 10 different iPhone 8's are being considered, Apple will shave that down to two or three models by the time they launch next year.\nApple has yet to ditch LCDs in favor of OLED technology for its iPhones, even as competitors such as Samsung and Xiaomi have done so. The only Apple products with OLED displays are the Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pros .\nOLED screens could help make the iPhone 8 thinner and more power efficient.\nWhat's the big deal about OLED? To normal folk, LCD and OLED screens might not look too different, but the advantages of OLEDs are many, with better color reproduction and improved contrast (thus deeper blacks). Also, LCDs require a backlight but OLEDs don't; instead, each individual pixel lights up. Pixels that turn black don't need to light up and, thus, help conserve power.\nFurthermore, because OLED displays don't need a backlight, it's one less layer to fit into the iPhone's already tightly packed design. That means Apple could make the iPhone 8 thinner and lighter than the iPhone 7.\nOf course, the release of an iPhone 8 with an OLED screen will depend largely on production yield rates. Apple moves millions of iPhones every quarter, after all.\nOther iPhone 8 rumors we've heard include a glass and metal design resembling the iPhone 4S, an embedded Touch ID sensor underneath the display and wireless charging .\nIf this year's iPhone 7 and its lack of a headphone jack were underwhelming to you, next year's might be better. Just don't count on the headphone jack coming back. It's gone, guys. Get over it .\nBONUS: The 3 best things about the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 10:58 AM EST Intel: Spending for Apple, Or Just Cause They Like to Spend? Asks Instinet Instinet ’s Romit Shah today asks whether Intel ’s ( INTC ) surprising step-up in its spending outlook presages greater investment in its relationship with Apple ( AAPL ) or some other project as yet undisclosed. Shah, who has a Buy rating on the stock, notes that after a restructuring announced this past spring, the chip maker’s latest forecast for spending is surprisingly high: After this announcement, consensus revenues for 2016 increased by $2 billion, presumably generating several hundred million dollars of operating leverage. And Intel sold a majority stake in McAfee, reducing operating expenses by almost $1.5 billion ($1.1 billion expected in 2017). We estimate these developments—restructuring, higher revenues and McAfee— should reduce expenses to $19 billion or 30% of sales.",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nApple claimed that its IOS 10 Operating system is completely unbreakable. However, sadly for Apple, it seems like the Chinese hacking group named Pangu is ready with their new IOS 10 Jailbreak tool. \nThe latest reports suggest that Pangu is adding more versatility to their jailbreak tool and is also timing the launch of this said tool. Meanwhile, it is expected that Apple will release its latest IOS 10.0.2 update in the month of December. \nIs it possible that Pangu might release the jailbreak before that? Earlier, Pangu claimed that they have already jailbroken the new IOS from Apple. Sadly, they went completely silent and never released the jailbreak tool. \nAccording to experts, the reason behind this was constant updates from Apple and addition of new and improved security features. According to Neurogadget, Pangu has managed to add more functionality to their new IOS Jailbreak tool, especially after the introduction of new updates and features from Apple. \nAccording to the Senior Security Engineer of Alibaba who goes by the Twitter handle SparkZheng, there will be a new IOS 10 jailbreak, and it will be released soon. Sadly, he neglected to mention the date of its release. The last IOS 10 update was IOS 10.0.1, and it came with better iMessage versions through third-party applications, new lock screen, new emojis and also a change introduced in 3D Touch. \nThe online communities, who like evading the limitations set by their Apple device, are eagerly waiting for an update from Pangu and it would also be the perfect gift for the online community of IOS. Besides Pangu, there are many other hacking groups who are trying to jailbreak the new IOS, but they haven’t met with any success so far. \nThere have been numerous false claims, but nothing substantial has shown up yet. For the time being, Apple users need to keep their fingers crossed and sincerely wait for the new jailbreak update to be released soon. \nIn the meantime, the fans that look up to Pangu for all the latest jailbreak updates, are pretty frustrated. It has been September since the popular hacking group revealed any tools. \nAccording to many users, the regular updates by Apple are preventing them from their jailbreak tool. Meanwhile, a well-known hacker named Luca Todesco said that he already has the hack ready in its place. Various followers of the hacker said that they want him to help them out, but he never offered to help Pangu. \nHowever, according to the Twitter posts from the hacker, an IOS 10 Jailbreak is very much possible. \nThere are others groups who claimed that they had jailbroken the new IOS, but according to Todesco, all of them are false claims. However, if there is any truth to these rumors, the hackers need to release the tool as soon as possible since Apple is already working on a new update for the IOS. \nMoreover only registered beta users will have access to this update. Many people believe that this time around, it is impossible to jailbreak the new Apple Operating System and the company has finally managed to stump all the hackers once it for all. \nHackers also declared that they can’t promise a new jailbreak tool since the IOS 10 Jailbreak tool is still unstable. According to him, there might not be a public release at all. \nThe BitBag reported that a team called Unblock Jailbreak has managed to crack IOS 10, but they are yet to post any details on how it can be downloaded. As a result, jailbreak hunters can only wait for a jailbreak tool to be released and nothing more. Page 1 of 2 1 2 »",

      "text": "Apple’s next iPhone could come with a major new feature, according to a report.\nApple is testing an iPhone with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology that could allow for a curved screen, The Wall Street Journal is reporting , citing sources. The report says the OLED model would be in addition to traditional liquid crystal display (LCD) versions that Apple would also release.\nOverall, Apple is working on “more than 10” distinct iPhone prototypes, according to the Journal .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nNext year’s iPhone could be a major update over the current model, the iPhone 7. Next year marks the 10th anniversary for the iPhone , and both analysts and market researchers believe Apple wants to offer at least one model that delivers many of the innovations competitors like Samsung have offered for the last few years.\nSamsung, for instance, has made a curved OLED-based screen with its Galaxy S “edge” line. The ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 Samsung released this year and subsequently discontinued because some caught fire or exploded also had a curved screen.\nApple AAPL has been criticized in the last several months for not offering many of the innovations its competitors have. Those complaints reached a crescendo in September when Apple unveiled an iPhone 7 that looked strikingly similar to last year’s iPhone 6s. It also lacked a headphone port, which elicited intense criticism. Still, the iPhone 7 is among the biggest selling smartphones available.\nNext year, though, Apple may want to make a bigger splash.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nRumors over the last several months indicate that Apple is testing major updates to the iPhone including a curved screen based on OLED technology. It’s believed the curved version would be bigger than the 5.5-inch screen in Apple’s biggest smartphone, the iPhone 7 Plus. The next iPhone could also come without the physical Home button that sits below its screen. Instead, Apple is said to be considering moving the Home button under the screen , which would require users to press the touch display to reach the iPhone software’s home screen or to buy something using the company’s mobile-payment service Apple Pay.\nStill, delivering a new iPhone with major changes is no simple task, and that’s likely why Apple is testing so many prototypes. It’s possible that Apple will discard its idea for a curved iPhone screen.\nFor its part, the notoriously secretive Apple hasn’t said what it’s planning and hasn’t even confirmed it’s working on a new iPhone. However, the company is believed to be planning a new iPhone next year and likely won’t announce it until that time.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Apple TV gets... TV app Apple's new TV app aims to put all your live and on-demand TV content in one place.\n1:39 Close Drag Apple 's new TV app is nearing launch, and with it comes the ability to rid yourself of the laborious process of repeatedly signing into every streaming app with every update. \nRight now, single sign-on (SSO) is only available for those with the iOS 10.2 beta installed on a compatible device. However, when the feature officially launches, Apple TV and iOS users can use the new feature. \nWith SSO set up on your device(s), you can skip the sign-in process for any streaming app such as NBC, HBO Go or CNN that require you to log in and verify a cable subscription to unlock all features of the app. Assuming the app(s) adds support for SSO.\nAdding to its benefit, SSO will also make it possible for you to use the new TV app to view and discover shows or movies in a single app instead of bouncing between apps. \nSSO on iOS Enlarge Image Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET Open the Settings app on an iOS device, then scroll down to TV Provider and tap on it. Pick your provider from the list, then log in using the proper credentials. Currently, there are five TV providers offering support for SSO: \nDish DirecTV GVTC Communications Hotwire Sling TV After signing in, you can view a list of apps you are signed into using SSO (should be blank right now), as well as discover more apps with support for SSO (again, should be blank right now). \nOnce the feature officially launches and developers can submit apps with support, the discovery screen will surely populate with a list of apps. \nWe will update this post with more instructions once Apple updates the Apple TV with support for SSO and the new TV app. \n ",

      "text": "Apple today started rolling out the fourth public beta version of iOS 10.2, an update that became available to developers earlier today and will become available for everyone to install in the next few weeks. \nThe public beta is a way for Apple to test out the next version of its operating systems before they go out to the general population, so that Apple can figure out what to fix. Unlike developer beta releases, public beta releases can be accessed free of charge, by signing up for Apple’s Beta Software Program . If you’re already part of the beta program, you’ll be able to download the new version as an over-the-air (OTA) update. \nGoogle recently established the user-friendly Android Beta Program , which gives people access to the developer previews of Android early.\nAs for this new version of iOS 10 — which became available to everyone in September and is now running on more than 60 percent of iOS devices, according to Apple data — it once again includes the TV app Apple recently debuted, just like the second and third public betas of iOS 10.2. Apple has fixed a few bugs in the app — for example, users won’t be asked to connect third-party apps to the TV app over and over again. Also artwork for synced content should be correct now.\nBut the app still has some bugs that Apple knows about. Namely the app might take a long time to open, it can’t be restored after it’s deleted, it may crash on the iPod Touch, and syncing an iOS device with computers running certain versions of iTunes may result in some content being deleted from the TV app.\n",

      "text": "Bug bounties: How does Apple's program compare to others? by Apple has started to offer bug bounties to researchers who find vulnerabilities in iOS. Expert Michael Cobb compares Apple's program to that of other companies. Sections   Expert Q&A \nEnjoy this article as well as all of our content, including E-Guides, news, tips and more.

What do you think of Apple's bug bounty program? How do Apple's prices for iOS bugs compete with other bug bounties and, more importantly, the black market? \nOver the last few years Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Samsung and many other major tech companies have been using bug bounties to offer recognition and compensation to non-employees who report security flaws in their products. Although these companies have in-house teams searching for security vulnerabilities, encouraging others to help find them improves the overall detection rate and reduces the chances of the wrong type of hacker discovering them first. Even companies that don't have the technical expertise to run their own bug bounty program have started outsourcing the process to firms like Bugcrowd. Apple had been a major exception, refusing to outbid governments and black markets that regularly pay for vulnerabilities in Apple products. \nHowever, Apple finally launched its own bug bounty program, but it's quite different from those of other companies. It's purely invitation-only, open only to researchers who have previously made valuable vulnerability disclosures to the company. This approach is even more exclusive than that taken by the Department of Defense when it piloted its Hack the Pentagon program . Apple won't turn away new researchers if they provide useful disclosures but it clearly wants to avoid dealing with part-time sleuths, unknown researchers or shady hackers. It's looking for a higher percentage of quality submissions than many programs receive. Bugcrowd's 2016 Annual State of Bug Bounty Report found that private programs have a much better overall signal-to-noise ratio of 29% compared to 13% in public programs. This is borne out by Google Bughunter University, which says: \"Approximately 90% of the submissions we receive through our vulnerability reporting form are ultimately deemed to have little or no practical significance to product security.\" Apple is not interested in encouraging younger, less established bounty hunters; instead, it wants those with the necessary specialist skills and expertise to find very specific types of vulnerabilities, particularly vulnerabilities that could lead to compromises of sensitive data and privacy issues, and its five- and six-figure bug bounties reflect that too. For example, vulnerabilities discovered in the secure boot firmware components can earn up to $200,000. \nCompare that to the rewards and the types of vulnerabilities that qualify for Google's program where bug bounties top out at $20,000: \"Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data is likely to be in scope for the program.\" A \"truly novel exploitation technique against protections built into the latest version of our operating system\" will qualify for Microsoft's maximum $100,000 bounty, although it has run contests in which it has paid more. There is no cap on Facebook's bug bounties and according to the company, individual researchers have earned more than $100,000 for multiple valid submissions. \nHowever, even these amounts won't beat the payouts researchers can earn from government agencies or the black market. The FBI reportedly paid nearly $1 million for the exploit it used to break into an iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the individuals involved in the San Bernardino shooting in December 2015, while Exodus Intelligence has unveiled a \"research sponsorship program\" that offers as much as $500,000 for zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities -- exploits or vulnerabilities that have already been patched. These payments mean any type of bug bounty program is going to struggle to attract hackers who only care about earning money and have no qualms over the ethics of who pays them. Thankfully there are plenty of ethical hackers out there and existing programs have all identified new vulnerabilities that the sponsors didn't yet know about. Apple's bug bounty program will certainly help the overall security of its products now that there is a clear path for reporting vulnerabilities and potential fixes, and the rewards being offered reflect the amount of time and skill it takes to find and report critical vulnerabilities. \nAsk the Expert: Want to ask Michael Cobb a question about application security? via email.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Instinet ’s Romit Shah today asks whether Intel ’s ( INTC ) surprising step-up in its spending outlook presages greater investment in its relationship with Apple ( AAPL ) or some other project as yet undisclosed.\nShah, who has a Buy rating on the stock, notes that after a restructuring announced this past spring, the chip maker’s latest forecast for spending is surprisingly high:\nAfter this announcement, consensus revenues for 2016 increased by $2 billion, presumably generating several hundred million dollars of operating leverage. And Intel sold a majority stake in McAfee, reducing operating expenses by almost $1.5 billion ($1.1 billion expected in 2017). We estimate these developments—restructuring, higher revenues and McAfee— should reduce expenses to $19 billion or 30% of sales. However, management, in October, guided for a point of leverage in 2016 and 2017, implying operating expenses of $20.5 billion (34% of sales) on $61 billion in revenue. In sum, we believe Intel is planning to reinvest more than $1 billion of this year’s cost savings in 2017. The impact to EPS is roughly $0.40 and the share price is $4-6 (10-15x P/E), per our estimation. \nInvestors, thinks Shah, “should be asking the company, ‘Which projects is Intel investing in that it didn’t contemplate in April? And why?’”\nCould it be that they are going to fab chips for Apple’s iPhone , he muses:\nThis is the upside scenario because of the revenue opportunity ($ billions) and destabilizing effect on TSMC and the ARM supply chain. We have no insight into discussions between Intel and Apple, but within our mosaic, we believe an Apple foundry win would be highly sensitive, which might explain why Intel is being uncharacteristically vague in its communication and waiting until the analyst day in February to provide more details on spending. In addition, this scenario comes amid reports (Nikkei Asian Review) that Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron in June to consider assembling iPhones in the U.S. If Apple is seriously considering manufacturing iPhones in the U.S., it seems plausible that it would consider sub- components locally as well. Our understanding is that a high-volume foundry win for Intel would materially increase operating expenses. Part of Intel’s value-add as a foundry is that the company takes on design work from the customer. Large scale designs can require custom packaging, special mask work, and possibly derivative process technology development in support of a different leakage profile. \nMaybe they’re spending more to hold off Nvidia ( NVDA ) in chips for server computers for cloud: \nDatacenter revenues are lower than we expected at the start of the year (2016 consensus revenues for DCG declined from $18.6bn to $17.4bn over the last 12 months), but we estimate operating margins will decline 4% to 45%. In addition, operating margins for Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) are 15-20% lower than Altera on a stand-alone basis. The percentage difference amounts to $250- 300mn of higher spending, much of which could be targeted at FPGA parallel processing for the datacenter. As such, lower operating margins in both DCG and PSG could potentially signify something more worrisome, such as a defense move (i.e., more custom projects) to stem market share loss in the Cloud. \nOr maybe, he thinks, the “most probable scenario” is that “Intel is spreading itself too thin,” which would be a “continuation of the status quo: Intel likes to spend.”\nWhatever it is, the spending takes $4 to 6 off the upside for the stock, or a $41 price per share, versus his $40 price target and an implied $48 value per share.\nIntel shares today are up 13 cents at $35.57.",

      "text": "\nBack in September, Apple launched iOS 10 to mostly positive reviews, but you might want to wait before you update to the latest 10.1.1 version, as reports state the batteries are no longer functioning correctly. As News.com.au states, after updating to iOS 10.1.1, phones with an 80 percent battery life would be empty if left unused overnight. Charging it would show a 30 percent battery life, then quickly drop to zero within seconds, before shutting down. However unplugging the phone when it shows 100 percent battery life sees the figure drop below 50 percent as soon as the iPhone is unlocked.\niOS 10.1.1 was released on October 31, while a second version was released on November 9. Hopefully the problem can be fixed before iPhone batteries start failing altogether.\nApple support forum user JimS-in-Seattle reports:\n“I unfortunately confirm that 10.1 does not work. My phone is lasting about 3 hours now. Instead of the battery shutting down at 70 percent it is now shutting down at 85 percent. I cannot tell you how many calls I have been bumped from. BTW, when it happens my phone is essentially dead for about 10 minutes before I can use it again.”\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "title": "Been Getting Nailed With iCal Spam? Here’s How to Stop It",
      "text": "Photo-Illustration: Getty Images For at least a month , Apple iCal users have been getting hit with a particularly annoying (and, frankly, ingenious) form of spam, in which they receive invites to events like “Value Brand glasses as low as 19.99” with a URL attached at the bottom. Thanks to a quirk of iCloud and iCal integration, victims receive an email about the invite in their iCloud email; also see the spam invite in their iCal pop-up on their desktop; and even sometimes get reminders on their iPhones about the cheap Oakleys.\nIt’s unclear what happened to cause the sudden uptick in this form of spam. It’s actually a somewhat old type of spam — users were reporting similar attempts back in 2008 . My best guess? A group of Chinese spammers hit upon the idea, had a large email list from somewhere, and leased some time on a botnet to blast out the iCal invites, thus avoiding the pretty sophisticated spam filters in place for email clients nowadays.\nIf you’ve been getting hit, here’re two methods to stop it, one dead simple but that will cut off your iCloud syncing, and one that’ll still let you use iCloud but requires a bit more legwork.\nLet’s start with simple first, which is best if you don’t use your iCloud calendar all that much, but use your desktop calendar quite a bit.\n1. Go to System Preferences and select iCloud\n2. Log into to your account and then unclick, “Use iCloud for contacts, calendars, reminders, notes, and Safari.” This will mean you won’t sync to iCloud from your desktop, but you also won’t be hit with desktop notifications about cheap Louis Vuitton bags.\nBut what if you want to keep using your iCloud calendar from your desktop? Then you’re going to have to get a bit more crafty.\n1. Don’t dismiss or respond at all to the event invites — all this does is confirm that your email address is indeed active, ensuring you’ll get hit with more spam in the future.\n2. Instead, set up a dummy calendar for all the spam invites you’ve gotten so far. Name it whatever you like, and then reclassify all the spam messages you’ve gotten as belonging to that calendar. Next hit “Edit” and then delete the calendar with all the invites about Ugg boots — without the spammers getting any notification about whether you’ve seen the invite or not.\n3. Unless you want clearing out spam invites to become a general housecleaning duty, next go to your iCloud calendar on your desktop (you won’t be able to do this from your phone). Hit the gear icon in the lower left-hand side for Preferences and then hit Advanced. Change how you receive notifications from “in-app” to “email.” You’ll still get hit with spam, but it’ll land in your inbox instead of popping up while you’re trying to get work done — and hopefully your email spam filters are a bit better than Apple’s iCloud at spotting spam. This does mean, however, that you’ll need to also stay on top of your inbox a bit more for legit invitations for things that you do want to have on your calendar.\nHopefully, Apple can figure out a way to block the mass invites via iCloud. In the meantime, these are the best workarounds to avoid the whole mess altogether.",

      "text": "By Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman YANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI program director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\". \nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nTwo companies in Apple's supply chain, the world's No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq))\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. \"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said. Foxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\". Pegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added. FROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\". A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\". \"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "Apple ( AAPL ) could be taking a cue from rival smartphone maker Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) with its next iPhone model.\nThe Cupertino, CA-based company could roll out an iPhone with a curved screen as soon as next year, just in time for the iPhone's 10th birthday, Apple's display suppliers told the Wall Street Journal .\nCurved screens are powered by organic LED displays, which pack better color reproduction and don't require a backlight, which results in a thinner phone. But they're also more expensive and more difficult to produce than traditional LED screens.\nAn OLED phone would likely be released alongside several other models, and could also be rejected during the prototype phase in favor of alternative models, according to the Wall Street Journal's sources.\nThe design would be similar to Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge in that the screen would wrap around the sides of the phone. It could have an \"active screen area\" of 5.1 to 5.2 inches, but the screen panel could be up to 5.8 inches diagonally, according to 9to5mac.com , which references a report from market research firm KGI Securities published earlier this month.\nCurrently, Apple's largest iPhone is the 7 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "title": "For Apple and others, tin supply chain has ties to rebel-held Myanmar mine",
      "text": "By Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman\nYANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI program director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\".\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nTwo companies in Apple's supply chain, the world's No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq))\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. \"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said. Foxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\". Pegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added. FROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\". A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\". \"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "By Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman\nYANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfil those regulations they looked to an audit programme designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI programme director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\".\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organisation to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nRead More Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nTwo companies in Apple's supply chain, the world's No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq))\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. \"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said. Foxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\". Pegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added. FROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\". A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\". \"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "Reddit \niOS 10.2 is just around the corner! You know that because Apple has just rolled out its fourth beta preview for the next version of its mobile OS. Available initially to developers, the beta is also trickling out to brave iPhone and iPad owners who opted into Apple’s Beta Software program. Those that did are now enjoying a whole new set of emojis from Unicode 9.0. And if they own an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, they also get three new wallpapers to delight. \nEmojis are hot, but were you aware that there’s actually an international standard for what goes in and what stays out? Well, technically Unicode is more about how characters of different languages are encoded by computers but, since emoji is practically a new language, it falls under that as well. In iOS 10.2, users will be greeted by profession-specific emojis like firefighter, doctor, and scientist as well as a selfie emoji. \nThe beta also includes Apple’s TV app, which replaces the age-old iOS Videos app. But more than just playing videos, the app also acts as a TV guide for checking shows and channels. Of course, you can watch those in the app itself, if you’ve taken advantage of the new single sign-on feature in beta. \nOther changes include an “SOS” function exclusive to India that is triggered when pressing the power (not home) button five times, relocated shuffle and repeat buttons in the Music app, and three new wallpapers exclusive to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. \nApple’s beta program is a good way for curious users to check out what’s coming in new versions of iOS or macOS, while also giving back to the company through reports and testing. While the developer previews are naturally exclusive to those with developer accounts, Apple does have a free public preview program available for everyone else that doesn’t fall that far behind the initial developer drop.",

      "text": "All eyes are on the next-generation iPhone, but Apple is hard at work on some pretty big changes for the iPad as well, including what could be the complete removal of the home button. A new report from Japanese blog Macotakara and citing people with knowledge of the matter indicates that Apple is getting ready to ditch the home button on at least one of the upcoming iPad models, with some thinking that this is done in anticipation of a similar change planned for the iPhone. Specifically, the source says that future iPads could come in three sizes, namely 9.7, 12.9, and 10.9 or 10.5 inches – information regarding the size of this last model is still contradictory, but there’s a big chance that Apple could go for 10.9-inch and achieve a bigger difference versus the 9.7-inch model. Smaller or no bezels at all One of the changes that Apple is aiming for is a bezel-less design, or at l...",

The company has dropped several hints ever since, suggesting that they are planning a major design and specifications overhaul with the launch. Now reports suggest that the company is planning on adding a 3D camera to its speculated device.\nAccording to a report by The Korea Economic Daily, Apple is working with LG Innotek to develop a camera module that is compatible with 3D technology.\n“Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera. Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit in sometime within next year,” the report read.\nThe report further goes on to suggest that Apple might make use of LG Innotek’s 3D dual rear camera module in its future device.",

      "text": "Home > DT Daily > Apple is looking at many options for the upcoming… Apple is looking at many options for the upcoming iPhone 8 Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nPieces of Eight \nIt’s Monday, November 28th, and let’s hop right into the latest iPhone 8 new, or news/rumors. According to Business Insider , Apple has more than ten different iPhone 8 test mules on their workbenches. Why so many iPhone 8 prototypes? Well, 2017 marks the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, introduced by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs back in 2007. \nAnd as the smartphone technology race continues to escalate, Apple is finding itself in the unusual position of also-ran as other companies push the pace of innovation with curved 4K screens, bigger batteries, higher-spec cameras and so on. Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 plus are hot sellers, but more and more, it looks like the iPhone 8 will be a major revamp for the iconic device, with the top-tier phone possibly featuring a curved OLED screen. \nWhatever happens, 2017 will be an interesting year for the smartphone market, as Apple’s competitors will certainly try to one-up a company known to take tech to the next level. And that’s going to be fun for everyone. \nSuddenly, CNN gets a lot more interesting \nYouTube fixture Casey Neistat , that guy that’s always doing crazy stuff while rocking sunglasses and a t-shirt, has an odd new home for his video shenanigans and his social video app: CNN . \nThe app is called Beme (“beam”), and it’s basically a short video sharing app sort of like Vine and such. CNN has bought the app and brought crazy Casey into the fold, where he’ll be the new White House correspondent. OK, no, he won’t, but he will be in-house at CNN doing something that will hopefully bring the network some millennial eyeballs. As for Beam, it’s gotten a recent refresh so maybe check it out. \nDeals over here, deals over there, cyber deals everywhere \nLike we said, it’s Monday, but it’s that special Monday we love known as Cyber Monday, so if you didn’t melt your credit cards down to nothing on Black Friday, then today’s the day to snap up some of the deals you might have missed. \nWe’ve scoured the vast interwebs for the best deals on the hottest tech out there, so hit our buyers guide at this link here.

We need to bring broadcast over IP (Internet protocol).” \nAlongside the ever-increasing number of apps available on Apple TV, PlayStation Vue one of the latest to reach the platform, Apple is reportedly working hard on original content , though not, says Eddy Cue , by trying to launch its own streaming package.

      "text": "Does your iPhone 6s shut down quite repeatedly? It’s time to get its battery replaced free of cost.\nAs per reports, a small number of iPhone 6s devices reboot unexpectedly. The issue doesn’t get fixed even after restoring the device as new or clearing storage. The problem reportedly affects devices within a limited serial number range which had been manufactured between September and October 2015.\n\nHow to Check if iPhone 6s is Eligible for Apple’s Battery Replacement Program “Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.” – Apple. \nIf your iPhone 6s, unfortunately, is faced with the same issue, you can visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to get the battery replaced free of cost if found eligible.\nStep #1. Locate the serial number of your iPhone. It’s found on the back of iPhone as well as from Settings → General → About.\n\nStep #2. Next up, look for the following characters at the 4th and 5th position of your iPhone’s serial number.\n\nQ3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 QC QD QF QG QH QJ If the serial number of your device includes any of these numbers, then it is eligible for free battery replacement from Apple even if it is out of warranty.\nOnce you have found that your device qualifies for battery replacement, you can call your service provider to confirm so that battery replacement service is available when you visit them. Check Out the Apple Authorized Service Provider Apple Retail Store – Make an appointment Apple Technical Support How to Prepare your iPhone 6s for the battery Replacement Process Step #1. Connect your iPhone to the computer. Fire up iTunes and back up your data as usual.\nStep #2. Make sure to turn off Find My iPhone as well. (Settings → iCloud → Find My iPhone.)\nStep #3. Now, you need to erase data and settings. Go to Settings → General → Reset → Erase all Content and Settings.\nThat’s it!\nAs an iPhone 6s user, I would appreciate this decision by Apple to help fix the problem free of cost.

      "title": "News: Apple wins initial victory against Australian banks in Apple Pay fight",
      "text": "Apple wins initial victory against Australian banks in Apple Pay fight By Dan Pye ● 33 minutes ago \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has issued a preliminary ruling against a group of Australian banks who wanted Apple to open up the iPhone’s NFC controller for use with their mobile payment systems. The banks had asked for the right to collectively bargain with Apple to negotiate for access to the iOS platform and for the ability to pass Apple Pay fees on to the service’s users, but in the draft determination, Chairman Rod Sims said, “While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited.” \nThe banks have been boycotting Apple Pay over the fees Apple charges and filed a motion in July requesting the ability to collectively bargain with the company, claiming the company’s refusal to allow their mobile payment apps on the iPhone stifles competition. In its reply , Apple claimed it was the banks who were worried about competition, and that the boycott was “likely to harm consumers and slow the pace of innovation for mobile wallets in Australia.” Sims said the banks have enough avenues for competition—including the ability to offer their digital wallets on Android phones—to justify letting Apple maintain its hold over access the iPhone’s hardware. The ACCC views iOS as a major part of Apple’s product offering to consumers and any encroachment on it is seen as a slippery slope to distorting competition between mobile phone providers.The commission is still seeking drafts for and against the banks’ position before issuing its final decision.

      "text": "Apple, Google...McKinsey? How an Old-School Company Is Changing the World of Digital Design Changing times call for changing methods. Just ask one of the oldest firms in America. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT , a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016 , serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you.   \nWhen James McKinsey founded \"McKinsey and Company\" almost a hundred years ago, there was no such thing as management consulting. \nFast forward to today. The organization has become not only an American institution, but a global one. McKinsey helped usher in the era of science and data-driven business practices, and has founded its reputation on an ability to solve difficult problems. \nTraditionally, though, McKinsey hasn't been known for its creative work. That's why I was intrigued to learn that the company assembled an impressive digital design team --led by former members of Facebook, Google and Apple, just to name a few. \nI had the chance to speak with Collin Cole, McKinsey's Vice President of Experience Design. The firm--as employees of McKinsey often refer to the company--recently added Cole and Nitin Gupta, co-founders of digital design studio Carbon12 Creative, to its digital practice. \nI was curious to learn why Cole chose to join McKinsey at this point in his career, and how the company is changing. Here are some highlights from our conversation (edited for brevity and clarity): 1. Almost your entire team (from Carbon12 Creative) chose to follow you and Nitin to McKinsey. Why was that? \nFor three decades I've worked in design studios--each of which were exciting places that brought together lots of diverse, creative viewpoints. But even the best agencies have blind spots; or, put another way, design alone is not enough to solve every problem. How studios engage with clients can also post challenges; we wanted to play a bigger role from end-to-end, from developing the initial recommendations to operationalizing solutions. \nAdditionally, McKinsey works at the highest levels, including the biggest and most complicated companies in the world. Actively participating in meetings with those senior leaders, the challenge of multifaceted problems--these are massive opportunities for learning and growth. \nAt the same time, designers are able to help clients see issues and drive impact from an entirely new perspective. 2. How is your role at McKinsey different than what you've done in the past? \nMy role includes working with not only designers and clients but also business consultants and technical experts. My job is to add 'design thinking' to our problem solving--a deep consideration for the actual people who will be touched by the solution. \nI love my team and continue to actively mentor them, but I'm also excited to work with the broader Experience Design team. I get to mentor but also learn from them. I also get to work with separate but adjacent leaders, other VPs from data science, development, agile coaching, and more--which is helping me think through not only how I best serve a particular client, but also to take a broader perspective and think: What can we now create, across all of these disciplines, to better serve our clients? 3. Any major changes in thought or strategy you can share? How about special challenges? \nGlobally, McKinsey has been quietly but steadily amassing some of the world's top design talent. People I would consider thought leaders in the experience design field are peers of mine here--and that reflects a big shift in strategy from historically focusing on business consulting to now welcoming those of us from 'non-traditional' backgrounds, from design, technology, and more. \nMcKinsey is sending a very strong signal that it is serious about bringing top design talent to its clients. Among our main challenges is: How can we fully harness the added diversity of background and perspective our team brings, while also ensuring consistent development? \nIt's a cliché but it's true: We live in a world where the only constant is change, where companies no longer have time to settle for steady growth and incremental improvements. Companies need to think differently, work differently, and serve customers in new ways. \nDesign is a great catalyst. It helps us reframe problems and discover exciting new opportunities.

      "text": "Pesticide Exposures May Alter Mouth Bacteria Updated 0 \nApple picking in orchard \nMONDAY, Nov. 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Pesticide exposure may change the makeup of bacteria in the mouths of farm workers, a new study finds. \nResearchers at the University of Washington analyzed swabs taken from the mouths of 65 adult farm workers and 52 adults who didn't work on farms. All lived in Washington's Yakima Valley. \nThe farm workers had higher blood levels of pesticides, and greater changes in their mouth bacteria than non-farm workers, the study found. \nThe most significant finding was in farm workers who had the organophosphate pesticide Azinphos-methyl in their blood. \nIn this group, researchers found significantly reduced quantities of seven common groups of oral bacteria. Among those was Streptococcus, which first author Ian Stanaway called \"one of the most common normal microbiota in the mouth.\" He's a doctoral candidate in environmental toxicology. \nStanaway noted that previous studies have found that \"changes in species and strains of Streptococcus have been associated with changes in oral health.\" \nThe changes noted in this new study persisted into the winter, long after the growing season when pesticide use is highest, the researchers said. \nThe study doesn't establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, however. \nThe results were published recently in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology . \nWith this discovery, \"the challenge becomes, what does this mean? We don't know,\" principal investigator Elaine Faustman said in a journal news release. Faustman is a professor in the university's Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences. \n\"We depend on the microbiome for many metabolic processes,\" she said. \nMore information \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has more on pesticides . ***",

      "title": "Apple, GE Suppliers May Have Ties to Rebel-held Myanmar Tin Mine",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple, GE Suppliers Linked to Rebel-held Myanmar Tin Mine From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world’s largest consumer companies. More than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple aapl , coffee giant Starbucks sbux and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co tif , list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar’s border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found. The mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters. This potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric @General Electri ge , at risk of violating sanctions that forbid “direct or indirect” dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. Several sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions “generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities” on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances. The situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. Following a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa. But the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. Apple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). A CFSI program director said the group was “aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar.” The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include “a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas.” Tin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa. “Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,” she said. Civil War Most of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. The Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high-grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal. The mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so. Interviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies. Tin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar’s peace process. “There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,” the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. “Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It’s the biggest source of income.” While Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents. Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. “The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,” Kucik said. Two companies in Apple’s supply chain, the world’s No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine. Mandy Gan, a tin analyst from China’s leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine. Sanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters’ findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA. Still, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said. Supply Chain The chain connecting some of the world’s best-known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. One key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys “a long-term, stable strategic partnership” with the UWSA statelet. YCII declined several interview requests. YCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world’s top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. Yunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology and, indirectly, Pegatron, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron. “Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI…As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that’s acceptable for us,” said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. In the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. More than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, Calif.-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Two members of Yunnan Tin’s board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a “portion” of the company’s tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. “We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,” Pan told Reuters. “We don’t specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.” Yunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. That means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin’s purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons. Apple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, “and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain.” “While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we’ll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,” it said. Foxconn said it “enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers.” It added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a “single, non-U.S.-based customer.” Pegatron said it carried out “annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains.” “Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,” the company added. From Jewelry to Appliances Companies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. Among the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a “very small amount of tin” from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware. The company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, “use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy.” Starbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had “noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners.” A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target tgt said in a statement it was “committed to responsible business conduct.” “We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,” the statement said.

      "text": "Apple’s next iPhone will feature the ability to take 3D photos, it has been claimed.\nThe tech giant is rumored to have teamed up with LG Innotek to develop a new camera module capable of snapping images in an astonishing new way.\nThis subsidiary of LG reportedly made the dual lens camera which appears on the iPhone 7 Plus.\nIndustry sources told The Korea Economic Daily : “Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera.”\n“Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year.”\nThe technique of 3D photography requires images to be taken by two different lenses. These are then combined to create the illusion of depth.\nLike all the Apple rumors which swirl around the tech world, the claims have not been verified and may not be accurate.\nWe’ll have to wait until next year to find out exactly what Apple has in mind for its upcoming smartphone.\nThis week, it was also suggested that Apple will install incredible wireless charging technology in the iPhone 8.\nA world-renowned tech analyst known as Ming The Merciless has claimed the upcoming smartphone will not need to be plugged in to recharge the battery.\nThe Apple guru, whose real name is Ming-Chi Kuo, said the company’s next smartphone would feature a case made entirely of glass .\nThis would allow it to be placed on top of a wireless charger, which would quickly pump juice into the battery.\nApple already uses similar technology on the Apple Watch, so the prediction is not all that far-fetched.\nThe reliable Apple news website 9to5Mac wrote : “According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities, the 2017 iPhone will add wireless charging for the first time.”\n“Instead of plugging in a cable, iPhone 8 owners will be able to charge their batteries using an inductive pad similar to how the Apple Watch charges.”\nMing the Merciless has been unflinching with his predictions about the upcoming iPhone for several months now.\nHe previously claimed it would come in three fruity colors and could be fitted with a flashy OLED screen.\nOther analysts suggested the next iPhone could fold in half just like old-fashioned flip phones.\nThe Apple rumor mill is swirling with speculation that the tech giant is planning a device which has a flexible display with a hinge at one side.\nThe details were released in patent filings in the US by the tech giant.\nThey suggest that Apple is taking inspiration from Motorola, which pioneered the flip phone way back in the 1990s.\n This article originally appeared on The Sun .",

The pre-announced shut down is part of Apple’s annual time off period for app reviewers at the company. \nThe busiest season on the App Store is almost here. Make sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays. New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other iTunes Connect and developer account features will remain available. \nFor developers, this means any changes being planned during that period should be in place ahead of time and new app and update submissions should be handled days in advance. For customers, it means the App Store won’t be updating for a few days aside from scheduled releases while the App Store team takes a break. \nApple regularly schedules this downtime period each year. The company has tips for developers for preparing for the downtime. Guides",

Tree surgeon bled to death when chainsaw cut his throat \nNext target – the Home button. \nApple’s rumoured to be making its first device without the iconic round ‘unlock’ button on the front – an iPad, due early this year. \nMacotakara says that a new 10.9-inch iPad will still have the Facetime camera at the top of the screen – but will be missing the home button. \nThe additional space will make room for more sreen, with the tablet expected to be the same size as the current 9.7in iPad Pro. (Photo by Neil Godwin/MacLife Magazine via Getty Images) \nThe move could pave the way for iPhones without buttons on the front – an approach already seen on Google’s rival Pixel phone, which has no buttons on the front.
