(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) \nSelf-driving car prototypes should not be subject to the same safety regulations as production vehicles, Apple argued in a letter last month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe letter commends many other aspects of the agency's proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (FAV), but it offers few clarifications to the rumors that have been swirling in recent months about Apple's own self-driving car ambitions.\nFrom securing car-related domain names to hiring executives from Tesla , it's clear that Apple is at least exploring autonomous driving. But the company in September reportedly laid off dozens of employees working on the self-driving project, code-named Project Titan, in a sign that the tech giant is rethinking its efforts.\nIn the letter, sent by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner on Nov. 22 and spotted by the Wall Street Journal last week, the company said it agreed with many safety and certification rules for the production of self-driving cars, but suggested that prototypes should not be subject to all of them. Rather than requesting exemptions from the rules each time it makes a modification to a prototype, Apple wants to self-certify that its prototypes are safe.\nMore From PCmag Shield Your Face From Facial Recognition With Reflectacles",

Deputies tracked Meleski's footprints from the truck stop and after about an hour found him at a downtown Richfield bar, where he told them he had gotten drunk at the stadium, lost his cell phone and was separated from friends.\nMore from FoxSports Howie Long with high praise for the Raiders front office in 2016 | THE HERD Pereira: let's put cameras on goal lines, sidelines Here is what we know about the Oakland Raiders going into Week 14 | UNDISPUTED Cam Newton was benched for violating dress code - Skip and Shannon react | UNDISPUTED His 111-mile journey finally over, Meleski was reportedly booked on a misdemeanor charge of defrauding a taxi cab operator and released.\nAt least he didn't go through all that trouble to witness a loss.

      "text": "By Andrew O'Reilly \nPublished December 05, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Newspaper headlines show Italian Premier Matteo Renzi's resignation following the result of Sunday's constitutional referendum, at a newsstand in Rome, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. Italian voters dealt Premier Renzi a resounding rebuke early Monday by rejecting his proposed constitutional reforms, plunging Europe's fourth-largest economy into political and economic uncertainty. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) \nThe results over the weekend of Italy’s referendum and Austria’s presidential election were billed as the first true test of the rising tide of populism that has engulfed European politics amid stagnant economies, high unemployment and unease over the continuing stream of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.\nBut instead of making a murky political situation clearer, Sunday’s results have left observers with almost more questions than answers as the world awaits 2017’s key elections in Western European superpowers France, Germany and The Netherlands.\n“There are definitely trends that we’re seeing across the region, but one thing this weekend showed is that each country is different,” Dan Kelemen, a professor of political scene at Rutgers University, told FoxNews.com. “We shouldn’t expect that just because the Brexit in the U.K., the election of [Donald] Trump in the U.S. and the rise of some populist leaders in Europe that the rest of the countries are going to go this way.”\nIn Rome - amid a wave of anti-establishment anger led by populist comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement - Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has promised to step down from power after Italians voted against a series of reforms that acted as an unofficial plebiscite on his rule.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Italian Premier Matteo Renzi arrives at a press conference at the premier's office Chigi Palace in Rome, early Monday, Dec. 5, 2016.

Italians voted Sunday in a referendum on constitutional reforms that Premier Matteo Renzi has staked his political future on. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) \nWhile Italy’s “no” vote on Renzi’s referendum is a clear indication of populism’s rise on the boot of Europe, Sunday’s decision may be a high point for the movement given the fractured nature of Italian politics and the varying political viewpoints at play.\nGrillo’s 5-Star Movement is the biggest winner in the referendum's failure, but the more left-leaning populist will have to face numerous other candidates if he hopes to win the prime minister’s job when elections are next held.\nGrillo has called for quick elections, but political analyst Giovanni Orsina, deputy director of the school of government at Rome's LUISS university, said he probably doesn't want them to come too soon because he wants the establishment's failure to \"cook\" over time. If opinion polls hold, the 5-Star movement commands roughly one-third of the vote, but whether that would be enough to govern depends on how the new electoral law is written.\nThe other big player in Italy’s upcoming election is the anti-EU, anti-migrant Northern League and its leader, Matteo Salvini. The Northern League's popularity got a boost in the week after Trump's victory, and Salvini has deepened his alliances with Europe's far-right parties to solidify his influence.\nSalvini wants  immediate elections in an effort to latch on to the growing discontent connected to the migrant crisis, especially in the northern regions of Veneto and Lombardy where they run regional governments and where Italy's proud entrepreneurial class is still struggling to regain footing after the economic crisis.\nExperts say that while these two parties certainly used the strength of Europe’s populist movement to squash Renzi’s referendum, the sheer number of political parties in Italy will make it difficult for one party to seize power outright.\n“The referendum was definitely a vote for populism, but it was more so about Italian anger at  Renzi than populism,” Kelemen said.\nAbout 700 miles to the north, the far-right candidate Norbert Hofer narrowly lost the country’s presidential election to leftist Alexander Van der Bellen in a race that pitted Hofer’s nationalistic brand of populism against Van der Bellen’s self-described “Pro-European” politics.\nVan der Bellen’s victory over Hofer was welcomed by moderate European leaders – on both the right and left – as a win for supporters of the European Union and a blow against the populist forces looking to weaken it.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leading member of the Greens Party, celebrates on the podium at a party of his supporters in Austria's capital Vienna Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016, after the first official results from the Austrian presidential election showed left-leaning candidate Alexander Van der Bellen with what appears to be an unbeatable lead over right-winger Norbert Hofer. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) \nThe Austrian presidency is a mostly symbolic post, but the race attracted a good deal of attention across a Europe stunned by the electoral win by Trump in the U.S. and the Brexit vote in Britain.\n\"What happens here today has relevance for all of Europe,\" Van der Bellen said as he cast his ballot, later noting that his win showed most voters backed his message of \"freedom, equality, solidarity.\"\nVan der Bellen added that  the win sends a \"message to the capitals of the European Union that one can win elections with high European positions.\" He said he would work to unite a country deeply split between the moderate liberals who voted for him and supporters of Hofer's anti-immigrant Freedom Party.\n“This is definitely a clear cut win for those in favor of a multi-national, more Euro-centric view of politics,” Kelemen said. Van der Bellen received praise from numerous European leaders including France’s Francois Hollande, who said Austrians \"made the choice of Europe, and openness.\"\nThe results in Italy and Austria may give those two countries a better grasp on their domestic political situations, but does little to help forecast how their neighbors will vote in 2017.\nMore on this...

(AP) Percy Harvin's comeback lasted just two games after the Buffalo Bills placed the receiver on the season-ending reserve-non-football-illness list because of migraines.\nThe team announced the roster move Monday, a day after Harvin missed his second consecutive game since he began experiencing headaches. The move comes a month since the Bills lured the receiver out of retirement.\nHarvin appeared in two games this and finished with two catches for 6 yards, plus an 11-yard run.\nMore from FoxSports Antonio Cromartie reveals his junk food diet to Colin and Kristine | THE HERD Was Cam Newton a one-year wonder during his MVP season? | THE HERD Howie Long with high praise for the Raiders front office in 2016 | THE HERD Pereira: let's put cameras on goal lines, sidelines Harvin's health and readiness to play were in question after his season in Buffalo was cut short in October 2015 because of injuries to his right knee and hip.\nThe Bills took a gamble on signing Harvin to add experienced depth to an injury-depleted group of receivers.\nThe eighth-year player's career has been slowed by a series of injuries, including a lengthy history of migraine issues.\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

But I’ve had enough. This book and the images within them are a violation. \n5 out of the now 100s of released photos were used for what they were intended: an artful magazine shoot back in 2012. \nThese photos being used w/out my permission is an example of exactly the opposite of what I stand for: women choosing when and how they want to share their sexuality and bodies. \nTo be clear: I signed no release & was not paid. That said, the legal side of this is private and I would appreciate it if people waited to base their opinions on facts rather than speculation or assumptions. \nThe photos in question were taken in May 2012 and were used for a magazine spread. \nIf a person shares your nudes without your consent, I’m pretty sure they belong in jail. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": " 40   \nBRUSSELS (Dec 6): Web giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. \nThe companies will share 'hashes' – unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos – of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. \nTech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. \nYouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. \nBut many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. \nTwitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. \nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. \nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership. \nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. \nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.",

      "text": "Who We Are Piers Morgan in 'Awe' of Trump's Twitter ' Mastery ' I’m flabbergasted at how dumb the American media has been... in letting Trump play them in such an obvious way. 12.5.2016 Mark Tapson \nFrom our Credit Where Credit is Due Department: Daily Mail editor Piers Morgan, not exactly a fan of conservatives or Donald Trump, penned a column Monday in which he conceded that Trump's \"absolute mastery\" of social media and his skillful manipulation of the \"dumb\" news media contributed greatly to his presidential election victory. \nMorgan congratulated the mogul on his “direct” and “authentic” Twitter communication with voters, despite how “rude and offensive” his tweets may have been. Morgan said that these controversial and outrageous \"antics\" forced the media to stay focused on Trump in a perpetual cycle of coverage: \nI am in awe of his absolute mastery of the medium… I’m also flabbergasted at just how dumb much of the American media has been, and continues to be, in letting Trump play them in such an obvious way. Every time they throw their high-minded journalistic toys out of their strollers at one of his tweets, Trump wins. His brand thrives on the oxygen of TV coverage, newspaper headlines and the media’s faux outrage. It always has. \nMorgan went on to say that Trump’s social media style gave him an edge over competitor Hillary Clinton in that he came off as dynamic and incendiary while she remained reserved and “uninspiring.” Morgan also opined that now that he is the President-elect, Trump no longer needs to heed requests from the media or from “pompous New York and Washington elites” to act presidential. \n\"‘Why should I listen to any of them?’ [Trump] asks himself, ‘when I won by ignoring their advice throughout the election?’ I couldn’t agree more. The whole point of Trump’s tweets is that they are as far removed as humanly possible from the way any ‘normal’ president or politician would ever speak in public.” \nMorgan ended his column by encouraging Trump to keep on infuriating critics and never stop tweeting.

      "text": "Published December 06, 2016 Associated Press Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Lee Jae-yong, a vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. arrives for hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. South Korea's most powerful business leaders from Samsung, Hyundai Motor and six other companies face grilling as lawmakers probe their links to a corruption scandal involving South Korea's president and her confidante. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)  (The Associated Press) \nSEOUL, South Korea –   The heir to the Samsung empire and other tycoons took a public drubbing by lawmakers Tuesday over deep-rooted ties between politics and business that helped drive South Korea's economic ascent but are central to its political crisis.\nThe questioning on national TV of Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong, 48-year-old only son of the company's ailing chairman, and eight other business leaders was in response to prosecution claims that President Park Geun-hye allowed a corrupt confidante to pull government strings and extort big sums from companies.\nLee apologized repeatedly, without saying what he was apologizing for, and sought to distance himself from Park's friend and shadowy adviser Choi Soon-sil.\n\"There are many things that I myself feel embarrassed about and I regret that as we have disappointed the public with many disgraceful things,\" Lee said.\nThe bright expectations for Park when she took office nearly four years ago promising a \"happy era\" of entrepreneurship and greater equality have dimmed to deep disappointment as the country's biggest political scandal has unfolded.\nWith Park facing the threat of impeachment over the scandal, her successor stands to inherit an economy, Asia's fourth largest, that is struggling with no easy solutions on the horizon.\nHousehold debts have surged to a record high while the youth unemployment rate peaked at a record-high 12.5 percent in February and stood at 8.5 percent in October. The gap between wages for full-time, career jobs and contract work has widened, while quarterly growth has been below 1 percent for a full year.\nSouth Korea's two-biggest biggest brands, Samsung and Hyundai Motor, are seeing their profit sag.\nYounger South Koreans have taken to calling their country \"Hell Joseon,\" referring to an ancient feudal kingdom.\n\"What good is it for people in their 20s to have hopes for the future?\" Baek In-pum, 19, a student at a top university, said during a recent rally near the presidential office. \"People are struggling but that doesn't bring a better future. The future will also be full of pain.\"\nBaek said he doubts he could ever afford to buy his own home.\nOlder supporters of Park had hoped she would replicate the success of her father, Park Chung-hee, who is revered for guiding South Korea's rapid industrialization while he ruled as a military dictator from 1961-1979.\n\"I thought Park Geun-hye would be smart like her father. I feel terrible about how stupid she turned out to be,\" said Chae Woo-yeon, 85, who was holding a candle while selling blankets to fellow protesters at a rally that drew hundreds of thousands of people, the sixth straight weekend of demonstrations calling for Park's ouster.\n\"I never thought things would collapse like this,\" she said.\nOf course, Park Geun-hye inherited a more mature economy, lacking the dynamism of her father's era, at a more challenging time for global growth.\nSouth Korea is now the fastest aging society among developed countries, with an ultra-low birth rate. Many of the big businesses that drove an export boom subsidized by cheap government loans are struggling to adapt to the changing global landscape.\nPublic morale has deteriorated as Park's administration lurched from crisis to crisis. In 2014, 304 people, mostly teenagers on a school trip, died in a ferry accident. That disaster took a toll on consumption, leisure and tourism. A year later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome sapped consumer spending and business activities.\nPark's troubles have sharpened doubts over close ties between politicians and big, family-controlled businesses, known as chaebol.\nLocal media say prosecutors are looking into whether 53 businesses that donated funds to nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi received favors in return. Prosecutors also have raided Samsung and the nation's pension fund, reportedly scrutinizing its decision to back a 2015 merger of two Samsung companies.\n\"She gave the chaebol what they wanted,\" Kim Jae-kyun, a 51-year-old factory employee disgruntled over labor and wage reforms that he says have helped big industry at the expense of ordinary workers.\n\"My wages haven't gone up and I'm worried my children won't be able to find jobs when they graduate,\" Kim said during a recent demonstration.\nOnce the current political crisis passes, what will remain is the hard work of charting a future course for the economy.\nThe country's largest shipping line recently went bankrupt, while its biggest shipbuilder is undergoing a restructuring. The recent slowdown in China, the country's biggest export market, has been a further drag on growth.\nPark has managed to boost growth in the short-term by increased government spending and stimulating construction and property development.\nBut the 2.5 percent growth rate last year came at the cost of an unsustainable rise in household debt. And efforts to counter inequality by promoting inclusive growth and restructuring the labor market and the public sector provoked huge backlashes.\nOther policy initiatives like the \"creativity economy\" policy of promoting entrepreneurship likewise have made little headway, said Kim Sang-jo, executive director of a non-governmental business watchdog, Solidarity for Economic Reform.\nMeanwhile, \"The competitiveness of key industries appears to have collapsed,\" Kim said. \"South Korea's economy is in a crisis like a frog in slow boiling water.\"",

(AP) \nMatt Damon criticized \"outrageous\" stories in the era of fake news as he responded Tuesday to accusations that his role in the new China-Hollywood co-production \"The Great Wall\" should have gone to an Asian actor. \nSome critics have said Damon's casting as the lead character amounted to \"whitewashing,\" in which Caucasians are chosen for roles that actors of other ethnicities should play. \nIn an interview with The Associated Press, the American actor said he thinks of the term \"whitewashing\" as applying to Caucasian actors putting on makeup to appear to be of another race, as was common in the early days of film and television, when racism was overt. \n\"That whole idea of whitewashing, I take that very seriously,\" Damon said, using the example of the Irish-American actor Chuck Connors, who played the lead character in the 1962 film \"Geronimo,\" about the famed Apache chief. \nDamon, 46, plays an English mercenary in the upcoming $150 million adventure fantasy about a Chinese army battling monsters, helmed by acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou. \nThe movie's trailer sparked criticism in the U.S. that a white man had been chosen to play the lead in a film set in China meant to showcase Chinese culture. The furor came amid other accusations of a lack of diversity and opportunities for Asian actors in Hollywood. \nDamon questioned whether the critical stories on online news sites based on \"a 30-second teaser trailer\" would have existed before the era of fake news and headlines designed to make people click on them. \n\"It suddenly becomes a story because people click on it, versus the traditional ways that a story would get vetted before it would get to that point,\" said the star of the \"Bourne\" franchise. \nPeople fall for outrageous headlines, but \"eventually you stop clicking on some of those more outrageous things because you just realize there is nothing to the story when you get to it,\" Damon said. \n\"The Great Wall\" is the first movie made by Legendary East, the Chinese venture of Legendary Entertainment, a Hollywood studio now owned by Chinese real estate and theater chain developer Wanda Group. Other companies behind the movie include the state-owned China Film Group Corp.; Le Vision Pictures, a private film company affiliated with Chinese tech firm LeEco; and Hollywood's Universal Pictures. \nDamon and Zhang told the AP that because of the demands of the story, Damon's role — a mercenary who comes to China to steal gunpowder — was always intended to be European. \nDamon said he thought the criticism over his casting would subside \"once people see that it's a monster movie and it's a historical fantasy and I didn't take a role away from a Chinese actor ... it wasn't altered because of me in any way.\" \nThe film is the first Sino-Hollywood co-production and first English-language film for Zhang, the director of the romantic Kung Fu drama \"House of Flying Daggers\" and the opulent opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. \nIt also stars Pedro Pascal of \"Game of Thrones\" as Damon's sword-wielding partner in crime, Willem Dafoe and Hong Kong's Andy Lau. Jing Tian plays the female lead warrior. Eddie Peng of the boxing drama \"Unbeatable\" and Lu Han, a former boy band sensation, also appear. \nIn the movie, China's Great Wall has been built to keep out menacing, otherworldly creatures. The use of monsters and a hero saving the world are very much Hollywood techniques. \nZhang told the AP that the script took Hollywood seven years to develop. \"Although it was developed for commercial purposes, I felt there was room for me to play and put many elements of Chinese culture into it,\" he said. \nMost Chinese co-productions with the West have been box-office flops, but producers hope \"The Great Wall\" can show that big-budget Sino-Hollywood co-productions can work. \nHollywood is eager to work with Chinese actors and producers to appeal to the Chinese cinema-going market, which is expected to outgrow the current No. 1 market, North America, within the next two or three years. The Chinese government has long sought to project cultural influence abroad and hopes that \"The Great Wall\" will be an international blockbuster. \n\"This kind of cooperation is not an end, but a start,\" Zhang said. \"It is just like relations between countries; cooperation is always a good thing and confrontation is not.\" \nThe film debuts in Chinese cinemas on Dec. 16 followed by other countries, including the United States in February.

      "text": "EU Brexit negotiator puts time pressure on Britain Published December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Michel Barnier, Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations with the United Kingdom under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, speaks during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. (AP Photo/Thierry Monasse) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) \nBRUSSELS – Britain will have less than 18 months to negotiate its exit from the European Union once talks begin and won't be allowed to pick and choose what it likes, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator said Tuesday as he outlined his stance for the first time. \nMichel Barnier said formal procedures like parliamentary approvals across Europe will cut into the two-year period that Britain was expecting to have to negotiate the terms of its exit. \n\"Time will be short,\" Barnier said in Brussels. \"We are ready; keep calm and negotiate.\" \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has voiced her intention to invoke by the end of March Article 50 of the EU Treaty, the step that will officially kick off two years of exit talks. \nBut Barnier warned that that the effective negotiating time will be less. An agreement, he says, may have to be secured by October 2018 to get an agreement in place by March 2019 — two years on from the triggering of Article 50. Related News... Death threats and abuse for woman leading Brexit court fight \nMay could even struggle to stick to her timetable of invoking Article 50 after a court last month decided that Parliament had to give its backing to such a move. The government is contesting that ruling in the Supreme Court. Should it confirm that Parliament has to be involved, it could delay May's plans to begin the exit discussions. \nBarnier, who spoke in English and French, said that Britain can't \"cherry-pick\" what it likes about the EU, noting says that the single market and its four freedoms, such as the freedom of movement, are \"indivisible.\" \nThe Frenchman did not want to be drawn on the possibility of a transitional deal, in which Britain retains partial access for a period of time to ease its exit. \n\"It is for the British to say what kind of relationship they want and for the 27 EU states to define the future they want to build with them,\" he said. \"You can't do everything in 15 to 18 months of negotiations\" \nThe British government has been reluctant to reveal much about what it wants from the discussions and what sort of post-Brexit relationship it is looking for out of fear that it would weaken its hands in negotiations. \nEarlier, Britain's finance chief said all options remained on the table, including the possibility that the country may continue paying into EU coffers for access to the single market after leaving the bloc. \nIn a rare appearance for the regular meeting of the EU's 28 finance ministers, Philip Hammond stressed that he wants to minimize the economic disruption from Britain's exit. Leaving the EU single market would be a blow to many British businesses that would face new tariffs on trade. \n\"I think that it's in everybody's interest on both sides of the English Channel to have a smooth a process as possible that minimizes the threat to European financial stability and minimizes the disruption to the very many complex relationships that exist between European manufacturing businesses and their financing banks and so on in London,\" he said. \nThat, he conceded, may include ongoing contributions to the EU budget after so-called Brexit. \nIn terms of any future contributions to particular organizations, Hammond said \"we would look at what was on offer, we would look at the cost, and as you do with anything we would decide if that was a good deal or not.\" \nThough there's been a degree of understanding across European capitals about the constitutional arrangements that have to play out in Britain, there's also been discontent over the approach the British government has taken so far. One idea that's vexed politicians in Europe is that Britain can \"have its cake and eat it,\" — that it can still have access to the single market while applying stricter immigration controls. The EU stresses that the freedoms of trade, money and people are inseparable and a country cannot pick and choose. \nJeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who also chairs meetings of the 19 EU countries that use the euro, said that the proposals he's seen so far \"are incompatible with smooth and incompatible with orderly.\" \n\"It can be smooth and it can be orderly but it requires a different attitude on the part of the British government,\" he said. \"If the U.K. wants to have full access to the internal market they will have to accept the rules and regulations that go with that internal market.\" Advertisement",

      "text": "France raises risk level on bird flu to 'high' Published December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nPARIS – France raised to \"high\" the risk level across the country after the detection of several cases of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian flu strain in Southwestern France farms and in wild ducks in Northern France, the farm ministry said on Tuesday. More on this... Expect more bird flu cases in Europe and in the US, OIE says \nThe decision was also motivated by the \"rapid change in the... situation in France and in several European countries,\" the statement said. \nFrance, which has the largest poultry flock in the EU, is still recovering from a severe bird flu epidemic in southwestern France earlier this year which led to a total halting of duck and geese output in the region and import restrictions from trading partners.

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nOne of the reasons Donald Trump won the presidency is that millions of Americans now believe they are being conned on immigration. \nHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had absolutely no interest in being responsible on the issue of people traveling to the USA illegally or even protecting Americans from vicious foreign criminals already here. \nIn fact, the far-left wing of that party actually wants open borders and blanket amnesty for the undocumented living all across the country. \nNever mind that would create a dangerous security nightmare and run up far more government debt. \nLiberal zealotry sees America as a nation driven by white privilege and wants to flood the USA with new citizens, the fewer restraints the better. \nAnd it doesn't matter that Hillary Clinton might not be that extreme. \nShe put forth no vision on immigration other than the status quo, which has been a colossal failure. \nThus, Trump's tough guy approach to enforcing immigration law propelled his campaign despite the unending charges of racism that came his way \nSo now the question becomes, what is a fair policy in this most emotional of arenas? \nFor that we turn to Australia, a nation of about 24-million people but with a land mass almost exactly the same as America's. \nAnd we have 325 million people. \nSo there is plenty of room to roam Down Under. \nAustralia has a stone-cold policy on illegal entry. If you are caught, you are forcibly taken by the Aussie military to remote locations in the South Pacific, where you can either sit for years or be deported home. \nAustralia accepts less than 15,000 migrants a year on a humanitarian basis. \nRecently it announced it would take 12,000 Syrian refugees on top of that. \nBut even more recently the Obama administration said it would take more than 2,000 refugees currently languishing in the South Pacific, human beings that Australia refuses to bring to its mainland. \nMy question is, why not? \nWhy won't the Aussies take them? \nSurely, desperately poor people in South Asia, or Central America for that matter, deserve sympathy. \nDuring my time in El Salvador, I visited folks who were actually living in caves. Dogs in America have more comforts. \nJudeo-Christian philosophy compels its followers to embrace the poor, and it seems that rejecting asylum-seekers and migrants goes against that tenet. \nThus, the far-left demonizes those who call for restrictions on illegal immigration, saying they are bad people. \nThat's what the Sanctuary City movement is all about. \nBut you don't hear much condemnation of Australia and inside that country both political parties support the tough immigration laws. \nThere is little moral debate. \nBy the way, if Perth for example declared itself a Sanctuary City, it would have big trouble with the Aussie military, which as I stated actually enforces immigration law. \nAnd a general reports directly to the government in Canberra. \nAustralians generally believe that undocumented migrants destabilize the country and put themselves at grave physical risk by crossing oceans to get Down Under. \nAlso, Aussie politics have created a generous welfare state that works for a small population. \nThat entitlement culture would be overwhelmed and go broke if mass illegal immigration was accepted as it has been here in the USA. \nSimply put, Australians do not want the enormous disruption that immigration chaos causes. \nSo they are sending more than 2,000 poor souls here, folks they should assimilate. And Barack Obama is happy to take them. \nAre we chumps? \nOr are we the most compassionate nation on Earth? \nPresident Trump will have his hands full trying to figure out how to get things under control on the immigration front. \nHere is what Talking Points recommends. \nA moratorium on refugees for one year until Trump's new Homeland Security Department can reorganize and setup intense vetting procedures. \nRight now the federal government cannot properly investigate refugees who want to come here. The system is broken. \nAll undocumented people already here must register with the feds at their local post offices within six months. \nIt becomes a felony if they fail to do that and immediate deportation if they are caught. \nBy the way, we told you very early on in the presidential campaign that mass deportations would not take place if Donald Trump were elected president. \nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan confirmed that yesterday: \nPAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: “We’re not working on a deportation force. Here’s what we’re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws. He talked about criminal aliens. That’s just enforcing laws for people who came here illegally, who came and committed violent crimes. We should enforce those laws.” \nOnce the federal government knows how many undocumented people are here and their circumstance, a fair system of evaluating migrants can take place. \nOn the borders, all of those caught trying to enter illegally will be bussed back into Mexico or Canada after being fingerprinted. \nSecond offense -- six months in jail then another bus ride. \nA congressional mandate on how many foreign nationals should be allowed into America each year should be agreed upon. \nThat number should be generous, but legal papers have to be renewed each year and actual citizenship will have to be earned over a substantial period of time. \nA new law that suspends all federal transportation money to individual states that tolerate sanctuary cities must be passed. \nTexas is in the process of outlawing sanctuary cities, punishing them financially. \nEvery state should do that. \nAnd if California says no, finance your own infrastructure. Same with all other defiant states. \nFinally, build effective barriers along the southern border using the Army Corps of Engineers. \nThe barriers designed to stop the flow of people and drugs. \nEnough is enough. \nIf I could, I'd help every poor and abused person in the world. \nBut I can't. \nSo I do what I can without making things worse by supporting policies that hurt the country at large. \nAustralia has figured this out. \nWe can, too. \nAnd that's \"The Memo\". \nBill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET) , the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

      "text": "Published December 06, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Actors dressed like gladiators are now banned outside of Rome's famed attractions.  (Reuters File) \n“Gladiator” fans who have been saving up for a trip to see Rome's ancient sites may be a little disappointed by the city's recent decision to ban playactors dressed as ancient, sword-wielding warriors from many popular attraction. \nThe ban, issued by mayor Virginia Raggi who says she received several complaints, targets anyone portraying a historical subject (centurions are specifically mentioned) in pictures or videos in exchange for cash, The Local reported.\nCARDINALS FIGHT PLAN TO OPEN MCDONALD'S IN VATICAN CITY \nAnd it’s not just the gladiators that have been forced to take their cos-play elsewhere. Another regulation is geared toward rickshaws, banning any vehicle used for transporting people and using an electric motor. Vehicles that are pedal-powered are now also forbidden in the Eternal City.\nAnyone disobeying the new law will be fined up to 400 euros (about $430).\nRaggi says her office received complaints of actors  overcharging or even robbing unsuspecting visitors. According to the The Local, some of the more successful costumed actors can make up to $13,000 a month posing with tourists. \nThe move is necessary, local authorities said, in order to “protect public order” and to maintain the city's “cultural, artistic and monumental heritage.”\nITALIAN BEACHES CRACK DOWN ON SPOT-SAVING TOURISTS \nRome tried to crack down on the unauthorized gladiators in November last year, when the city commissioner introduced an initial ban. But that ban expired on Nov. 30, prompting a quick return of the gladiators to the city. \nThe new regulation, which is valid until the end of July 2017, applies to the entire city, but particularly \"the historic center and major tourist attractions.”",

      "text": "Japanese leader Abe won't apologize at Pearl Harbor Published December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won't apologize for Japan's attack when he visits the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor later this month, the government spokesman said Tuesday. \nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that \"the purpose of the upcoming visit is to pay respects for the war dead and not to offer an apology.\" \nAbe announced late Monday that he would have a summit meeting with President Barack Obama in Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor. He will be the first Japanese leader to go to the site of the Japanese attack that propelled the United States into World War II. \nThe unexpected announcement came two days before the 75th anniversary of the attack and six months after Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima for victims of the U.S. atomic bombing of that city at the end of the same war.| \n\"We must never repeat the tragedy of the war,\" Abe said. \"I would like to send this commitment. At the same time, I would like to send a message of reconciliation between Japan and the U.S.\" \nThe White House confirmed that Obama and Abe would visit the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 27. It said \"the two leaders' visit will showcase the power of reconciliation that has turned former adversaries into the closest of allies, united by common interests and shared values.\" Related Image Expand / Contract Japanese PM Shinzo Abe (AP) \nDefense Secretary Ash Carter, on an official trip to Japan, said he would tell Abe at a meeting later Tuesday how pleased Obama and the U.S. are. \nThe announcement of the summit comes as Japan worries about the direction of U.S. foreign policy under Obama's successor, Donald Trump. \nTsuneo Watanabe, a senior research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, said that together with Obama's visit to Hiroshima, the Pearl Harbor visit will complete the reconciliation process and help smooth bilateral relations under any administration. \n\"Historical disputes tend to be brought up when relations become thorny ... but once you put them behind and move on, it makes a difference if there is any negative sentiment in the future,\" he said. \nBut Koichi Nakano, a professor of international politics at Tokyo's Sophia University, said the Pearl Harbor visit and Abe's commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance are tantamount to \"giving a blank check to Trump\" despite the uncertainty over bilateral relations under his administration. \nMore than 2,300 U.S. servicemen died in the aerial attack, which will be marked Wednesday at Pearl Harbor with a remembrance ceremony and a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., when the Japanese planes hit their first target. \nThree and a half years later, the war came to an end after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and on Nagasaki three days later. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15.",

      "title": "Meet LiLou, San Francisco airport's first therapy pig for stressed fliers",
      "text": "By Katherine LaGrave\nPublished December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print LiLou models one of her tutu outfits. (Courtesy San Francisco International Airport)\nTraveling can be stressful—one needn't look further than lengthy TSA lines, meltdown-inducing delays, and overpriced tuna sandwiches to know just what we're talking about.\nIn an attempt to help travelers quell some of that anxiety, San Francisco International Airport (SFO) has today introduced their latest team member: a small, spotted Juliana pig named LiLou who is famous enough to already have her own Instagram account, thankyouverymuch.\nLiLou is adorable, sure, but she's also making history. She's the first pig to be certified in the Animal Assisted Therapy Program of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the first non-canine addition to the Wag Brigade, a group of 22 trained therapy dogs that roam SFO's terminals with “Pet Me!” vests.\nThough she'll roam the terminals like the other members of the brigade, Lilou is not just a one-trick...er, pig: She also performs a variety of show-stopping moves, including \"greeting people with her snout or a wave, twirling and standing up on her back hooves, and playing a toy piano\"—even, USA Today reports, followed by a post-performance bow.\nMore from Conde Nast Traveler The 30 Most Terrifying Places on Earth\nThe Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities Around the World\nThe Best Small Towns in America\nThe Most Beautiful Travel Destinations of All Time\nSFO isn't the only airport using animals to help treat travel stress.\nMore than 30 U.S. airports have \"therapy dog\" programs, while others, like Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, have been bringing in miniature therapy horses since last May.\nLooking for LiLou in particular? There's no set schedule as to when she'll show up, but airport spokesman Doug Yakel said SFO expects her to terminal-trot about once a month.(At present, a maximum of three canine members of the Wag Brigade can be found on duty in the terminals every day of the week.)\nIf LiLou's Instagram is any indication, she may even be in disguise: In the past few months, the pig has dressed up as a wrapped gift, nurse, pilot, ballerina, and butterfly.\nAt JFK, Animals Get Their Own Bathrooms",

      "text": "Published December 06, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print (iStock)\nSchool lunch food isn't usually considered gourmet cuisine but cafeterias in New York City may start getting graded-- just like restaurants.\nElected officials in the Big Apple want cafeterias in city schools to post letter grades just like restaurants in the city, reports DNAInfo. Those ratings are intended to reveal if the kitchens are kept up to code in terms of safety and sanitary conditions.\nState senators from the Independent Democratic Committee (IDC) say their proposed legislation would require the Health Department-- which already inspects school cafeterias-- to make their inspections public by giving letter grades to the schools. Those schools would then be required to post the kitchen grade in an area that is publicly visible to kids and any visiting parents.\nNEARLY 30 PERCENT OF LOS ANGELES FOOD TRUCKS FACE SANITATION PROBLEMS, REPORT FINDS\nThe legislative push comes after new City Health Department records, obtained by the IDC, showed unsanitary conditions at 13 percent of school cafeterias surveyed. In the last fiscal year, 395 out of 2,976 completed inspections resulted in a sanitation grade of B or worse, the New York Daily News reported.\nOut of those reviewed, 320 cafeterias had 442 mouse-related health violations, 136 schools had 155 fly-related violations and, in four schools, evidence of rats was discovered.\nSchool cafeterias in Brooklyn were the most affected and they also led in the amount of violations for mice, flies, roaches and pests.\n“Many young people have their basic meals at the school cafeteria ... and I think it’s extremely important we know how clean or how dirty those cafeterias are,” State Senator Jeff Klein, who heads the IDC, said amid the report's release.\n“We expect our kids to get A’s and we should expect the cafeterias that feed them to work just as hard to make the grade,” an IDC report said. “It begs the question why the city is more transparent about the performance of private restaurants than with its own performance in keeping those kitchens we utilize to feed students clean.”\nCHIPOTLE'S STRUGGLES CONTINUE AS COMPETITORS MOVE IN\nBut there's good news for the majority of kids who eat meals at school cafeterias. If graded, 86 percent of cafeterias in the study would have received an A under the standards the Health Department applies to restaurants currently.\nHealth Department officials say they are are reviewing the proposed legislation and hope to to \"work closely together [with the Department of Education] to correct violations quickly.\"",

Do you think the United States can rip up the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal)? Do you think we and our nation will let him do that?” Rouhani said in a speech at the University of Tehran. \nRouhani added, \"Some man is elected in the U.S. whatever plans he has, it will be revealed later. Yes, he may desire many things. He may desire to weaken the nuclear deal. He may desire to rip up the deal. Do you suppose we will allow this?\" \nThe Iranian leader’s remarks were the latest attempt by the country to calm concerns over the future of the deal in the wake of Trump’s election.",

      "text": "Published December 06, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print (Screenshot from www.spectacles.com)\nSnapchat is a known showcase for tidbits from life, but for some users of the the new Snapchat Spectacles, it presents a whole new opportunity: the chance to shoot and share one's sex life.\nA recent report by Mashable profiled several Spectacles owners whose names were changed at their request for privacy. Mashable said 26 Spectacle owners chimed in, including, “several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex.”\nSNAPCHAT's SPECTACLES HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO SHOW UP ON EBAY FOR CRAZY PRICES\nSome users said they knew from the outset that Spectacles would make a great bedroom accessory. One told Mashable, \"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex.\"\nSnapchat, which boasts 150 million daily users, introduced the Spectacles this past summer to limited accessibility. Users with racy intentions said in the article that the potential to film themselves in the throes at different angles and views was seen as an exciting possibility.\nHowever, videos shot using the accessory are not automatically sent to the user’s feed, but go instead to a designated Spectacles tab. Snapchat also offers a “My Eyes Only” feature to the app, which requires a PIN code before content can be accessed.\nTHE CRITICS HAVE SPOKEN: SNAPCHAT'S GLASSES ARE A HIT\nSome users said Spectacles as a sexcessory wasn't without its hang ups. Spectacles only record up to 30 seconds of video after a button is pressed three times. Others said that the sunglasses aspect of Spectacles made intimacy feel impersonal.\nDespite that, one user told Mashable, \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\"\nSo, at least there's that.",

Related Image \nPEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO SMELL LIKE KFC'S FRIED CHICKEN \nTwo of the wackiest items—which have since sold out—are actually beauty products. \n\"Colour de Cheetos Bronzer\" is a bright orange blusher while Cheeteau Perfume has a scent that one lucky tester described as “Cheetos crumbs sprinkled on top of vanilla ice cream.” Neither the bronzer nor perfume are edible. \nThe most extravagant gift featured in this year’s catalog was an 18 karat yellow gold ring and earring set with orange sapphires and both black and white diamonds. “You will be the envy of the universe with Eye of the Cheetah from the Chestora Collection,” reads the item’s description. \nThe set sold for $20,000 within a few days of being posted online. A representative for Cheetos told FoxNews.com that the brand made just one set this year. \nMAN SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR USING CHEETOS TO START FIRE \nThough many of the items are now gone, some products have appeared on eBay (though their authenticity is not guaranteed)-- at exorbitantly marked up prices. The Onesie, for example, that originally sold online for $39.99 is now going for up to $349 on the auction site. \nBut there’s one particularly unusual gift still in stock that is sure to guarantee a more colorful bathroom experience. \nSix rolls of bright orange “Toilet Paw-per” can be yours for just $7.99.

Multiple knives and guns, including a shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle, were seized from his home. \nVandagriff, 24, of Frisco, was found burned and dismembered in a plastic kiddie pool in Acorn Wood Park on Lake Grapevine on Sept. 14. \nLOUISIANA MAN WHO SHOT EX-NFL PLAYER JOE MCKNIGHT CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER \nAccording to police, Bryan met Vandagriff at a local bar the night before she turned up dead. Security footage showed the two meeting at a bar in Denton, where she attended Texas Woman’s University. They were later seen at a different bar before leaving together around 9:45 p.m. \nHer body was found the next morning when firefighters responded to a fire at the park. A witness saw a man standing over the fire before leaving, the arrest warrant said. \nVideo surveillance also showed Bryant buying a shovel at 4:41 a.m. at a local Walmart, and there is evidence at his home that someone had tried to dig a hole in the ground. \nA day after her body was found, a mysterious tweet appeared on Vandagriff’s Twitter account that read, “Never knew I could feel like this.” \nAuthorities at the time said they were investigating the tweet as part of the investigation against Bryant. \nThe Tarrant County medical examiner’s office listed her cause of death as homicidal violence. \nBryant remains in the Tarrant County Jail with bail set at $1 million. The Star Telegram reported he has a court date scheduled for Dec. 14. Advertisement",

      "text": "Court filing: In Army's eyes, Chelsea Manning still a man   Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print FILE - In this undated file photo provided by the U.S. Army, Pfc. Chelsea Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick. A military prison psychologist is refusing to recommend that Manning’s gender be officially changed to female on her Army employee-benefits file. Lawyers for the transgender solider imprisoned for leaking classified information made the assertion in a federal court filing Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in Washington. (U.S. Army via AP, File) (The Associated Press) \nA military prison psychologist has refused to recommend that Chelsea Manning's gender be changed to female in her Army service record, complicating the transgender soldier's quest to wear a feminine hairstyle at the men's prison where she is serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified information, according to a court document. \nManning's American Civil Liberties Union lawyers disclosed the decision in a filing Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The document says the chief of the Mental Health Division at the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, prison declined Manning's Nov. 4 request to update her gender in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. The filing says Manning made the request \"based on her having achieved stability in her female gender.\" \nThe document doesn't say why psychologist Ellen Galloway refused. Army spokesman Wayne Hall declined to comment Tuesday, citing medical privacy laws. \nManning has tried to commit suicide behind bars at least twice, in July and October, according to her lawyers. In a Nov. 8 application asking President Barack Obama to commute her sentence to time served, Manning wrote, \"I am living through a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss and depression,\" citing her treatment at Leavenworth. \nThe White House confirmed Tuesday that it had received an ACLU letter supporting the commutation request but declined to comment further. \nThe court document filed Monday is a status report from both sides on Manning's lawsuit seeking a court order allowing her to wear her hair longer than 2 inches, the maximum length prison standards allow for men. \nIn the report, Manning's lawyers say a new Army policy enabling soldiers to officially change genders does not provide a way for Manning to do so unless she is released, so that she can obtain the required documents, or receives transgender surgery. \nManning's lawyers said in September that the Army has agreed to provide the surgery. U.S. Justice Department lawyers say in the status report that the government is assembling a team to assess Manning's current treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments. \nThe Army private formerly known as Bradley Manning was convicted in a 2013 court-martial of leaking more than 700,000 secret military and State Department documents to WikiLeaks while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Manning said she leaked the documents to raise awareness about the war's impact on innocent civilians. \n__ \nAssociated Press Writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

      "text": "13-year-old girl pleads guilty to shooting Missouri couple   Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nCLAYTON, Mo. – A 13-year-old girl who shot and critically wounded a couple in their 70s at a suburban St. Louis beauty supply store has pleaded guilty in family court. \nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the girl will be turned over to the juvenile system for at least three years and will get counseling during that time. \nThe guilty plea and sentence were announced Tuesday by the St. Louis County NAACP, which had argued that the girl should not be tried as an adult. \nThe crime happened in July at Kings Beauty Supply in Bellefontaine Neighbors. Police say the girl had been kicked out of the store earlier in the day for stealing hair extensions. She shot the couple — the parents of the store owner — after returning later in the day. \nThe girl's father and an aunt were at the NAACP news conference announcing the court action. They said they are happy the girl will get counseling and are praying for the victims. \nThe girl's father said he had tried to get his daughter help before the shooting, when he noticed peer pressure from the streets taking hold over her. The father said he doesn't know where his daughter got the gun used in the crime. The aunt didn't know either. \nNAACP President Adolphus Pruitt said he hopes the region can do a better job helping young people before they turn to violence. \nThe victims' daughter had wanted the girl to be tried as an adult, but a judge instead decided she should remain in the family court system. \n___ \nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com Advertisement",

      "text": "Twitter / Facebook / RSS \nBoeing stocks tumbled Tuesday after president-elect Donald Trump tweeted about canceling a $4bn Air Force One order. But it was a typical Trumpism: the number is plucked out of nowhere , and Boeing was forced to publicize the fact it's only got the U.S. Government on the hook for $170m, and that the two planes, if ordered, would be $850m each. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,\" he said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe president-elect's most recent financial disclosure form, filed in May and detailing his 2015 holdings, showed that the Manhattan billionaire owned between $50,001 and $100,000 worth of stock in Boeing, a purchase he announced on Twitter in 2013. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said Tuesday morning that Trump sold all of his stocks last June. \nMiller added that the exact details of Trump's desire to cancel the Boeing order would be dealt with after he is inaugurated next month. \nBoeing's stocks rebounded later in the morning as it became apparent Trump was saying untrue things. \n(Maybe he doesn't want to fly on it. Same as not wanting to live in the White House.) ",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Donald Stratton (Courtesy of the author) \nEditor's note: The following column is adapted from \" All the Gallant Men: An American Sailor's Firsthand Account of Pearl Harbor. \" \nI was aboard the USS Arizona on the morning of December 7, 1941. The courage I saw in our men was astonishing. \nThose gallant sailors fought back however they could. Pilots tried to locate airplanes that were still operable, but only a few managed to get in the air and into the fight. \nGunners found themselves with only the ammunition in their ready boxes, with the rest of the munitions they so desperately needed locked up belowdecks. \nWhat happened on December 7, 1941, if it didn’t kill us, changed us forever. President Roosevelt was right to call it “a date that will live in infamy.” But for my fellow survivors and me, it also is alive in memory, like shrapnel left embedded in our brains because the surgeon thought it too dangerous to operate. These memories lie within me, forever still and silent, like the men entombed in the Arizona. \nIf the bullets ran out, they raced to another gun, often one that had a fallen sailor crumpled beneath it. \nThe rest of the men fought back with whatever weapons were at hand, shooting at the streaking Japanese Zeros with lightweight machine guns, rifles, even pistols. \nActs of individual heroism could be witnessed everywhere you looked. Men being strafed as they brought boxes of ammo up ladders to the antiaircraft guns. Other men carrying their wounded buddies to safety, trying desperately to stanch their bleeding. Still others in small boats, navigating through the fiery sea, pulling oil-soaked sailors from the water. Many putting out fires on board their ships. All the while these men were dodging enemy bullets that were cutting everything around them to shreds, including their fellow sailors. \nWe were not extraordinary men, those of us who fought on that infamous date in December seventy-five years ago. \nTruth be told, most of us had enlisted because there were precious few jobs to be found where we lived. The Great Depression had pulled the pockets of the economy inside out, leaving little more than a lint’s worth of hope for the young men entering the workforce. Most of us who enlisted did so because we needed a job. \nPearl Harbor changed that. A surge of patriotism swept the country, and everyone threw themselves into the war effort. \nLove for country welled up inside seemingly every American, coming out in the songs we sang, in the movies produced, in the newspaper articles that were written. \nWe were ordinary men. What was extraordinary was the country we loved. We loved who she was, what she stood for. We loved her for what she meant to us, and for what she had given to us, even in those meager times. \nIt didn’t matter where you hailed from, whether you came from the mountains or the prairies, a sprawling city or a small coastal town: you loved her. \nWe all did—more than the states we left behind, our homes, the careers we gave up. As too many would prove, we loved her more than our very lives. \nThe battleships and destroyers at Pearl Harbor were named after states from where some of us had been raised. Ohio. Tennessee. Oklahoma. Maryland. California. West Virginia. Utah. Nevada. Those vessels moored in that harbor so far from home reminded us where we came from. \nThe battleship I served my country on was the USS Arizona. \nThe men on that ship were drawn from different parts of the country. Some came from family farms in the Midwest. Some were fresh from the steel mills of Chicago. Others joined from dirt-poor towns in the Deep South. A few arrived with book smarts from places foreign to the rest of us—Annapolis, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt. \nThey came from different religious backgrounds. Some were Catholics, some Protestants, some Jews. Others weren’t sure what they were. A few didn’t care. After all, many were still teenagers with their whole lives stretching before them. There would be plenty of time for religion, later. \nThey came from different ethnic backgrounds, too. Their accents betrayed them. \nThere was a Jastrzemski from Michigan. \nAn O’Bryan from Massachusetts. \nA Schroeder from New Jersey. \nA Giovenazzo from Illinois.",

      "text": "60 feared drowned in Yemen after boat disappears Published December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nSANAA, Yemen – The Yemeni government says 60 nationals are feared drowned in the Arabian Sea, after their vessel went missing for days. \nIn a statement, the internationally recognized government said Tuesday the vessel disappeared some 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the remote Socotra island five days ago. It was heading from the southern province of Hadramawt, carrying women and children among others. \nAnother statement by the governor of Hadramawt Ahmed ben-Break said that two were rescued and that the search is still ongoing. \nThe government has urged the Saudi-led coalition — which is backing the government in its fight against the Houthi rebels — for help. \nFlights between Yemeni cities and the island were suspended since March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition began its campaign, by closing the air space of Yemen.

It was unclear if the women were related to the children. \nThe children were referred to child welfare agencies for care. \nIt is not illegal in Mexico for children to beg, but it is illegal for adults to keep the money they make.

      "text": "Airing your opinion on Brexit, Trump or anything political on Twitter is a bit like throwing a boulder into a paddling pool - it takes a long time to settle down and even when it does, what you're left with is dark and gungy. Professional 'things you shouldn't say' sayer Katie Hopkins drew the ire of singer Ellie Goulding after tweeting about the Italian referendum and the potential effects on the stability of the EU. The two traded barbed insults about looking like a dog and having a pitchy singing voice before Goulding challenged Hopkins to a boxing match. Here's how the argument went down: ITALEXIT!!

One fan tweeted to Goulding saying that Hopkins' previous promises to run naked down Oxford Street and move to America have yet to be fulfilled. True https://t.co/qeDrUx3jnr — Ellie Goulding (@elliegoulding) December 6, 2016 FYI, the photo Hopkins posted of her sewed-up head related to her operation to remove a lesion that caused her to have epileptic fits. The 'trollumist' previously ended up with the police reporting her to Twitter over one of her incredibly insensitive tweets about the horrific Camber Sands deaths. This Morning host Phillip Schofield also recently blasted Hopkins as 'nasty and wicked and cruel', and said that was why the show let her go. And that's enough about Katie Hopkins for one article; let' s all have a listen to some Ellie Goulding, shall we? This is a pretty darn good song, isn't it? And it was put to great use in Bridget Jones' Baby, which was a really nice, warm-hearted film that everyone seemed to love. Can Universal hurry up and rush release it on DVD? 2016 has been a pretty terrible year and we could all do with something nice and positive to watch on repeat. entertainment and tech news? @digitalspy Twitter account and you're all set.",

      "text": "Published December 06, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Country entertainer Naomi Judd arrives at the 35th annual Academy of Country Music Awards May 3, 2000 at the Universal Amphitheater in Universal City.  (Reuters) \nNaomi Judd is opening up years after the country star left the public eye to focus on her health. Now the \"Love Can Build a Bridge\" singer is speaking out about her battle with \"severe depression.\"\n\"What I've been through is extreme. My final diagnosis was severe depression,\" Judd told Robin Roberts on  \"Good Morning America\"  Tuesday. \"[I say I am] treatment resistant because they tried me on every single thing they had in their arsenal. It really felt like, if I live through this I want someone to be able to see that they can survive.\"\nJudd, 70, was one half of the country music duo The Judds along with her now 52-year-old daughter Wynonna Judd. The mother-daughter singers achieved a lot of success but faced their fair share of struggles along the way.\n\"They see me in rhinestones, you know, with glitter in my hair, that really is who I am,\" she shared. \"But then I would come home and not leave the house for three weeks, and not get out of my pajamas, and not practice normal hygiene. It was really bad.\"\nShe eventually found her path to \"radical acceptance\" and details her journey in her new memoir \"River of Time: My Descent into Depression and How I Emerged with Hope.\"\n\"Every day I exercised. I would walk up to Ashley [Judd's] house … and I would holler at her from her front step,” she said of her youngest daughter. \"If she was home she’d come out and give me a hug. Ashley and I are so stinking much alike. We have the same mannerisms. We both read a whole lot. We both love new places. There’s such similarities.\"\nAs for Judd and her daughter Wynonna? They're on a \"break.\"\n\"I love her but there are just times we need a break from each other,” Judd said. \"We’re still a little estranged from each other. And that happens with mother, daughters. If she sees this, and I hope she does, ’cause the smartest thing is for all of us to feel known, no matter what’s going on. Be truthful. I think she’ll say, ‘Good for you, Mom, for finally being willing to talk about the bad stuff.'\"",

      "text": "Published December 6, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nTrump’s staff picks reveal an interesting mix of priorities. \nBy ROBERT VERBRUGGEN | The American Conservative \nTrump was not exactly a model of clarity during the campaign. He was certainly consistent on his core issues—primarily immigration and trade—but he kept everyone guessing as to what his other priorities would be. At last, though, his cabinet and staff selections are giving us some major hints as to what he’ll try to accomplish.\nMy TAC colleague Daniel Larison has closely monitored Trump’s foreign-policy picks, wondering if Trump’s “bomb the sh** out of ’em” hawkishness or his “stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us” non-interventionism will win out in the end. There’s a similar question on the domestic front: will Trump govern as a populist or a boring old mainstream conservative?\nThe answer appears to be both. The populists will win on some issues and the conservatives will win on others, creating a fascinating mix of the two approaches that might or might not work on any number of levels. Trump may keep everyone happy at once, or he may stoke feuds within his own administration, alienate the GOP Congress, and fall out with the working-class voters who were so crucial to his election.\nRead the full story at the American Conservative→",

These things tickle our various fancies (specifically: social media, organization, every other fancy) and so we were really excited when we read the list of the top most-tweeted GIFs on Twitter , because it combines ALL OF THESE THINGS. If you follow Ryan on Twitter at all , you know that he’s hilarious. Dude could seriously have a second career as a comedian . We’d go see his standup (and it has nothing to do with his face or his abs SHUT UP don’t question our motives, they’re pure), that’s for sure. But this might be his crowning achievement… Ryan Reynolds NAILED the #1 most tweeted GIF of 2016 spot with this hilarious GIF of his wife, Blake Lively. Actual footage from the first date with my wife. Tried to surprise her and totally forgot I was a fucking shark. pic.twitter.com/7AxuauYH2e — Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) June 24, 2016 We hope that Ryan gives an acceptance speech, or something, and that somebody’s preparing him a trophy, because he deserves the trophy almost as much as we deserve the acceptance speech. The second most tweeted GIF makes perfect sense — it hits the recent Pokémon Go release, alongside our generations nostalgia for times past, and turns it into an am zing animation we can’t stop watching.",

      "text": "Bana Alabed, Twitter’s Child Witness to the Battle for Aleppo By , December 6, 2016 Bana Alabed, a seven-year-old in the Syrian city of Aleppo, whose mother has been tweeting about her while under siege. Credit Photograph by Thaer Mohammed / AFP / Getty Bana Alabed is a seven-year-old Syrian girl with outsized optimism and lustrous brown hair that tumbles past her waist. She enjoys reading about dinosaurs, practicing English with her mom, and playing with her two little brothers, Mohamed and Noor. She recently lost a tooth, but the tooth fairy never came, because she lives under siege, in eastern Aleppo. “The tooth fairy is afraid of the bombing here,” she said. “It run away to its hole. When the war finishes, it will come.” Bana’s thoughts are broadcast by her mother, Fatemah, on a Twitter account that she launched earlier this year. It has already amassed more than two hundred thousand followers. Many news organizations published stories on the earliest tweets and videos, and a Danish reporter brought up Bana’s case during an in-person interview with Syria’s President, Bashar al-Assad, who dismissed it as “a game of propaganda.” But the tweets that Fatemah attributes to Bana, though they call for peace, are rarely focussed on politics; they simply present the mild joys and daily tragedies of a child living under siege. In late November, Bana sat at home, watching one of the Harry Potter movies. She liked it, and now, as the temperature plummeted in Aleppo and her neighborhood ran out of food, she wanted to read the books, to fully immerse herself in Harry Potter’s world. Her mother typed a note to the author J. K. Rowling, inquiring about the books, and posted it to Twitter. “We don’t have it here,” Fatemah wrote. “How do we get?” Rowling quickly noticed Fatemah’s appeal. “I would love to send Bana a book,” she replied. But smuggling paperbacks past government checkpoints was foolish to attempt, and impossible to achieve, and so the author resigned herself to sending Bana “lots and lots of love.” Rowling spent the rest of the morning thinking about Bana , who was surrounded by pro-Assad militants and looking after her dolls as neighboring buildings collapsed around her. The U.N. has consistently failed to secure Assad’s permission to deliver food, blankets, and medical supplies to rebel-held areas, and, in recent weeks, Assad’s forces, backed by Iran, Hezbollah, other Shiite militias, and Russian air power, have taken back several neighborhoods in eastern Aleppo. The international community has spent nearly six years watching Syria transform into a vortex of killing and maiming and displacement, but remains unwilling to do anything more than issue verbal condemnations of the constant, flagrant violations of international law. (I have previously written about the geopolitical obstacles to achieving justice, and their implications.) Looking at Aleppo, it is as if Russian and Syrian forces are using the Rome Statute —the founding document of the International Criminal Court, which defines war crimes and crimes against humanity—not as a list of prohibitions but as a manual for how most efficiently to destroy and humiliate the opposition. Last week, after blowing up every remaining hospital in eastern Aleppo, which is still home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, pro-Assad warplanes dropped leaflets over the city. “If you do not leave these areas quickly, you will be annihilated,” the papers said. The only way to leave, however, was to walk into government areas, and many residents worried that they would be detained and tortured if they did so. The leaflets continued, “You know that everyone has given up on you. They left you alone to face your doom.” Soon after Fatemah’s exchange with Rowling, the author’s agent, Neil Blair, arranged to send Bana digital copies of all the Harry Potter books, to read on her mother’s smartphone. Bana was overjoyed. Sitting on a couch and dressed in a white sweater, with an oversized bow perched in her hair, Bana recorded a video for Rowling, expressing her gratitude in heavily accented, sing-song English. “Hello, my friend Jo, how are you?” she said. “I started reading your books. Thank you very, very much. I love you!” Hours after receiving the e-books, Fatemah posted a photo of the corpse of one of Bana’s friends, who had been killed that night in an explosion. The dead girl wore a pink sweater, and had blood seeping out from the back of her head and pooling in her matted, debris-filled hair. Her eyes were closed, her tiny face covered in dust. “Oh dear world, I am crying tonight,” Fatemah wrote on Bana’s behalf. The next hour, as the bombs continued to fall, Bana crouched in a corner, wedged between a bed and an interior wall. “Someone, save me,” she said, staring into the camera as Fatemah filmed. A few days later, their house was hit by an air strike. Bana suffered a mild injury, but survived. The building collapsed completely. Fatemah posted a photo of the rubble, all dust and broken concrete, with twisted railings protruding from a neighboring balcony. “My beloved dolls died in the bombing of our house,” Bana said. “I am very sad but happy to be alive.” Bana’s English video statements often have a scripted quality, as if she is being coached by her mother to communicate her thoughts in a language that she is only beginning to learn. Once, Fatemah posted a video of Bana traipsing through rubble; her guileless face and long pigtails, cinched with pink bows, presented a shocking, cinematic, and seemingly deliberate contrast to the devastation around her. Such moments have invited skeptics to question how, for example, Fatemah charges her phone to post videos when electricity lines so rarely function in her part of Aleppo. (In reply, she wrote, “I recharge my phone with solar panels.”) Others on Twitter question Fatemah’s agenda, accusing her of using Bana’s appeal to serve her own ends. To this, Fatemah insisted in a recent post, “Our agenda is just for Aleppo civilians like us [to be] evacuated from the battlefield. Nothing else.” The visibility of Bana’s account has made Fatemah a target of online vitriol and cruel harassment by pro-Assad trolls. They routinely taunt Fatemah and her children, delighting in their suffering and imagining the various ways that they may be tortured and murdered after being captured by the regime. One person created a fake account in Fatemah’s name, portraying her as an Al Qaeda sympathizer. (After the real Fatemah urged her followers to report the imposter to Twitter Support, the account was suspended.) In the past week, Bana’s account has become especially bleak, devoid of the optimism that had previously characterized it. “Hello, my friends, how are you?” Bana, now homeless, said in a recent video. “I am on the run now. I am fear being killed. Please save us. Thank you!” Fatemah, in desperation, wrote that she and Bana had received death threats, and appealed to President Obama to find some way to evacuate them. The next day, she simply posted, “We give up on life.” Bana got sick, and Fatemah, writing again on her behalf, posted, “I have no medicine, no home, no clean water. This will make me die even before a bomb kill me.” Fatemeh has started drafting each tweet as if it is her last, signing off with goodbyes to this world. On Sunday, Syrian government troops captured Bana’s neighborhood. “We are sure the army is capturing us now,” Fatemah wrote. “We will see each other another day, dear world. Bye.” Then she deleted Bana’s account, leaving her followers to wonder about their fate. Yesterday afternoon, Fatemah reactivated the account. I had spent several days communicating with her in private, and, seeing it back online, I asked whether she and her kids had managed to escape the siege while the account had gone dark. Her reply was just two words: “Still trapped.” \nBen Taub is a contributing writer for newyorker.com. ",

      "title": "2016’s top most followed Twitter accounts in Singapore",
      "text": "Twitter is one the fastest ways to keep your eyes on current affairs.\nIn fact, many Singaporeans still do used the platform to keep up to date, debate and join in global conversations. As such, here's a list of the most followed accounts, top ten hashtag trends and the golden moment (and even that golden tweet) in 2016.\n2016 most followed accounts on Twitter: \nNo. \nName \nTwitter Account \nFollowers as of Dec 5, 2016 \n1\nSingapore Airlines\n@SingaporeAir \n527,300\n2\nWil Tay\n@Wiltay \n441,800\n3\nLee Hsien Loong\n@leehsienloong \n438,800\n4\nSo Singaporean\n@SoSingaporean \n366,500\n5\nNaomi Neo\n@NaomiNeo_ \n341,800\n6\nXiaxue\n@xiaxue \n341,600\n7\nNational Environment Agency\n@NEAsg \n322,800\n8\nmrbrown\n@mrbrown \n319,800\n9\nJoseph Prince\n@JosephPrince \n318,200\n10\nSMRT Corporation\n@SMRT_Singapore \n311,300\nThe top 10 hashtag trends in Singapore for 2016: \nThe top hashtag trends showcase the Twitter conversations that had the most Singaporean Twitter users in 2016. While #Rio2016 was celebrated both locally and globally on Twitter, there was nothing more viral this year for Singaporeans on Twitter than #PokemonGO. Beyond that, Singaporeans also participated in global Twitter conversations around pop culture, sports, Korean wave, news and Internet memes.\n1) #PokemonGO \nNintendo’s augmented-reality game Pokémon GO reached Singapore’s shores in late July, resulting in hordes of Singaporeans taking to the streets and public spaces in the hunt for Pokémons and exchanging tips on where best to find rare Pokémons in Singapore. Hours after #PokemonGO’s Singapore launch, the Singapore Police Force posted an advisory urging the public to place their personal safety above the urge to \"catch em' all\". National Parks also requested the removal of Pokestops from nature reserves to minimize damage to these areas.\n \n2) #Rio2016 \nSchooling’s gold at the Rio Olympics definitely made waves, but he was not the only one that got everyone Tweeting. Yip Pin Xiu’s (@yippinxiu) two gold medal wins at the Rio Paralympics made Singapore proud, too.\n3) #ElectionNight \nSingapore also took to Twitter to follow developments in the 2016 US Elections. The US Elections suddenly felt closer to home when now-President-Elect Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrump) singled out Singaporeans as stealing jobs from Americans, resulting in Singaporeans taking to social media to express their disbelief at the claim.\n4) #MUFC \nFans of Manchester United (@manutd) have been having a tough time as of late, with the team falling far short of expectations this season. More recently, Jose Mourinho replaced Louis van Gaal as team manager. Nonetheless, #MUFC fans in Singapore are fiercely loyal, watching the games religiously, and also ready to support a new football-themed cafe to be set up in Singapore by former Manchester United stars, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville.\n5) #DescendantsOfTheSun \nThe K-wave peaked to a new high this year, with the Descendants of the Sun TV series. The love story between Captain Yoo Shi Jin (Song Joong Ki) and Doctor Kang Mo Yeon (Song Hye Kyo) captured hearts all over Singapore. Fans of this series, endearingly shortened to ‘DOTS,’ inspired wedding photo shoots in Singapore and even Halloween costumes.\n6) #Euro2016 \nThe 2016 UEFA European Championship marked the 15th edition of the tournament. This year, Iceland made it all the way to the quarterfinals with a stunning upset of England along the way, while underdog Portugal ending up taking home the Championship title. Football fans in Singapore got live updates about the #Euro2016 action on Twitter and cheered along with the global football community, even at Changi airport!\n7) #BTS \nBTS (@bts_twt) , also known as Bangtan Boys, is one of the hottest Korean acts in the world.

Mark Wilson / Getty Images Twitter has been blamed partly for contributing to the rise of Donald Trump. How does CEO Jack Dorsey feel about it? The usually thoughtful Dorsey was even more careful with his response Tuesday night when asked about Trump’s Twitter use at Recode’s Code Commerce conference in San Francisco. “Complicated,” he said. “I feel very proud of the role of the service and what it stands for and everything that we’ve done, and that continues to accelerate every single day. Especially as it’s had such a spotlight on it through his usage and the election.” “The complicated part,” Dorsey continued, “is just what does this mean to have a direct line to how he’s thinking in real time and to see that.” “Having the president-elect on our service, using it as a direct line of communication, allows everyone to see what’s on his mind in the moment. I think that’s interesting, I think it’s fascinating, I haven’t seen that before. So we’re definitely entering a new world where everything is on the surface and we can all see it in real time and we can all have conversations about it.” recode_divider",

More on this... Authorities seek to question NBA player over New York City nightclub brawl \nThey say he was carrying a red can containing a liquid that smelled like gasoline, matches as well as a book called \"Son of Hamas,\" which is about the son of one of Hamas' founders. He told officers that he didn't intend to set anything on fire. \nPolice say he didn't get close to the tree. \nThe Bronx man has been charged with making terroristic threats and disorderly conduct. It's unclear if he has an attorney. Advertisement",

(AP) The reloading Boston Red Sox pulled off the biggest deal yet at the winter meetings, acquiring ace pitcher Chris Sale from the Chicago White Sox for a package of four prospects.\nSale joins an already talented rotation with the AL East champions, now pitching alongside 2016 AL Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello, former winner David Price and knuckleballer Steven Wright.\nMore from FoxSports Peter King: I would not trade David Johnson for any back in football Mike Tomlin spots for James Harrison during workout Whitlock 1-on-1: Eric Mangini on Cam Newton being benched | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF WhatIfSports: NFL Week 14 Simulation Predictions The 27-year-old lefty has been an All-Star in each of the last five seasons, finishing high in Cy Young voting every time. To get him, Boston traded four minor leaguers: high-priced third baseman Yoan Moncada, considered by many the top young talent in baseball, along with pitchers Michael Kopech and Victor Diaz, and outfielder Luis Basabe.\nSale was 17-10 with a 3.34 ERA and 233 strikeouts this year, a season after he led the majors by fanning 274. He also comes with this benefit: a team-favorable contract that calls for a $12 million salary next year and includes club options for 2018 at $12.5 million and 2019 at $15 million.\nA few hours earlier, Boston got setup man Tyler Thornburg from the Milwaukee Brewers for a package that included infielder Travis Shaw, minor league infielder Mauricio Dubon, minor league right-hander Josh Pennington and a player to be named or $100.\nThe 28-year-old Thornburg will become Boston's eighth-inning guy, setting up closer Craig Kimbrel. Thornburg was 8-5 with 13 saves and a 2.15 ERA in 67 games for the Brewers last season, striking out 90 in 67 innings.\nNEW YORK (AP) - Derek Jeter's No. 2 is being retired, the last of the New York Yankees' single digits.\nThe Yankees said the number will be retired on May 14 before a Mother's Day game against Houston, and a plaque in Jeter's honor will be unveiled in Monument Park during the ceremony.\nJeter's number is the 21st retired by the team. He won five World Series titles and was a 14-time All-Star during a 20-season career that ended in 2014. The shortstop ranks sixth in major league history with 3,465 career hits.\nOXON HILL, Md. (AP) - Claire Smith became the first woman to win the J.G. Taylor Spink Award for meritorious contributions to baseball writing and will be honored during the Hall of Fame's induction weekend next July in Cooperstown, New York.\nThe 62-year-old Smith covered the New York Yankees for the Hartford Courant for five years starting in 1983 and was a columnist for The New York Times from 1991-98 and The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1998-2007. She currently is ESPN's news editor of remote productions.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\nBaylor hired Matt Rhule as head coach after his highly successful run at Temple, hoping he can rebuild the Big 12 Conference program hit hard by scandal and suddenly struggling on the field.\nRhule becomes the full-time replacement for two-time Big 12 champion coach Art Briles, who was dismissed after a scathing report over the university's handling of sexual assault complaints, including some against football players. Rhule will be introduced on the Waco campus Wednesday.\nFormer Wake Forest coach Jim Grobe had been out of coaching two years when he put his retirement on hold in May to serve as Baylor's acting head coach this season. The Bears are 6-6 and headed to the Cactus Bowl despite a six-game losing streak.\nThe 41-year-old Rhule is a former Penn State linebacker who has a monumental task ahead of him in putting together a coaching staff and a recruiting class at Baylor. With a monthlong quiet period in recruiting starting Saturday, Baylor has only one firm verbal commitment.\nPRO FOOTBALL\nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) - Mike Zimmer was back at practice with the Minnesota Vikings, not quite a week after surgery to repair a detached retina.\nZimmer wore a white patch that was taped over his right eye as he roamed the indoor field and instructed players as usual. The 60-year-old coach had to miss the game against Dallas last week because of the emergency operation, one of multiple procedures he's had over the last six weeks. The Vikings announced that Zimmer is expected to travel with the team for Sunday's game at Jacksonville.\nHARVEY, La. (AP) - The man who fatally shot ex-NFL player Joe McKnight was arrested and jailed on a charge of manslaughter.\nJail records show 54-year-old Ronald Gasser was arrested late Monday.\nGasser was released last week without charges pending further investigation of McKnight's death. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said Thursday's shooting was the result of an apparent road-rage incident. When deputies arrived, the sheriff said Gasser handed them his gun and confessed to killing McKnight.\nTENNIS\nNovak Djokovic and coach Boris Becker are splitting up after three successful seasons together.\nDjokovic posted a statement on Facebook, saying the duo ''jointly decided to end our cooperation.'' He has won six of his 12 career Grand Slam singles titles while working with Becker. Djokovic also was the runner-up at three other Grand Slam tournaments during his time with Becker, meaning the Serb made it to the finals at nine of the 12 majors during their partnership.\nSOCCER\nNEW YORK (AP) - David Villa earned Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Player award after scoring 23 goals for New York City in his second season with the team. Villa received the award, named after Landon Donovan, from MLS Commissioner Don Garber.\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) - FC Dallas signed MLS defender of the year Matt Hedges to a four-year contract.\nGOLF\nThomas Bjorn was appointed captain of Europe's 2018 Ryder Cup team, a reward for his long and successful association with the event as a player and vice-captain as well as his commitment to the European Tour.\nThe 45-year-old Dane became the first Scandinavian to lead the European team, which will look to regain the cup at Le Golf National in Paris in 2018 after its 17-11 loss to the United States at Hazeltine in October.\nBOXING\nCANASTOTA, N.Y. (AP) - Former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield and three-division champion Marco Antonio Barrera of Mexico highlight a list of nine people selected for induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\nAlso to be inducted June 11 in Canastota, New York are: super flyweight champion Johnny Tapia; Australian trainer Johnny Lewis; judge Jerry Roth; journalist-broadcaster Steve Farhood; broadcaster Barry Tompkins; and posthumous honorees Eddie Booker and ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Sr.",

      "text": "Jack Dorsey says there's 'no time frame' for quitting his CEO jobs at Twitter or Square (SQ, TWTR) Published by Business Insider on Wed, 07 Dec 2016 Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both Twitter and Square, doesn't see himself stepping down from either role anytime soon.Speaking at Code Commerce on Tuesday, Dorsey said he's focused on growing both companies and will continue to keep his dual CEO role for the foreseeable future.\"I don't have a specific time frame,\" Dorsey said. \"My intention is to serve both companies in every way I know how and make sure that we are really focused on whats most important for each.\"Dorsey said he wants to be measured by \"results\" and that both companies are showingaccelerating usage, proving people are enjoying each of their products. He admitted Twitter will \"take time\" to find the right approach,but on Square, Dorsey said he isproud of what that company has been able to accomplish over the past 18 months.To be fair, Square has gone public and repeatedly beat earnings estimates in the past year,drawing bullish investor sentiment from Wall Street. Twitter, on the other hand, has had a rough time, losing multiple executives and seeing its stock price remain roughly flat in the same period.When asked if he'd consider moving to a chairman role at Square, since it's in a better position, and also to allow him to focus more on Twitter, Dorsey said it's likely not going to happen.\"As chairman, you dont see the day to day, operational aspects of the company. Its important to not just opine on the direction and to actually see through it,\" he replied.\"Iwant to spend my time walking around the office and have a conversation with people.\"SEE ALSO:Amazon's new grocery store could be driving up the price of a $600 million companyJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: We sleep much differently than our ancestors ' here's why",

      "title": "The case against Bowe Bergdahl | News",
      "text": "Published December 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nThis is a RUSH transcript from \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" December 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! \nO'REILLY : Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly. In the \"Is It Legal\" segment tonight, very intense situation surrounding Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. As you may know, he is about to go on trial for deserting his unit in Afghanistan.\nAmong the charges levelled to Bergdahl, at least, two soldiers were wounded searching for him after he left his post. Now a judge will decide whether that evidence will be admitted in the case. With us our \"Is It Legal\" team, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lis Wiehl.\nWhy wouldn't a judge allow that in? That's part of the whole thing.\nLIS WIEHL, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Actually I agree. Let me ask you a question. Judge might say it's not relevant to the charges. I don't agree with that. The judge could say even if it's relevant, it's so prejudicial it might harm his case and so there --\nO'REILLY : Of course, it would harm his case.\nWIEHL : That's what's called good evidence, right?\nO'REILLY : Yes.\nWIEHL: There is something in the law that says it's relevant.\nO'REILLY: When is the judge going to make -- I understand it, but it's part of what happened.\nWIEHL: Right.\nO'REILLY: When is the judge supposed to make the decision?\nKIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST OF FNC'S \"THE FIVE\" : OK. So he can take his time essentially to make it, but December 16th is the next pre-trial hearing.\nO'REILLY : Right.\nGUILFOYLE : He will make up his mind. He'll give his ruling then, but this is really --\nO'REILLY : Is he going to give his ruling on December 16th?\nGUILFOYLE: Yes. Yes, he will.\nO'REILLY: On this desertion thing?\nGUILFOYLE : Yes. Here's the bottom line, this evidence is probative and I feel relevant. It's not going to be something too prejudicial. It goes directly to the charge of misbehaving before the enemy. He is only asking -- the prosecutors only have two specific instances of officers and soldiers that were injured during this time.\nO'REILLY: Right. There's two of them. One was dead -- one was killed, right?\nGUILFOYLE: Right. One particular had -- was shot in the head. Traumatic brain stroke but then survived and the other is Morito (ph), was struck in the right hand by --\nO'REILLY: The guy with the traumatic brain injury is still alive?\nGUILFOYLE: Yes. He ended up surviving.\nO'REILLY : So if you didn't watch us last week, Wiehl predicts that President Obama will not pardon Bowe Bergdahl.\nWIEHL : Correct.\nO'REILLY : Because the trial is going to be in April, the formal trial. And you, Guilfoyle, predict he will pardon Bowe Bergdahl.\nGUILFOYLE : Correct. And you, O'Reilly --\nO'REILLY: Who is always --\nWIEHL : Right.\nO'REILLY : Thank you.\nWIEHL : Because you two are agreeing with each other.\nO'REILLY: What do I predict?\nGUILFOYLE: That he will be pardoned on the last day in office.\nO'REILLY: Yes. I believe Barack Obama on his last day in office will pardon a whole bunch of people.\nWIEHL : No. Well, yes, he will.\nO'REILLY: Right, including Brian Kilmeade.\nGUILFOYLE: For crimes -- can we get one for Wiehl?\nO'REILLY : I don't know about that.\nGUILFOYLE : For crimes against \"Is It Legal?\"\nO'REILLY : President Obama does not want this trial to go forward particularly if that ruling December 16th says that this evidence that the two soldiers were hurt searching for this deserter.\nWIEHL: The evidence will come in, but I still maintain with my prediction that once Obama said I have already stuck my neck out once, I'm not going to do it again.\nGUILFOYLE: There were others that were injured and lost their lives.\nO'REILLY: It should be noted that we will not put up any money for charity to back up her assertion.

      "text": "Published December 7, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Cal Thomas  \nPublished December 05, 2016 |  FoxNews.com \n\nOnly five of the 335 men who survived the unprovoked attack that sunk the USS Arizona on Dec. 7, 1941 remain alive. Donald Stratton, 94, is one of them. He has added to the historical knowledge of that day and the beginning of America’s entry into World War II in a new book, “All the Gallant Men: The First Memoir By a USS Arizona Survivor.”\nTypical of so many men of that era, the book (written with Ken Gire) is less about Stratton, a 19-year-old kid from a tiny Nebraska town ravaged by the Great Depression, and more about the men with whom he served.\nAccording to the book, total casualties at Pearl Harbor on that fateful day amounted to 2,403 dead and 1,176 wounded. Many of Stratton’s shipmates lie interred in the bowels of the Arizona, which still secretes oil, a constant reminder to “never forget.”\nPeople too young to have known men of that era, or who never asked grandparents about their World War II experience, will find in Stratton’s book a quality that has declined in modern times — modesty. “We were not extraordinary men,” he writes. “Truth be told, most of us had enlisted because there were precious few jobs to be found where we lived.”\nThe isolationist spirit was strong in 1941. Here’s Stratton on the patriotism that overwhelmed isolationism after the attack: “Love for country welled up inside seemingly every American, coming out in the songs we sang, in the movies produced, in the newspaper articles that were written. … We were ordinary men. What was extraordinary was the country we loved.”\nCompare this sentiment to what we see in today’s movies, newspaper articles and songs. Stratton writes, “We loved who (America) was, what she stood for. We loved her for what she meant to us, and for what she had given us, even in those meager times.”\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

I don't think that's the way forward for the U.S or the world.\" \nHart added he's \"sympathetic\" to Trump's plans for infrastructure spending but \"when you look at the details of what he had in mind, those are not so impressive.\" \nHart shares this year's 8 million kronor ($930,000) economics award with Bengt Holmstrom of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The coastline then runs through the disputed territory of Western Sahara before reaching Morocco. \nThe agreement was signed during a visit to Nigeria this week by King Mohammed VI of Morocco, who has been touring several African countries.

Mladic \"called the shots\" as his troops murdered and expelled thousands of civilians to carve out an ethnically pure Serb mini-state in Bosnia during the Balkan nation's 1992-95 war, a United Nations prosecutor said Monday as Mladic's genocide trial neared its end. (ICTY Video via AP) (The Associated Press) \nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands – United Nations prosecutors have demanded a life sentence for Gen. Ratko Mladic, telling judges they should convict and imprison the former Bosnian Serb military chief for orchestrating atrocities throughout Bosnia's 1992-95 war. \nProsecutor Alan Tieger on Wednesday told judges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that it would be \"an insult to the victims, living and dead, and an affront to justice to impose any sentence other than the most severe available under law: A life sentence.\" \nTieger was speaking at the end of prosecutors' closing statements at the conclusion of Mladic's trial on charges including genocide, murder and terror. \nVerdicts are expected late next year.

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nLOS ANGELES – The deaths of at least 36 concertgoers in an Oakland warehouse inferno last Friday have many wondering if there is any way to know if a concert venue – especially a non-traditional space -- is safe. \nPaul Wertheimer, head of Los Angeles' Crowd Management Strategies, said no one can ever really know for sure. \n“We assume venues are safe,” Wertheimer told FOX411. “We find out too late they are not… There are too often few and fleeting options of escape. Getting on your knees and heading for the exit -- if there is one visible and unlocked -- is good advice for the first 10 people. After that, survivability diminishes.” \nOfficials said the Ghost Ship Warehouse had no fire sprinklers or smoke detectors and the only way out was on the first floor through a dark, rickety stairway. \nWertheimer said concerts like the one at the Ghost Ship are illegal and leave no room for safety. \n“They are not safe in any way,” he said. “Unsafe venue, no crowd management plan, no emergency plan, no trained crowd managers, no capacity limitation.” \nSteve Adelman, Vice President of the Event Safety Alliance, said people need to be as aware as they possibly can when they go to any sort of entertainment space. \n“The thing that people should look for when they go into any live event space … is clearly marked exits over a door which is accessible to them,” he explained. “Anybody at this point knows what an exit sign is supposed to look like…that is not a hard thing to ask people to look for. That exit sign has to be over a door which is accessible to them.” \nBut most people do not necessarily asses the risks a venue might have before going, and evacuation plans are not something that crosses their mind until there is an emergency. \n“The whole idea of going to a show, a club, or sporting event it’s a place where other people have already taken care of safety measures,” Adelman said. “I think most of the time when someone goes out for entertainment purposes, they are kind of suspending their disbelief about the need to protect themselves because they trust someone already looked into this.” \nThe Ghost Ship warehouse manager Derick Ion Almena apologized for the tragedy on “Today” Tuesday morning. \n“It’s not a good morning. What am I doing here? Can I just say I’m sorry?” he said. “The only reason why I’m here is to put my face and my body here in front. Am I the man who should be held accountable? Did I build something … I mean what am I going to say to that? Should I be held accountable? I can barely stand here right now.” \nWertheimer said the real problem is deficiencies in crowd safety laws. \n“The scandal is a lack of comprehensive crowd safety laws and the failure of public officials to enforce those that exist,” he said. “The other problem is compliance...The first responders did a heroic job in Oakland. But, what about the fire inspectors, police and city that could have prevented---or attempted to prevent this known illegal situation?” \nEarlier this week, the Los Angeles County Fire Department issued tips for what you should do before enterting an entertainment venue. \n1- Take a good look around at the condition of the building. \n2- Have a communication plan and plan a meeting place. \n3- When you enter the building locate exits immediately and check for clear exit paths. \n4- If there is an emergency, react immediately, get out and stay out. \nA refrigerator may have been the cause of the Oakland warehouse inferno. Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern said a person who escaped the deadly blaze told authorities there were flames coming from the refrigerator, and evidence found at the scene so far supports the claim. \nThe building’s structure and safety have reportedly been on city officials’ radar for some time and questions have emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the fire. \nOakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints about the warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn't get inside, said Darin Ranelletti of the Oakland Planning Department. \nOnce the building is cleared, the investigation will turn to the cause of the fire. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze. \nThe Ghost Ship fire is just the latest fire-related concert tragedy. In 2003, there was a fire caused by pyrotechnics at the Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, killing 100 people. In 2013, there was a nightclub fire in Brazil that left 238 people dead. \nThe AP contributed to this report. \n\nYou can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA . Advertisement",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print The conning tower of the mini submarine sunk by the USS Ward (Credit: University of Hawaiʻi/HURL). \nOn Wednesday, the 75 th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, NOAA will livestream dives to two Japanese mini submarines, the first of which was sunk by the USS Ward prior to the attack. \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will use an underwater robot operated from its ship Okeanos Explorer to send back images from the wreck sites, which are near Pearl Harbor. \n\"Until now, only a handful of explorers and scientists have seen these relics of the war in the deep sea,\" said James Delgado, director of maritime heritage at the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, in a press release. \"But thanks to technology, anyone and everyone can now dive with us in the first live exploration of the 'midget' submarines that represent the beginning of the war in the Pacific.\" \nINCREDIBLE IMAGES REVEAL US NAVY SEAPLANE LOST IN PEARL HARBOR ATTACK \nNOAA explains that, on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, U.S. naval vessels and aircraft on patrol outside Pearl Harbor saw a partially submerged submarine attempting to enter the harbor, but alerts were not immediately sent out. Some 90 minutes before Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japanese aircraft the USS Ward fired on the mini sub and sank it, marking the first U.S. shots fired in World War II. \nThe second submarine disappeared on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, but was discovered in shallow waters in 1951 and raised by the U.S. Navy. The sub was then taken out to sea and dumped in deeper water, before its rediscovery by the University of Hawai’i’s Undersea Research Laboratory in 1992. The last time the wreck was visited by the university’s submersibles was in 2013. \nNOAA told FoxNews.com that the first livestreamed dive, which will visit the submarine sank by the USS Ward, will start at 11:30 a.m. ET and is expected to end at 1:30 p.m. ET Wednesday. The dive to the second submarine, which is lying in three pieces, will start at 4:30 p.m. ET and end at 7:00 p.m. ET Wednesday. \nINCREDIBLE IMAGES OFFER FIRST GLIMPSE OF SUNKEN WWII-ERA AIRCRAFT CARRIER \nThe livestream will be available here . \nLast year NOAA and the University of Hawai’i released incredible images of a U.S. Navy seaplane sunk during the opening minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nEarlier this year scientists also released stunning images of the light aircraft carrier USS Independence, which was intentionally sunk off California in 1951. \nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers Trending in Science",

Not only that, the robotic critter— made with an eye towards someday helping with search and rescue operations— can execute a parkour-like move and jump off the ground, then off a wall. \nDuncan Haldane, first author on a study about the new robot and a PhD candidate at University of California, Berkeley, said his team was inspired to make SALTO after talking with first responders at an urban rescue training site. \nNEW RECORD! ROBOT SOLVES RUBIK'S CUBE IN LESS THAN A SECOND \n“Our goal was to have a search and rescue robot small enough to not disturb the rubble further, [and] move quickly across the many kinds of rubble produced by collapsed buildings,” he said during a teleconference on Monday. “To do that, it has to be able to jump.” \nFurther inspiration for the robot came from a stellar natural jumper, an animal called a galago, or bush baby, that can jump as high as about five and a half feet high in the lab, and do it quickly. \n“We don’t quite reach the galago’s performance, but SALTO has 56 percent more vertical jumping agility than any other untethered robot,” Haldane said. \nHARVARD HAS BUILT A CIGARETTE-SMOKING ROBOT, AND IT'S HERE TO HELP \nHaldane highlighted that because the robot is such a good jumper, it can use its environment in a dynamic way, like leap off the ground, then bounce off a wall— a skill that calls to mind the famous parkour chase scene in the James Bond film “Casino Royale.” \n“The closest model for what we’re trying to do is human parkour,” Haldane said, in a video about the robot. “You have these people that like excel at running over buildings, bouncing off of all these crazy obstacles, using stuff that would otherwise be an obstacle, like a wall, as a feature to help yourself move.” \nThe study about SALTO appears in the first issue of a new journal, Science Robotics. \nFollow Rob Verger on Twitter: @robverger Advertisement",

He insisted that he helped Solidarity activists.\nThe TVN24 station has shown an indictment against a Solidarity activist, Antoni Pikula, signed by Piotrowicz.\nOpposition lawmakers have asked an ethics commission to punish Piotrowicz for denying facts, and questioned the ruling conservative party's moral standards.\nLaw and Justice has made it a priority to condemn communism, ousted in 1989, and to remove from public life communist-era activists.",

      "text": "By Dan Gainor \nPublished December 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nNewly-elected President Donald Trump will soon take the helm of the world’s most-powerful job. He’ll command an expansive nuclear arsenal, an unparalleled military and a Twitter account with 16.9 million followers.\nThat last item gives Trump the unique ability to go around the major media. It makes him a one-man super power – able to push policy agendas, compliment allies and critique the press.\nThe American media are terrified of Trump. They are freaked out by his ability to talk directly to the American public.\nEven more, they are enraged over his willingness to attack them – the people who think they are “truth tellers.”\nWhat many in the left and the news media don’t seem to understand is that Trump is doing his job.\nIn slightly less than a month since the election, Trump has already passed the benchmark of the first 100 Tweets of his new administration. More than one-fourth of those more than 100 tweets has criticized the biased media.\nTrump has blasted the “ failing ” New York Times 10 times, and knocked “ one-sided, biased ” \"Saturday Night Live\" and the “ highly overrated ” play \"Hamilton.\"\nAccording to Socialbakers.com Trump's followers have skyrocketed since the election, from roughly 13 million followers to nearly 17 million.\nMonday, he aimed his tweets in a full broadside at the traditional news media:\n“If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to \"tweet.\" Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!” he wrote .\nTrump had told \"60 Minutes\" that he would cut back on Twitter as president just days after the election . “I’m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to be very restrained,” he explained to correspondent Lesley Stahl.\nThat appearance was cited by CBS News on Monday night. But they seem to have forgotten what else he said during the earlier interview. “I have a method of fighting back,” he added.\nHe’s right. And he needs it to even the odds against the press that is still campaigning against him.\nTrump’s tweets have been widely criticized in the media, including on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Liberal actor Alec Baldwin mocked Trump in the skit saying his “brain is bad,” explained Townhall . \"‘I just retweeted the best tweet. I mean, wow, what a great, smart tweet,’ Baldwin says after sharing a 16-year-old high schooler’s tweet -- which actually  happened  last month.” \"The View’s\" Whoopi Goldberg urged simply: ““Stay off Twitter and do your job now.”\nSo-called journalists are just as bad. CNN’s Chris Cuomo admitted to Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway the press is “distracted from a little bit of analysis of the cabinet by the tweeting once again.” Cuomo listed a few of the topics Trump had targeted on Twitter and asked her, “Is this really how he's going to spend his time as president?”\nThe Times ended up confused, wondering, “If Trump Tweets It, Is It News? A Quandary for the News Media.” The news organization that has 32 million followers on Twitter , isn’t sure if Twitter is a legitimate form of communication?! The paper inadvertently made Trump’s case for using Twitter, amidst its internal angst: “Mr. Trump’s Twitter account — a bully pulpit, propaganda weapon and attention magnet all rolled into one — has quickly emerged as a fresh journalistic challenge and a source of lively debate.”\nThe Times quoted liberal Nation editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel urging news outlets to limit covering what Trump said. “Media would be wise to stop hyper-coverage of Trump’s tweets — they distract, distort and debase,” she whined.\nNot everyone agrees that Twitter is bad, even on the left.

Josh Earnest  told reporters  defended Trump’s use of Twitter “President Obama has found Twitter to be a useful mechanism for communicating with the American public and providing some insight to all of you about what he’s thinking about,” he told the press corps. \nWhat many in the left and the news media don’t seem to understand is that Trump is doing his job.\nFormer vice president Dick Cheney gets it. He told a defense forum recently that Twitter is “sort of a way around the press.” Cheney added : “He’s at the point where we don’t need you guys anymore.”\nAnd that’s what really scares journalists. That he doesn’t need them. Why deal with an activist, left-wing news media that is continuing its campaign against him?\nNancy Reagan became famous for the slogan, “Just say no.” In Trump terms, that should become: “Just tweet no.”\n\nDan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture . He writes frequently about media for Fox News Opinion. He can also be contacted on Facebook and Twitter as dangainor.",

(Reuters) \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes believes the Democratic Party was a bigger threat the the First Amendment during the 2016 election, not Donald Trump.\nBewkes was asked about the President-elect's campaign promise to open up libel laws at Business Insider's IGNITION conference.\n\"Do you worry about that at all,\" Business Insider's Henry Blodget asked Bewkes of Trump's threats towards CNN which is owned by Time Warner. The then-candidate said he wanted to change American libel laws to make it more difficult for the press to publish inaccurate stories.\nBewkes responded saying he doesn't \"think that's a serious thing\" and that if anyone is trying to change free speech it's the Democrats who \"had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.\"\nBewkes was referring to Hillary Clinton's campaign platform to overturn the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling which stated that free speech extends to unions and corporations.\n\"And that was worrying me more,\" Bewkes said. \"The press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing — I think overly charitably — as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices.\"\n\"Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo,\" the Democratic Party's 2016 platform stated .\n\"So I thought the real threat to the First Amendment came from the Democrats' side more,\" Bewkes concluded. \"There's not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.\"",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nVice President-elect Mike Pence is using the capital’s glamorous new Trump International Hotel as a backdrop for major events. The Bahrain government is hosting its “national day” reception at President-elect Donald Trump’s elegant D.C. property Wednesday. This, amid reports that delegations from foreign countries are eagerly snapping up pricy rooms at the Pennsylvania Avenue location. \nTaken together, the developments give a snapshot of the kind of ethical entanglements Trump could face with his newest luxury property -- and the broader conflict of interest questions surrounding his business empire -- as he prepares to move into the White House less than a mile away. \nOne Asian diplomat recently told The Washington Post: \"Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, 'I love your new hotel!' Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, 'I am staying at your competitor?'\" \nLarry Noble, general counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, cited this kind of scenario as a problem. \n“They are saying that of course we'll stay at the Trump hotel. We're going to see the president and when we see the president, we want to say you have a wonderful hotel there,” he told Fox News. “So he's really profiting from this. It really creates real conflicts of interest.” \nAt issue is the “foreign emoluments clause” of the Constitution, which bars U.S. government officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without congressional approval. \nBahrain isn’t the only foreign government sending money into the Trump Organization’s coffers this month. The Azerbaijani Embassy is hosting a Hanukkah party at the Trump hotel next week. \nTrump and his family say they’re trying to put up the necessary firewalls to settle any ethical questions. \nShortly after his election, Trump declared he would be distancing himself from the business and making sure his children take on a bigger role in the Trump Organization. \nHe and daughter Ivanka told CBS’ “60 Minutes the company’s brand paled in comparison to the importance of governing. \n“I don't think it matters. This is so much more important,” Ivanka Trump said. “And more serious. And so … you know, that's the focus.” \nDonald Trump echoed his daughter message \n“This is big league stuff. This is … our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing,” he said. \nWith the president-elect now promising a Dec. 15 news conference where he will officially turn over the business to his children, good government groups are suggesting that is not enough – and the entire family should get out of the business. \n“I think this is a really dangerous area and I think he's going to see it,” Noble said. “Hopefully he's going to see it, and they're just going to divest.” \nIn one curious development, while Ivanka Trump and her father said she and her siblings were taking on a bigger role in the business, reports have surfaced that she and her husband are moving to Washington – suggesting she may instead be taking on a bigger role in the government and raising more questions of who’s poised to run the family business. \nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent. He joined the network in June 2011. Advertisement",

      "text": "Olympic doping sanctions against Russia extended Published December 07, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nTwo days before the release of a new report into Russian doping, the IOC on Wednesday extended the provisional sanctions imposed on the country over allegations of systematic cheating and cover-ups. \nPUTIN HOPES FOR BETTER RUSSIA-U.S. TIES, JOIN EFFORTS IN ANTI-TERROR FIGHT \nThe International Olympic Committee executive board said the measures imposed on July 19 have been extended \"until further notice.\" \nThe sanctions, originally designed to apply until the end of this year, were put into place following the first report by World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren that alleged state-sponsored doping in Russia. \nANTI-DOPING AGENCY TO RUSSIA: ACCEPT BLAME, STOP OBSTRUCTING \nUnder the measures, the IOC will not organize or \"give patronage\" to any sports events or meetings in Russia. In addition, the IOC urges all Olympic winter sports federations to \"freeze their preparations for major events in Russia,\" including world championships and World Cups and \"to actively look for alternative organizers.\" \nThe IOC executive board released a statement that set out its position ahead of Friday's release in London of McLaren's second and final report into the Russian scandal. \nThe Canadian lawyer's first report, issued in July, led WADA to recommend Russia's exclusion from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The IOC rejected the call, instead allowing international federations to decide which Russians could compete. \nFriday's report is expected to focus on evidence of organized Russian doping centered on the Sochi Games, including allegations that tainted samples of Russian athletes -- including medalists -- were swapped for clean ones through a concealed hole in the wall of the drug-testing lab. \nThe IOC said the allegations \"go to the heart of the Olympic Games and are a fundamental attack on their integrity.\" \nThe committee said \"due process\" must be followed, meaning McLaren's evidence must be evaluated and those implicated -- including athletes and the Russian Sports Ministry -- \"have to be given the right to be heard.\" \nOnce the investigations are complete, the IOC will \"take all the appropriate measures and sanctions,\" including disqualification of athletes from the games and exclusion of implicated officials, entourage or government officials from the Olympics, the statement said. \nOutside of the Olympics, international federations have the authority to sanction athletes and their entourage and potentially suspend national federations, the IOC said. \nMcLaren's report will be sent to two separate IOC inquiry commissions. One is looking into the allegations of Russian state involvement in doping, the other is investigating the athletes and the doping samples. Advertisement",

At the time of the controversial trade in 2014, the White House described Bergdahl as \"honorable\" and someone who served with dignity.\n\"It’s nobody’s fault but his that he was put in that position so he has  nobody to blame but himself and it’s unfortunate that he was a prisoner for five years, but it’s his own fault,” former platoon mate Sgt. Matt Vierkant said during an interview with Fox and Friends Tuesday. \"It's a desperate attempt by his defense and his team because they don't have a leg to stand on.\"\n\"He has to be held accountable for his actions,\" Vierkant continued. \nRead the full story at Townhall.com→",

(Reuters File) \nA breast cancer patient currently undergoing chemotherapy is speaking out after an incident in which she believes the TSA at Los Angeles International airport crossed the line while performing a security check. \nDenise Albert was flying home to New York Sunday night when she says a TSA agent put her hands on her buttocks and crotch and then patted her left leg all the way down to the ankle, applying pressure the whole way. In the incident, captured on video, the TSA agent then goes back up and repeated the process along Albert’s right leg.\nBut when the agent moved her hands to her chest, Albert, co-host of a media company called  “The Moms,” had had enough.\n“You can't touch me there,” she told the agent. “You can’t touch me there ... You can’t touch me there.\"\nAlbert reiterated, \"Sorry … I have breast cancer. I have a port in me. You can’t touch me.”\nA second agent moved in and told her: “So, that is part of the procedure. We have to clear everything … She’s going to use as much pressure as she needs to, to clear the area. That’s part of this. We have to make sure there’s nothing there.”\n“I was in such shock…. I have never been so humiliated or felt more violated in my life,” Albert, 41, wrote that night in a lengthy Facebook post that included a video of the incident.\nThe mother of two sons, who has chronicled her battle with cancer in Good Housekeeping and writes a series called “Divorce Diaries” for the Huffington Post, continued:\n“I went through the scanning machine at the airport without incident. I had already told them about my metal port and my medical cream which I removed from my bag for them to see and test as I have done on prior flights.\n“I don't know what was different this time but TSA agents aggressively attempted to do a body cavity search in public. I was TSE precheck and once through the scanner they asked me to take off my shoes.\n“I explained I didn't have socks on and that my cream is for an infection from my current treatment, including on my feet. So if they wanted to put my shoes through x-ray, I would have to sit down because I would not put my bare feet on the floor. They allowed that.\n“They then started to tell me they would apply pressure from head to toe and I got very upset because I wear a wig. I didn't want them to touch it, move it, or ruin it. So I ripped it off for them to pat my head ….\n“After at least 20 minutes of sitting there because they were debating how to proceed, I told them my feet were freezing. Also a side effect from chemo. They refused to help me.”\nAfter several minutes, a supervisor finally arrived, took her to a private room and conducted a “regular soft pat down,” Albert wrote. But her ordeal wasn’t over.\n“… they opened my bags, removed everything and another TSA agent joked about all of the eyelashes I had. I told her, it's because I don't have real ones from my cancer treatment.”\n\"I started crying,\" Albert told PIX11 , where she is a regular guest on the morning news. \"It was overwhelming and horrific. I could not believe what was happening….\nIn an updated Facebook post on Dec.5, Albert wrote that she has \" never been so humiliated or felt more violated in my life.\"\nShe said she has since filed an online complaint with the TSA and received a form response:\n“We regret that you had a negative screening experience. While every person and item must be screened before entering a secured area, the manner in which the screening is conducted is important. Our policies and procedures focus on ensuring that all passengers, regardless of their personal situations and needs, are treated with dignity, respect, and courtesy….” \nIn a statement sent to Pix11, the TSA wrote: “The Transportation Security Administration takes reports of alleged impropriety very seriously. TSA is currently looking into the specific details as to what occurred during the screening process to ensure our security protocols were followed. We regret any distress the security screening process may have caused the passenger. We will work with the passenger directly to address her concerns.”",

      "text": "Published December 07, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print File photo - a contestant wearing an extra-terrestrial costume, waits in line for her turn in the UFO costume contest in Roswell, N.M., July 3, 1997. Roswell is the site of an alleged UFO crash in 1947. (Reuters) \nA new witness has broken his 36 -year silence to speak out about Britain’s most famous UFO incident.\nSteve Longero was told to keep quiet by his superiors following the infamous Rendlesham Forest incident in Suffolk. \nBut now the retired U.S. Air Force police officer has gone on the record for the first time and said: “I think it was something not from this world.”\nThe incident – dubbed the British Roswell – took place over three nights between 26 and 28 December, in 1980.\nMilitary personnel from nearby RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge, including the deputy base commander, witnessed strange lights in the forest and hovering above the twin NATO airbases which were on high alert as the Cold War was at its peak.\nA UFO? VIDEO CAPTURES STRANGE OBJECT NEAR OHIO MILITARY BASE \nSteve, who served as a police sergeant in the USAF, was guarding the weapons storage area when the alarms started going off.\nHe said: “While on duty that night, we had a very sophisticated alarm system and everything just went off.\n“And then I could see these lights over the treetops, and I was thinking, what’s going on? Then they started sending people out there and at first it was hard to believe, all these bright lights. It was hard to take in.\n\"Well from what I remember the lights, fluorescent lights, kind of a glow, like a reddish glow. I remember going out there.”\nSteve went out into the forest where he remembers seeing a large group of other military personnel had already gathered including Staff Sgt Jim Burroughs, Airman First Class Edward Cabansag and Airman First Class Larry Warren.\nDescribing the UFOs, he said: “They looked like fluorescent coloured lights, like red and green, glowing lights and that’s what they looked like.I could see them hovering over the treetops like an eye that was almost following everybody.”\nMYSTERIOUS UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT CRASHES IN MYANMAR \nHe added: “It was real kind of quiet and this thing hovering over the trees, and you were like kind of tracking it and like ‘what is this?’. And it was like following, it was like watching us, that’s what it looked like to us. It seemed like something watching us.\n“From what I remember it was like aglow, it was really glowing like a reddish, greenish light. It was really glowing, like something was really hot and it was just glowing.”\nHe also recalled seeing Colonel Charles Halt there, who made a tape recording describing how beams of light were being shone down by the UFO. He has written an explosive new book called The Halt Perspective describing his close encounter.\nMr Longero said: “Col Halt came afterwards, after all that was called in. I remember him turning up, that’s when they kind of gathered everyone around and said this is what we are going to do, and everybody kind of dispersed and did what they were told to do.\n\"I remember we had a little briefing right there and everybody was just like, we just could not believe what we were seeing. Your adrenalin was flowing and I remember people saying like ‘what is that?’.”\nSTRANGE 'BURNING' OBJECT SPOTTED IN SKY OVER WESTERN US \nRubbishing theories that the lights in the woods were caused by a lighthouse on the east coast, he laughed: “I don’t think so. Not unless the lighthouse could move. Unless they could float that thing in the air.\n“And then, as people were getting close to this thing it kind of came nearer to us and then it would go forward and then go back and all of a sudden it just disappeared, like something out of Star Trek, it was like warp speed and we were all ‘what was that?’ it was gone and then that’s when they started doing all their investigations. After we secured the area they said okay, you’re gone, get out of here.”\nSteve said he was debriefed a few days later and was told not to talk about what he saw as the base had nuclear weapons on site.\nUFO investigator Philip Mantle, who interviewed Steve for Outer Limits Magazine , said: “Steve does not claim to be anything special but he wanted to emphasise that there were a lot of others involved who were witness to the events in question, many of whom have yet to add their voice to these events.\n“Steve has confirmed the open secret that nuclear weapons were stored at RAF Bentwaters at the time although he did not personally witness any lights being shone onto the WSA.\nUFO OVER ST. LOUIS? STRANGE  LIGHT OVER GATEWAY ARCH SPARKS DEBATE \n“He has confirmed much of what Colonel Halt has already said on the record and he is in no doubt that Larry Warren was there.\n“What is clear is that despite the best efforts of some this case will continue to be hotly debated for many years to come.”\nThe story originally appeared on The Sun .",

Chan School of Public Health, who has done research on health in public housing.\nBut public health professionals are hoping that he’ll bring his medical lens to the job — pushing for quality housing for low-income people and improving people’s health conditions within public housing.\nRead more at Foxnews.com→",

      "text": "By Rob Verger\nPublished December 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print These radar images of comet P/2016 BA14 were taken on March 22, 2016, by scientists using an antenna of NASA's Deep Space Network. At the time, the comet was about 2.2 million miles from Earth. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/GSSR)\nCitizens of Earth, get out your calendars: June 30, 2017 will be International Asteroid Day, the United Nations proclaimed on Wednesday.\nJune 30 may seem like a random date, but it’s not. On that day in 1908, the massive Tunguska asteroid event smashed over 770 square miles of terrain in Siberia in an explosion that knocked down millions of trees . The United Nations said that the point of International Asteroid Day is to “raise public awareness of the asteroid impact hazard”-- in other words, to work towards making sure that we all don’t perish during a cataclysmic space rock impact.\nIn the United States at least, NASA’s Planetary Defence Coordination Office takes the lead on keeping track of objects that could hit Earth as well as helping to figure out what to do if they were to detect such a threat. Part of that is the Near Earth Object Program, which in late October announced that they are now keeping track of a multitude of rocks: over 15,000 near-Earth asteroids.\nNASA WILL TACKLE ASTEROIDS WITH NEW PLANETARY DEFENSE OFFICE\nAnd on Sept. 7, an asteroid anywhere from 25 to 50 feet across whizzed past Earth , with about 25,000 miles to spare above the South Pole— much, much closer than the average distance between the moon and Earth, which is around 239,000 miles. That asteroid was only found two days before, on Sept. 5. Part of NASA’s future plans even call for grabbing a boulder from an asteroid and bringing it back to a lunar orbit, which is part of developing the technology to ideally protect Earth from space hazards.\nAsteroid Day was an event even before the United Nations recognized it as such. In a musical twist, the founders of the movement include Brian May— guitarist from the band Queen as well as holder of a doctorate in astrophysics.\nHOW THE AIR FORCE'S 'SPACE FENCE' WILL KEEP AMERICAN SATELLITES SAFE\n“We are extremely proud of the UN recognition as we founded Asteroid Day to raise awareness of the asteroid threat and the opportunity for the human species to unite around a single goal: protect our planet from asteroid impacts,” May, and the three other founders of Asteroid Day, said in a statement .\nFollow Rob Verger on Twitter: @robverger",

It's unclear when it took place, but the video appeared online this week.\nThe footage showed one wildebeest trying to push the other back to its feet.\n“I kept recording, and to my amazement the 'dead' animal got to its feet and they both ran away,” Ballantyne told the website. “The animals bolted past my car, I drove after them for a few seconds but they ran into thick bush and was unable to follow them.”\nBallantyne said he later heard from a source in the park that the animal had to be euthanized by rangers “due to the extent of its injuries and its inability to walk properly.”",

      "text": "Published December 07, 2016 Consumer Reports Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print When AT&T announced in October that it would spend $85 billion to acquire Time Warner, the plan was met with strong headwinds right out of the gate. A surprisingly broad array of lawmakers, from both sides of the political aisle, immediately voiced concerns. Among the concerned parties? The Senate Judiciary Committee, which today held a hearing examining the impact on competition, and potential antitrust concerns, the merger could raise.\nAs you would expect, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson thinks that letting his company snap up Time Warner will be great for everyone, especially AT&T. In his prepared testimony [PDF], Stephenson said that together, the two companies “will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models,” give consumers more options, increase competition for cable TV providers, and, somehow, speed up the development and deployment of 5G wireless networks.\nDisruption in the pay-TV industry is, of course, already happening—and AT&T is already a participant . Not only is premium content now available online through services like HBO Now and Netflix, but also with the rise of streaming bundles like DirecTV Now , Dish’s Sling TV, PlayStation Vue , and upcoming offerings from Hulu, “cable” has indeed begun to break open.\n“These changes to the old TV model unquestionably have been good for consumers,” Stephenson asserts. “But consumers want and deserve more options and better choices.”\nMore From Consumer Reports Top pick tires for 2016",

      "text": "By Cristina Corbin \nPublished December 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Patton is seen inside his Manalapan, Fla., home.  (Capehart Photography) \nPatton, a 9-week-old Goldendoodle and offspring of American military hero service dogs, likes to swim outside his Florida home, eat scrambled eggs and carry around a giant rawhide bone.\nHe's also poised to become the next \"First Dog\" to run the grounds of the White House, according to his owner.\nLois Pope, a prominent philanthropist and long-time friend of Donald Trump, told FoxNews.com Wednesday she's confident her puppy will be picked to serve as a \"companion and protector\" to the president-elect's 10-year-old son, Barron.\nPope, an advocate for veterans and animal welfare, said she sent Trump a note about the golden retriever and poodle mix and then showed him a photo while at Trump's Mar-A-Lago home on Thanksgiving.\n\"I walked up and showed him a picture of the dog and he said, 'Show it to Barron, he’ll want him,'\" Pope told FoxNews.com.\nPope then presented the pooch's photo to Trump's youngest child, who was busy playing a game on his iPhone, she said. \n\"He had the biggest smile,\" Pope said of Barron. \"That smile said everything.\"\n\"It brought tears to my eyes,\" she said. \"I thought this will give him the solace he needs. He has to make a dramatic transition to a new home and new friends in Washington. The dog will be a companion and a protector.\"\nThe Trump transition team has said Barron and his mother, Melania, will remain living at their New York City residence through the end of the school year before moving into the White House.\nThe Goldendoodle -- whose parents served in the U.S. military, according to Pope -- was named after World War II Gen. George Patton, whom Trump has praised as one of the greatest military leaders in American history.\nPope launched an extensive, nationwide search for the best dog to join the Trump family, which she said, to her knowledge, does not own any pets.\n\"He [Patton] comes from a lineage of hero dogs that served in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" she said. \"And he has the perfect disposition.\"\nU.S. presidents have a long history of keeping pets at the White House. Bo, a playful Portuguese water dog, joined the Obama family in 2009. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, had several animals, including Barney, a Scottish terrier, Miss Beazley, a puppy of the same breed, and India \"Willie\" the cat.\nOther presidential pets include Bill Clinton's chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy, and George H. W. Bush's Springer Spaniel, Millie.\nPresident George Washington kept a parrot named Polly and Theodore Roosevelt owned an array of animals: dogs, cats, guinea pigs, snakes and a badger named Josiah.\nWhile Patton hails from a military dog family, his owner said he enjoys the same activities as any other pooch. The puppy, who is currently 20 pounds and \"getting bigger by the day,\" swims in Pope's pool at her Manalapan, Fla., home and prefers scrambled eggs for breakfast after his daily \"puppy chow.\" Patton and his 12-inch rawhide bone are inseparable, she said.\n\"He’s unbelievably smart and a good swimmer,\" Pope said.\nAs of Wednesday, there was no official word from the Trump transition team about whether Patton will join the president-elect's family.\nBut Pope said she's optimistic the Trumps will adopt the puppy -- who could be heard barking in the background during a phone interview Wednesday morning.\n\"I'm confident they will take him for Barron,\" Pope said. \"This will be the First Dog for the First Son.\"\n\"He is a puppy worthy of the presidency,\" she said.",

      "text": "Follow on Twitter  34 p.m. \nBANGOR, Maine — Bangor provides many resources to make the city safe and attractive to its seniors and other residents, but there is plenty of room for improvement. The results of a city-wide “livability” survey were released on Wednesday in a preliminary report, closing the first phase of a project to improve Bangor’s living environment for residents of all ages. \nAbout 15 members of the Bangor Livable Communities Committee gathered in the City Council chambers to review the report, which was presented by staff from the University of Maine Center on Aging. The committee has been working for about 18 months, with about $8,000 in funding from the senior advocacy group AARP, to lay the groundwork for making the city safer, more navigable and more attractive for everyone who lives here. \nThe report reflects the work of seven focus groups that have met over the past year, drawing participation from a broad demographic of city residents. The topic areas discussed by the groups were provided by AARP’s “Age-Friendly Communities” initiative and included: outdoor spaces and buildings, transportation, housing, social participation, respect and social inclusion, civic participation and employment, communication and information, and community and health services. \nAll topic areas identified both strengths and challenges. Under transportation, for example, the focus groups identified as an asset the existence of the public bus system that serves the Bangor area. But many people do not understand how to use the bus system or where to find information about routes and hours of operation. In addition, the bus service hours are limited, making it hard to use in the evening or on weekends. In the housing section, the availability of free or inexpensive home repair services for low-income homeowners was offset by an overall lack of affordable housing options.   permanent closing earlier this year of Bangor’s Hammond Street Senior Center , because of financial unsustainability, was identified as a major loss for both social participation and social inclusion. Focus group members identified the opening of a new, sustainable senior center as a high priority. In the communications and information report, groups said local print and broadcast media do a good job of alerting seniors and other residents to services and events, but they called for a universal clearing house of some sort for all information. While the report did not specify a way to make the information easily available to everyone, one committee member suggested using public libraries as a bricks-and-mortar solution. \nIn a discussion of the report, Bangor resident John Friedman, 71, said Bangor should construct an all-purpose senior center that provides fitness options such as an indoor track and pool, a health care component, social and crafting activities, a teaching kitchen and other resources specifically geared to the needs of seniors. \n“You’re talking about it in snippets,” he said. “Have one place for all of it.” \nFriedman said the existence of such an “all things senior” center would attract retirees to Bangor. \nOther suggestions including building a network of in-town bike lanes and trails to encourage healthy physical activity and cut down on car traffic; developing a city-issued “seal of approval” for business, venues and events that ensure accessibility for people with mobility limitations; and increasing the availability of comprehensive adult day services for people with dementia and other disabilities. \nCity Councilor Sean Faircloth, who spearheaded the multigenerational approach to improving the city’s age-friendliness, said that it’s important to devise strategies for meeting the needs of seniors without giving short shrift to younger residents. The city has experienced a net loss in population in recent years, he said, and needs to attract and retain younger people in order to ensure economic and cultural vibrancy going forward. \nFaircloth has championed the creation of a multicultural center in Bangor to help young immigrants feel more welcome and enhance the local workforce. He also envisions a multicultural and cross-generation network of volunteers to help support frail elders and disabled residents in their homes and the community. \nCommittee Chair Patty Hamilton, director of Bangor Public Health and Community Services, noted that many interventions that would help Bangor seniors would benefit people of all ages, including improved sidewalks, enhanced safety in some neighborhoods and better access to transportation and health services. \n“These things will make our city more inviting to all ages and generations,” she said. \nLen Kaye, director of the UMaine Center on Aging, said a more detailed report will be released before the end of this month. That report will include information from a 2015 survey of about 450 Bangor residents that was performed to help the city qualify for AARP’s “age-friendly” status and funding. The final report also will reflect the results of another survey that will soon be sent to members of the Bangor Area Chamber of Commerce, asking the business community how it can contribute to the citywide effort. \nThe committee will reconvene in January to begin identifying specific proposals.",

      "text": "Published December 7, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print AP \nBy BYRON YORK | Washington Examiner \nThere's no shortage of people telling Donald Trump he can't build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And maybe, in the end, he won't do it. But at the moment Trump takes office, he will have the legal authority and the money he needs to get started on the wall. Yes, there will be obstacles — what's the over/under on the number of lawsuits that will be filed trying to stop it? — but the fact is, the law is already in place that will allow Trump to go forward.\nAs in other areas of immigration enforcement, Trump will be able to effect radical change simply by following the law. In this case, it is the Secure Fence Act, passed in 2006 with bipartisan support — 283 votes in the House and 80 in the Senate, including then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThe law ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security, within 18 months of passage, to \"take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.\"\nRead the full story at the Washington Examiner→",

      "text": "Published December 7, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nBy John Ziegler | Mediaite \nIn our communal effort to now try to figure out what kind of president Donald Trump will be (an endeavor which has traditionally, until this year, been undertaken BEFORE a presidential election has been completed), it seems there has been a lot of misdirected focus. It appears that, especially on the left, most of the concern is that he will turn into a racist dictator of some sort.\nHowever, the left, as they so often do, is not only overplaying their hand with regard to who Donald Trump is, but they are also missing the primary point almost entirely. While I understand how someone who bought into the left’s “alt-right” “white supremacist” caricature of Trump might see his authoritarian “law and order” language as real warning signs of the rise of a Hitler-like figure (did you know that they were both named Time’s “Person of the Year”?), I think this conclusion requires a fundamental misunderstanding of who Trump is.\nWhether he even fully realizes it himself, I see Trump as carving out a new role of “King of America” for himself. Judging from his first month as “president-elect,” it is very clear that the Trumpian view of the presidency is much more in line with that of the early 20th Century British monarchy than how our founders conceived of the position of commander in chief (heck, have you seen his living quarters in Trump Tower?!).\nRead the full story at Mediaite→",

Street gang violence in Chicago is as bad, if not worse, than the record-setting death years of the 1990s.\nBut there is no penalty for Democratic politicians who sit back in the Democratic city and do nothing to compel tougher sentences for gun crimes to keep the most aggressive shooters off the streets.\nRead the full story at the Chicago Tribune→",
