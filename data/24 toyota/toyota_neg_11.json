Brands Spins Off China Unit In New York Where the discovery was made: The Spring-8 synchotron (Photo: Wikipedia) \nYes, you have read right. Toyota has developed what it says is “the world’s first method for observing the behavior of lithium ions in an electrolyte when a battery charges and discharges.” Able to observe those ions for the first time in real time, Toyota researchers think they have found the reason why a battery ages. Once the breakthrough is commercialized, which could take “two to three years,” a new lithium ion battery could improve the battery-powered range of an electric vehicle by 15%, Dr. Hisao Yamashige of Toyota’s advanced R&D and engineering division told a small group of reporters this morning at the company’s Tokyo HQ. \nIt took three years’ work, and a giant synchrotron northeast of Kobe, Japan, for Toyota to be able to observe the travel of ions from a battery’s minus to its plus side, which creates the desired electricity. In the Spring-8 synchrotron , a ring with a 5,000 ft diameter, built around a hill in Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture, researchers bombarded batteries with radiation a billion stronger than a chest X-ray to create moving images on a high-speed camera. The synchrotron, one of the world’s largest, was developed jointly by the RIKEN Institute and the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. The ring can be rented for only $600 per hour by those who want to keep the research to themselves. Publish your research, and the ring is yours free of charge. Today’s press conference could have saved frugal Toyota some money. \nStudying the migration of ions from minus to plus, researchers could observe a kind of ion constipation that develops during the course of battery charging and recharging. When the battery begins to suffer intestinal problems, “the ions can no longer flow freely, they get blocked, and battery performance decreases,” as Yamashige-san tried to explain the phenomena in terms simple enough for the assembled reporters to understand. Despite valiant attempts on popular science, even Reuters’ star reporter Nori Shirouzu had to admit that he “was lost.” \nTo make a long story short, Toyota’s battery-boffins expect to use the new observation method to develop batteries that hold a better charge, and lead a longer life. Yamashige said he hopes to see commercialization in “a couple of years,” for improvements of “10 to 15%.” When I asked him why we hear so much about huge gains in future battery technology, and then he can promise only a marginal increase after all the scientific effort, Yamashige said that’s all he can do, “sorry to disappoint you.” \n15%. Yes, that’s it. \nAs I stepped outside of Toyota’s HQ building into a Tokyo experiencing an early dusting of snow, Wall Street Journal reporter Sean McMillan opened his umbrella next to me, and muttered: “Engineers.” \nWe probably didn’t grasp the momentousness of the discovery. For an audience that can better appreciate the research, the findings will be presented at the 57 th International Symposium on Batteries, Fuel Cells and Capacitors, taking place next week at Tokyo’s Makuhari Messe.

      "text": "Toyota says aims to develop advanced electric-car battery in a few years Reuters Reuters Photo: \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a new, more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to come up with an electrified vehicle with driving range and battery life enhanced by up to 15 percent. \nSuch performance-enhanced lithium-ion battery technology will likely enable all its electrified vehicles to be improved, Toyota said. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to give their electrified cars a better driving range, battery life, and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid car called the Prius Prime. It also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020. \n(Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Related Links",

Toyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Reblog",

Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

Yuri Kageyama AP Photo 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO \nToyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n--- \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Related content",

Toyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. But all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. Toyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga , a department manager. The tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Today's Deals",

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) Posted: Thursday, November 24, 2016 1:39 am | Updated: 2:01 am, Thu Nov 24, 2016. Toyota says new technology means longer battery life Associated Press | \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. \nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. \nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said. \n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates) Next In Business News",

      "text": "BOSTON --(BUSINESS WIRE) Dishman Law announces a settlement is being proposed by Toyota concerning rust corrosion which can lead to accelerated corrosion and jeopardize the vehicle’s structural integrity. The proposed settlement purports to only include certain years of Toyota Tacoma, Tundra (2007-2008) and Sequoia (2005-2008) vehicles. Toyota has allegedly known for years of the serious problems with its truck frame corrosion and also truck bed corrosion and it has tried to deal with all of these serious issues quietly through a series of inadequate low-key customer-service campaigns. In some instances, depending on the extent of corrosion, Toyota proposes the frame will only be cleaned and a corrosion-resistant compound will be applied.\nIf you purchased, owned, or leased a Toyota Tacoma, Tundra, or Sequoia, and suffered any loss as a result of rust corrosion to your vehicle’s frame or bed or would like more information, you may contact Dishman Law at toyotarustsettlement@dishmanlaw.com to discuss your options. Your claim could be part of the settlement of claims against Toyota so you are urged to act promptly.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161123005601/en/\nDishman Law\nDavid Dishman, 617-523-5253\ntoyotarustsettlement@dishmanlaw.com\n ",

      "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently.\n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday.\nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics.\nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety.\nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020.\nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said.\nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said. \n\n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates)",

A majority of the minivans – 744,000 – were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. Share this: ",

That can cause the circuit to overload and open a fuse in the car, which prevents the door from latching shut properly. \nToyota is still working on a fix and anticipates notifying owners of the problem in mid-January.

      "text": "Toyota works to develop advanced electric-car battery Reuters ADVERTISEMENT \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. \nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. \nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said. \n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates) Related Links",

Toyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. The ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. But all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. Toyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga , a department manager. The tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Latest News",

      "text": "Breakthrough Contributes to R&D that will Lead to Longer Battery Life and Longer Driving Range for Vehicles Using Lithium ion Batteries Structure and Principles of an Automotive Li-ion Battery Condition While Discharging Newly-Developed Observation Method Li-ion Deviation in Electrolyte During Battery Discharge Toyota City, Japan, Nov 24, 2016 - (JCN Newswire) - Toyota Motor Corporation has developed the world's first(1) method for observing the behavior of lithium ions (Li-ions) in an electrolyte when a Li-ion battery charges and discharges.By using this method, it is possible to observe in real-time, the deviation of Li-ions-one of the causes of deterioration in the performance of Li-ion batteries. Toyota believes that this will provide essential guidelines for R&D that aims to improve the performance and durability of batteries, which would lead to longer battery life, as well as longer driving ranges for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs) and electric vehicles (EVs).Li-ion batteries use a metal oxide in the cathode, a carbon material in the anode, and an organic electrolyte for the electrolyte. Lithium ions flow in the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode when the battery is charging, and from the anode to the cathode when the battery is discharging, which results in an electric current flow. Thus, the Li-ions play an essential role within the electrolyte during battery charging and discharging.Structure and Principles of an Automotive Li-ion Battery https://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11241.jpg It has been known that Li-ion deviation occurs in the electrodes and electrolyte as a result of charging and discharging, and such deviation has been believed to limit the usage area of batteries, which is one factor that reduces the area in which the maximum performance of the battery can be achieved. When investigating the mechanism of Li-ion deviation, however, confirming the behavior of Li-ions in the electrolyte under the same environment and conditions as when it is being used in related products was not possible using existing methods.Condition While Discharging https://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11242.jpg The two main features of the observation method that Toyota developed to help solve this problem are as follows:(1) The Toyota Beamline(2) in the SPring-8(3) synchrotron radiation facility, which generates the world's highest-performance synchrotron radiation, produces high-intensity X-rays that are approximately 1 billion times more powerful than those generated by an X-ray equipment. This makes it possible to create 0.65 micron/pixel high-resolution and 100 ms/frame high-speed measurements.(2) In place of the electrolyte with phosphorous that is used in many Li-ion batteries, a new electrolyte with heavy elements is being utilized instead, thus replacing the phosphorous-containing ions that the Li-ions bind to as they move in the electrolyte with heavy element-containing ions. Heavy elements transmit less of the X-rays than phosphorous, and the shadows on the images taken after the X-rays pass through are darker. By observing the behavior of the heavy elements, it is possible to observe the deviation behavior of the Li-ions which are bound to them in the electrolyte. Newly-Developed Observation Method https://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11243.jpg By using the method described above, and a battery that is similar to that of related products such as laminated cell under the environment and conditions that resemble those of actual battery use, it is possible to observe in real-time, the process of Li-ion deviation that occurs in electrolytes during the course of battery charging and discharging. This observational method was jointly developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc., Nippon Soken, Inc., and four universities.(4)Li-ion Deviation in Electrolyte During Battery Discharge https://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11244.jpg Going forward, Toyota will observe the behavior of Li-ions caused by differences in the materials and structures of cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes, as well as the differences in battery control. Analyzing the mechanisms that cause deterioration of battery performance will lead to R&D that can help to improve the performance and durability of batteries, to bring about longer battery life and longer driving ranges.(1) Methods for observing laminated cells by using high-intensity X-rays and incorporating heavy elements into an electrolyte (According to Toyota Motor Corporation, as of August 2016)(2) Installed as a special-purpose beamline by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc. with the Cooperation of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI).(3) A testing and research facility with the world's highest performance synchrotron radiation comprehensively operated by RIKEN as the facility owner. Operated and maintained by the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI). SPring-8 stands for Super Photon ring-8 GeV.(4) Hokkaido University, Tohoku University, Kyoto University, and Ritsumeikan University.About ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

Yuri Kageyama AP Photo 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO \nToyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n--- \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Related content",

PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 24, 2016 1:38 PM \n[TOKYO] Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a new, more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to come up with an electrified vehicle with driving range and battery life enhanced by up to 15 per cent. \nSuch performance-enhanced lithium-ion battery technology will likely enable all its electrified vehicles to be improved, Toyota said. \n\"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,\" Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to give their electrified cars a better driving range, battery life, and safety. \nToyota, Japan's biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid car called the Prius Prime. \nIt also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "Toyota debuts Yaris L sedan, Vios hatch for China Text: Nica Onate / Photos: Toyota   12:00 Yaris and Vios get new bodystyles in China Toyota Motor Corporation has recently unveiled the Yaris L Sedan and the Vios FS Hatch at this year's Guangzhou Motor Show, providing new variants for the Chinese market. Not to be confused with the Vios sedan, also sold in China, the Yaris L sedan is available through the Guangzhou Automobile Group Motor Co., Ltd. (GAC) Motor, with its own unique stylings. Meanwhile the Vios L hatchback is assembled and sold through its partnership with FAW Toyota Motor. However, both companies became interested in other segments, leading to the development of these new variants for each car. The Yaris L sedan features a the distinct front fascia tht separates it from the Vios sedan. The rear end meanwhile gets a mildly tweaked version from the Vios Sedan with its LED taillights and revamped rear bumper. As for the Vios hatch, it also has its own front fascia, with a different set of headlights and a new T-shapped upper grill. It is also equipped with a wider lower grill integrated to the front fog lights and is accented by vertical LED daytime running lights. The rear of the Vios hatch retains the familiar design from the models in the ASEAN market. The tail lights are upgraded to LED units with slimmer indicators plus a mildly tweaked rear bumper. Both the Vios hatch and Yaris L receive the same 1.3-liter Dual VVT-i engine producing 99 PS and the bigger 1.5-liter rated at 107 PS. The engine can then be mated to either a CVT with a seven-speed manual mode or a five-speed manual gearbox. Related Articles",

      "text": "Technology Photos | Thu Nov 24, 2016 | 12:30pm IST Toyota works to develop advanced electric-car battery left right A Toyota Prius Prime is seen during the media preview of the 2016 New York International Auto Show in Manhattan, New York, U.S. March 23, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo 1/2 left right A detail is seen on a Toyota Prius Prime during the media preview of the 2016 New York International Auto Show in Manhattan, New York March 23, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo 2/2 \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. \nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. \nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said. \n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates) Next In Technology Photos ",

      "text": "  \nI was sitting in the service department of my Toyota dealer, staring at a book without seeing it as I waited for my car. God was next to me, watching \"The Price is Right.\" \n\"Eight-hundred forty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents,\" he said. \n\"Huh?\" I said. \n\"The retail price of a stainless-steel Kenmore 4.2 cubic foot freestanding gas range,\" said God, pointing to the television. \nOn the screen, an excited young woman blurted, \"Twelve hundred dollars!\" \nDrew Carey looked sad for her as he revealed the price. God shook his head. \"I tried to tell her,\" he said. \"If people would only listen to me ...\" \n\"Oh,\" I said, and returned to the book I wasn't reading. \nGod regarded me a moment. Then he said, \"Transmission?\" \nI looked up. \"What?\" \nGod said, \"I asked if you brought the car in because your transmission went blooey. Obviously, something's got you down.\" \nI sighed and closed the book. \"Trump,\" I said. \n\"Trump?\" \n\"The guy that's going to be our new president,\" I said. \n\"Oh yeah,\" said God. \"With the hair, right?\" \n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"That guy.\" \n\"Well, what about him?\" \nOn the screen above us, some man had Drew Carey in a bear hug. I sighed. \"He's the worst excuse for a leader I've ever seen,\" I said. \"What kind of 'president' spends his time whining about how he's treated on 'Saturday Night Live'? Or has to pay out $25 million to resolve a fraud case en route to inauguration? Not to mention that he's assembling a cabinet only a Klansman could love.\" \n\"Frightening,\" said God. \n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Now here it is Thanksgiving and I find that, well, I'm just not feeling very thankful.\" \nGod was incredulous. \"But look at all I've given you. You've got that great wife, you have a house, you have health and you've got that new granddaughter toddling around.\" \n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Of course, I'm thankful for all that. But the country...\" \n\"You should thank me for the country, too,\" he said. \n\"How?\" I said. \"Like I just told you, there's nothing to be thankful for.\" \n\"I disagree,\" said God. \"I did some of my better work here.\" \n\"Oh?\" I said. \"Which part? The bigotry, the stupidity or the misogyny?\" \nGod gave me a level look. \"You're angry,\" he said. \n\"Yeah,\" I admitted. \"I probably will be for the next few years.\" \n\"Why?\" asked God. \n\"Why?! Didn't you hear what I said about the dope we elected? About the Masters of Evil he's surrounding himself with? I expect better from this country.\" \n\"You expect better,\" said God. On the screen above, some lady shrieked and bit her fingernails as the Big Wheel spun. \n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I do.\" \n\"And what gives you this expectation?\" \n\"This is America,\" I said. \nGod laughed. \"You people always say that word like a magic spell,\" he said. \"But there is no magic in it. Certainly no guarantee. You may expect better in America only because here, you have the freedom to demand better — and to work toward better. That's all 'America' means. You had that freedom before this Trump person was elected, and you have it still. Not everyone does.\" \n\"So you're saying the fight to form a more perfect union is always ongoing? And that even in our current predicament we can draw strength from knowing that? You're saying that God abides even now, and that these are things to be grateful for on Thanksgiving Day?\" \nGod smiled. \"I'm saying thanksgiving is not a day.\" \n\"Wow,\" I said. \"I never thought about it like that.\" \n\"You're welcome,\" said God. \nLeonard Pitts Jr. is a columnist for the Miami Herald. \nlpitts@miamiherald.com",

      "text": "Tokyo: Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10-15%.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker’s Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions’ movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren’t as common as gas stations.\nALSO READ: Toyota agrees to settle $3.4 billion rust dispute settlement \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world’s major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world’s pure EVs sold.\nToyota’s new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next “several years,” said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.",

      "text": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently.\n\"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,\" Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo today.\nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said.\nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.\nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors because of its limiting characteristics.\nProducers of EVs, plug-in hybrids, as well as conventional hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety.\nToyota has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. The automaker has also said it is aiming to launch an EV by about 2020.",

      "text": "Toyota says new technology means longer battery life \nPosted 3:36 a.m. today Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated): * Subject: * You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By YURI KAGEYAMA, AP Business Writer \nTOKYO — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama \n ",

      "text": "( Reuters ) – Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery “in a few years” that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently.\n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday.\nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics.\nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety.\nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020.\nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in “real time” how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said.\nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.\n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates)\n \n",

      "text": "\"Pulled out in the hood Toyota/ Drove back to the hood Lambo,\" Travis Scott sings on \"Beibs in the Trap,\" a standout track on his latest album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. It's a line that pretty much sums up Scott's transition from a relatively unknown Texas artist to one of hip-hop's premier acts and creative minds.\nThe journey not only influences Scott's music, but also the clothing for his upcoming 2017 tour. Beginning a three-day pop-up store trek in as many cities on Friday (Nov. 18) in Los Angeles (with New York and hometown Houston to follow), Scott converted an empty store lot on La Brea Avenue into a boutique space and sold Travis Birds, a collection only fans could fully understand. The featured decorative piece was a vintage Toyota MR2.\n\"The Toyota, that's [my] favorite car,\" Travis said, tucked in the back of the store as fans scrambled for merch. \"That's where I lost my virginity. And my homie Dozie used to pick me up in his Toyota Camry. That was our story we have from when we were growing up. That was our whip.\"\nThank u Man U kids are one of a kind I love u Tour soon.\nA photo posted by flame (@travisscott) on Nov 20, 2016 at 6:31pm PST\nWith Travis present, the vibe of the shop leaned towards that of a concert, but not because Scott ever really performed. As he stepped into a crowd of fans, they yelped lyrics from \"Through the Late Night\" -- another Birds track, which blared over Sonos speakers -- and shoved their new purchases his way for him to sign with his Sharpie.\n\"He signed it, bro!\" one teen yelled to a buddy, referring to a grey Levi's denim trucker jacket with a pink-headed eagle on its back. \"I'm from Texas,\" Travis explained. \"The bald eagle is just our whole shit.\"\nAnd the eagle has a name. \"That's Jack,\" he teased. \"You'll know more about that when you come on tour.\"\nTwo weeks ago at his ComplexCon performance in Long Beach, attendees were treated to a preview of his 2017 tour staging, which features a massive, gothic black eagle with red eyes, and a cage that it appears to have escaped from.\n\"Now you're dialing in,\" he said as he adjusted his black dad hat (also for sale) and realized that I attended the show. \"Now you're connecting with me. That stage that you saw is only a fourth of my stage that I'll have on tour. It's a full production. It's so crazy.\"\nAs far as the design of his clothing is concerned, Travis was at the helm. \"I work with my guys Quentin and Mark on the designing,\" he explained. \"The three of us, we figure it out. I draw most of this shit out and then I pass it on and they make it way iller.\"\nHe also mentioned that Antwerp, Belgium design studio Uber and Kosher assisted \"with the Hood Toyota shit,\" which is boldly written in white on a pair of grey sweatpants on sale in the shop. \"I like reaching out to different people and catching their vibe.\"\nLet us kids fly !\nA photo posted by flame (@travisscott) on Nov 20, 2016 at 6:35pm PST\nAs kids piled in 30 at a time, each happily left with tour merch and a sighting of their rager rap hero. \"I met Travis Scott!\" one girl squealed as she exited.\n\"It's cool, bro,\" Travis said, taking it all in with a smile that revealed his dazzlingly jeweled grill. \"I just [recreated] the merch booth from my tour. That's all I wanted to do. I couldn't fit a car in my merch booth on tour, so I had to make an extensive merch booth here.\"",

      "text": "Cyclical Consumer Goods | Thu Nov 24, 2016 | 12:31am EST Toyota says aims to develop advanced electric-car battery in a few years \nTOKYO Nov 24 Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a new, more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to come up with an electrified vehicle with driving range and battery life enhanced by up to 15 percent. \nSuch performance-enhanced lithium-ion battery technology will likely enable all its electrified vehicles to be improved, Toyota said. \n\"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,\" Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to give their electrified cars a better driving range, battery life, and safety. \nToyota, Japan's biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid car called the Prius Prime. It also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020.

Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an \"emergency\" plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution. \nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city's roads. Late last year, the country's top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi. Continued... ",

      "text": "By YURI KAGEYAMA\nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama\n ",

      "text": "Toyota says aims to develop advanced electric-car battery in a few years Thursday, 24 November 2016 11:58 28 \nTOKYO: Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a new, more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to come up with an electrified vehicle with driving range and battery life enhanced by up to 15 percent. \nSuch performance-enhanced lithium-ion battery technology will likely enable all its electrified vehicles to be improved, Toyota said. \n\"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,\" Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to give their electrified cars a better driving range, battery life, and safety. \nToyota, Japan's biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid car called the Prius Prime. It also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020. Copyright Reuters, 2016 ",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   8:44   \nTOKYO (Nov 24): Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15% greater range and battery life than they have currently. \n\"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,\" Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. \nToyota, Japan's biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. \nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. \nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.",

      "text": "By Aditi Shah\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters.\nToyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota's India business said on Wednesday.\nThe Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue.\nThe development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India's first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price.\nFor instance, Toyota's Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees ($47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India's top-selling small cars.\nToyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said.\nSeveral Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an \"emergency\" plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution.\nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city's roads. Late last year, the country's top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi.\n\"We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,\" Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India's stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017.\nToyota's sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India's auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.\nThe number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota's market share was 5 percent.\nTotal passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million.\n(Reporting by Aditi Shah.

      "text": "Toyota Develops World's First Behavior Observation Method for Lithium Ions in Electrolyte Toyota Develops World's First Behavior Observation Method for Lithium Ions in Electrolyte Toyota City, Japan, Nov 24, 2016 - (ACN Newswire) - Toyota Motor Corporation has developed the world's first(1) method for observing the behavior of lithium ions (Li-ions) in an electrolyte when a Li-ion battery charges and discharges.\nBy using this method, it is possible to observe in real-time, the deviation of Li-ions-one of the causes of deterioration in the performance of Li-ion batteries. Toyota believes that this will provide essential guidelines for R&D that aims to improve the performance and durability of batteries, which would lead to longer battery life, as well as longer driving ranges for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs) and electric vehicles (EVs).\nLi-ion batteries use a metal oxide in the cathode, a carbon material in the anode, and an organic electrolyte for the electrolyte. Lithium ions flow in the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode when the battery is charging, and from the anode to the cathode when the battery is discharging, which results in an electric current flow. Thus, the Li-ions play an essential role within the electrolyte during battery charging and discharging.\nStructure and Principles of an Automotive Li-ion Battery\nhttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11241.jpg\nIt has been known that Li-ion deviation occurs in the electrodes and electrolyte as a result of charging and discharging, and such deviation has been believed to limit the usage area of batteries, which is one factor that reduces the area in which the maximum performance of the battery can be achieved. When investigating the mechanism of Li-ion deviation, however, confirming the behavior of Li-ions in the electrolyte under the same environment and conditions as when it is being used in related products was not possible using existing methods.\nCondition While Discharging\nhttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11242.jpg\nThe two main features of the observation method that Toyota developed to help solve this problem are as follows:\n(1) The Toyota Beamline(2) in the SPring-8(3) synchrotron radiation facility, which generates the world's highest-performance synchrotron radiation, produces high-intensity X-rays that are approximately 1 billion times more powerful than those generated by an X-ray equipment. This makes it possible to create 0.65 micron/pixel high-resolution and 100 ms/frame high-speed measurements.\n(2) In place of the electrolyte with phosphorous that is used in many Li-ion batteries, a new electrolyte with heavy elements is being utilized instead, thus replacing the phosphorous-containing ions that the Li-ions bind to as they move in the electrolyte with heavy element-containing ions. Heavy elements transmit less of the X-rays than phosphorous, and the shadows on the images taken after the X-rays pass through are darker. By observing the behavior of the heavy elements, it is possible to observe the deviation behavior of the Li-ions which are bound to them in the electrolyte.\nNewly-Developed Observation Method\nhttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11243.jpg\nBy using the method described above, and a battery that is similar to that of related products such as laminated cell under the environment and conditions that resemble those of actual battery use, it is possible to observe in real-time, the process of Li-ion deviation that occurs in electrolytes during the course of battery charging and discharging. This observational method was jointly developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc., Nippon Soken, Inc., and four universities.(4)\nLi-ion Deviation in Electrolyte During Battery Discharge\nhttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11244.jpg\nGoing forward, Toyota will observe the behavior of Li-ions caused by differences in the materials and structures of cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes, as well as the differences in battery control. Analyzing the mechanisms that cause deterioration of battery performance will lead to R&D that can help to improve the performance and durability of batteries, to bring about longer battery life and longer driving ranges.\n(1) Methods for observing laminated cells by using high-intensity X-rays and incorporating heavy elements into an electrolyte (According to Toyota Motor Corporation, as of August 2016)\n(2) Installed as a special-purpose beamline by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc. with the Cooperation of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI).\n(3) A testing and research facility with the world's highest performance synchrotron radiation comprehensively operated by RIKEN as the facility owner. Operated and maintained by the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI). SPring-8 stands for Super Photon ring-8 GeV.\n(4) Hokkaido University, Tohoku University, Kyoto University, and Ritsumeikan University.\nAbout Toyota\nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "text": "TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

      "title": "Toyota Aiming To Develop Advanced Car Batteries With Greater Range",
      "text": "Toyota recently announced that it’s creating a new in-house unit which will be tasked with developing electric cars , it goes to show that the Japanese auto giant is serious about competing in this market. The company has now said that it’s aiming to develop advanced electric car batteries “in a few years” which will provide 15 percent greater range and battery life than existing batteries. “Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” said Toyota battery technology researcher Hisao Yamashige during a media briefing earlier today.\nLithium-ion battery packs are used to power electric cars. Improving the performance of these batteries is easier said than done. It takes a significant amount of time and resources to make that happen and clearly Toyota is willing to invest into this aim.\nToyota isn’t alone in its quest to develop more advanced and efficient electric car batteries. Many automakers and battery manufacturers are also working on similar projects to advance the cause of electric cars.\nToyota engineers have been able to see in “real time” how lithium ions move inside the electrodes using techniques developed in collaboration with four universities in Japan and one of the country’s publicly-financed laboratories. This insight will enable engineers to come up with new designs that prevent lithium ions from unevenly moving and limiting battery life by bunching up in the electrodes.\nFiled in",

      "text": "Toyota Will Recall 744000 Sienna Minivans To Fix Potential Issue of Their Doors 24 Nov 2016, 12:45 UTC · / Home / News / Recalls Toyota has announced it will recall approximately 744.000 MY2011-2016 Sienna vehicles in the USA. The minivan from Toyota will go through a safety recall because the automaker has discovered a potential problem with its sliding doors. Toyota says that the issue can be encountered only under certain and limited conditions, which then lead to the overload of the sliding door motor circuit. As Toyota has explained, the sliding doors could be opened while driving if there were unlatched, but only if the fault were to happen before driving with the doors unlatched. No injuries, deaths, or accidents have been reported as being related to this problem. The electrical problem described above could only happen if the operation motor that slides the doors is impeded. Only if the conditions for the fault to become dangerous are met, the affected models risk opening the fuse for the motor. If even that fail-safe has been eliminated, there is still hope for the owners - having the doors latched, which should prevent any problems until the fix is performed on all the affected models. It is worth noting that the rear occupants of the vehicle should be safe even if the rear doors are accidentally opened while driving if they have their seat belts on. Well, safety is relative when the sliding doors of a vehicle get opened, but at least keeping the seat belts buckled and the children secure in their designed seats will prevent anyone from falling out of the car. Toyota has stated that its engineers are currently working on the remedy for the situation. All the known owners of the involved Sienna vehicles will be notified by first class mail by mid-January 2017. If you own a 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna , but are not in the company’s database for one reason or another, it is advisable to look up your VIN on www.toyota.com/recall. You can also call customer service at 1-800-331-4331.",

      "text": "November 24, 2016 \nAdvertisement \nI was sitting in the service department of my Toyota dealer, staring at a book without seeing it as I waited for my car. God was next to me, watching “The Price is Right.” \n“Eight-hundred forty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents,” he said. \n“Huh?” I said. \n“The retail price of a stainless-steel Kenmore 4.2 cubic foot freestanding gas range,” said God, pointing to the television. \nOn the screen, an excited young woman blurted, “Twelve hundred dollars!” \nDrew Carey looked sad for her as he revealed the price. God shook his head. “I tried to tell her,” he said. “If people would only listen to me …” \n“Oh,” I said, and returned to the book I wasn’t reading. \nGod regarded me a moment. Then he said, “Transmission?” \nI looked up. “What?” \nGod said, “I asked if you brought the car in because your transmission went blooey. Obviously, something’s got you down.” \nI sighed and closed the book. “Trump,” I said. \n“Trump?” \n“The guy that’s going to be our new president,” I said. \n“Oh yeah,” said God. “With the hair, right?” \n“Yeah,” I said. “That guy.” \n“Well, what about him?” \nOn the screen above us, some man had Drew Carey in a bear hug. I sighed. “He’s the worst excuse for a leader I’ve ever seen,” I said. “What kind of ‘president’ spends his time whining about how he’s treated on ‘Saturday Night Live’? Or has to pay out $25 million to resolve a fraud case en route to inauguration? Not to mention that he’s assembling a cabinet only a Klansman could love.” \n“Frightening,” said God. \n“Yes,” I said. “Now here it is Thanksgiving and I find that, well, I’m just not feeling very thankful.” \nGod was incredulous. “But look at all I’ve given you. You’ve got that great wife, you have a house, you have health and you’ve got that new granddaughter toddling around.” \n“Yeah,” I said. “Of course, I’m thankful for all that. But the country…” \n“You should thank me for the country, too,” he said. \n“How?” I said. “Like I just told you, there’s nothing to be thankful for.” \n“I disagree,” said God. “I did some of my better work here.” \n“Oh?” I said. “Which part? The bigotry, the stupidity or the misogyny?” \nGod gave me a level look. “You’re angry,” he said. \n“Yeah,” I admitted. “I probably will be for the next few years.” \n“Why?” asked God. \n“Why?! Didn’t you hear what I said about the dope we elected? About the Masters of Evil he’s surrounding himself with? I expect better from this country.” \n“You expect better,” said God. On the screen above, some lady shrieked and bit her fingernails as the Big Wheel spun. \n“Yeah,” I said. “I do.” \n“And what gives you this expectation?” \n“This is America,” I said. \nGod laughed. “You people always say that word like a magic spell,” he said. “But there is no magic in it. Certainly no guarantee. You may expect better in America only because here, you have the freedom to demand better — and to work toward better. That’s all ‘America’ means. You had that freedom before this Trump person was elected, and you have it still. Not everyone does.” \n“So you’re saying the fight to form a more perfect union is always ongoing? And that even in our current predicament we can draw strength from knowing that? You’re saying that God abides even now, and that these are things to be grateful for on Thanksgiving Day?” \nGod smiled. “I’m saying thanksgiving is not a day.” \n“Wow,” I said. “I never thought about it like that.” \n“You’re welcome,” said God. \n— Leonard Pitts Jr., winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, is a columnist for the Miami Herald.",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. “Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. Improving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. Producers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. Using techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. This should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said. -Reuters",

      "text": "By YURI KAGEYAMA\nAP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles - an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama\n ",

It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020.\nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said.\nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.\n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates)\nGo to MSN Home",

Toyota says it has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. Yamashige explained to reporters the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. (AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) TOKYO Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. Toyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. The ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. But all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. Toyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. The tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news?

That can cause the circuit to overload and open a fuse in the car, which prevents the door from latching shut properly. \nToyota is still working on a fix and anticipates notifying owners of the problem in mid-January.

      "title": "Toyota C-HR",
      "text": "Form over function Press Release \nAn exciting next chapter in Toyota’s storied North American product history has been revealed under the lights of the Los Angeles Convention Center. Stylish, athletic, and tech-filled, the all-new 2018 Toyota C-HR – or, Coupe High-Rider – represents a leap forward in design, manufacturing, and engineering for Toyota. When it arrives at dealerships next spring, the C-HR will serve as a solid springboard of excitement, adventure, and pride for its fashion-forward, trendsetting owners. \nLast year at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Scion debuted its stunning C-HR Concept. That well-received design study set the stage for the Toyota C-HR, which, nearly to the tee, carries on the concept’s avant-garde physique; modern, comfortable cabin; and bold, outgoing character. \nThe C-HR will be available in two grades at launch, XLE and XLE Premium, each equipped with a long list of standard premium features that includes 18-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, supportive bucket seating, 7-inch audio display, and Toyota Safety Sense P™ (TSS-P). \nBut, the C-HR doesn’t only look great – it’s got the sportiness to impress thanks to Deputy Chief Engineer, Hiro Koba, who is a diehard racer at heart. He and his team made it their mission to ensure the C-HR exhilarates its driver anytime, anywhere. Like its uncanny looks, the C-HR’s comprehensive and cohesive blend of comfort, control, consistency, and responsiveness that was cultivated on the famed Nürburgring is as impressive as it is unique. \nPOLISHED DIAMOND STYLE \nToyota’s team of global designers expounded on one theme: “Distinctive Diamond.” The iconic gemstone evokes universal notions of luxury, attractiveness, sophistication, and strength. Designers translated these traits into a physical form that’s collectively matchless, sexy, muscular, and edgy. From the get-go, they strived to sculpt an urban-dwelling crossover that would effortlessly navigate tight city streets and stand out, with an agile, dynamic expressiveness. \nAt the C-HR’s nose, two slim projector-beam halogen headlights with LED daytime running lights wrap deep into its toned shoulders – nearly all the way into the front quarter panels. Because of this, the vehicle looks wider than it is, and possesses an assertive fascia that’s uncommon in the segment. \nDeep, curvy character lines emerge from a prominent Toyota badge that’s flanked by the headlamps, and lead into the narrower core body. They run below the slender windows, and continue above the rear wheel where they marry to a high beltline and distinctive C-Pillar with integrated door handle. \nLook closely at the silhouette to see the clear resemblance of a diamond set on its side. Powerful arches housing the extra-large 18-inch aluminum wheels accentuate the C-HR’s sturdy posture and compact cabin. \nThe rear is a cohesive melding of its elaborate lines and 3D shapes. The tail lamps protrude outward, and the hatchback – outfitted with a lip spoiler and functional top wing – tapers neatly inboard, adding to the C-HR’s futuristic look, and, once more, surprising girth. \nCUTTING-EDGE CABIN \nOpening a door reveals a modern, spacious, and uncluttered interior having a keen placement of diamond accents and a driver-centric “MeZONE” orientation. Along with the soft-touch materials covering surfaces throughout, the diamond pattern influences the designs of the dual-zone climate controls, speaker surrounds, and black headliner above the front passengers. \nThe slightly angled dashboard and amenity controls allows for the driver to have a clear view of the road ahead and intuitive access to instrumentation – a nod to the C-HR’s sports car influence. The 7-inch audio display is positioned centrally atop the dash, rather than in it, so as to help reduce a driver’s eye movements. An informative twin-ring gauge cluster resides behind the leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel. The wheel, with its slender profile, small diameter, and compact center pad, is reminiscent of a sports car’s easy-to-grip helm. The satin-plated shift knob exudes a high-quality feeling, and once in-hand, has a solid shift movement. A bright 4.2-inch color Multi-Information Display sits between the twin-ring cluster. \nKey XLE standard features include a premium leather steering wheel; power fold and heated mirrors; auto-dimming rearview mirror with backup camera; electric parking brake; and dual-zone climate control. The XLE Premium builds upon the XLE’s amenities and adds Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert; heated front seats; power lumbar driver’s seat; auto fold, heated side mirrors with puddle lamps that project “Toyota C-HR”; fog lamps; and Smart Key with Push Button Start. Both grades are equipped with a 7-inch touchscreen display having AM/FM/HD Radio™, Aha™app, USB port and AUX jack, Bluetooth®, and Voice Recognition with voice training. \nBolstered bucket seats help keep passengers snug and comfortable, no matter their commute’s duration or dynamism. All passengers will appreciate the generous amount of small item storage space and cup holders. Designers used scalloped seatbacks, foot well cubbies carved below the front seats, and a chamfered headliner to create a spacious backseat environment. Sound insulating materials placed on the carpet, headliner, A-pillars, and door trim to help keep all unwanted noises out and the good conversations in. For extra cargo carrying versatility on weekend trips or errand runs, the rear 60/40 seat can split and fold flat. \nSURPRISE ATHLETE \nThe Toyota C-HR scores high on style points, but it is also a hit when it comes to thrilling fun and impressive comfort. Deputy Chief Engineer Koba took full advantage of the C-HR’s adaptable Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) to craft an engaging character that goes well beyond just a cool appearance. The C-HR’s core driving personality incorporates the ingredients of a well-sorted sports car – one that seamlessly melds cunning responsiveness, linearity, consistency, and comfort. \nYears were spent developing the C-HR’s driving performance and ride quality on some of the world’s most curvaceous and challenging roads, including the Nürburgring Nordschleife, an iconic racing circuit. Doing so took a mix of innovation, creativity, and trial and error. As a result, the TNGA platform – with an inherent low center-of-gravity, high strength, and low weight – benefitted from extra rigidity through added spot welding, gussets, braces, and adhesives in and on key connection structures. \nThe newly developed MacPherson strut front suspension with SACHS dampers has angled strut bearings and a large diameter stabilizer bar to help the C-HR’s front end respond quickly and precisely at initial corner turn-in. And at the rear, an all-new double-wishbone suspension utilizes SACHS shock absorbers with urethane upper supports – a first for Toyota. The material, together with an aluminum-cast upper support housing, aids in the dampers’ absorption efficiency, and therefore, greatly benefit passenger comfort, cabin quietness, and vehicle agility. \nFeeling connected to the road is characteristic of a sporty drive, and the C-HR delivers with its column-type Electronic Power Steering (EPS) system. As is the case with other EPS systems, a tilt of the steering wheel will return light feedback at low speeds, and at higher speeds, drivers will notice stronger feedback for increased confidence while behind the wheel. The C-HR’s steering system’s feel, however, relies on a highly rigid rack-and-pinion steering gearbox that is installed directly to the front suspension. \nFor all of its sportiness, the C-HR’s ride quality is well-sorted, civilized, and highly capable in absorbing the nastiest of unkempt pavement. The end result is a C-HR that finds itself as at home on congested boulevards as it does on serpentine roads. \nCOMPACT PUNCH \nThe C-HR’s engine, a punchy 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque, sends all power to the front wheels via continuously variable transmission (CVT). The engine employs many of Toyota’s latest generation of technologies, including Variable Valve Timing (VVT) and Valvematic, both of which have received extensive optimization to enhance fuel economy and smooth operation. Valvematic offers a broader range of continuously variable valve timing (lift and phasing) to provide optimal intake valve (not on exhaust side) operation relative to engine demands. Furthermore, to reduce exhaust emissions, the catalyst is warmed earlier during the engine’s ignition cycle. \nThe all-new CVT received much attention by engineers, and utilizes redesigned pulleys to enhance acceleration and fuel economy; a new belt structure to reduce cabin noise; and, a world’s-first coaxial two-port oil pump system that allows for continuous oil pressure modifications in various driving conditions. A Preload Differential helps to distribute torque between the left and right wheels during low-speed operation to make for easier, composed driving. \nOf course, drivers and passengers will appreciate the powertrain’s fuel efficiency, impressive smoothness, and quiet operation, but they’ll love Sport mode and the simulated 7-speed Sequential Shiftmatic. Engaging the Sport mode via the MID increases the responsiveness of the throttle, quickens the CVT’s automatic artificial “step-up” shifts, and maintains high engine speed to enhance acceleration. The EPS’ feedback is weightier for a more confidence-inspiring feel. Pushing the gearshift over to the left while in Drive engages Sequential Shiftmatic, and lets drivers shift simulated gears at their convenience. \nSTATE-OF-THE-ART SAFETY \nNo matter its grade, the C-HR comes equipped with standard Toyota Safety Sense P™ (TSS-P). This multi-feature advanced active safety suite bundles cutting-edge active safety technologies including Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection function (PCS w/PD) featuring forward collision warning and Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist function (LDA w/SA), Automatic High Beams (AHB), and Full-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC). The C-HR is the only competitor in the segment to offer standard Full-Speed DRCC. \nComplementing TSS-P are 10 standard airbags, standard Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC) and rear backup camera, as well as available Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, which are only available on the XLE Premium grade.

      "text": "By YURI KAGEYAMA\nAP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles - an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama\n ",

REUTERS/Erik De Castro/Files More By Aditi Shah\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters.\nToyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota's India business said on Wednesday.\nThe Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue.\nThe development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India's first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price.\nFor instance, Toyota's Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees ($47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India's top-selling small cars.\nToyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said.\nSeveral Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an \"emergency\" plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution.\nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city's roads. Late last year, the country's top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi.\n\"We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,\" Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India's stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017.\nToyota's sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India's auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.\nThe number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota's market share was 5 percent.\nTotal passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million.\n($1 = 68.8473 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Aditi Shah.

      "text": "TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker’s Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions’ movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren’t as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world’s major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world’s pure EVs sold.\nToyota’s new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next “several years,” said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\n___\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "While the Toyota Prius has not exactly been a hit with India’s car buyers, with the rising pollution problem, it could be a good time to re-introduce a good old friend. Toyota Motor Corp plans to do just that as it has made up its mind and will soon be launching the new Toyota Prius come the first quarter of 2017.\nYes, the Toyota Prius hybrid that went low on emissions and high on price may not have been a success when it first launched in 2009, but this time around things could change. Car and Bike have reported that the new Prius hybrid will be launched in the first quarter of 2017 with the company looking at January launch.\nRecently a senior Toyota official commented on how the company expects its hybrid car sales to shoot up to 20 percent by 2020 from the current 2 percent today.\n\nToyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota’s India business told Reuters .\nComing to the specifications, the Pruis is powered by the same 1.8-litre 4-cylinder engine that develops 97bhp and is paired to an electric motor that develops 71bhp. The new Prius comes with new nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) hybrid battery system that now sits lower beneath the rear seats for better weight distribution.\nThe new and updated Toyota Prius features a more angular and aggressive design that is a big update from the previous model.\nThe post Toyota Prius hybrid to see an early 2017 launch in India appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Toyota works to develop advanced electric-car battery By Published Friday, November 25, 2016 \nToyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. \nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. \nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.

      "text": "A recall for the Toyota Sienna and its power-sliding doors Photo: Toyota Canada Print \nMore than 60,000 units of the Sienna minivan are concerned by a recall in Canada regarding a problem with its power-sliding side doors. \nThe motor of these doors could stall in certain conditions that could prevent the doors from opening, such as an accumulation of snow or ice. When the motor stalls, a high amount of current could be generated and trigger the circuit protection for the motor, and if the door is unlocked, it could open by itself, even while the vehicle is in motion. \nA total of 60,190 units of the Sienna, model years 2011 to 2016, is said to be affected by this issue. For now, Toyota hasn’t determined how it will fix the problem. Vehicle owners can nonetheless contact the automaker toll free at 1-888-869-6828 for further information. Related content",

      "title": "Toyota Yaris isn’t flashy, but it gets the job done",
      "text": "\nBobby Yip/Reuters\nBy Warren Brown The Washington Post November 25, 2016\nI am not a socialist who believes everyone should drive small, unadorned economy cars.\nI am a realist who understands that most of us cannot comfortably afford automobiles marketed as luxury or high-performance machines.\nAdvertisement\nAlso increasingly evident is that our national and global environments cannot forever support bigger, faster, high-horsepower automobiles. That is reality, which in no way means I am against driving or the pursuit of the ‘‘fun to drive.’’\nI am in and out of hundreds of cars and trucks annually — products priced at myriad levels, from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to several million dollars in some cases. The experience is revealing: Regardless of price, all cars get stuck in traffic jams; and there are always traffic jams somewhere.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign ‘‘Prestige’’ does not help you move any faster. Nothing is more humbling than being stuck behind a Hyundai Elantra in an Aston Martin on the Pacific Coast Highway, or shuffling behind a Volkswagen Beetle in a high-performance Porsche on a London street or some segment of the Washington area’s Beltway.\nNo law enforcement officer anywhere ever served me a traffic citation with the words: ‘‘Wow! That’s a prestigious car!’’\nSpeeding from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds impresses some automotive journalists or other self-avowed ‘‘gearheads.’’ But try doing that in a quiet neighborhood — especially with a loud exhaust note — on a late night or early morning. How to make friends and influence people? That is definitely not the way.\nAdvertisement\nDo I like luxury and high-performance cars? Yes. But rapid technological advances, available in what we once called ‘‘economy’’ cars, makes some luxury metal seem vapidly foolish; and a super-high-horsepower car on an otherwise calm local street seems particularly out of place. High-performance on a racetrack or other designated space is fine, assuming you have the money or are lucky enough to get an invitation to share that venue.\nAll of this helps to explain the many Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Honda, Chrysler, Volkswagen, Fiat, Hyundai and Kia vehicles you see in daily traffic on the Beltway and worldwide. They are vehicles that make sense, cars and trucks that real people really can afford.\nReality: I regretted having to return the 2017 compact Toyota Yaris LE hatchback I drove last week. It was such a worry-free drive. Fast? Not particularly. Equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine, it stubbornly moved from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nearly 10 seconds. But it was a solid, reliable, reasonably safe and comfortable little car that could be parked almost anywhere and that got me and mine everywhere we wanted to go without necessitating a stop by bankruptcy court.\nAnd there was this about the Yaris: Toyota is to be congratulated for standardizing advanced electronic safety items through its Safety Sense package. That gives the motorist needed items such as forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems. I like this. I will look for this in all vehicles regardless of price or performance boasting.\nBottom line: Prestige vastly is overrated. Think safety, need, cost when buying a car. Impressing a neighbor will not impress your credit rating, doctor or police officer.\nRide, acceleration and handling: This is a get-about car that serves that purpose well. It’s not a racer and does not move like one.\nHead-turning quotient: It’s not about that. Most heads will miss it and you won’t care.\nBody style and layout: It is a front engine, front-wheel-drive compact car available with two or four doors, manual or automatic transmission, or hatchback or sedan format. There are three trim levels: L, LE, and SE.\nEngine/transmission: It comes with a 1.5-liter, 16-valve four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. An antiquated four-speed automatic is optional. Hint: Buy the much more enjoyable manual transmission.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 15.3 cubic feet with all seats in place. The fuel tank holds 11.1 gallons of regular grade gasoline.\nMileage: I averaged 34 miles per gallon on the highway.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake system; Safety Sense package; stability and traction control; pre-collision safety system; and side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Toyota Yaris LE with automatic transmission starts at $18,000 with a dealer’s invoice price of $17,278. Price as tested is $19,104 including $239 in options and an $865 factory-to-dealer shipment charge.",

      "text": "Toyota puts Aberdeen on a high \nFriday, November 25, 2016 Tweet \nABERDEEN High & Primary School in St Elizabeth won the grand prize of a brand new 2017 Toyota Hiace bus in Toyota Jamaica’s Bus Di School Competition recently. \nThe school was one of four rural institutions earning top spots in the competition. They all received cash prizes totalling more than $7.5m. These were St Albans Primary and Infant School in Malvern, St Elizabeth; Garlogie Primary & Junior High in Banana Ground, Clarendon; and Mannings Hill Primary School in rural St Andrew. \nPrim Lewis, principal of Aberdeen High & Primary School, said she was elated to win the bus. \n“We are excited, happy and so grateful to Toyota for giving us this bus. Aberdeen has had a dire need and we would not have been able to complete the fund raising to purchase a bus for another three years. This Toyota Hiace bus gives us a real boost to meet the growing transportation needs of our students,” said Lewis. \nLewis explained that Aberdeen’s extra-curricular activities were expanding. She said the school was recently accepted into Inter-Secondary Schools Sports Association, which means students will participate in various sports competitions, and that the institution partners with other schools for shared academic programmes. \n“This bus is needed to take the students to various competitions and activities safely and cost effectively. This helps us to make another important step as we strive to be seen as a school of choice,” said Lewis. \nTom Connor, Toyota Jamaica’s managing director, said his company recognises the importance of having access to safe and reliable transportation as part of the education experience for students across the island. \n“Bus Di School competition is an important programme for us as we are able to make a significant contribution to education, which is a major challenge in Jamaica. Our area of expertise is transportation, and as such, assisting schools with this need was very fitting. Ensuring that our students can commute safely to and from school, also attend competitions, special events, along with other academic programmes, is important to us. There are far too many stories of risky modes of transport that some schools have to rely on, and the unfortunate outcomes that result,” he said. \nSt Albans Primary in Malvern sees their $150,000 cash prize as enabling the school’s administration to help more children to attend school. \n“Transportation is a vital service, as many children are not coming to school because they have no way of getting here and back home,” said Christopher Dubidad, principal at St Albans. \n“With this cash award, we will be able to put measures in place to facilitate transportation for some of the students so that they can get the education that will help to transform their lives,” said Dubidad. \nSchools across the island were invited to submit their pitch for why they should win the Toyota Jamaica Bus Di School grand prize. The winner is selected by a combination of judging by a panel and a public vote of the schools’ proposals on the Toyota Jamaica \nFacebook page.",

      "text": "News Releases Toyota Develops World's First Behavior Observation Method for Lithium Ions in Electrolyte Breakthrough Contributes to R&D that will Lead to Longer Battery Life and Longer Driving Range for Vehicles Using Lithium ion Batteries November 24, 2016 Toyota City, Japan, November 24, 2016?Toyota Motor Corporation has developed the world's first 1 method for observing the behavior of lithium ions (Li-ions) in an electrolyte when a Li-ion battery charges and discharges. By using this method, it is possible to observe in real-time, the deviation of Li-ions?one of the causes of deterioration in the performance of Li-ion batteries. Toyota believes that this will provide essential guidelines for R&D that aims to improve the performance and durability of batteries, which would lead to longer battery life, as well as longer driving ranges for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs) and electric vehicles (EVs). Li-ion batteries use a metal oxide in the cathode, a carbon material in the anode, and an organic electrolyte for the electrolyte. Lithium ions flow in the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode when the battery is charging, and from the anode to the cathode when the battery is discharging, which results in an electric current flow. Thus, the Li-ions play an essential role within the electrolyte during battery charging and discharging. Structure and Principles of an Automotive Li-ion Battery \nIt has been known that Li-ion deviation occurs in the electrodes and electrolyte as a result of charging and discharging, and such deviation has been believed to limit the usage area of batteries, which is one factor that reduces the area in which the maximum performance of the battery can be achieved. When investigating the mechanism of Li-ion deviation, however, confirming the behavior of Li-ions in the electrolyte under the same environment and conditions as when it is being used in related products was not possible using existing methods. Condition While Discharging \nThe two main features of the observation method that Toyota developed to help solve this problem are as follows: The Toyota Beamline 2 in the SPring-8 3 synchrotron radiation facility, which generates the world's highest-performance synchrotron radiation, produces high-intensity X-rays that are approximately 1 billion times more powerful than those generated by an X-ray equipment. This makes it possible to create 0.65 micron/pixel high-resolution and 100 ms/frame high-speed measurements. In place of the electrolyte with phosphorous that is used in many Li-ion batteries, a new electrolyte with heavy elements is being utilized instead, thus replacing the phosphorous-containing ions that the Li-ions bind to as they move in the electrolyte with heavy element-containing ions. Heavy elements transmit less of the X-rays than phosphorous, and the shadows on the images taken after the X-rays pass through are darker. By observing the behavior of the heavy elements, it is possible to observe the deviation behavior of the Li-ions which are bound to them in the electrolyte. Newly-Developed Observation Method \nBy using the method described above, and a battery that is similar to that of related products such as laminated cell under the environment and conditions that resemble those of actual battery use, it is possible to observe in real-time, the process of Li-ion deviation that occurs in electrolytes during the course of battery charging and discharging. This observational method was jointly developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc., Nippon Soken, Inc., and four universities. 4 Li-ion Deviation in Electrolyte During Battery Discharge \nGoing forward, Toyota will observe the behavior of Li-ions caused by differences in the materials and structures of cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes, as well as the differences in battery control. Analyzing the mechanisms that cause deterioration of battery performance will lead to R&D that can help to improve the performance and durability of batteries, to bring about longer battery life and longer driving ranges. 1 Methods for observing laminated cells by using high-intensity X-rays and incorporating heavy elements into an electrolyte (According to Toyota Motor Corporation, as of August 2016) 2 Installed as a special-purpose beamline by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc. with the Cooperation of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI). 3 A testing and research facility with the world's highest performance synchrotron radiation comprehensively operated by RIKEN as the facility owner.

      "text": "Toyota says new technology means longer battery life Published: Friday | November 25, 2016 | 12:00 AM AP Toyota Motor Corp engineer Hisao Yamashige speaks to reporters at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office Thursday, November 24, 2016. \nToyota Motor Corp has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles - an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 per cent to 15 per cent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its line-up since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles (EV). Japanese rival Nissan Motor Company leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometres) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organisation Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n- AP ",

      "text": "November 24, 2016 at 16:33 PM EST Toyota Develops World's First Behavior Observation Method for Lithium Ions in Electrolyte \nBreakthrough Contributes to R&D that will Lead to Longer Battery Life and Longer Driving Range for Vehicles Using Lithium ion Batteries \nToyota City, Japan, Nov 24,   Toyota Motor Corporation has developed the world's first(1) method for observing the behavior of lithium ions (Li-ions) in an electrolyte when a Li-ion battery charges and discharges. \nBy using this method, it is possible to observe in real-time, the deviation of Li-ions-one of the causes of deterioration in the performance of Li-ion batteries. Toyota believes that this will provide essential guidelines for R&D that aims to improve the performance and durability of batteries, which would lead to longer battery life, as well as longer driving ranges for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs) and electric vehicles (EVs). \nLi-ion batteries use a metal oxide in the cathode, a carbon material in the anode, and an organic electrolyte for the electrolyte. Lithium ions flow in the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode when the battery is charging, and from the anode to the cathode when the battery is discharging, which results in an electric current flow. Thus, the Li-ions play an essential role within the electrolyte during battery charging and discharging. \nStructure and Principles of an Automotive Li-ion Batteryhttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11241.jpg \nIt has been known that Li-ion deviation occurs in the electrodes and electrolyte as a result of charging and discharging, and such deviation has been believed to limit the usage area of batteries, which is one factor that reduces the area in which the maximum performance of the battery can be achieved. When investigating the mechanism of Li-ion deviation, however, confirming the behavior of Li-ions in the electrolyte under the same environment and conditions as when it is being used in related products was not possible using existing methods. \nCondition While Discharginghttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11242.jpg \nThe two main features of the observation method that Toyota developed to help solve this problem are as follows: \n(1) The Toyota Beamline(2) in the SPring-8(3) synchrotron radiation facility, which generates the world's highest-performance synchrotron radiation, produces high-intensity X-rays that are approximately 1 billion times more powerful than those generated by an X-ray equipment. This makes it possible to create 0.65 micron/pixel high-resolution and 100 ms/frame high-speed measurements. \n(2) In place of the electrolyte with phosphorous that is used in many Li-ion batteries, a new electrolyte with heavy elements is being utilized instead, thus replacing the phosphorous-containing ions that the Li-ions bind to as they move in the electrolyte with heavy element-containing ions. Heavy elements transmit less of the X-rays than phosphorous, and the shadows on the images taken after the X-rays pass through are darker. By observing the behavior of the heavy elements, it is possible to observe the deviation behavior of the Li-ions which are bound to them in the electrolyte. \nNewly-Developed Observation Methodhttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11243.jpg \nBy using the method described above, and a battery that is similar to that of related products such as laminated cell under the environment and conditions that resemble those of actual battery use, it is possible to observe in real-time, the process of Li-ion deviation that occurs in electrolytes during the course of battery charging and discharging. This observational method was jointly developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc., Nippon Soken, Inc., and four universities.(4) \nLi-ion Deviation in Electrolyte During Battery Dischargehttps://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaElectrolyte11244.jpg \nGoing forward, Toyota will observe the behavior of Li-ions caused by differences in the materials and structures of cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes, as well as the differences in battery control. Analyzing the mechanisms that cause deterioration of battery performance will lead to R&D that can help to improve the performance and durability of batteries, to bring about longer battery life and longer driving ranges. \n(1) Methods for observing laminated cells by using high-intensity X-rays and incorporating heavy elements into an electrolyte (According to Toyota Motor Corporation, as of August 2016)(2) Installed as a special-purpose beamline by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc. with the Cooperation of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI).(3) A testing and research facility with the world's highest performance synchrotron radiation comprehensively operated by RIKEN as the facility owner. Operated and maintained by the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI). SPring-8 stands for Super Photon ring-8 GeV.(4) Hokkaido University, Tohoku University, Kyoto University, and Ritsumeikan University. \nAbout Toyota \nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM ), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products. As of the end of December 2013, Toyota conducts its business worldwide with 52 overseas manufacturing companies in 27 countries and regions. Toyota's vehicles are sold in more than 170 countries and regions.   www.toyota-global.com. \nSource: Toyota Toyota Motor Corporation Public Affairs Division Global Communications Department Tel: +81-3-3817-9926 \nCopyright 2016 JCN Newswire .

      "text": "Comment Melissa Riofrio \nElectric and hybrid vehicles have been hailed to be the future of the automobile, as developed countries work in tandem with one another in order to make sure that they end up with less fossil fuels burned, resulting in a cleaner environment for everyone. Of course, a lower dependency on oil for any country is also a good thing, since it would not have its economy being held ransom to the price of oil. Toyota of Japan has long looked into the future where its automobiles are concerned, and I clearly remember how its Prius hybrid vehicle proved to be quite the hit when it was first revealed all those years back, and has continued down a few generations. This time around, we received word that Toyota has succeeded in achieving a breakthrough for its battery technology. This particular breakthrough for batteries will be able to increase the range of electric vehicles by up to 15%. \nAccording to Toyota, this particular technological breakthrough has been described as “the world’s first method for observing the behavior of lithium ions in an electrolyte when a battery charges and discharges.” Being able to to see these ions “work” in real time for the very first time, researchers over at Toyota might have a niggling suspicion that they have finally figured out why a battery ages in time. The point where this particular ends up commercialized might be a couple of three years down the road, resulting in an all new lithium ion battery that might actually see an improvement of up to 15% in terms of range for electric vehicles. \nDr. Hisao Yamashige who hails from Toyota’s advanced R&D and engineering division informed this amazing discovery to a bunch of reporters over at the company’s Tokyo HQ. The road to arrive at this particular destination at the moment has not been an easy one, where it is the culmination of 3 years’ work. The huge synchrotron that is located at the northeast of Kobe, Japan, also has a crucial role to play in Toyota being able to check out the travel of ions from a battery’s minus to its plus side, resulting in electricity. The Spring-8 synchrotron that sports a ring with a 5,000 ft diameter was constructed around a hill in Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture. This synchrotron was then bombarded with radiation at levels a billion times stronger compared to that of a chest X-ray onto the battery, resulting in moving images on a high-speed camera. One of the world’s largest synchrotrons in existence, it was developed alongside the RIKEN Institute and the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute , and this ring has a rental of $600 per hour -- should you prefer to keep the research to yourself. Be generous and publish your research, and it can be used for free, now how about that? \nBasically, Toyota would like to take advantage of this new observation method in order to work on batteries which can hold a charge for a longer period of time, with commercialization being targeted in two years’ time at the earliest. Assuming the Chevrolet Bolt’s official range of 238 miles on a full charge, a 15% increase would see it jump to 273 miles, which is another 35 miles of improvement. Not too shabby, actually. ",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Toyota Motor Corporation ( TM - Free Report ) recently announced that it is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna Minivans in North America. The recall will address the problem of the involuntary opening of the sliding doors while the vehicle is moving. The Sienna Minivans that are being recalled were manufactured between 2011 and 2016. Roughly 774,000 of these vehicles were sold in the U.S. Toyota stated that when the doors of the vehicle are prevented from opening, the motor circuit gets over loaded. In case the vehicle door is unlatched, it could open on its own even when the car is in motion. Toyotais developing a solution for the problem. The company will repair the doors of affected vehicles for free. Customers will likely be notified of the fix by mid-Jan 2017. Recently, Toyota recalled 340,000 gas-electric hybrid Prius cars globally, including 212,000 in Japan and 94,000 in North America. These vehicles faced a defect in the parking brake cable. This defect could result in a car starting to roll and crash if left in any gear except park. The affected cars had been manufactured at the company’s Tsutsumi plant in Toyota city, Japan from Aug 2015 through Oct 2016. Toyota’s shares fell 0.6% to $113.78 on Nov 22. \nTOYOTA MOTOR CP Price",

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker’s Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions’ movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren’t as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world’s major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world’s pure EVs sold. \nToyota’s new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next “several years,” said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Toyota works to develop advanced electric-car battery Thu Nov 24, 2016 2:00am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020. \nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said. \nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said. \n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.
