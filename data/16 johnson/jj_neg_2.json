      "title": "Biotech group Actelion, Johnson & Johnson confirm deal talks",
      "text": "Tweet Share The logo of healthcare company Johnson & Johnson is seen in front of an office building in Zug, Switzerland July 20, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More By Paul Arnold and Ludwig Burger ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare group Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (JNJ.N) and biotech group Actelion (ATLN.S) confirmed they are in talks after media reports about a potential deal sent the Swiss company's stock to a record high. Shares in Actelion had jumped as much as 19 percent on the reports that a takeover may be brewing for the fast-growing biotechnology group. \"Actelion confirmed today that it has been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible transaction. There can be no certainty that a transaction will result,\" Actelion said in a brief statement. Johnson & Johnson called the talks \"preliminary discussions\" and said it would not comment further \"unless and until it is appropriate to do so, or a formal agreement has been reached\". The Swiss lung disease specialist has long been seen as a takeover target, and any deal could prompt competing bids, \"most likely from\" larger Swiss peer Novartis (NOVN.S), one investment banker told Reuters. A person familiar with the situation told Reuters there was broader interest for Actelion from prospective suitors in the industry. Another source close to Novartis, however, said the drugmaker was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline. Some investment bankers who follow the sector closely expressed scepticism that a deal would emerge in the end, calling Actelion an expensive asset whose product line-up would appeal to only a very small field of potential buyers. Actelion shares surged by 18.8 percent at one point to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the share's total gains this year up to Thursday's close. Before Actelion's statement, Eric Le Berrigaud, an analyst at brokerage Bryan Garnier, said he expected big Swiss drugmakers to express interest in Actelion if the talks were confirmed. \"We should then see many other (companies) interested (in Actelion). That will probably include at least one of the two other Basel-based companies,\" Le Berrigaud said, referring to Novartis and Roche (ROG.S). Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid could be worth up to 220 francs or 250 francs per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast growing businesses. Actelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated 1.4 billion this year. ((For a FACTBOX see)) However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake, has repeatedly said in the past he wants the company to remain independent. In 2011, he managed to rally shareholders against activist investor Elliott's campaign to put the biotech firm on the auction block. The shares have more than tripled since then. J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash in September and Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments.

      "text": "By Austen Hufford\nSwiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion Ltd. said Friday that it had been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible deal.\nAs of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs ($16.4 billion). With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion. Johnson & Johnson's market value is more than $300 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose 16% to 182.40 Swiss francs on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nJ&J confirmed Friday that it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Actelion. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion makes drugs for rare diseases, with a focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and in the heart.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by Jean-Paul Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug giant after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website. In 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion francs and a profit of 551.9 million francs.\nJohnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care.\nThe company has been acquisitive as of late. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nBloomberg had reported Thursday that J&J had made an initial bid for the specialty drug company.\nShares of J&J rose 0.7% to $113.91 in morning trading in the U.S.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\n 12:18 ET (17:18 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Send me a copy: Image: Reuters ALSO READ Dabur eyes 75 per cent sales from ayurveda Infrastructure can't slow down march of mobile: Travis Johnson Medical technology majors bat for ease of norms to import refurbished equipment Cipla, Wockhardt join global initiative on tackling drug resistant infections No Indian Pharma company in world Access to Medicine Index Johnson & Johnson has approached Actelion about a potential takeover of the $17-billion Swiss drugmaker as the US health-care giant works to expand its pharmaceutical lineup, people familiar with the matter said. Deliberations are still at an early stage following J&J’s initial offer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Actelion is working with an adviser to explore options, and any discussions may not lead to a transaction, they said. The company may also attract other suitors, such as Novartis AG and Sanofi, separate people with knowledge of the matter said. Representatives for J&J, Allschwil, Switzerland-based Actelion, Novartis and Sanofi declined to comment. Shares of Actelion jumped the most in more than four years. While Actelion, Europe’s largest biotech firm, has been named as a potential takeover target for years, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jean-Paul Clozel has previously said the company planned to remain independent. The 61-year-old, who is one of Actelion’s largest shareholders, may now be more open to entertaining a sale at a sufficient premium, one of the people said. An acquisition would add to the $246 billion of pharmaceutical deals announced this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Actelion rose 11%to 175.90 Swiss francs at 3:41 pm in Zurich Friday after earlier jumping as much as 19 per cent, the biggest intraday gain since April 2012. The shares had risen 13%this year through Thursday, valuing the company at almost $17 billion. New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, with a market capitalisation of about $308 billion, rose less than 1 percent to $113.62. J&J Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso has said he would consider deals of any size that fit into the strategy of building up its three main businesses — consumer, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The company agreed to buy the eye-surgery equipment unit of Abbott Laboratories for $4.33 billion in September. Actelion has brought to market two new lung medicines that are poised to become blockbusters over the next three years. That will reduce dependence on Tracleer, a medicine to treat a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs, which accounted for more than half its revenue last year. Sales of Tracleer may plummet following the introduction of cheaper copycats in the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, revenue from Opsumit is projected to surpass $1 billion next year, while Uptravi is forecast to cross that threshold in 2019, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. For the longer term, the company is also developing experimental drugs for insomnia, lupus and multiple sclerosis.",

      "text": "By Austen Hufford\nSwiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion Ltd. said Friday that it had been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible deal.\nAs of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs ($16.4 billion). With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion. Johnson & Johnson's market value is more than $300 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose 16% to 182.40 Swiss francs on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nJ&J confirmed Friday that it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Actelion. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion makes drugs for rare diseases, with a focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and in the heart.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by Jean-Paul Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug giant after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website. In 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion francs and a profit of 551.9 million francs.\nJohnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care.\nThe company has been acquisitive as of late. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nBloomberg had reported Thursday that J&J had made an initial bid for the specialty drug company.\nShares of J&J rose 0.7% to $113.91 in morning trading in the U.S.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\n 25, 2016 12:18 ET (17:18 ",

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has approached Swiss biotechnology firm Actelion Ltd about a potential takeover, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter. \nThe report said deliberations were still at an early stage following Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) initial offer, and Actelion was working with an adviser to explore options. \nActelion declined to comment. J&J did not respond to a request for comment. \nActelion shares were indicated 6.5 percent higher in pre-market activity in Zurich on Friday. Before Thursday's report, Actelion shares had risen more than 13 percent this year, valuing it at about $17 billion. \n\"With J&J having a market cap exceeding $300 billion, Actelion would clearly be an affordable asset for the company. Less clear to us is the logic of the timing, ahead of a likely favorable ex-U.S. cash repatriation window for U.S. corporates,\" JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said in a note that cited Actelion CEO Jean-Paul Clozel's comments in the past opposing a sale. \n\"We also see little in the way of obvious therapeutic overlap to allow synergies, beyond J&J’s interest in the Xarelto anti-coagulant which could have some modest overlap with cardiologists prescribing PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) therapies,\" they added. \nJ&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this year the company was interested in making deals to expand its main consumer, medical device, and pharmaceuticals segments. He noted that in recent years, J&J had derived about half its revenue from acquired products. \nJ&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash in September. \nIn October, Actelion raised its earnings guidance for the third time this year as sales from its new drugs Opsumit and Uptravi, which treat PAH, for the first time surpassed those of Tracleer, its decade-long mainstay that lost U.S. patent protection last November. \n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Crosby and Mark Potter) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "ALLSCHWIL, Switzerland, Nov. 25 (UPI) -- Johnson & Johnson, a U.S. healthcare giant, said Friday it is in preliminary talks to acquire Actelion, a biopharmaceutical company in Swtizerland.\n\"Actelion confirmed today that it has been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible transaction,\" the company said in a statement. \"There can be no certainty that a transaction will result.\"\n\"There can be no assurance any transaction will result from these discussions,\" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. \"Johnson & Johnson does not intend to make any additional comments regarding these discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so, or a formal agreement has been reached.\"\nIn Zurich, shares of Actelion climbed 17 percent to $181.50, the biggest jump since April 2012. Bloomberg reported Actelion's market valuation at Friday's close was $19.9 billion.\nFounded in late 1997, Actelion is Europe's largest biotech firm and a leader in the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Actelion's two new lung medicines, Opsumit and Uptravi, have surpassed its Tracleer. The older drug lost its U.S. patent protection last year to treat high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs.\nActelion has 2,560 employees and sales of 2.01 billion in 2015, according to its financial statement.\nJohnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J. has approximately 126,900 employees at more than 250 Johnson & Johnson operating companies with sales of $70 billion last year, according to its financial report.\nAccording to its website, Johnson & Johnson \"offers the world's largest range of consumer healthcare products\" in baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care, over-the-counter and women's health products.\nLike UPI.com Related UPI Stories DuPont to end pension contributions, freeze benefit plans Shareholders give green light to $2.6B merger of Tesla, SolarCity Oracle Corp. to acquire web service provider Dyn, Inc.

      "text": "Close The Associated Press \nIn this Oct. 10, 2008, file photo illustration, Johnson & Johnson products are shown in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Johnson & Johnson and biotech group Actelion confirm they're in deal talks Reuters 2 hrs ago ( … ) \nIn this Oct. 10, 2008, file photo illustration, Johnson & Johnson products are shown in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) The Associated Press \nZURICH • Johnson & Johnson and biotech group Actelion confirmed Friday they are in talks after media reports about a potential deal sent the Swiss company's stock to a record high. \nShares in Actelion had jumped as much as 19 percent on the reports that a takeover may be brewing for the fast-growing biotechnology group. \n\"Actelion confirmed today that it has been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible transaction. There can be no certainty that a transaction will result,\" Actelion said in a brief statement. \nJohnson & Johnson called the talks \"preliminary discussions\" and said it would not comment further \"unless and until it is appropriate to do so, or a formal agreement has been reached.\" \nThe Swiss lung disease specialist has long been seen as a takeover target, and any deal could prompt competing bids, \"most likely from\" larger Swiss peer Novartis, one investment banker told Reuters. \nA person familiar with the situation told Reuters there was broader interest for Actelion from prospective suitors in the industry. \nAnother source close to Novartis, however, said the drugmaker was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline. \nSome investment bankers who follow the sector closely expressed scepticism that a deal would emerge in the end, calling Actelion an expensive asset whose product line-up would appeal to only a very small field of potential buyers. \nActelion shares surged by 18.8 percent at one point to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the share's total gains this year up to Thursday's close. \nBefore Actelion's statement, Eric Le Berrigaud, an analyst at brokerage Bryan Garnier, said he expected big Swiss drugmakers to express interest in Actelion if the talks were confirmed.",

      "text": "By Austen Hufford\nSwiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion Ltd. said Friday that it had been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible deal.\nAs of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs ($16.4 billion). With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion. Johnson & Johnson's market value is more than $300 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose 16% to 182.40 Swiss francs on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nJ&J confirmed Friday that it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Actelion. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion makes drugs for rare diseases, with a focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and in the heart.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by Jean-Paul Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug giant after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website. In 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion francs and a profit of 551.9 million francs.\nJohnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care.\nThe company has been acquisitive as of late. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nBloomberg had reported Thursday that J&J had made an initial bid for the specialty drug company.\nShares of J&J rose 0.7% to $113.91 in morning trading in the U.S.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\n 12:18 ET (17:18 ",

      "text": "By Jonathan D. Rockoff\nJohnson & Johnson said Friday it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Swiss drug company Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a deal that would help the health-products company overcome looming competition to its top-selling drug.\nNew Brunswick, N.J.,-based J&J has been trying to reassure Wall Street that it can overcome competition to its drug Remicade, an autoimmune therapy that had $4.5 billion in U.S. sales last year. Pfizer Inc. has said it plans to start selling its copy, Inflectra, in the U.S. this month.\nJ&J has argued that it has several new drugs in development whose launch could make up for any revenue loss. A deal for Actelion, however, would help J&J quickly plug the lost sales, which analysts estimate could amount to $1 billion in 2017.\nActelion sells drugs for rare diseases, such as an artery disorder that affects the lung and heart known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company reported about 1.785 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion) in sales during the first nine months of this year.\nA deal for all of Actelion would come at a steep price. As of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs. With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose nearly 17% to 182.50 Swiss francs ($184.03) on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Friday, after the company confirmed J&J had approached it about a possible transaction. Bloomberg had earlier reported J&J's interest in the Swiss company.\nWith a market value more than $300 billion and billions of dollars in cash overseas, J&J could afford the high price. J&J's biggest deal to date was the $21 billion acquisition of trauma-device maker Synthes in 2011.\nBoth J&J and Actelion cautioned in their statements that a transaction wouldn't necessarily happen. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by husband-and-wife team Jean-Paul and Martine Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug firm after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website.\nIn 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nThis year, it successfully averted a decline in revenue after its best-selling drug Tracleer lost patent protection, thanks to a swift ramp-up in sales for new pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs Opsumit and Uptravi.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion Swiss francs and a profit of 551.9 million Swiss francs ($556.5 million).\nJohnson & Johnson makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nRare diseases aren't an area of focus for the company. Yet Actelion's top-selling drugs could complement J&J's portfolio of heart drugs, and rare-disease therapies would fit with J&J's stated goal of providing treatments that make a difference for patients.\nBig drug companies such as Pfizer and Sanofi SA have prioritized rare diseases, because advances understanding the molecular roots of disease have led to new treatments and health insurers have been willing to pay the high costs because few of their members require treatment.\nShares of J&J rose nearly 1% to close at $114.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.\n--Austen Hufford and Denise Roland contributed to this article\nWrite to Jonathan D.

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson Approaches Swiss Firm Actelion About Potential Deal -- 2nd Update  43:  Johnson & Johnson Approaches Swiss Firm Actelion About Potential Deal -- 2nd Update By Jonathan D. Rockoff \nJohnson & Johnson said Friday it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Swiss drug company Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a deal that would help the health-products company overcome looming competition to its top-selling drug. \nNew Brunswick, N.J.,-based J&J has been trying to reassure Wall Street that it can overcome competition to its drug Remicade, an autoimmune therapy that had $4.5 billion in U.S. sales last year. Pfizer Inc. has said it plans to start selling its copy, Inflectra, in the U.S. this month. \nActelion sells drugs for rare diseases, such as an artery disorder that affects the lung and heart known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company reported about 1.785 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion) in sales during the first nine months of this year. \nA deal for all of Actelion would come at a steep price. As of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs. With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion. \nShares of Actelion rose nearly 17% to 182.50 Swiss francs($184.03) on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Friday, after the company confirmed J&J had approached it about a possible transaction. Bloomberg had earlier reported J&J's interest in the Swiss company. \nWith a market value more than $300 billion and billions of dollars in cash overseas, J&J could afford the high price. J&J's biggest deal to date was the $21 billion acquisition of trauma-device maker Synthes in 2011. \nBoth J&J and Actelion cautioned in their statements that a transaction wouldn't necessarily happen. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive. \nActelion was founded in 1997 by husband-and-wife team Jean-Paul and Martine Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug firm after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website. \nIn 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then. \nThis year, it successfully averted a decline in revenue after its best-selling drug Tracleer lost patent protection, thanks to a swift ramp-up in sales for new pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs Opsumit and Uptravi. \nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion Swiss francs and a profit of 551.9 million Swiss francs ($ 556.5 million). \nJohnson & Johnson makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion. \nRare diseases aren't an area of focus for the company. Yet Actelion's top-selling drugs could complement J&J's portfolio of heart drugs, and rare-disease therapies would fit with J&J's stated goal of providing treatments that make a difference for patients. \nBig drug companies such as Pfizer and Sanofi SA have prioritized rare diseases, because advances understanding the molecular roots of disease have led to new treatments and health insurers have been willing to pay the high costs because few of their members require treatment. \nShares of J&J rose nearly 1% to close at $114.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. \n--Austen Hufford and Denise Roland contributed to this article \nWrite to Jonathan D.

      "text": "Tweet Share A general view shows Swiss biotech group Actelion Headquarters in Allschwil near Basel February 17, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More By Paul Arnold and Ludwig Burger ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion (ATLN.S) about a potential takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion. Lung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur. An acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J's biggest product, an arthritis drug called Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). Actelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock's total gains this year up to Thursday's close. The company's focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses. Actelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated $1.4 billion this year. J&J's shares finished up nearly 1 percent at $114.13. J&J's chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash. Actelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent. In 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management's campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion's shares have more than tripled since then. There may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come \"most likely\" from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG (NOVN.S). Another source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline. Novartis could not be reached for comment. (Additional reporting by Liana B.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Actelion could give Johnson & Johnson hypertension. The Swiss drug maker Actelion, a specialist in blood pressure drugs, is being courted by the American giant, the company said on Friday , confirming a report by Bloomberg . Given Actelion’s high price — its market capitalization reached $18.5 billion in early trading on Friday — Johnson & Johnson would need big cost cuts to make the deal work. Moreover, Actelion is fiercely independent and faces mounting competition. The Swiss company fought off an attempt by Elliott Management to force it into a sale in 2011, and a reported bid by Shire last year. That has had reasonable results for shareholders. Elliott thought Actelion could fetch 70 Swiss francs a share, less than half its current value. Shire’s approach, reported by The Sunday Times of London, would also have been below the current share price. Johnson & Johnson’s approach looks a little odd. Actelion makes drugs for pulmonary arterial hypertension, which can be disabling and shorten lives. There is some overlap with the United States company’s pharmaceutical business, but it is a specialist area, meaning few synergies. The logic might just be that Johnson & Johnson needs to scoop up drugs to bolster a light pipeline and that Actelion’s drugs are growing quickly. Actelion is far from cheap, trading at 20 times forecast earnings, compared with a sector average of about 13 times, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon. Assume Johnson & Johnson is forced to pay a 30-percent premium over a price of 150 Swiss francs a share. Then assume that Johnson & Johnson can rip out 20 percent of Actelion’s operating expenses. That would imply a return on investment of 8.4 percent, below Actelion’s cost of capital, which is likely to be about 10 percent. ",

Merely on the pharmaceutical side, Johnson & Johnson offers 46 drugs raking in over $50 million each, 34 drugs with over $100 million in revenue individually, and 11 blockbuster drugs (over $1 billion each).\nThe company is a natural fit for risk-averse investors searching for the safest dividends .",

      "text": "By Paul Arnold and Ludwig Burger\nZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a potential takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion.\nLung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur.\nAn acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J's biggest product, an arthritis drug called Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc .\nActelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock's total gains this year up to Thursday's close.\nThe company's focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure.\nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses.\nActelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated $1.4 billion this year.\nJ&J's shares finished up nearly 1 percent at $114.13.\nJ&J's chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash.\nActelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent.\nIn 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management's campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion's shares have more than tripled since then.\nThere may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come \"most likely\" from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG .\nAnother source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline. Novartis could not be reached for comment.\n(Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies in London and Michael Shields and John Miller in Zurich and Liana B.

      "text": "By Jonathan D. Rockoff\nJohnson & Johnson said Friday it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Swiss drug company Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a deal that would help the health-products company overcome looming competition to its top-selling drug.\nNew Brunswick, N.J.,-based J&J has been trying to reassure Wall Street that it can overcome competition to its drug Remicade, an autoimmune therapy that had $4.5 billion in U.S. sales last year. Pfizer Inc. has said it plans to start selling its copy, Inflectra, in the U.S. this month.\nJ&J has argued that it has several new drugs in development whose launch could make up for any revenue loss. A deal for Actelion, however, would help J&J quickly plug the lost sales, which analysts estimate could amount to $1 billion in 2017.\nActelion sells drugs for rare diseases, such as an artery disorder that affects the lung and heart known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company reported about 1.785 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion) in sales during the first nine months of this year.\nA deal for all of Actelion would come at a steep price. As of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs. With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose nearly 17% to 182.50 Swiss francs ($184.03) on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Friday, after the company confirmed J&J had approached it about a possible transaction. Bloomberg had earlier reported J&J's interest in the Swiss company.\nWith a market value more than $300 billion and billions of dollars in cash overseas, J&J could afford the high price. J&J's biggest deal to date was the $21 billion acquisition of trauma-device maker Synthes in 2011.\nBoth J&J and Actelion cautioned in their statements that a transaction wouldn't necessarily happen. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by husband-and-wife team Jean-Paul and Martine Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug firm after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website.\nIn 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nThis year, it successfully averted a decline in revenue after its best-selling drug Tracleer lost patent protection, thanks to a swift ramp-up in sales for new pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs Opsumit and Uptravi.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion Swiss francs and a profit of 551.9 million Swiss francs ($556.5 million).\nJohnson & Johnson makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nRare diseases aren't an area of focus for the company. Yet Actelion's top-selling drugs could complement J&J's portfolio of heart drugs, and rare-disease therapies would fit with J&J's stated goal of providing treatments that make a difference for patients.\nBig drug companies such as Pfizer and Sanofi SA have prioritized rare diseases, because advances understanding the molecular roots of disease have led to new treatments and health insurers have been willing to pay the high costs because few of their members require treatment.\nShares of J&J rose nearly 1% to close at $114.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.\n--Austen Hufford and Denise Roland contributed to this article\nWrite to Jonathan D.

      "text": "By Jonathan D. Rockoff\nJohnson & Johnson said Friday it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Swiss drug company Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a deal that would help the health-products company overcome looming competition to its top-selling drug.\nNew Brunswick, N.J.,-based J&J has been trying to reassure Wall Street that it can overcome competition to its drug Remicade, an autoimmune therapy that had $4.5 billion in U.S. sales last year. Pfizer Inc. has said it plans to start selling its copy, Inflectra, in the U.S. this month.\nJ&J has argued that it has several new drugs in development whose launch could make up for any revenue loss. A deal for Actelion, however, would help J&J quickly plug the lost sales, which analysts estimate could amount to $1 billion in 2017.\nActelion sells drugs for rare diseases, such as an artery disorder that affects the lung and heart known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company reported about 1.785 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion) in sales during the first nine months of this year.\nA deal for all of Actelion would come at a steep price. As of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs. With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose nearly 17% to 182.50 Swiss francs ($184.03) on the SIX Swiss Exchange on Friday, after the company confirmed J&J had approached it about a possible transaction. Bloomberg had earlier reported J&J's interest in the Swiss company.\nWith a market value more than $300 billion and billions of dollars in cash overseas, J&J could afford the high price. J&J's biggest deal to date was the $21 billion acquisition of trauma-device maker Synthes in 2011.\nBoth J&J and Actelion cautioned in their statements that a transaction wouldn't necessarily happen. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by husband-and-wife team Jean-Paul and Martine Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug firm after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website.\nIn 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nThis year, it successfully averted a decline in revenue after its best-selling drug Tracleer lost patent protection, thanks to a swift ramp-up in sales for new pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs Opsumit and Uptravi.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion Swiss francs and a profit of 551.9 million Swiss francs ($556.5 million).\nJohnson & Johnson makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nRare diseases aren't an area of focus for the company. Yet Actelion's top-selling drugs could complement J&J's portfolio of heart drugs, and rare-disease therapies would fit with J&J's stated goal of providing treatments that make a difference for patients.\nBig drug companies such as Pfizer and Sanofi SA have prioritized rare diseases, because advances understanding the molecular roots of disease have led to new treatments and health insurers have been willing to pay the high costs because few of their members require treatment.\nShares of J&J rose nearly 1% to close at $114.13 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.\n--Austen Hufford and Denise Roland contributed to this article\nWrite to Jonathan D.

      "text": "Related Content View Photo A general view shows Swiss biotech group Actelion Headquarters in Allschwil near Basel February 17, 2015. …\nBy Paul Arnold and Ludwig Burger\nZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion (ATLN.S) about a potential takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion. \nLung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur.\nAn acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J's biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).\nActelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock's total gains this year up to Thursday's close.\nThe company's focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure.\nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses.\nActelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated $1.4 billion this year.\nJ&J's shares finished up nearly 1 percent at $114.13.\nJ&J's chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash.\nActelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent.\nIn 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management's campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion's shares have more than tripled since then.\nThere may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come \"most likely\" from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG (NOVN.S).\nAnother source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline.\nA spokesman from Novartis declined to comment.\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies in London and Michael Shields and John Miller in Zurich and Liana B.

      "text": "International Business Johnson & Johnson approaches Actelion about takeover deal U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a potential takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, currently valued at about US$20 billion. Posted 26 Nov 2016 01:30 Updated 26 Nov 2016 08:40 A general view shows Swiss biotech group Actelion Headquarters in Allschwil near Basel February 17, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann A \nZURICH/FRANKFURT: U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a potential takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, currently valued at about US$20 billion. \nLung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur. \nAn acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J's biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc . \nActelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around US$20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock's total gains this year up to Thursday's close. \nThe company's focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure. \nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs (US$217) or 250 Swiss francs (US$246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses. \nActelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than US$4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated US$1.4 billion this year. \nJ&J's shares finished up nearly 1 percent at US$114.13. \nJ&J's chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about US$4.33 billion in cash. \nActelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent. \nIn 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management's campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion's shares have more than tripled since then. \nThere may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come \"most likely\" from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG . \nAnother source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline. \nA spokesman from Novartis declined to comment. \n(Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies in London and Michael Shields and John Miller in Zurich and Liana B.

      "text": " count=\"51\" data-total-count=\"51\">Actelion could give Johnson & Johnson hypertension. The Swiss drug maker Actelion, a specialist in blood pressure drugs, is being courted by the American giant, the company said on Friday , confirming a report by Bloomberg . Given Actelion’s high price — its market capitalization reached $18.5 billion in early trading on Friday — Johnson & Johnson would need big cost cuts to make the deal work. Moreover, Actelion is fiercely independent and faces mounting competition.\nThe Swiss company fought off an attempt by Elliott Management to force it into a sale in 2011, and a reported bid by Shire last year. That has had reasonable results for shareholders. Elliott thought Actelion could fetch 70 Swiss francs a share, less than half its current value. Shire’s approach, reported by The Sunday Times of London, would also have been below the current share price.\nJohnson & Johnson’s approach looks a little odd. Actelion makes drugs for pulmonary arterial hypertension, which can be disabling and shorten lives. There is some overlap with the United States company’s pharmaceutical business, but it is a specialist area, meaning few synergies. The logic might just be that Johnson & Johnson needs to scoop up drugs to bolster a light pipeline and that Actelion’s drugs are growing quickly.\nActelion is far from cheap, trading at 20 times forecast earnings, compared with a sector average of about 13 times, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon. Assume Johnson & Johnson is forced to pay a 30-percent premium over a price of 150 Swiss francs a share. Then assume that Johnson & Johnson can rip out 20 percent of Actelion’s operating expenses. That would imply a return on investment of 8.4 percent, below Actelion’s cost of capital, which is likely to be about 10 percent.\n Johnson & Johnson might be able to make the numbers work. If it tears up Actelion’s research and development budget, the return on capital would stretch to a more acceptable 9.3 percent.\nJohnson & Johnson may also be looking for a home for its cash held outside the United States, Barclays analysts suggest, so there could be other indirect benefits for a buyer.\nStill, this is a risky bet. The Actelion boss, Jean-Paul Clozel, may not want to sell, and may demand a fat premium. And Actelion itself faces competition as its drugs and those of its rivals lose patent protection. A generic version of its flagship drug Tracleer is expected soon . Letairis, the competitor to Actelion’s top-selling drug Opsumit, will lose exclusivity in 2018. Johnson & Johnson should avoid the tears.",

      "text": "By Paul Arnold and Ludwig Burger | ZURICH/FRANKFURT \nZURICH/FRANKFURT U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion ( ATLN.S ) about a potential takeover of Europe’s largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion. \nLung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur. \nAn acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J’s drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J’s biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ). \nActelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock’s total gains this year up to Thursday’s close. \nThe company’s focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure. \nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses. \nActelion’s Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated $1.4 billion this year. \nJ&J’s shares finished up nearly 1 percent at $114.13. \nJ&J’s chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories’ ( ABT.N ) eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash. \nActelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent. \nIn 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management’s campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion’s shares have more than tripled since then. \nThere may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come “most likely” from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG ( NOVN.S ). \nAnother source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion’s drug pipeline. \nA spokesman from Novartis declined to comment. \n(Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies in London and Michael Shields and John Miller in Zurich and Liana B.
