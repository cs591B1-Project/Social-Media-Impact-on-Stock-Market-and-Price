      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nMy setup involves a Microsoft Azure VM instance running Server 2012, connected to a Azure SQL Database V12 server on another instance. \nI've set up an SSTP VPN on the server, and it works. Clients connecting to it do not use the server gateway, since its purpose is to host network shares and not to proxy traffic. The database server is set to refuse connections from anything but the VPN server. \nI would like to have the database accessible through the VPN, but am having trouble routing the traffic from the VPN server to the database — specifically, I'd like to have the database accessible on 192.168.26.1 . I've opened port 1433, and added a TCP port forward with: netsh add v4tov4 listenaddress=192.168.26.1 listenport=1433 connectaddress=<database hostname> connectport=1433 \nWhen I attempt to connect to the database through 192.168.26.1 on a client machine, netstat on the VPN server shows: > netstat -an | findstr 1433 TCP 10.0.0.4:51056 <database ip>:1433 TIME_WAIT TCP 192.168.26.1:1433 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING \nSimilarly, netstat on the client (a Windows 10 machine) shows a brief connection to 192.168.26.1:1433 . \nFrom this, I am led to believe the connection to the database is being made through the VPN, however when attempting to connect to the database through the 192.168.26.1 proxy, SSMS says: \nYour client IP address does not have access to the server. Sign in to an Azure account and create a new firewall rule to enable access. \nFollowing the instructions leads Azure to wanting to add my client IP to an allowed firewall rule. However, shouldn't the connection have been made through the VPN? netstat seems to say so, so why am I being asked to add my client IP? \nFor my SQL credentials, I use 192.168.26.1 as the server name, and <username>@<database hostname> as the login. This works from a Remote Desktop Connection on the VPN server. \nWhat's going on?",

      "text": "For my sins, I was asked back to FutureDecoded again this year to give a talk on the Microsoft UWP platform, specifically about bringing games to the XboxOne using UWP.  By all accounts the session went well (especially as there was standing room only by the time the talk started). With it being just two days in the London ExCeL exhibition center, not everyone who wanted to make it could, in fact even some people were contacting me on the day saying they were in other sessions at that time but wanted more info.\nSo for everyone who couldn’t make it on the day or missed the session (or for those wanting a recap), I’ve recorded the session at home and published it on my “ Darkside of MonoGame ” Youtube channel. (I just have to hope my MonoGame friends will forgive me for featuring Unity on there for a bit.)\nYou might also ask “Why all the Fuss?” Well, the answer is simple. Microsoft just opened up the XboxOne to UWP developers, allowing any retail Xbox One to become a development machine and test / deploy and publish UWP projects to the Xbox One Store. It’s like Christmas has come again for those of us who remember the Xbox Live Indie Game platform and the thrill of writing your own games and running them on your home Xbox.\nJust What Is UWP? (The Universal Windows Platform) \n\n\nI’ve posted a few times about the UWP platform, but to recap, UWP is Microsoft’s latest endeavor to make it even easier for developers to be able to publish on Windows platforms. So much so, that now you only need one project to be able to deploy on to all of their Windows 10 platforms, this includes:\nWindows 10 desktop. Windows 10 Mobile. Xbox. (supported) IoT devices. Surface Hub. HoloLens. Plus, any other devices that Microsoft decides to roll out on to from now on.\nIt pretty much sounds like a multi-platform dream, and it certainly is. But how does UWP handle all the different variations on its platform? Each device is different and has its own unique characteristics. The answer, in this case, is “Extensions.”\n\n\n\nAs you might expect, Windows 10 has a single “core” that runs on all devices, in exactly the same way. Then for those little extras, the UWP platform provides an “Extension” component that is specific to each platform. However, these extensions are also expressed on all the other platforms, so your code doesn’t break and you write the same code as if you were writing for them all. Where a device doesn’t support a certain feature (say the Holographic API on an Xbox), then the code simply does nothing, it doesn’t error, it doesn’t crash, your code still works but nothing actually happens. For those platforms with that feature, lights start shining, the bells ring and the choir sings out with joyful praise.\nAlso as part of this “Extension” framework, Microsoft gives you the ability to test if a feature is available or not, allowing you to write different code depending on whether the feature is active, like if you want to use a device's accelerometer if it has one, or use a virtual joystick on a desktop with a touch screen, or fall back to keyboard if hat isn’t available. Sure, there is a bit of thought to go into building for “Any” device but that is the trade-off for building one solution.\nBut What About the Games? \n\n\nWhen we start looking at building games under UWP, there is a lot of support (that is constantly growing) from third parties. As you can see most of the major engines and frameworks already support the Universal platform out of the box, making it even easier to publish your game as a UWP app.\nStill not see any engine or feature you like, then there is always the ultimate fallback:\n\n\n\nUnder the hood, UWP Games are just a DirectX surface and you can write games using native DirectX in either C# or C++, there are even Visual Studio Templates “out of the box” for UWP as well.\nGetting Started With UWP on Xbox \n\n\nNow that UWP apps can be deployed / tested and run by anyone with a Retail Xbox, we can go wild and try out our own games to see how they run on the big screen. Once you lick all the bugs and get it just right, you can publish that game “as is” to the Xbox Store. Well, once you have your project accepted by the ID@Xbox team (which is even easier for UWP developers now)\nSo long as you have a Windows 10 PC and a retail Xbox, your good to go as everything else is free, the tools, the software, even the ability to switch your retail XboxOne over to a UWP dev kit. All from the comfort of your own home (or hotel room with free wifi)\nThere is one other caveat, that you need to also have a Windows Store developer account. This normally costs about £19 for an individual, a little more for a company account. You can either get this yourself, or when you are accepted by ID, you will get this account plus a load of other software completely FREE. Up to you.\nP.S. If you have an MSDN account, you also get a code for FREE, check your benefits.\nSetting Up Your Development Environment \n\n\nOnce you have everything ready, getting started couldn’t be simpler and there are only a few short steps. As the slide above shows, you can get up and running with your first project deployed in just five minutes. (if you're using Unity, it might take a little longer )\nIn short, what you need to do is:\n1: Install the “Dev Mode Activation” app on to your Xbox from the Xbox Store\n2: Launch the “Dev Mode Activation” app. You will be presented with a code and a URL. Navigate to the URL on your PC, sign in with your Windows Account (same one used with your Xbox Live Gamertag) and enter the code to register the Xbox to your Microsoft Account\n3: Once complete, your Xbox will automatically refresh and then ask you to restart.\nThis will now boot your Xbox in to UWP developer mode with a completely separate sandbox inside your Xbox.\nYour Retail settings / apps are still safe on your Xbox, you just can’t access them from developer mode. You can return to Retail mode at any time.\n4: Once you have signed in to your Xbox using your Microsoft account, you can launch the Developer Portal app on the Xbox.\nThis shows you all the apps / games installed plus a ton of other developer details.\nTake note of the Tools IP in case Visual Studio doesn’t automatically detect it.\n5: The first time you connect to your Xbox from Visual Studio (selecting the deployment as remote and selecting the Xbox, as shown here) you will be asked for a code to pair the Xbox.\nYou get this code from the Developer Portal on the Xbox in the “Pair with Visual Studio” section.\nVisual Studio and the Xbox must be signed in using the same Microsoft account you activated with.\n6: Done. You should now be able to deploy and run games from Visual Studio on your Xbox.\nYou can also see debugging information from your Xbox (providing your local network supports it) while the game is running.\nJust make sure you Run in “Release” or “Master” mode when looking at performance issues as the debugger has an impact.\n\n\nAnd that’s it. You are up and running. The security of the setup ensures that you (and only you) can connect to your Xbox in dev mode and deploy apps, so long as you use the same Microsoft account for everything. You can still sign in other gamers, using their GamerTags for local multi-player (although you can’t grant gamerscore ). If you also are a member of ID and have access to to the Live SDK and services, you can also test networked multi-player and all the other Live services.\nChecking Out the Demos For the demos, you are going to need to watch the video but here are some handy links to the start of each demo:\n*Click on images to view the demos \nWhat’s Next? \nRight, so you have your project ready, plans are afoot and you know what you either want to build or have a tech-demo (or even a full project) ready. To get ready to be published on the Xbox and Windows Store (for games) you need to be registered with the awesome ID@Xbox program. In the past, some developers have been a bit disillusioned with the responses to the program but times have changed . The team has evolved (especially with UWP deploy now coming to light) and it’s now even more streamlined to get access to the program.\nOnce registered and signed up, the ID team are fully behind you, giving you:\nFree software and a Windows Store account Access to all major gaming events Support through the MS Game Developer network Enablement to Xbox Live for access to achievements, networking, leader boards and much more. My recommendation (especially if you have a mobile game already or the beginnings of a desktop app) is to apply just for Windows 10 first, get your project out there in the hands of players and then either publish it as a UWP to Xbox or then also apply for the Xbox tier to build a native game (although check the next section for more detail on that). Windows 10 has much easier access but has all the same rewards for all ID developers, it also has fewer requirements and certifications to get published (you can’t ship a game that randomly crashes for instance!).\nThe key here is that you are getting your game out as early as possible, getting it into the hands of players and gaining presence. I state this in the video but you must be prepared for the amount of footwork you need to put into promoting your game with the general public. ID will be behind you every step of the way to take your content further (many ID games are now even getting in front of Major Nelson these days, thanks to ID). I will stress though, expect a lot of work, ID won’t do it for you and you need to be ready to produce high quality videos, marketing material and make yourself available. At least 80% of the effort in your game will come from the last 20% (as they say).\nIf you want your game to be successful, you need to be out there building presence and touting your game! Only you can promote your game the best way. (But ID will help with guidance and weight) \n \nKey Differences Between UWP and Native \n\n\nTo round this session up and to allay some of the concerns and comments I’ve either heard or been asked about UWP on Xbox, I’ll walk through some of the key differences between publishing UWP on Xbox and going native.\nUWP Projects in short, UWP is simply easier. It’s a friendlier platform and the key benefit is that the single project you build, is also directly shippable on all of Microsoft’s other Windows 10 platforms.\n\n\n\nWhile at FutureDecoded , the VISR-VR team showcased an awesome VR project aimed at helping children and adults who suffer from autism called Botanika \n(it’s also a fun game for anyone btw ). \nThis game was written in Unity, running as a UWP using the Vive VR setup. To make it even more amazing, the lead developer spent 10 minutes converting the project over the HoloLens (the night before the event no less) and had it running perfectly. Granted it wasn’t the full scope of the project but all the key elements were there, all now using HoloLens’s gestures to control the game instead of the Vive Controllers.\nGetting Botanika up and running in about 10 minutes on a HoloLens in Unity was an awesome effort Louis! \nWhen publishing UWP games to the Xbox, there are slightly fewer resources to native games (about 70% of resources are available) but there are also fewer certification requirements, meaning fewer headaches trying to figure out why a controller keeps getting disconnected. As the demo’s show, there is a LOT you can get done with that 70% (remembering, it’s 70% of a very powerful beast, do not be fooled into thinking it’s not much)\nNative Development If you get invited into the Xbox Native group, which is a tougher crowd and you need your project to shine, you will be given two developer-enabled Xboxs and a couple of years to get your project “finished.”\nA great number of developers are also taking up Microsoft’s offer of getting a “ Preview ” version of their title out even earlier to consumers. Something not offered on other platforms. Yes, it’s more work but it means you get to build more presence and get feedback direct from your players while building.\nI cannot stress more, just how much extra effort is needed to get a native Xbox game out, apart from the stricter certification requirements (which with some engines, you can run into trouble if it’s the engine causing the issue). Most certification builds take months of testing and validation to get ready. There are also stricter controls placed on console projects from a ratings perspective (and in some cases, quite costly), IARC hasn’t reached Xbox native yet (like with the Windows Store) but hopefully it will be coming soon.\nThere is also the fact that in a lot of cases, you will need C++ skills (or contract them) to work on the interconnectedness of things, or if you need the utmost performance on the platform. Although, I’ve known a fair few devs who haven’t had to go down this route but there are always compromises.\nSumming Up \n\n\nThe world just got that little bit bigger and if you are already working on a project for Windows 10, the reach of your title has now opened up even more and for very little effort. If you want to then use the success of your game to then build the “Evolved” edition and build that native later, then you already have a foot in the door and it also becomes easier (although harder from an effort perspective )\nSo, if you want to build one game and ship it on to several platforms at once, then UWP is the answer (yes I know mobile share is small at present but MS is still committed to it ). You’ll still be able to take it to other platforms later as most engines and frameworks also support more than UWP, so if you architect your project right, the world is your oyster.\nIf you are making games these days, NEVER restrict or limit your dream to one platform. Go BIG, go WILD and get out there!",

      "title": "Faking DateTime Using Microsoft Fakes Seems to Be Broken Web Dev",
      "text": "It seems as if causing  DateTime.Now  to return another value has become the demo to show when demoing an unconstrained Mocking framework. It’s easy to show and needed in many unit tests – unless you want your tests to be affected by time – trust me and you don’t.\nThat’s why I was amazed to find out that the demo from MSDN which showed how to use Shims has somehow stopped working…\nWhat I Initially Did In order to start using Microsoft Fakes you need to use Visual Studio  Enterprise  edition – I’ve used VS2015 update 5 in this case.\nThe next step is to right click on the assembly you need to fake and choose  Add Fake Assembly \n\nThis will generate the same assembly followed  .fakes  so if you’re faking  MyAssembly  a new  MyAssembly.Fakes  will be created this is not the case with  System  as I was quickly reminded.\nNow according to my knowledge and the demos at hand all I needed to do now is find  ShimDateTime  and use some magic to change how it behaved – but it was nowhere to be found – in fact, I could not see anything to do with  DateTime  which I know for certain existed inside  System .\nIt took me a while to get it but looking at the project’s references showed the problem:\n\nYou see – usually when faking  System  two fake assemblies are created – one for System and one for  mscorlib  where the good stuff is.\nYou can even see that under  Fakes  folder there are two configuration files one for each – but no  mscorlib  to be found.\nThe Solution? I did what any developer would have done: I’ve decided to repeat the same process again expecting different results. Actually, first I Googled a bit and found very little information.\nAnd so I need to delete three files – the fakes assembly and two configuration files (fake configuration?) and try again – and I got the exact same mess.\nAfter trying two more time – just to make sure I’ve decided to check the output window and saw the following:\n\nArmed with this new knowledge I’ve decided to dig into some documentation and found that some new breaking changes caused issues when creating fakes and quick workaround would be to remove a few classes from the  “ To fake list” and so I’ve opened  mscorlib.fakes  configuration file and written (read: pasted) the following code:\n<Fakes xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/fakes/2011/\"> <Assembly Name=\"mscorlib\" Version=\"4.0.0.0\"/> <StubGeneration> <Remove FullName=\"System.Diagnostics.Tracing\"/> <Remove FullName=\"System.Text.Encoding\"/> <Remove FullName=\"System.Security.Cryptography\" /> </StubGeneration> </Fakes> \nNext, I’ve deleted  System.4.0.0.0.Fakes  and  system.fakes  and right-clicked  System->Add Fakes Assembly  and got the following:\n\nAnd now I was able to write my test using my  DateTime  of choosing.\nFrustrating? you bet! but at least now I know a quick workaround and able to test time-based code – if all I have is Microsoft Fakes.",

      "text": "print Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Thomson Reuters \nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff made it clear he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella. \nSpeaking at the Code Conference on Monday, Benioff talked about the short-lived bromance between the two companies and how it all ended up falling apart over a course of just two years. \nIn particular, Benioff pointed to a meeting that took place between him and Microsoft's cloud boss Scott Guthrie that really killed the trust he had placed in the company. \nThe story goes that Benioff took a meeting with Guthrie after his old friend and Microsoft chairman John Thompson connected the two last year. He believed the meeting was intended to share more about Salesforce's business in hopes of possibly becoming an Azure cloud customer one day. But that wasn't Microsoft's real goal, according to Benioff. He said: \"The message was 'Why don’t you meet with Scott Guthrie? He runs Azure and would really like to walk you through the details of your business because maybe we could get Salesforce to run on Azure'... and I'm like OK, and it was clear also that he was someone not in our business, he was running Azure.\" \nBut then a couple weeks later, Benioff found out through press reports that Guthrie had suddenly been promoted to also run Microsoft's CRM business, which is a direct competitor to Salesforce. Things got even worse when Salesforce was disinvited from a Microsoft customer event without prior notice. Benioff continued: \n\"I just came to the conclusion at that point that the new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft. ... And little things like this started stacking up and we put it all together, I don’t feel like this is exactly the new Microsoft that we were looking for.\" \nSalesforce and Microsoft were not always on the best terms before Nadella became CEO in 2014. The old Microsoft is known for not being particularly friendly with outside partners and Benioff used to openly criticize ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. \nNadella was different, quickly becoming good friends with Benioff, and even speaking at Salesforce's big annual conference Dreamforce for the first time in 2015. \nBut the relationship took a quick turn lately after Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn earlier this year. \nSalesforce is now trying to convince European regulators to block or impose certain conditions on the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal, claiming it would shutter access to LinkedIn's data. Salesforce, meanwhile, signed a deal with Amazon Web Services, instead of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform this year.",

      "text": "News Microsoft, Nvidia work to speed up AI platform powering Cortana Microsoft and Nvidia collaborate to boost the deep-learning capabilities of CNTK, the underlying AI technology behind Cortana and Skype language translator More like this \nNvidia's DGX-1 supercomputer packs the horsepower of 250 servers. Credit: Nvidia Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 7:00 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nThanks to artificial intelligence, we have autonomous cars, chat bots, and speech recognition. Microsoft's CNTK (Cognitive Toolkit) is one among many platforms that trains computers to learn, and it's getting an upgrade. \nCNTK drives the Microsoft services Cortana and Skype language translation, and it boasts more than 90 percent accuracy in speech recognition tasks. Microsoft will soon release an upgraded CNTK toolkit, and one hardware maker wants to ensure the toolkit works best on its hardware. \nNvidia is partnering with Microsoft to optimize its GPU development tools for CNTK. The companies have created a set of deep-learning algorithms and libraries that will speed up CNTK to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition on GPUs. \n[ Also on CIO.com: The whiteboards of tomorrow: 3 interactive displays ] \nDeep-learning tools like CNTK are sandboxes in which developers can create a model for computers to solve a particular problem. The ultimate objective is to build a well-trained model that can accurately perform a specific task, such as shuffling through loads of medical data to diagnose a disease. \nBased on input, researchers are continuously modifying models and tweaking parameters. One such tweak optimizes neural networking connections for better AI capabilities and for scaling the training model over more GPUs and servers. \nThe training of computer models can run for days and require intense computing horsepower. GPUs power deep learning for companies like Google and Facebook, and Microsoft is allowing some customers to test GPUs as part of its Azure cloud service. The updated CNTK tools will run faster on Microsoft's Azure N Series cloud offerings, which run on GPUs based on Nvidia's older Kepler and Maxwell architectures. \nThe updated CNTK tools could be bought on-premises with Nvidia's DGX supercomputer, which costs US$129,000 and has eight Tesla P100 GPUs based on the latest Pascal architecture. \nNvidia has been working closely to optimize its GPU deep-learning libraries for the upcoming CNTK release, said Ian Buck, vice president for accelerated computing at Nvidia. \nGPUs from Nvidia already work on CNTK with existing libraries, but the new framework will provide a big performance upgrade. There is a 7.4 fold improvement in deep-learning training times across eight GPUs in a system, Buck said. \nBuck declined to comment on when the new tools would be released. \nNvidia has made improvements in tools like CUDNN, which provides the libraries and algorithms for GPU-based deep-learning. CUDNN is a core underlying technology of CUDA, which is Nvidia's parallel programming framework. \nThere are other deep-learning frameworks like Google's Tensor, Theano, and the open-source Caffe, which excels at image recognition. Companies like Intel and IBM have forked those frameworks to work best with their hardware. Nvidia's GPUs already support most of the deep-learning frameworks, but CNTK now has an edge. \nGoogle has come out with its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit, which is designed to improve deep learning results. Google can afford to build its own hardware because it deploys deep learning across on a larger scale, but it could be expensive for smaller companies to deploy deep-learning systems; instead they can turn to cloud services like Azure.

      "text": "up vote 1 down vote favorite \nI'm a web developer of many years. I've grown tired on the Microsoft scene, so I'm moving on to other Operating Systems - Mac OS and Ubuntu/Linux. I have to stay marketable and that's where everything's headed. \nIn any case, I'm taking on Ubuntu. I am a complete newbie at it. I was surprised though that I was able to select the type of Linux Distribution I wanted and in this case it was Ubuntu 15.10. I am still using PCs. I don't want Windows in the way AT ALL. So I decided to download the Linux ISO and installed Ubuntu on a USB. I feel safer doing this until I get famliar with the OS. To get to Ubuntu, I simply changed the boot settings on one of my machines to boot from the USB first instead of the hard drive. I was surprised how little time it took to do this - just a little reading and voila, I was looking at the Ubuntu desktop. \nHere's my question. I've been going through tutorials and some of these tutorials recommend downloading of softwares to help with Ubuntu configurations. One such utility suggested is \"Unity Toolkit\" - I believe that's the name. \nMy question is - If you have downloaded Ubuntu/Linux distribution to your USB, will ALL of the downloads you perform and install be installed on the USB. I don't want to mix anything I'm doing with Ubuntu onto Windows. So I want to make sure before I start downloading things and playing with it. \nI recall that when I created the ISO, I was asked for an allocation of how much space to leave for soemthing?? Was this allocationn for downloads etc. on my USB? \nI just want to verify everything is targeted to the USB if I have Ubuntu pulled up on my Windows machine. \nThanks in advance for your help.",

      "text": "Microsoft Announces Visual Studio for Mac Microsoft Announces Visual Studio for Mac By 0 \nMicrosoft announced today plans to release Visual Studio for Mac at the upcoming Connect() conference set to start this Wednesday on November 16. \nThe move to port Visual Studio, one of Microsoft's most defining products next to Windows and the Office Suite, isn't surprising in the big picture. \nOn the development scene, Microsoft has been very friendly as of late. After announcing it would contribute code to the Linux project, porting the Linux bash for Windows 10, open-sourcing the Roslyn .NET compiler platform, developing TypeScript, open-sourcing Edge's JavaScript engine, keeping Xamarin open source after its acquisition, and more, the Redmond company has made another unexpected move. Visual Studio for Mac goes after cloud and mobile developers \nBy porting Visual Studio to the Mac, Microsoft wants to keep developers using its tools, and all its adjacent services, most of which are very Azure-friendly, one of Microsoft's major revenue streams. \nAzure, who is quite a reputable and reliable service on its own, has had little growth, thanks to the perceived vendor lock-in that many developers expect when dealing with Microsoft products. \nBy porting Visual Studio to the Mac, and open-sourcing more and more of its products, Microsoft is winking at developers and showing them the door. Basically, the decision to port Visual Studio for the Mac is entirely money-driven, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad decision. The same Visual Studio as before \nAs for the application itself, Visual Studio for Mac is the exact same Visual Studio developers have come accustomed to, only with a Mac-like GUI. \n\"At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio,\" Mikayla Hutchinson, senior program manager on Xamarin Platform at Microsoft explains. \n\"If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home,\" Hutchinson continues. \"It's UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.\" A preview will be available on Microsoft's website \nA preview version of Visual Studio for Mac will be available through the Visual Studio website after the Connect() conference. Initial Visual Studio for Mac features include support for IntelliSense, NuGet, TextMate bundles, extensive debugging features, live previews, and a project system and build engine that still uses MSBuild, despite working on a Mac. \nEven if Visual Studio for Mac supports creating Windows apps, Microsoft expects developers to use it for primarily developing native iOS, Android and Mac apps (via the Xamarin integration) and server development via .NET Core (via the Azure integration). \nUnder the hood, Visual Studio for Mac is written in C# and on top of the open-source MonoDevelop IDE, on which the Xamarin Studio app is also built. This also means that developers can extend it to support new languages and project types not included in Microsoft's upcoming official version. \nA basic introduction to the new Mac version is available on the MSDN portal .",

      "text": "  \nCurrently on Windows 10 devices , only first-party Microsoft apps can send notifications during the user-specified Quiet Hours. That’s about to change according to a post in Microsoft’s User Voice feedback forums which says that the company has begun testing the change with Windows Insiders. \n“We just enabled this in the next Insider fast-ring flight of the Creators Update! All third-party alarm apps will break through quiet hours now, just like the first-party alarm app!” the post says . “Thank you everyone for letting us know that this feature was important to you!” \nHave you been wanting this change made or do you prefer to have as many apps as possible locked out of notifications during Quiet Hours? Let us know  ",

      "text": "NVIDIA and Microsoft Accelerate AI Together GPU-Accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit Now Available in the Cloud on Microsoft Azure and On-Premises with NVIDIA DGX-1\nSALT LAKE CITY, UT--(Marketwired - Nov 14, 2016) - SC16 -- To help companies join the AI revolution, NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate AI in the enterprise.\nUsing the first purpose-built enterprise AI framework optimized to run on NVIDIA® Tesla® GPUs in Microsoft Azure or on-premises, enterprises now have an AI platform that spans from their data center to Microsoft's cloud.\n\"Every industry has awoken to the potential of AI,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. \"We've worked with Microsoft to create a lightning-fast AI platform that is available from on-premises with our DGX-1™ supercomputer to the Microsoft Azure cloud. With Microsoft's global reach, every company around the world can now tap the power of AI to transform their business.\"\n\"We're working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world's most pressing problems,\" said Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft. \"By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we've made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.\"\nThis jointly optimized platform runs the new Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK) on NVIDIA GPUs, including the NVIDIA DGX-1™ supercomputer , which uses Pascal™ architecture GPUs with NVLink™ interconnect technology , and on Azure N-Series virtual machines, currently in preview. This combination delivers unprecedented performance and ease of use when using data for deep learning.\nAs a result, companies can harness AI to make better decisions, offer new products and services faster and provide better customer experiences. This is causing every industry to implement AI. In just two years, the number of companies NVIDIA collaborates with on deep learning has jumped 194x to over 19,000. Industries such as healthcare, life sciences, energy, financial services, automotive and manufacturing are benefiting from deeper insight on extreme amounts of data.\nThe Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit trains and evaluates deep learning algorithms faster than other available toolkits, scaling efficiently in a range of environments -- from a CPU, to GPUs, to multiple machines -- while maintaining accuracy. NVIDIA and Microsoft worked closely to accelerate the Cognitive Toolkit on GPU-based systems and in the Microsoft Azure cloud, offering startups and major enterprises:\nGreater versatility: The Cognitive Toolkit lets customers use one framework to train models on premises with the NVIDIA DGX-1 or with NVIDIA GPU-based systems, and then run those models in the cloud on Azure. This scalable, hybrid approach lets enterprises rapidly prototype and deploy intelligent features.\nFaster performance: When compared to running on CPUs, the GPU-accelerated Cognitive Toolkit performs deep learning training and inference much faster on NVIDIA GPUs available in Azure N-Series servers and on premises. (1) For example, NVIDIA DGX-1 with Pascal and NVLink interconnect technology is 170x faster than CPU servers for the Cognitive Toolkit.\nWider availability: Azure N-Series virtual machines powered by NVIDIA GPUs are currently in preview to Azure customers, and will be generally available soon. Azure GPUs can be used to accelerate both training and model evaluation. With thousands of customers already part of the preview, businesses of all sizes are already running workloads on Tesla GPUs in Azure N-Series VMs.\nNVIDIA and Microsoft plan to continue their collaboration to help optimize the Cognitive Toolkit for NVIDIA GPUs in Azure and as part of a hybrid cloud AI platform, when connected to NVIDIA DGX-1 on premises.\nMore Resources\nMicrosoft Cognitive Toolkit Azure N-Series NVIDIA Deep Learning NVIDIA DGX-1 The Intelligent Industrial Revolution by NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang (1) AlexNet training batch size 128, dual-socket E5-2699v4, 44 cores CNTK 2.0b2 for CPU compared to NVIDIA DGX-1 system.

      "title": "Enough with the popups Microsoft",
      "text": "tweet \nMicrosoft customers on Windows may have experienced yet another popup notification while running their device. \nMicrosoft’s latest informational message is directed towards Office365 subscribers and is pushed to various versions of Windows including Windows 7 and 10. This may come as a surprise considering that those users are already paying customers. \nThe popup launches right above the Windows system tray area. It is labeled Office365, and informs customers that “your upgrade to Office 2016 is ready”. It reveals furthermore that the upgrade is free (Free with your Office 365 subscription). \nCustomers can click on “see what’s new” for information, later to postpone the upgrade, or upgrade to start the upgrade process right away. via ZDnet \nIf that sounds awfully familiar to the “ get Windows 10 ” notifications that Windows 7 and 8.1 users had to endure, you are probably not wrong. \nThe main issue with it is the usual one: there is no “no thanks” button. While you can select later to dismiss it for the time being, it is almost guaranteed that it will spawn again at a later point in time. \nWhile not necessarily classified as an ad, it certainly is nagware. \nMary Jo Foley over on ZDnet reports that the prompt is misleading as well. She is a Office 365 Business Essentials subscriber and as such does not get locally installable Office 2016 apps. Still, she did get the popup advertising those. \nA Microsoft spokesperson told ZDnet that the notification is designed to provide existing Office 365 subscribers with an easy way to upgrade to the latest version. Microsoft furthermore would evaluate customer feedback and adjust the right frequency of the notification. \nThe company has released a Fix It solution that turns off the Office 365 is ready notification on the operating system. \nTo use it, simply download it and follow the steps outlined in the application to do so. Doing so should block any future popups from being launched on the system (until Microsoft changes the method I guess). \nOffice365 subscribers who don’t want to upgrade to the newest versions of the Office apps, or cannot without paying extra, may want to run the Fix It solution to block the popup from appearing again. The rise of the popup \nPopup ads don’t have the best of reputation on the web, and rightfully so. Microsoft pushing popups to Windows 10 first and foremost, but now also to other versions of Windows, may convince part of the company’s user base to do whatever the popup suggests, but it will certainly irritate another part. \nIt seems that Microsoft is accelerating the pushing of popup notifications — ads — especially on Windows 10. \nMost are limited currently to get users either to upgrade to a new Microsoft product version, or switch to a Microsoft product — think Edge instead of Chrome — instead. \nNow You : What’s your take on the development? \n ",

By: IANS | New York   1:19 PM “Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate,” Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer, said in a Microsoft blog post on Monday. (Reuters) \nMicrosoft said its Cheyenne datacentre in Wyoming will now be powered entirely by 237 megawatts of wind energy. \n“Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate,” Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer, said in a Microsoft blog post on Monday. \n“That’s why we are announcing our largest wind energy purchases yet – 237 megawatts of wind energy – that will allow our datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming to be powered entirely by wind power,” Smith added. \nMicrosoft has also structured the purchase and partnered with the local utility in novel ways to facilitate a shift of cities and states towards a cleaner energy grid. \nMicrosoft said it entered into agreements with two wind farms to power its Cheyenne datacentre from renewable sources. \nOf the two partnerships, Microsoft has procured 178 megawatts from the Bloom Wind Project in Kansas through Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to help bring this new project online and partnered with Black Hills Corp. to purchase wind power from the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nWith these energy deals, Microsoft’s total investment in wind energy projects in the US has gone up to over 500 megawatts. \n“The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the energy used at the datacenter,” Smith said.

      "text": "From left: Drake Callahan, Scott Moore, Mark Maday, Kate Reinmiller, Paul Lavelle. Credit: Ad Lightning. Scott Moore, a 20-year veteran of online publishing for the likes of Microsoft, Yahoo and Cheezburger, has found his next venture.\nAd Lightning scans digital publishing outlets for disruptive ads that slow down and hurt their sites. The idea for the company came out of Seattle-based startup incubator Pioneer Square Labs , and when Moore heard about it, his first thought was “I wish we had this” at Cheezburger. \nThe company has been in stealth mode for the past few months, but came out of it this week, announcing a $2 million seed round led by Sinclair Digital Ventures , an investment division of Sinclair Broadcast Group . The selection of Moore, who sold Cheezburger earlier this year , was also announced this week. Pioneer Square Labs founders Mike Galgon, Greg Gottesman and Geoff Entress.\nIn an interview with GeekWire, Moore said digital publishers have less control over the ads that show up on their sites than they used to. That is because of a concept known as programmatic advertising. Moore explains it as a kind of matchmaking service, where publishers pitch their audience and demographics and the systems matches them with advertisers that fit their budget and want access to those types of readers.\n“There’s a growing realization that programmatic, while it’s been an incredible boon for marketers and advertisers, has created a lot of unintended consequences that are harming the very user experiences and consumer engagements that these advertisers and their agencies need in order to get their marketing messages delivered,” Moore said.\nMany Cheezburger users installed ad-blocking software to avoid bad ads that slowed down the site, Moore said, and that cut into the company’s revenue stream. Some of the most frequent problematic ads are those that are so large that they require an excess of processing power to load them and those with video or audio that start up unprompted. Since these ads pop up in response to a specific user’s cookies, it is tough to recreate those conditions.\n“If you’re a user and you’re having a poor user experience on a website because of ads, you don’t really care whether it’s the ads or the publisher’s fault or whatever, you just get frustrated and you leave,” Moore said.\nThat’s where Ad Lightning comes in. It monitors the site in the background at all times and shows which ads are troublesome. Then it’s up to the publishers to decide if they want to shut down bad ads.\nThough Moore wouldn’t get into the size of his staff, he did note that he brought in veteran software developer and executive Drake Callahan to be CTO and Kate Reinmiller , former COO of Mixpo , to be vice president of operations soon after he came on board. The company will use the investment funds to hire more people and find more customers.\nIn the short-term, growing the business and landing more customers is the goal, but the company has grander visions. In the future, Moore said he believes it will be possible to build a database that tracks and monitors all digital advertising content floating around the internet. Since there is a finite amount of ads, and they tend to run for several weeks, tracking them wouldn’t be too tough.\n“If we can, over time, build a database of all the creative floating around through programmatic inventory and then quality score it, that becomes a really valuable asset we can license to many different players in the industry,” Moore said.",

      "text": "(This article was first published on R – Curtis Miller's Personal Website , and kindly contributed to R-bloggers) \nSo Tuesday happened. I have a lot to say about our President-elect, and you’ll probably see a couple posts about him in the next few weeks. But that’s for later. Today, I’m writing about a more pressing issue, one that has been subject to debate for years without resolution, and I plan to settle this debate once and for all.\nDo I look angry in this picture?\n\nHere’s the backstory: in my first semester of college in 2010, I took a drawing class. We were required to draw a self-portrait at the beginning of the class, then at the end, after having been trained. I had taken many drawing courses prior to the class and thought myself quite skilled, and I remember when I drew my first self-portrait thinking “How can I do better than this?” But a semester later, I drew this.\nI remember after drawing this picture thinking “That’s how.”\nEveryone who saw the picture was impressed, from my parents to my art professor (who begged me not to stop drawing; sadly, though, I have not drawn like this since that class, though I hope someday to recover those skills and draw again). I hung the picture on my bedroom door, and one morning, my little sister’s dog Fancy woke me up when she was barking frantically at it; it was so realistic it apparently frightened her.\nYet while the picture was impressive, there was a common reaction to it: I look angry. Everyone would ask me, “Why do you look so angry in this picture?” It even reached a point where my grandpa, when he saw it, pointed to it and said, “This is not you. This is not the person who you are.” (My professor, when I mentioned this to him, said what I managed to do was become so focused I captured that focus and intensity in the drawing.)\nI can assure you that I was not angry while drawing this picture. Just consider some of the selfies I took that night:\n\n\n\nNo people, I was not angry, and I don’t have anger issues. (Well, I do have a deep anger at the universe for all the slights it dealt me and all the injustices in the world, but that’s a separate issue.)\nMonths ago, I saw this tutorial for using Microsoft’s Emotion’s API for detecting emotions in photos, using R. I thought the idea would be fun, and today I decided to see what the app would say about my drawing.\nHere’s the result (using a lot of the code from the aforementioned tutorial; note that you will have to create an account and get a key to use the API ):\nlibrary(\"httr\") library(\"XML\") library(\"stringr\") library(\"ggplot2\") library(\"reshape2\") # Define image source img.url = 'https://ntguardian.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/selfportrait.jpg' # Define Microsoft API URL to request data URL.emoface = 'https://api.projectoxford.ai/emotion/v1.0/recognize' # Define image mybody = list(url = img.url) # Request data from Microsoft (faceEMO = POST( url = URL.emoface, content_type('application/json'), add_headers(.headers = c('Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' = emotionKEY)), body = mybody, encode = 'json' )) \n## Response [https://api.projectoxford.ai/emotion/v1.0/recognize] ## Date: 2016-11-13 22:41 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 ## Size: 264 B \n# Request results from face analysis (SelfPortrait = httr::content(faceEMO)[[1]]) \n## $faceRectangle ## $faceRectangle$height ## [1] 530 ## ## $faceRectangle$left ## [1] 584 ## ## $faceRectangle$top ## [1] 549 ## ## $faceRectangle$width ## [1] 530 ## ## ## $scores ## $scores$anger ## [1] 0.004670194 ## ## $scores$contempt ## [1] 8.175469e-05 ## ## $scores$disgust ## [1] 5.616587e-05 ## ## $scores$fear ## [1] 0.0008795662 ## ## $scores$happiness ## [1] 3.147202e-05 ## ## $scores$neutral ## [1] 0.9871294 ## ## $scores$sadness ## [1] 0.003053426 ## ## $scores$surprise ## [1] 0.00409801 \n# Define results in data frame o<-melt(as.data.frame(SelfPortrait$scores)) \n## Using as id variables \nnames(o) <- c(\"Emotion\", \"Level\") o \n## Emotion Level ## 1 anger 4.670194e-03 ## 2 contempt 8.175469e-05 ## 3 disgust 5.616587e-05 ## 4 fear 8.795662e-04 ## 5 happiness 3.147202e-05 ## 6 neutral 9.871294e-01 ## 7 sadness 3.053426e-03 ## 8 surprise 4.098010e-03 \n# Make plot ggplot(data=o, aes(x=Emotion, y=Level, fill = Emotion)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") + ggtitle(\"Detected Emotions in Self Portrait\") + theme_bw() \n\nThe API successfully detected the region of the picture where my face is located, and I’m confident it provides a reasonable analysis of the emotions seen. It appears there is only one emotion in the drawing that Microsoft detects: neutral. Lots and lots of neutral. I will also admit that there is an intensity in my expression that the API probably does not capture or quantify, and that intensity coupled with the shere “neutrality” of my expression perhaps is perceived as anger.\nWill that end the discussion? Probably not. Computers see what they see, but what matters in the end is what people perceive, not computers; it’s to them emotions matter. Nevertheless, it’s nice to get some vindication from Microsoft; I was not angry!\n\nTo leave a comment for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: R – Curtis Miller's Personal Website .

      "text": "You don't need to sign in to use Skype anymore Microsoft's VOIP service can now be used without an account. Save shutterstock \nUnless you have Skype configured to boot-up when you start your computer, starting the program, logging in and connecting to a call can be mildly tedious. It's not anymore -- Microsoft just announced a new 'Guest' mode for Skype that makes user accounts almost completely optional . Now if you want to join a Skype call, all you have to do is click a link and enter your name. \nSkype as a Guest includes voice and video calling, group instant messaging and screen and file sharing features for up to 300 people per conversation. Users will be given a unique link to share with contacts that instantly open the Skype conversation, which can be made up of more Guests, or fully signed-in Skype users. \nSo, what's the catch? Not much: conversations expire after 24 hours, and you'll still need to log-in to call a landline or use Skype's live translation features . The account-free mode also only works in Skype.com's web-client, but those limitations aside it seems to offer all the service's basic free features. Not bad -- particularly if you only use Skype when somebody else asks you to.",

      "text": "AvePoint Announces New Integrations with Rencore and NetApp in DocAve to Enhance Microsoft SharePoint Management Share Article The latest DocAve release allows organizations to safely deploy customizations, backup and restore NetApp systems, and features additional support for hybrid SharePoint management With every release of DocAve, we aim to build functionality that meets and anticipates the ever-changing needs of our customers. Past News Releases AvePoint and CIPL Assess Global... Vienna (PRWEB) November 15, 2016 From the halls of the European SharePoint Conference (ESPC) 2016, AvePoint, the Microsoft Cloud expert, today announced the general availability of DocAve 6 Service Pack (SP) 8, the enterprise-class SharePoint management platform. With this release, organizations can safely deploy customizations, backup and restore NetApp Systems, and access additional hybrid management and SharePoint 2016 management. With DocAve, organizations have access to a platform of fully integrated solutions that simplify and centralize all of their management capabilities across cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid SharePoint environments. New features include: Safe Customization Deployment: DocAve Deployment Manager now features full integration with Rencore’s SharePoint Code Analysis Framework (SPCAF) Farm Protection. Developers and administrators can easily scan each SharePoint customization before deployment or migration to any Office 365 environment or on-premises farm to detect potential issues and risks to the environment, operational processes, and data. Backup and Restore NetApp Systems: DocAve Backup and Restore and High Availability expand to be able to restore from NetApp SnapShots to provide the fastest SharePoint backup and recovery solutions. In addition, DocAve now supports data restoration using snapshots through an integration with NetApp Data ONTAP data management software to provide faster speed, data replication capabilities, disaster recovery, farm cloning, and storage optimization. This provides continued support for customers affected by the discontinuation of NetApp SnapManager for Microsoft SharePoint. Additional Support for SharePoint Hybrid Management: In order to provide a better hybrid experience for both end users and administrators, DocAve Replicator allows organizations to perform one-way, real-time replications of SharePoint content and Nintex Workflows from on-premises SharePoint to Office 365 – SharePoint Online. Administrators can also use DocAve Replicator to configure business rules that allow end users to publish content to sites, libraries, and lists across different SharePoint versions. With DocAve Administrator, administrators can now also reduce business disruption and improve end user experience by combing site collections, sites, and subsites for broken links across hybrid deployments. “With every release of DocAve, we aim to build functionality that meets and anticipates the ever-changing needs of our customers,” said John Peluso, Senior Vice President of Product Strategy, AvePoint. “By introducing new integrations with enterprise-class technology leaders, organizations will have access to expansive performance and speed enhancements, but also the strength and resiliency of knowing their solution will be matched against industry best practices from Rencore and NetApp.” The latest release of DocAve 6 SP 8 is generally available today, November 15, 2016, for SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint 2013.

      "text": "0 Comments \nIn the first part of this multi-part story, I talked about IFS approach to ERP for manufacturers and the emphasis on the Industrial IoT. I also talked about the more general issues associated with digital transformation as it relates to this industry, separating incremental change from bold moves. In this segment, I’m diving into the technology and IFS’s reliance on the Microsoft stack. \nAt some point in the customer event, one IFS executive remarked that they’re in the applications business not the technology business. That is why they’ve chosen to rely on Microsoft to power many components of their tech stack going forward. Microsoft will provide them with PowerBI, machine learning, Azure Managed Cloud, etc. These new Microsoft tools are a key component of IFS’ Industrial IoT strategy and tech stack. \nThe tech stack changes should deliver value in several ways including: Easier and faster ability for customers and partners to build out product extensions and enhancements Faster application of new releases Smaller and more easier upgrades Enablement of advanced functionality (e.g., algorithms) Quicker deployments \nIFS is not the first vendor to embrace the Microsoft arsenal . I’ve heard similar stories from competitors such as Unit4 , SYSPRO , Acumatica and more. With all of these vendors striking similar deals, where’s the differentiation in this strategy? An alternative strategy might have been to embrace more open source software in the tech stack the way that Workday and others have done. That strategy lets a vendor add an infinite number of customers and owe no (appreciable) additional monies to systems software providers. \nThat’s a critical point for vendors who want to work on relentlessly lowering the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for their solutions and to eliminate dependency on third parties. This does mean that there is no short cut route to development because in an open source world, vendors have to make careful bets about which version, fork or whatever they choose. \nHowever, turning over cloud management and operations to Microsoft makes sense as few software firms will ever have the scale, customer base or capital appetite to match the abilities of Amazon or Microsoft. The risk for ISVs like IFS in this camp is that the cost of hosting on Amazon or Microsoft becomes prohibitive at massive scale. \nWe believe that while hosted cost may be a problem for the short term, both Amazon and Microsoft (along with Oracle and Google) will recognize the commodity nature of broad scale campmate architectures and respond accordingly. \nThose arguments aside, there are plenty of customers who do care about the underpinning technology to the point where IFS selection of Microsoft as the stack of choice will be viewed favorably. New stack opportunities \nIFS’ last major release (#9) was announced 18 months ago at the last IFS World event with most customers gaining access to the product approximately one year ago. Today, about 20% of IFS’ 1 million users are currently on release 9. \nThis is interesting on a couple of levels. IFS executives indicated that the new release contained 500+ industry updates. As a result, existing users should be able to upgrade without needing to manually re-apply a number of their pre-existing customizations. Reduced customization effort should trigger reduced upgrade conversion costs for customers and act to lower TCO over time. \nThe new tech stack should also drive up adoption rates of new releases. As a result, new releases are now arriving in more digestible and smaller chunks. This also produces the added effect of reduced customer TCO, and that will be welcome for all customers. \nIn my final piece about IFS I’m going to talk about their operational intelligence offering, views on cloud and then my final summary. Buckle up folks, there’s plenty more to consider. \nImage credit - via IFS",

It really is a specialization in neuron-scientific information technology. That is for folks who research and examine company needs and then design, mount, troubleshoot and configure networking systems. MCSE Certification is suited to a person who has been working as an operational system engineer, professionals who are tech support team engineers, system analysts, network analysts and technical consultants, for at least twelve months. You will discover two courses available by Microsoft, that happen to be MCSE on Microsoft Glass windows 2000 and MCSE on Home windows Server 2003. The remuneration provided to MCSEs is a good among IT specialists. \nWhether you’re nearly to begin with, or a skilled technician seeking to gain acknowledged qualifications, you will discover interactive Microsoft MCSA training programs to teach both requirements of scholar. Identify an exercise provider that wants to understand you, and can help identify the perfect avenue for you, even before they start considering which course. You can even expect those to suggest where you can start dependent upon your present absence or understanding of it. Avoid putting too much emphasis, like more and more people do, on working out process. You are not training with regard to training; you ought to be intended for the real job by the end of it. \nThe actual fact you are scanning this means you’ve planned to use your Cisco CCNA or another Cisco exam in simple fact and just realizing that means you might fall victim to 1 of the 10 fatal exam blunders. I can consult with some power on exam blunders because within the last 8 years I’ve made almost all of them myself I’ve taken a whole lot of computer exams since I kept the authorities including Compton tests, the MCSE, CCNA and the CCNP among a few others. IT tests are usually used at an approved tests centre that has to check out set guidelines and steps to ensure each prospect has an identical experience. The condition was that whenever I visited leading door I read to my horror an indicator saying that that they had moved. \nCompTIA performs their accreditations through both Parametric and Pearson VUE assessment centers. The certifications available are in four different series to showcase skills from individuals beginning at a simple entry-level up to mastery. The Comptia CASP basic series protects common issues and subject areas in it that connect with anybody seeking a posture involving personal computers with the Strata IT Basic principles exam. The essential exam includes knowledge of computers, compatibility, mistakes, software unit installation and security hazards. The exam includes 70 questions and really should be studied by individuals for positions including sales affiliates, marketing specialist and computer support.",

      "text": "Select All Posts By This User I think he was quoted slightly out of context here. He's basically just thinking out loud as if to say 'really wouldn't surprise me if...' And he's not wrong. Windows store is currently a monumental flop when it comes to PC games. I think I read somewhere that someone bought Infinite Warfare on Windows Store, saw there was one other player active and asked for a refund. Microsoft aren't going to do anything to benefit Steam. As we've seen from other client side attempts like Origin and uPlay, PC gamers don't want their libraries all over the place. Just as much as MS don't want Steam to dominate that segment. Don't think there's anything to worry about just yet, though.",

      "text": "Microsoft has a problem: Many developers use Macs, and Mac developers aren't as likely to code for Microsoft platforms if they don't have tools built for their operating system.\nThat may be why Microsoft announced Monday that a full, native version of its Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment; a place to code, debug and test) is coming to the Mac.\nAccording to an official Microsoft blog post (since pulled from the web), it'll launch in preview at Microsoft's Connect developer event later this week, and will \"look and feel like a native citizen of MacOS.\"\nThere's one catch: it's not exactly a built-from-the-ground up version of Visual Studio, but rather ( as long-time tech journalist Tim Anderson points out ) a rebranding of Xamarin. Microsoft bought Xamarin in February 2016 . Perhaps that distinction is why Microsoft pulled the blog post. Microsoft declined to comment.\nIt's also not technically the first chunk of Visual Studio to make its way to Mac. That would be Visual Studio Code , which went open-source last year.",

      "text": "Tweet \nMore and more companies are moving their office applications to the cloud and Microsoft Office 365 is one of the most popular options with around 85 million subscribers. \nOne of the major concerns with this trend is keeping information secure, to address this IT management solutions provider Kaseya is launching its latest AuthAnvil. An identity and access management solution, this provides single sign on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA) and automated user provisioning for Office 365. \nAuthAnvil gives end users the simplicity and time saving of securely signing in once to access all applications without having to remember multiple sets of login details. With its MFA capabilities, AuthAnvil provides an added, easy to use layer of security to protect businesses from password breaches at third-party services and sites. Kaseya's MFA supports common end-user devices, including Apple iOS, Android phones and tablets, and Windows 10, as well as meeting industry standards such as HIPAA. \n\"The growth of the cloud is in a historic phase right now, and Microsoft Office 365 is one of the leading drivers of this advancement. That said, security remains a leading concern for all organizations as corporate data increasingly resides outside IT firewalls. The latest release of Kaseya AuthAnvil locks down two key threat vectors to hybrid cloud environments: endpoint security and network access\", says Mike Puglia, chief product officer for Kaseya. \"With Kaseya AuthAnvil, our multiple layers of security checks and balances ensure that access is limited to authorized users only, giving IT leaders peace of mind in the security of their corporate information\". \nAmong other features are the ability to tie into a company's existing Active Directory or other user directory, so AuthAnvil can automate both Office 365 user provisioning and privileges assignment. As a result, IT administrators no longer have the burden of having to create user accounts and assign common services and privileges. \nMore information about AuthAnvil can be found on the Kaseya website.",

      "title": "Kaspersky Accuses Microsoft Of Anti-Competitive Practices",
      "text": "  Kaspersky Accuses Microsoft Of Anti-Competitive Practices Eugene Kaspersky, the co-founder and CEO of Russian security software company Kaspersky Lab, has accused software giant Microsoft of anti-competitive practices and endangering computer security with its attitudes to anti-virus software. In a blog post entitled That’s It. I’ve Had Enough! Kaspersky likened the fight to that between David and Goliath, but with the Microsoft Goliath „squeezing independent developers out of specialist areas – and announced plans to push for an investigation into the company’s business practices. Kaspersky isn’t exactly the first software entrepreneur to accuse Microsoft of unfair competition. The EU only recently finally lifted a sanction that forced Microsoft to offer a choice of browsers to end the dominance of its own Internet Explorer. Or the invention of Windows Live Essentials as a way to offer the firm’s bundleware as a separate suite of programs instead. Users of Windows 10 have been complaining that the system is changing settings, uninstalling user-installed apps and replacing them with standard Microsoft ones. A similar thing’s been happening with security products, wrote Kaspersky. He accused Microsoft of giving third parties as little notice as possible (one week) to start preparing for changes to Windows 10, and then blocking any incompatibilities in favour of its own Windows Defender, which has gone from being a backstop, to being the de facto and, if Microsoft is to be believed, only security tool Windows 10 users need. Kaspersky went on to talk about alarming pop-ups that are created if Windows 10 detects Windows Defender is off, even saying that a third-party solution is unnecessary and actively shouldn’t be on. A second antivirus solution is allowed, but only if it’s Windows Defender. He also accused Microsoft of not offering sufficient ability for third parties to warn customers if their coverage has expired, instead opting to turn on Defender. Kaspersky pointed out that Windows Defender hasn’t tested well compared with other antivirus packages, and is considered “below average” in terms of effectiveness and features. The trend is clear. Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose,“ he said. In doing so, Microsoft is acting against the interests of users since a lot of its products are of inferior quality. Browsers, gaming hubs, image viewing, processing of multimedia files and PDF documents, cyber security and many others are already suffering from this and, as a consequence, so are users. And it looks like this is only the beginning. What’ll be next in the firing line? Virtual machines? Cloud services? An embedded video from an internal Microsoft training film appears to back up Kaspersky’s claims. It shows a Redmond adviser stating: I want you to think about kicking out the third-party antivirus because we’ve got a great solution right now and it’s going to be even better in the months to come. Kaspersky believes that, despite repeatedly failing to create a workable antivirus product (remember Windows Security Essentials? OneCare?) investors are pressuring the company to get the numbers up, hence all the Windows 10 pop-ups. We think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own products, he said. The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyber attacks. The company is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market and infringes on the interests of independent developers of security products. Therefore, we’ve taken the decision to address official bodies in various countries (including the EU and Russia ) with a request to oblige Microsoft to cease its violation of anti-competition legislation and to remove the consequences of that violation.

Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart \n\"Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate,\" Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer, said in a Microsoft blog post on Monday. \n\"That's why we are announcing our largest wind energy purchases yet - 237 megawatts of wind energy - that will allow our datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming to be powered entirely by wind power,\" Smith added. \nMicrosoft has also structured the purchase and partnered with the local utility in novel ways to facilitate a shift of cities and states towards a cleaner energy grid. \nMicrosoft said it entered into agreements with two wind farms to power its Cheyenne datacentre from renewable sources. \nOf the two partnerships, Microsoft has procured 178 megawatts from the Bloom Wind Project in Kansas through Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to help bring this new project online and partnered with Black Hills Corp. to purchase wind power from the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nWith these energy deals, Microsoft's total investment in wind energy projects in the US has gone up to over 500 megawatts. \n\"The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the energy used at the datacenter,\" Smith said.

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft is looking to help small businesses to better keep track of their interactions and deals with customers. As such, the company has announced the launch of Outlook Customer Manager, a free program that will be part of the Office 365 Business Premium plan. \nThose familiar with Microsoft’s higher-end business products, can think of this new service as a very light version of Dynamics. Those of you less familiar with Microsoft nomenclature, can simply think of it as a convenient way to centralize some data on clients and deals. The Outlook Customer Manager sidebar - click to embiggen \nOutlook Customer Manager, as its name suggests, will be part of the Outlook desktop client, for those on the correct Office 365 plan. It will unify data on clients by keeping tab of your e-mail interactions, notes you write, calendar appointments, and other data spread across Office. It’ll then show you the timeline of your interactions with said client, reminders, and notifications when a deadline or important event is coming up, and recent discussion notes that you wrote down. And, of course, it does this across your entire business for all employees. \nThere’s also a “Focused” view which only shows the most important clients and deals, alongside the tasks, contacts involved and calendar dates you need to keep in mind. \nThere's also a mobile app for Outlook Customer Manager, originally destined for iOS only, but coming to other platforms in the future. The mobile version of the app lets you check on client interactions or recent notes. Microsoft describes it as the perfect way to brush up on previous discussions before going into a client meeting. \nOutlook Customer Manager is already rolling out to those Office customers who opted into the First Release program and will become more widely available in the next few months. Though limited to the Office 365 Business Premium plan for now, Microsoft says the feature will eventually come to E3 and E5 plans in the future as well. \nYou can check out more info on Microsoft’s Outlook Customer Manager page .

Photo: My Paper The Business Times Tuesday, Nov 15, 2016 \nJessica Tan, managing director of Microsoft Singapore, will be leaving Microsoft to pursue new business opportunities, the tech company announced on Monday. \nShe will remain in her role until Dec 31, 2016. Kevin Wo, a senior vice-president at digital solutions company Avanade, will take over the leadership reins from Ms Tan. \nMicrosoft said that Ms Tan will leave behind \"a deep legacy\" in her 13-year stint with the company in the Asia-Pacific - having served twice as its managing director for Singapore, in addition to regional leadership roles. \nMs Tan was also awarded IT Leader of the Year by the Singapore Computer Society in 2016. \nShe said: \"In the tech industry, we understand better than anyone else that change is the only constant. \nAfter 13 rewarding years in Microsoft, I think that the time is right for me to have fresh talent succeed what I hope is a great legacy.\" \nMs Tan added that Microsoft is in a strong position strategically, and has the \"right leadership and people\" in place in the Singapore team. \nMr Wo, who joins Microsoft Singapore with a 23-year track record in the IT industry, will be responsible for developing and driving growth strategies for all of Microsoft's product, service and support offerings in Singapore. \nRalph Haupter, president of Microsoft Asia and corporate vice-president of Microsoft Corp, shared that the company is \"humbled\" by Ms Tan's contributions to Microsoft in the Asia-Pacific and Singapore, and efforts to champion women's leadership roles in the IT industry. \nMr Haupter also described Mr Wo as a \"proven IT leader\" who will deepen Microsoft's relationships with customers and partners in co-creating new digital possibilities as Singapore charts its next lap of growth. \nAvanade, which Mr Wo joined in 2010, was a joint venture between Microsoft Corporation and Accenture. It was named Microsoft's Country Partner of the Year for Singapore in 2015. \nThis article was first published on November 15, 2016. Get The Business Times for more stories.

(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) \nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn has broken her arm in training, just weeks into the current ski season. \nShe sustained the injury in a crash Thursday on Copper Mountain, in Colorado. \n“I had successful surgery (Thursday) night in Vail and everyone took great care of me,” Vonn said in a Facebook post Friday. \n“While I am beyond frustrated by this latest setback, at least my knees are OK and I will return to the slopes as soon as possible, as I always do! Thank you for the continued love and support, it means so much to me.” \nInjury plagued \nVonn, the most successful woman in World Cup ski racing with 76 wins, suffered a nasty knee fracture in March that ended her ski season. \nThe 31-year-old skier already had an extensive injury history, including the torn ACL/MCL and fractured tibial plateau she suffered during the World Championships in February 2013. \nIt is unclear how long the injury will keep Vonn off the slopes. She is currently 11 wins away from breaking the all-time World Cup record set by Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark in 1989. 39.501419 -106.151627 ",

      "text": "  Microsoft Patch Tuesday – November 2016 November 9,   \nAlong with 14 patches, Microsoft introduced a new Security Update Guide web site, as the new location for information on security vulnerabilities. \nThis month’s Patch Tuesday was also election day in the U.S. and I imagine for once, IT pros are actually happy to see a big load of security updates released – it’s something to take our mind off the culmination of this contentious campaign season. \nAlong with the fourteen patches released today, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) team published a blog post that introduces the new Security Update Guide web site , which the company sees as the “new single destination for security vulnerability information.” \nIt’s in preview now, and the Microsoft Security Bulletin site is still operational, so if you’re one of many who don’t like change, you can still access the information in the traditional way – at least for a few months. After January 2017, the information about the security fixes will no longer be published to the Bulletins site; you’ll have to transition to the Update Guide. \nThe good news is that the new portal does give you far more flexibility. You can filter by release date, KB number, CVE identifier, or product. This is great for those who don’t want to waste time scrolling through information about software and services that they don’t have deployed or don’t use. \nThis month’s updates include six that are rated critical and eight classified as important. There are updates for both Microsoft web browsers, Adobe Flash, and various components of Windows, as well as one for SQL Server and one for Microsoft Office. \nLet’s take a look at each of these updates in a little more detail. Critical \nMS16-129 (KB 3199057) This is the usual cumulative update for the Edge browser and applies to Edge on all iterations of Windows 10. It is rated critical for all. \nThe update addresses seventeen vulnerabilities, including multiple memory corruption issues, information disclosure, and a spoofing vulnerability. Twelve of these could be exploited to accomplish remote code execution. \nThe update fixes the problems by changing how Microsoft browsers handles objects in memory, changing how the XSS filter in Microsoft browsers handle RegEx, modifying how the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine handles objects in memory, and correcting how the Microsoft Edge parses HTTP responses. \nMS16-130 (KB 3199172) This is an update for all currently supported versions of the Windows client and server operating systems, including the server core installation. It is rated critical for all. \nThis update addresses three vulnerabilities: two elevation of privilege issues and one remote code execution vulnerability. The update fixes the problems by correcting how the Windows Input Method Editor (IME) loads DLLs and requiring hardened UNC paths be used in scheduled tasks. \nMS16-131 (KB 3199151) This is an update for the Microsoft Video Control component in Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, RT 8.1 and 10. It is rated critical for all. It also affects Windows Server 2016 Preview 5. \nThe update addresses a single vulnerability based on the way the Video Control component handles objects in memory, which can be exploited to accomplish remote code execution. The update fixes the problems by correcting how Microsoft Video Control handles objects in memory. \nMS16-132 (KB 3199120) This is an update for the Graphic component in all currently supported versions of Windows client and server operating systems, including the server core installation. It is rated critical for all. \nThe update addresses four vulnerabilities: an open type font information disclosure issue (for which a workaround is provided in the security bulletin), two memory corruption vulnerabilities – one in Windows Animation Manager and one in Media Foundation – and an open type font remote code execution vulnerability, which also has a workaround. You can find instructions for the workarounds at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms16-132.aspx \nThe update fixes the problems by correcting how the ATMFD component, the Windows Animation Manager, and the Windows Media Foundation handle objects in memory. \nMS16-141 (KB3202790) This is an update for Adobe Flash Player running on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016. It does not include the server core installation, which doesn’t have a web browser installed by default. It is rated critical for all affected systems. \nThe update addresses nine vulnerabilities in the Flash Player software, which include type confusion vulnerabilities and use-after-free vulnerabilities, both of which can be exploited to accomplish code execution. The update fixes the problems by updating the affected Adobe Flash libraries contained within Internet Explorer 10, Internet Explorer 11, and Microsoft Edge. \nMS16-142 (KB3198467) This is the usual cumulative update for the Internet Explorer web browser. It is rated Critical for IE 9 and IE 11 on affected Windows clients, and rated Moderate for IE 9, IE 10 and IE 11 on affected Windows server operating systems. \nThe update addresses seven vulnerabilities, which include four memory corruption issues and three information disclosure vulnerabilities. The most severe of these could be exploited to accomplish remote code execution. The update fixes the problems by correcting how Internet Explorer modifies objects in memory and the way it uses the XSS filter to handle RegEx. Important \nMS16-133 (KB 3199168) This is an update for Microsoft Office that applies to Office 2007, 2010, 2013, 2013 RT, and 2016, as well as Office for Mac 2011 and 2016, the Office Compatibility Pack, and the Excel and PowerPoint Viewers. Also affected are Excel Services and Word Automation Services on SharePoint 2010, Word Automation Services on SharePoint 2013, and Office Web Apps 2010 and 2013. It is rated important for all. \nThe update addresses twelve vulnerabilities, ten of which are memory corruption issues. The other two are information disclosure and denial of service vulnerabilities. The update fixes the problems by correcting how Microsoft Office initializes variables and how affected versions of Office and Office components handle objects in memory. \nMS16-134 (KB3193706) This is an update for the Common Log File System Driver in all currently supported releases of Windows client and server operating system, including the Server Core installation. It is rated important for all. \nThis update addresses ten vulnerabilities, all of which are elevation of privilege issues. The update fixes the problem by correcting how CLFS handles objects in memory. \nMS16-135 (KB3199135) This is an update for the Windows Kernel-mode Drivers in all currently supported releases of Windows client and server operating system, including the Server Core installation. It is rated important for all. \nThis update addresses five vulnerabilities, which includes two information disclosure issues and three elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. The update fixes the problem by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. \nMS16-136 (KB3199641) This is an update for all currently supported editions of Microsoft SQL Server 2012, 2014 and 2016. It is rated important for all. \nThe update addresses six vulnerabilities, which includes three SQL RDBMS Engine Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities, one MDS API XSS vulnerability, and one SQL Analysis Services information disclosure vulnerability, along with one SQL Server agent elevation of privilege vulnerability. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker could to gain elevated privileges that could be used to view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts. The update fixes these most severe vulnerabilities by correcting how SQL Server handles pointer casting. \nMS16-137 (KB3199173) This is an update for Windows Authentication Methods in all currently supported releases of Windows client and server operating system, including the server core installation. It is rated important for all. \nThe update addresses three vulnerabilities, which include a Virtual Secure Mode Information Disclosure vulnerability, a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service Denial of Service vulnerability and a Windows NTLM Elevation of Privilege vulnerability. \nThe update fixes the problems by updating Windows NTLM to harden the password change cache, changing the way that LSASS handles specially crafted requests and correcting how Windows Virtual Secure Mode handles objects in memory. \nMS16-138 (KB3199647) This is an update for the Microsoft Virtual Hard Disk Driver in Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016, including the server core installation. It is rated important for all. \nThe update addresses four vulnerabilities, all of which are elevation of privilege issues that an attacker could exploit to manipulate files in locations not intended to be available to the user. The update fixes the problem by correcting how the kernel API restricts access to these files. \nMS16-139 (KB3199720) This is an update for the Windows kernel in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, including the server core installation. It is rated important for all. \nThe update addresses a single vulnerability in the way the kernel API enforces permissions, which an attacker could exploit to gain access to information that is not intended for the user, but the attacker would have to be able to locally authenticate. The update fixes the problem by helping to ensure the kernel API correctly enforces access controls. \nMS16-140 (KB3193479) This is an update for the Boot Manager in Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016, including the server core installation. It is rated important for all. \nThe update addresses a single vulnerability when Windows Secure Boot improperly loads a boot policy that is affected by the vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could disable code integrity checks, allowing test-signed executables and drivers to be loaded onto a target device. The update fixes the problem by revoking affected boot policies in the firmware. \nYou can find the full summary of all these updates, with links to each security bulletin, at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms16-nov.aspx \nIf you don’t want to miss out on future information about important Microsoft vulnerabilities and patches, subscribe to our blog and receive regular news updates in your inbox.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft Black Friday preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops The tech giant's online store takes $400 off the Surface Book laptop, while also having specials on Dell and Alienware notebooks. | Topic: Microsoft \nMicrosoft's online store will have Black Friday deals on Surface tablets and the Surface Book laptop. \nThough many people might be eyeing Microsoft's online store on Black Friday for Xbox deals, the site will also have a few specials on Windows devices, which it's already previewing . These include discounts on its own Surface systems, though it's a little tricky to determine precisely what you're actually saving on. Black Friday 2016 Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals \nFor instance, Microsoft claims that the Surface Book 2-in-1 laptop will be $400 off from the base $1,899 price starting on Black Friday. However, Microsoft's site already shows the current starting price for the Surface Book as $1,499. So is the $400 savings off the Intel Core i5 or the Core i7 256GB model, which both currently run $1,899? Since Microsoft doesn't indicate which version is on sale, it's hard to know. \nMicrosoft is also promoting a deal on its Surface Pro 4 tablet: a Core i5 model with 256GB of storage and a Type cover accessory for $999, which is $429 off the regular price. It's taking $200 off another Surface Pro -- again, the specific configuration isn't listed, but the process of elimination suggests it's the Core i5 with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage since it's the same original price ($999) as Microsoft is advertising. \nIn addition to the Surface deals, Microsoft is promoting four Windows 10 laptop sales on its site -- three from Dell and one from its gaming arm, Alienware. However, it's playing one of the favorite Black Friday tricks of retailers: claiming an \"original\" price much higher than the current price it's selling an item for. For instance, the Dell Inspiron 15 i5559-4682SLV with Core i5-6200U, 8GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, and 15.6-inch full HD touchscreen display is touted as having an original price of $749, which makes the $399 price look like a steal. But go to the laptop's product page, and you'll see it's already selling for $499, meaning the Black Friday discount is $100. Not bad, but $350 as the promo suggests. \nWe see a similar strategy with the Dell Inspiron 15 i7559-5012GRY (Core i7-6700HQ/8GB/1TB SSD/Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M graphics/4k 15.6-inch touchscreen). It's original price is listed as $1,099, but its current price on the Microsoft online store is $899, again leading to a Black Friday discount of $100 instead of the stated $300. Yet again, it happens with the Alienware 15 Touch Signature Edition gaming laptop, which shows an original price of $2,499, a current price of $1,799, and a Black Friday price of $1,497. You still get a powerful notebook with Core i7-6700HQ CPU, 16 gigs of RAM, a terabyte hard drive and a 256GB SSD, GeForce GTX 970M graphics, and a 4k 15.6-inch touchscreen display -- you just don't save $1,000 as you may be lead to believe.

      "text": "Google may have beaten Microsoft to the punch in getting office productivity applications in the cloud, but Microsoft has more than made up for lost time.\nA look at the use of cloud applications in more than 120,000 organizations around the world by cloud access security broker Bitglass Inc. finds that Office 365 is now deployed in nearly 35 percent of organizations, while G Suite from Google Cloud is used by 25 percent.\nPublic companies favor Office 365 to G Suite by nearly a two-to-one ratio – 48 percent to G Suite’s 25 percent. Among private companies, the split is 29 percent Office 365 and to 25 percent G Suite. Microsoft has made impressive inroads with its office productivity suite; in 2014 adoption was just 7.7 percent, Bitglass said.\nThe good news for both companies is that 59 percent of organizations worldwide now use at least one of the two app suites. That’s up from 48 percent in 2015, according to Bitglass. Also of note is the rapid growth of Slack, the collaboration suite from Slack Technologies Inc. Bitglass called it the fastest-growing enterprise cloud service, with at least some use in an estimated one-third of enterprises, although some of that use is unsanctioned.\nBitglass used a combination of mail exchange records and custom scripts on more than 120,000 domains to reach its conclusions. Its research also looked at the adoption of single sign-on, or SSO, a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications.\nWhile widely used behind the corporate firewall, SSO is still a relative newcomer in the cloud. Bitglass said SSO adoption is growing, however, with one in 10 organizations now deploying it. Office 365 users are more likely to use it, with 26 percent adoption among that user base, up from 22 percent a year ago. In comparison, G Suite customers’ use of SSO increased to 6 percent this year from 4 percent in 2015.\nThe report can be downloaded here .\nPhoto by Florian Christoph via Flickr CC ",

      "text": "Twitter News Feed Item Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus and Microsoft to Support Data Management and Genomic Analysis November 15, 2016 08:05 AM EST Blog This \nDNAnexus Inc. , the global leader in genome informatics and data management, today announced that the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine ( SCGPM ) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud in order to bring enterprise-ready genomic analysis, data management, and collaborative research solutions to the center. The SCGPM, which supports researchers across nearly 80 laboratories, brought the two technologies together after working with both DNAnexus and Microsoft independently. \nSCGPM seeks to advance genomic technology so that genetic and molecular profiling will become powerful tools routinely used to understand, detect, prevent, and treat complex diseases. To advance this goal, SCGPM had deployed both the DNAnexus Platform and the Azure cloud for different aspects of the core sequencing facility’s massive genomic processing and data management requirements. With this partnership, a distributed network of scientists and researchers now have secure and compliant access to petabytes worth of data through a simple web browser through DNAnexus on Azure. Each month SCGPM generates on average 7.7 trillion base-pairs of data, which if all this data came from a single DNA strand, it would stretch across the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\"By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation,” said Richard Daly, CEO of DNAnexus. \n\"Microsoft is committed to advancing the field of genomics,\" according to David Heckerman, distinguished scientist and director of Microsoft Genomics. \"We look forward to working together with DNAnexus to further accelerate global scientific discoveries.” \nAbout DNAnexus \nDNAnexus combines expertise in computing and bioinformatics to create the global network for genomics. The company operates in 31 countries, and spans a wide spectrum of industries — pharmaceutical and biotech, healthcare, clinical diagnostics, government, and research consortia — facilitating some of the most challenging and exciting opportunities in human health. The secure, scalable, and collaborative DNAnexus Platform combines out-of-the-box clinical compliance for the healthcare industry, streamlining communication between healthcare providers and reducing information silos for more efficient collaboration.

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 7 minutes ago with 1 comment \nMicrosoft announced on Monday a number of new deals with regard to renewable energy that have helped make its Cheyenne, WY datacenter run entire on wind power. The new investments are part of Microsoft’s plan to use 50% renewable energy by 2018 . \nThe company announced that it has purchased an additional 237 megawatts of wind energy capacity, allowing it to run the Cheyenne data center completely on renewable energy, and bringing the company’s total wind capacity to 500 megawatts across the US. \nAlso of note is how Microsoft actually structured this deal and why the company believes it’s not only helping itself, but local communities. The most important aspect of this is that Microsoft partnered with Black Hills Energy to allow the energy supplier to use Microsoft’s datacenter as a secondary energy producer, through back-up natural gas-powered generators, when demand gets too high. \nThis, according to Microsoft , will keep the grid more stable, offer improved access, help out the power company which is now free to invest in renewables more, and most importantly, keep rates lower for the local community. \nEarlier in the year Microsoft’ CEO Satya Nadella, and its President and Chief Legal Office, Brad Smith took the stage in London to talk about the company’s vision for the cloud and how it fits in a connected, green world . The company says this move, alongside others coming in the near future, are a step on that journey to sustainability and corporate responsibility. Tags",

      "text": "Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus and Microsoft to Support Data Management and Genomic Analysis\nDNAnexus Inc. , the global leader in genome informatics and data management, today announced that the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine ( SCGPM ) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud in order to bring enterprise-ready genomic analysis, data management, and collaborative research solutions to the center. The SCGPM, which supports researchers across nearly 80 laboratories, brought the two technologies together after working with both DNAnexus and Microsoft independently.\nSCGPM seeks to advance genomic technology so that genetic and molecular profiling will become powerful tools routinely used to understand, detect, prevent, and treat complex diseases. To advance this goal, SCGPM had deployed both the DNAnexus Platform and the Azure cloud for different aspects of the core sequencing facility’s massive genomic processing and data management requirements. With this partnership, a distributed network of scientists and researchers now have secure and compliant access to petabytes worth of data through a simple web browser through DNAnexus on Azure. Each month SCGPM generates on average 7.7 trillion base-pairs of data, which if all this data came from a single DNA strand, it would stretch across the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\"By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation,” said Richard Daly, CEO of DNAnexus.\n\"Microsoft is committed to advancing the field of genomics,\" according to David Heckerman, distinguished scientist and director of Microsoft Genomics. \"We look forward to working together with DNAnexus to further accelerate global scientific discoveries.”\nAbout DNAnexus\nDNAnexus combines expertise in computing and bioinformatics to create the global network for genomics. The company operates in 31 countries, and spans a wide spectrum of industries — pharmaceutical and biotech, healthcare, clinical diagnostics, government, and research consortia — facilitating some of the most challenging and exciting opportunities in human health. The secure, scalable, and collaborative DNAnexus Platform combines out-of-the-box clinical compliance for the healthcare industry, streamlining communication between healthcare providers and reducing information silos for more efficient collaboration.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft and NVIDIA today announced a collaboration to accelerate AI in the enterprise. They are introducing an optimized platform that runs the new Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK) on NVIDIA GPUs, including the NVIDIA DGX-1 supercomputer, and on Azure N-Series virtual machines, currently in preview.\nUsing the first purpose-built enterprise AI framework optimized to run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs in Microsoft Azure or on-premises, enterprises now have an AI platform that spans from their data center to Microsoft’s cloud.\n“Every industry has awoken to the potential of AI,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. “We’ve worked with Microsoft to create a lightning-fast AI platform that is available from on-premises with our DGX-1™ supercomputer to the Microsoft Azure cloud. With Microsoft’s global reach, every company around the world can now tap the power of AI to transform their business.”\n“We’re working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world’s most pressing problems,” said Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft. “By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we’ve made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.”\nNVIDIA and Microsoft worked closely to accelerate the Cognitive Toolkit on GPU-based systems and in the Microsoft Azure cloud, offering startups and major enterprises:\nGreater versatility: The Cognitive Toolkit lets customers use one framework to train models on premises with the NVIDIA DGX-1 or with NVIDIA GPU-based systems, and then run those models in the cloud on Azure. This scalable, hybrid approach lets enterprises rapidly prototype and deploy intelligent features. Faster performance: When compared to running on CPUs, the GPU-accelerated Cognitive Toolkit performs deep learning training and inference much faster on NVIDIA GPUs available in Azure N-Series servers and on premises. (1) For example, NVIDIA DGX-1 with Pascal and NVLink interconnect technology is 170x faster than CPU servers for the Cognitive Toolkit. Wider availability: Azure N-Series virtual machines powered by NVIDIA GPUs are currently in preview to Azure customers, and will be generally available soon. Azure GPUs can be used to accelerate both training and model evaluation. With thousands of customers already part of the preview, businesses of all sizes are already running workloads on Tesla GPUs in Azure N-Series VMs. NVIDIA and Microsoft are planning to continue their collaboration to optimize the Cognitive Toolkit for NVIDIA GPUs in Azure and as part of a hybrid cloud AI platform, when connected to NVIDIA DGX-1 on premises.\n",

      "text": "By: DNAnexus Inc. via Business Wire News Releases  00 AM EST Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus and Microsoft to Support Data Management and Genomic Analysis Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine (SCGPM) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud for genomic processing and data management. \nDNAnexus Inc. , the global leader in genome informatics and data management, today announced that the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine ( SCGPM ) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud in order to bring enterprise-ready genomic analysis, data management, and collaborative research solutions to the center. The SCGPM, which supports researchers across nearly 80 laboratories, brought the two technologies together after working with both DNAnexus and Microsoft independently. \nSCGPM seeks to advance genomic technology so that genetic and molecular profiling will become powerful tools routinely used to understand, detect, prevent, and treat complex diseases. To advance this goal, SCGPM had deployed both the DNAnexus Platform and the Azure cloud for different aspects of the core sequencing facility’s massive genomic processing and data management requirements. With this partnership, a distributed network of scientists and researchers now have secure and compliant access to petabytes worth of data through a simple web browser through DNAnexus on Azure. Each month SCGPM generates on average 7.7 trillion base-pairs of data, which if all this data came from a single DNA strand, it would stretch across the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\"By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation,” said Richard Daly, CEO of DNAnexus. \n\"Microsoft is committed to advancing the field of genomics,\" according to David Heckerman, distinguished scientist and director of Microsoft Genomics. \"We look forward to working together with DNAnexus to further accelerate global scientific discoveries.” \nAbout DNAnexus \nDNAnexus combines expertise in computing and bioinformatics to create the global network for genomics. The company operates in 31 countries, and spans a wide spectrum of industries — pharmaceutical and biotech, healthcare, clinical diagnostics, government, and research consortia — facilitating some of the most challenging and exciting opportunities in human health. The secure, scalable, and collaborative DNAnexus Platform combines out-of-the-box clinical compliance for the healthcare industry, streamlining communication between healthcare providers and reducing information silos for more efficient collaboration.

They make it more and more inconvenient to use the old apps, and, simultaneously, they try to become the only source for the new ones. “Slowly, over the next five years, they will force-patch Windows 10 to make Steam progressively worse and more broken. They’ll never completely break it, but will continue to break it until, in five years, people are so fed up that Steam is buggy that the Windows Store seems like an ideal alternative. Interesting, since Epic games deals with Microsoft intimately and exclusively.

Epic Games has a lot to lose by saying this publicly. You do realize Epic works exclusively with Microsoft? I find such a statement is more genuine when it comes from the belly of the beast.

But I wouldn't put it past MS to do this. I think MS are competent enough to do it, so I disagree with Tim Sweeney in that respect. The issue is whether or not people find out and do something about it, if it happens. Anyone here running Windows 10 notice any minor issues with Steam so far?

If the application is widely used it will probably be supported (it's not like the XP scenario). Edited by Edge Of Pain - 7/26/16 at 5:40pm",

      "text": "tweet \nMicrosoft revealed some time ago that it wanted to bring the cumulative update scheme from its Windows 10 operating system to Windows 8.1 and 7. \nThe new scheme started in October 2016 and brought along with it massive changes in regards to the downloading and deployment of updates for Windows 7 and 8.1 operating systems. \nThe move removed control from admins and home users alike, as it introduced an all or nothing approach to updating. \nPreviously, you could install or block individual updates, for instance if they caused issues on the system. With the new scheme, you cannot do that anymore as all updates are deployed as a single update. This means that you need to remove the whole update — all good ones and the ones causing issues — if you run into issues. \nThe new updating scheme raises another question: how are bugs caused by security updates handled ? If they are patched by non-security updates, then security-only systems won’t get them. Microsoft’s updating terminology is atrocious \nBut there is another issue, one that has not been talked about that much. Microsoft publishes two update packages for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 each month. \nOne includes only security updates released in that month, the other includes those security updates and non-security updates. The second may furthermore include patches from previous months on top of that. \nThe designated names for these updates are: [month] Security Only Quality Update for [operating systems]. Example: November, 2016 Security Only Quality Update for Windows 8 and Server 2008 R2 [month] Security Monthly Quality Rollup for [operating systems]. Example: November, 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 \nThe naming scheme is confusing in my opinion even though there are indicators that tell you which is which. \nHere are the pointers: The security-only update package for a given month has “ security only ” in the title. The all updates package for a given month as “ rollup ” in the title. \nThis is the only way to distinguish between those two update packages. It is important for Windows users and administrators who only want to install the security updates but not the regular updates. \nIt is unclear why Microsoft made them sound this similar. While I can understand the company’s desire to reflect that both include security updates, it would have been better if it would have picked a slightly different terminology for the updates: Security Only Update for Rollup Update for \nThis would make things a lot clearer and prevent much of the confusion surrounding the current terminology for update packages for Windows. \nNow you   new updating terminology?",

      "text": "Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus and Microsoft to Support Data Management and Genomic Analysis November 15, 2016 08:00   \nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.-  DNAnexus Inc. , the global leader in genome informatics and data management, today announced that the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine ( SCGPM ) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud in order to bring enterprise-ready genomic analysis, data management, and collaborative research solutions to the center. The SCGPM, which supports researchers across nearly 80 laboratories, brought the two technologies together after working with both DNAnexus and Microsoft independently. \nSCGPM seeks to advance genomic technology so that genetic and molecular profiling will become powerful tools routinely used to understand, detect, prevent, and treat complex diseases. To advance this goal, SCGPM had deployed both the DNAnexus Platform and the Azure cloud for different aspects of the core sequencing facility’s massive genomic processing and data management requirements. With this partnership, a distributed network of scientists and researchers now have secure and compliant access to petabytes worth of data through a simple web browser through DNAnexus on Azure. Each month SCGPM generates on average 7.7 trillion base-pairs of data, which if all this data came from a single DNA strand, it would stretch across the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\"By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation,” said Richard Daly, CEO of DNAnexus. \n\"Microsoft is committed to advancing the field of genomics,\" according to David Heckerman, distinguished scientist and director of Microsoft Genomics. \"We look forward to working together with DNAnexus to further accelerate global scientific discoveries.” \nAbout DNAnexus \nDNAnexus combines expertise in computing and bioinformatics to create the global network for genomics. The company operates in 31 countries, and spans a wide spectrum of industries — pharmaceutical and biotech, healthcare, clinical diagnostics, government, and research consortia — facilitating some of the most challenging and exciting opportunities in human health. The secure, scalable, and collaborative DNAnexus Platform combines out-of-the-box clinical compliance for the healthcare industry, streamlining communication between healthcare providers and reducing information silos for more efficient collaboration.

      "text": "Microsoft has announced a new partnership with OpenAI, the $1 billion artificial intelligence research nonprofit cofounded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator President Sam Altman. \nUnder the terms of the partnership, OpenAI will use the Microsoft Azure cloud computing service as the \"preferred\" place to do its AI experiments. In return, Microsoft gets increased access to OpenAI's deep bench of robotics and experts, making Azure a better place for building AI-powered software. \n\"You want to get a good feedback loop going,\" says Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie. \"That helps you ultimately build a better platform.\"\nArtificial intelligence is going to be a big point of competition between Microsoft Azure, the leading Amazon Web Services , and the relative upstart Google Cloud over the months and years to come. As Guthrie says, \"any application is ultimately going to weave in AI,\" and Microsoft wants to be the company that helps developers do the weaving.\nThat's where the OpenAI partnership becomes so important, Guthrie says.\nBecause we're still in the earliest days of artificial intelligence, he says, the biggest challenge is figuring out what exactly can be done with artificial intelligence. Guthrie calls this \"understanding the art of the possible.\"\nMicrosoft \nWith OpenAI, a research institution focused largely on just that, it's a natural collaboration as they work to \"jointly build an even richer ecosystem around artificial intelligence\" and \"learn as fast as possible,\" Guthrie says.\nGuthrie highlights the fact that Microsoft customers like ThyssenKrupp and Uber are already working with Azure and its artificial intelligence capabilities to power things like fixing elevators before they actually break or making sure your driver is actually your driver.\nCombine that with Microsoft's expertise in serving large business customers and helping them build applications that can securely handle large amounts of data, and Guthrie believes  Microsoft really stands out from the pack. \n\"Combined, they help make Azure an even more differentiated platform,\" Guthrie says. \nNOW WATCH: China just showcased the world's most human-like robots, and they show how close we’re coming to Westworld reality \n",

      "text": "Microsoft said Tuesday that a forthcoming Azure cloud service will help developers build and deploy bots or chatbots easily. Bots, a hot, much-hyped topic of late, are pieces of software that work under the covers to let consumers perform tasks, such as ordering pizza, using their favorite chat or texting app.\nMicrosoft’s Azure Bot Service, now in preview, builds on the company’s much touted Bot Framework , which aims to support all the popular chat and texting applications in the universe.\n“This is a full application, a managed platform that does all you need to host a bot,” Microsoft executive vice president Scott Guthrie told Fortune .\nThe service relies on Azure Functions, which like the Lambda service from Microsoft msft rival Amazon Web Services, lets developers quickly build in capabilities that are triggered by a user action. There are tons of uses in the connected world of devices, the so-called Internet of things.\nFor example, an Internet-connected button could be programmed to order milk or a ride from point A to point B. Microsoft and Amazon are vying to ensure that their cloud services are the ones facilitating those deceptively simple actions.\nDevelopers can use Microsoft’s new service to build bots, basically, at no cost. “You can stand up a bot endpoint, we do all the challenging integration so you can publish through Facebook fb , Google , Slack, Microsoft Teams, Skype and you can use any programming language,” Guthrie said.\nSo basically developers can use whatever tool set or software development language they want, provided they commit to using Microsoft Azure to run the backend operations. Charges only apply when the bot is used.\nBots are a hot item in an age when consumers are suffering from app overload . Why have different apps from Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks , Peets and every company in the caffeine-supplier universe if you can use an existing messaging app or Facebook Messenger to order from any of the above? Fewer downloads, less complexity, less app exhaustion is the selling point of those developing bot services.\nFor more on AI, watch \nMicrosoft, like public cloud leader Amazon amzn and rival Google goog , wants to make its cloud the home base for software developers. And within software generally, artificial intelligence is a key focus of its effort. Towards that end, Microsoft also said that OpenAI, a non-profit research organization, will use Azure as its “primary” cloud provider. OpenAI is\nTowards that end, Microsoft also said that OpenAI, a non-profit research organization, will use Azure as its “primary” cloud provider. OpenAI is backed by big name techies including Elon Musk; Y Combinator president Sam Altman; LinkedIn lnkd co-founder Reid Hoffman; and investor Peter Thiel. It aims to foster the safe use of artificial intelligence.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nOpenAI is using Azure’s Nvidia N-Series graphics processing units (GPUs), which will be made available to all customers starting in December.\nAs the name implies, GPUs are specialized chips that are particularly adept at handling compute-intensive graphical workloads like visualizations and simulations. They are well suited for handline neural networks, a particularly complicated form of AI that tries to solve problems by mimicking the human brain.\nAn OpenAI spokesman confirmed that the “vast majority” of its AI and deep learning workloads are moving to Azure, but this is not an exclusive arrangement. The organization will continue to explore other cloud services on an “as-needed basis.”",

      "text": "Microsoft teams up with Elon Musk’s OpenAI project Posted Twitter (finally) updates its abuse policy: easier reporting of trolls, more granular mutes \nOpenAI , the artificial intelligence research non-profit backed by Tesla’s Elon Musk, Y Combinator’s Sam Altman, a Donald Trump fan called Peter Thiel, and numerous other tech luminaries , is partnering with Microsoft to tackle the next set of challenges in the still-nascent field. \nOpenAI will also make Microsoft Azure its preferred cloud platform, in part because of its existing support for AI workloads with the help of Azure Batch and Azure Machine Learning, as well as Microsoft’s work on its recently rebranded Cognitive Toolkit . Microsoft also offers developers access to a high-powered GPU-centric virtual machine for these kind of machine learning workloads. These N-Series machines are still in beta, but OpenAI has been an early adopter of them and Microsoft says they will become generally available in December. \nAmazon already offers a similar kind of GPU-focused virtual machine, though oddly enough, Google has lagged behind and — at least for the time being — doesn’t offer this kind of machine type yet. \n“Through this partnership, Microsoft and OpenAI will advance their mutual goal to democratize AI , so everyone can benefit,” a Microsoft spokesperson told me when I asked for specifics about the partnership. “ Microsoft Research researchers will partner with researchers at OpenAI to advance the state of AI and OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure and Microsoft ‘s N-series hardware for their future research and development, and explore tools such as Microsoft ’s Cognitive Toolkit for their research.” Microsoft didn’t want to comment on whether there is any monetary component to the partnership. \nIn addition to the OpenAI partnership, Microsoft also today launched its Azure Bot Service, a new service that will allow developers to most easily and cost-effectively host their bots on Azure. The service sits on top of the “serverless” Azure Functions tool and Microsoft Bot Framework. Using Azure Functions ensures that you only pay when your bot is actually being used.

      "text": "print Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie Microsoft \nMicrosoft has announced a new partnership with OpenAI , the $1 billion artificial intelligence research nonprofit cofounded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator President Sam Altman . \nUnder the terms of the partnership, OpenAI will use the Microsoft Azure cloud computing service as the \"preferred\" place to do its AI experiments. In return, Microsoft gets increased access to OpenAI's deep bench of robotics and experts, making Azure a better place for building AI-powered software. \n\"You want to get a good feedback loop going,\" says Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie. \"That helps you ultimately build a better platform.\" \nArtificial intelligence is going to be a big point of competition between Microsoft Azure, the leading Amazon Web Services , and the relative upstart Google Cloud over the months and years to come. As Guthrie says, \"any application is ultimately going to weave in AI,\" and Microsoft wants to be the company that helps developers do the weaving. \nThat's where the OpenAI partnership becomes so important, Guthrie says. \nBecause we're still in the earliest days of artificial intelligence, he says, the biggest challenge is figuring out what exactly can be done with artificial intelligence. Guthrie calls this \"understanding the art of the possible.\" \nElon Musk jurvetson / Flickr \nWith OpenAI, a research institution focused largely on just that, it's a natural collaboration as they work to \"jointly build an even richer ecosystem around artificial intelligence\" and \"learn as fast as possible,\" Guthrie says. \nGuthrie highlights the fact that Microsoft customers like ThyssenKrupp and Uber are already working with Azure and its artificial intelligence capabilities to power things like fixing elevators before they actually break or making sure your driver is actually your driver. \nCombine that with Microsoft's expertise in serving large business customers and helping them build applications that can securely handle large amounts of data, and Guthrie believes Microsoft really stands out from the pack. \n\"Combined, they help make Azure an even more differentiated platform,\" Guthrie says.

Adobe issued a fix for its software last week. Microsoft says it’s testing a patch and will release it next week.\nMicrosoft acknowledged the problem Tuesday, saying only that it affected older versions of Windows and was used by a group called Strontium to target “a specific set of customers.”\nThe security firm Crowdstrike and others have linked Strontium, also known as “Fancy Bear,” to recent attacks on government, media and political targets in several countries.",

      "text": " 30 AM EST ImageWare Systems Releases Newsletter on Enterprise-Ready Biometric Authentication for the Microsoft Ecosystem Featuring Insights from Gartner GoVerifyID(R) Enterprise Suite Addresses Gartner's Previously Identified Challenges for Reliable and Trusted Authentication Solutions \nSAN DIEGO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/15/16 -- ImageWare Systems, Inc. (ImageWare) ( OTCQB: IWSY ), a leader in mobile and cloud-based biometric identity management solutions, today distributed its newsletter featuring research from leading analyst firm Gartner on the first enterprise-ready biometric platform that seamlessly integrates with Microsoft infrastructure. ImageWare's latest innovation, GoVerifyID® Enterprise Suite, is a multi-modal, multi-factor end-to-end biometric authentication solution that solves the numerous challenges Gartner previously identified in a research report published in April 2016. In a clear, side-by-side comparison, the newsletter explains how GoVerifyID's cutting-edge technology paired with ImageWare's flexible business model addresses key barriers that previously prevented enterprises from implementing biometric authentication for employees, customers, vendors, and partners. \n\"As a pioneer in the biometric authentication space, we have worked to understand and address pain points for the enterprise, including the extension of incumbent authentication methods to support a growing mobile workforce,\" said Jim Miller, chairman and CEO of ImageWare. \"The industry was in need of a secure, consistent, device-agnostic, user friendly and snap-in solution, and we are pleased to present the solution -- GoVerifyID Enterprise Suite -- that addresses the key challenges Gartner has documented.\" \nDue to numerous high profile data breaches, it is now widely acknowledged that traditional passwords alone are not secure. In fact, as the number one vector for data breaches, passwords are involved in more than 80 percent of all security attacks. ImageWare's GoVerifyID Enterprise Suite extends reliable, multi-modal biometric authentication to all stationary and mobile users to enable high assurance authentication with multiple security layers for added protection. GoVerifyID Enterprise Suite offers unlimited scalability and works hand-in-glove with non-biometric measures companies already have in place. The platform supports flexible user authentication security policies for different use cases and user roles with a single sign-on across all corporate systems, mobile devices, desktops, web applications, and enterprise networks. \nAccording to a report published by Gartner research analyst Anmol Singh, more than 50 percent of organizations are unable to extend incumbent authentication methods to support expanding digital workplace requirements -- including access for an increasingly mobile workforce.* However, the same report shares the prediction that by the year 2020, 60 percent of organizations pursuing digital workplace strategies will adopt contextual authentication and adaptive access for improved user experience, up from less than 5% today. \nTo access ImageWare's complimentary newsletter, visit https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/imageWare/1-3INICKX/index.html \n*Gartner, \"Balance Trust and Agility With Good Authentication Choices for Workforce Local Access.\" 01 April 2016 \nAbout ImageWare Systems, Inc.

      "text": "Author: Cade Metz. Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 11.15.16. Time of Publication: 9:00 am. 9:00 am OpenAI Joins Microsoft on the Cloud’s Next Big Front: Chips OpenAI co-chairman Sam Altman and Microsoft AI and research chief Harry Shum. Brian Smale \nTo build OpenAI—a new artificial intelligence lab that seeks to openly share its research with the world at large—Elon Musk and Sam Altman recruited several top researchers from inside Google and Facebook. But if this unusual project is going to push AI research to new heights, it will need more than talent. It will needs enormous amounts of computing power. \nGoogle and Facebook have the resources needed to build the massive computing clusters that drive modern AI research, including vast networks of machines packed with GPU processors and other specialized chips . Google has even gone so far as to build its own AI processor . But although OpenAI says it’s backed by more than a billion dollars in funding, the company is taking a different route. It’s using cloud computing services offered by Microsoft and perhaps other tech giants. “We have a very high need for compute load, and Microsoft can help us support that,” says Altman, the president of the tech incubator Y Combinator and co-chairman of OpenAI alongside Musk, the founder of the electric car company Tesla. President Barack Obama on How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect Jobs \nThe arrangement points to a new battlefield in the increasingly important world of cloud computing, where companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google offer massive amounts of computing power over the Internet. OpenAI is part of a sweeping movement towards deep neural networks , networks of hardware and software than learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, and this technology leans heavily on GPUs and other specialized chips, including the TPU processor built by Google. As deep learning continues to spread across the tech industry—driving everything from image and speech recognition to machine translation to security—companies and developers will require cloud computing services that provide this new breed of hardware. \n“Anyone who wants a trained neural net model to handle real enterprise workloads either uses multiple GPUs or twiddles their thumbs for days,” says Chris Nicholson, founder of Skymind, a San Francisco startup that helps other companies build deep learning applications . “So every company that needs AI to improve the accuracy of its predictions and data recognition [will run] on them. The market is large now and will be huge.” Skymind’s own operations run on GPU-backed cloud computing services offered by Microsoft and Amazon. \nA research outfit like OpenAI, which is trying to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, requires more specialized computing power than the average shop. Deep learning research is often a matter of extreme trial and error across enormous farms of GPUs . But even if you’re training existing AI algorithms on your own data, you still need help from chips like this. Related Stories",

The app applies certain filters to make colors stand out. \nIt's made to help those with red/green, green/red, or blue/yellow colorblindness. \nFor example, with reds and greens, the app’s filters can turn the red to a pink, or darken the green to help users tell the colors apart. \nThe app is meant to be used as a viewfinder, it can’t apply the filters to images or video already captured, according to Microsoft. \nThe Microsoft blog explains how this tool that can help people with daily tasks. Cooking and choosing matching clothes were a couple of the examples. \nMore details here . Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "share \nMicrosoft's new Surface Dial debuted alongside the Surface Studio last month. While it's available as a separate accessory for $99, less than 20 apps support it out of the box. Some of those apps just offer basic zoom and volume controls, but there are a couple that stand out. Sketchable includes various radial menus for drawing controls, and now Drawboard looks like the best case yet for the Dial. \nDrawboard , a PDF markup app, is adding support for Microsoft's Surface Dial in an upcoming app update. It's designed as an app to manage drawings and documents, with support for touch and ink to leave annotations for colleagues or friends. A number of architects and engineers use Drawboard, and the company is making use of the Dial to bring a virtual protractor and ruler to the app. As the Dial reports its angle, architects will be able to set angles for drawing annotations or even set the grid overlays with the Dial. \nDrawboard details the new features in a promotional video for Microsoft's Surface channel on YouTube, and they certainly look impressive. Microsoft is allowing developers to extend the use of the Dial in their applications, and it's apps like Drawboard and Sketchable that show the potential of the Surface Dial. Just like StaffPad with the Surface Pen , Microsoft will need many more apps to lead the way in showing why this new hardware could be useful for creatives, engineers, architects, and other professionals.

Skype users can create a special conversation that link that can now be shared with anyone to enable messaging, voice / video calling, and screen sharing, all free without an account. \nSkype without an account works on the web, and up to 300 people can participate in a Skype group chat, with up to 25 people on a voice or video call. If you use Skype as a guest then the conversation will only last for 24 hours, and if you want to access features like calling landlines or Skype Translator then you'll still need a regular Skype account.

      "text": "Image Credit: Code.org Microsoft announced the next effort in a series of educational Minecraft products today: the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer , a free tutorial co-developed by Code.org that teaches students as young as six years old the basic problem-solving and critical thinking skills that underly programming.\nCode.org CEO Hadi Partovi. The program was created for the Hour of Code , an annual campaign that takes place during Computer Science week from Dec. 5-11 and encourages young students and educators to spend an hour learning coding skills. A Minecraft tutorial developed for last year’s event reached 30 million students worldwide, Microsoft says.\nThe new tutorial builds on last year’s success, allowing students to program and play their own Minecraft games. The game uses Code.org’s drag-and-drop coding interface to teach students basic computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, event-handlers and repeat loops.\nThe students face a series of 12 challenges that teach them skills, and are then able to create their own game, which they can then share and play with friends. The games are highly customizable — students use the skills they learned to make monsters run away instead of attacking, or chickens that lay solid gold.\n“We are partnering with Code.org again this year to make computer science more accessible to millions of youth around the world with ‘Minecraft’ and Hour of Code,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “I am inspired by the ‘Minecraft’ generation who view themselves not as players of a game, but as creators of the new worlds they dream up. This is the generation that will imagine, build and create our future, and together we can equip them with the computational thinking and problem-solving skills to seize the opportunities ahead.”\nThe dramatic rise in tech and computer science jobs projected over the coming decades is shining a light on early computer science education, leading to increased efforts like the Hour of Code that attempt to develop tools for young learners.\n“Code.org was founded with the vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science — not only because it’s foundational for any career, but because students love it,” Hadi Partovi, co-founder and CEO of Code.org, said in a release. “‘Minecraft’ is a special game that appeals to a diverse global community. We’re delighted to have the chance to teach students coding with the fun familiarity of ‘Minecraft,’ to engage students of all backgrounds and skill levels.”\nCode.org has collaborated on a number of programs for the Hour of Code campaign, including Frozen and Star Wars -themed hits in years past.\nMicrosoft, which acquired Minecraft developer Mojang last year, has developed other educational tools based on the popular game, including Microsoft: Education Edition which allows educators to use the game as a sandbox for various lesson plans.",

      "text": "svenska Microsoft and Code.org announce free Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial for Computer Science Education Week, Dec. 5-11 With 30 million trials of last year's Hour of Code tutorial, Microsoft and Code.org believe the new offering will again introduce tens of millions to coding for the first time; Microsoft Stores to also host coding workshops worldwide during Computer Science Education Week. News provided by Nov 15, 2016, 09:30 ET Share this article REDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. and Code.org on Tuesday unveiled the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer, a coding tutorial for students and educators created for Hour of Code , an annual, global campaign held during Computer Science Education Week, Dec. 5 – 11. The new web-based tutorial — available for free at http://code.org/minecraft — enables beginner coders to create and share their own simple \"Minecraft\" game, and is designed to empower anyone to begin learning the problem-solving and critical thinking skills required in today's tech-fueled world. Created by \"Minecraft\" game designers at Mojang and Microsoft, in partnership with Code.org, the fun and easy-to-learn one-hour experience builds on the success of last year's record-breaking \"Minecraft\" tutorial, which reached more than 30 million students worldwide. With the goal of inspiring millions more to try coding for the first time — and to keep going on their journey of learning computer science — as of today's launch, the tutorial is available in 10 languages, including Spanish. It is scheduled to be available in 50 languages by Dec. 5 . With the immense popularity of \"Minecraft\" around the world, Microsoft and Code.org believe the tutorial has the potential to reach people of all ages and likeness. Women and girls already compose nearly half of the game's global fan base. The tutorial also underscores Microsoft's commitment to ensuring all young people have the opportunity to learn computer science, an economic and social imperative in this era of digital transformation, which is expected to generate 1.4 million computing jobs in the U.S. alone by 2020 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . In the U.S., 40 percent of schools do not teach computer science, and Microsoft aims to reach students most likely to be among those without access, particularly girls and minorities. \"We are partnering with Code.org again this year to make computer science more accessible to millions of youth around the world with 'Minecraft' and Hour of Code,\" said Satya Nadella , CEO, Microsoft. \"I am inspired by the 'Minecraft' generation who view themselves not as players of a game, but as creators of the new worlds they dream up. This is the generation that will imagine, build and create our future, and together we can equip them with the computational thinking and problem-solving skills to seize the opportunities ahead.\" Designed for ages 6 and up, the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer teaches students to create their own \"Minecraft\" experience where they can program the rules. They can make chickens that drop gold, or zombies that run away instead of attacking. Along the way, students use Code.org's familiar drag-and-drop coding interface to learn computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, event handlers and repeat loops. Players face a series of 12 challenges, culminating in creating their own simple game, which they can share with friends. \"The 2016 Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial builds on the success of the original in a great way,\" said Mike Harvey , technology teacher from Falmouth, Maine . \"By programming familiar game events themselves, learners will be able to experience computer science in a way that is authentic as well as fun. The open-ended challenges help to show that our favorite games (like 'Minecraft') are ultimately created with code.\" \"Code.org was founded with the vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science — not only because it's foundational for any career, but because students love it,\" said Hadi Partovi , co-founder and CEO, Code.org. \"'Minecraft' is a special game that appeals to a diverse global community. We're delighted to have the chance to teach students coding with the fun familiarity of 'Minecraft,' to engage students of all backgrounds and skill levels.\" In support of Code.org and the global Hour of Code campaign, Microsoft will also lead thousands of youth coding events in more than 60 countries. During Computer Science Education Week, this includes hundreds of free workshops hosted by Microsoft Stores across the globe. Students can reserve a spot in a store workshop by visiting microsoft.com/youthsparkprograms and also visit their local Microsoft Store to learn more. In addition to the latest tutorial and coding events, Microsoft has also been receiving rave reviews from educators on the newly launched \"Minecraft: Education Edition\" title, a fully featured title that brings the magic of \"Minecraft\" to the classroom for more immersive, long- term lesson plans.

      "title": "Microsoft's Excel API Now Generally Available | ProgrammableWeb",
      "text": "By Eric Carter , ProgrammableWeb Staff Microsoft has announced the general availability of its Microsoft Excel REST API for Office 365. Through the API, developers can integrate the popular business tool with third party applications to enhance the value of data, reporting, and dashboards. The Excel API represents another step in Microsoft's journey to make Office an open developer platform. The Excel API is exposed through Microsoft Graph. Accordingly, Microsoft is able to conduct and provide business intelligence and other insights related to Excel usage. Microsoft envisions a number of uses for Excel within third party apps, but gave a few examples to pique potential users' interest (e.g. Excel as a calculation service, Excel as a reporting service, and Excel as a data service). Two early partners already utilizing the Excel API include Zapier and Sage . Zapier now offers zaps where data transfers from services like email and surveys to Excel spreadsheets. Sage has integrated Excel with its accounting software package to allow users to combine the business data from Sage with the productivity functionality of Excel. For those looking to get started, visit the Excel-specific developer site . The site includes complete documentation and code samples. See how to build a basic Excel to-do list with just a few lines of code. Microsoft encourages users to provide feedback through GitHub and Stack Overflow . New feature suggestions are welcome through UserVoice . About the author: Eric Carter Eric the founder of Dartsand and Corporate Counsel for a specialty technology distributor.

      "text": "The latest DocAve release allows organizations to safely deploy customizations, backup and restore NetApp systems, and features additional support for hybrid SharePoint management\nVienna (PRWEB) November 15, 2016\nFrom the halls of the European SharePoint Conference (ESPC) 2016, AvePoint, the Microsoft Cloud expert, today announced the general availability of DocAve 6 Service Pack (SP) 8, the enterprise-class SharePoint management platform. With this release, organizations can safely deploy customizations, backup and restore NetApp Systems, and access additional hybrid management and SharePoint 2016 management.\nWith DocAve, organizations have access to a platform of fully integrated solutions that simplify and centralize all of their management capabilities across cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid SharePoint environments. New features include:\nSafe Customization Deployment: DocAve Deployment Manager now features full integration with Rencore’s SharePoint Code Analysis Framework (SPCAF) Farm Protection. Developers and administrators can easily scan each SharePoint customization before deployment or migration to any Office 365 environment or on-premises farm to detect potential issues and risks to the environment, operational processes, and data.\nBackup and Restore NetApp Systems: DocAve Backup and Restore and High Availability expand to be able to restore from NetApp SnapShots to provide the fastest SharePoint backup and recovery solutions. In addition, DocAve now supports data restoration using snapshots through an integration with NetApp Data ONTAP data management software to provide faster speed, data replication capabilities, disaster recovery, farm cloning, and storage optimization. This provides continued support for customers affected by the discontinuation of NetApp SnapManager for Microsoft SharePoint.\nAdditional Support for SharePoint Hybrid Management: In order to provide a better hybrid experience for both end users and administrators, DocAve Replicator allows organizations to perform one-way, real-time replications of SharePoint content and Nintex Workflows from on-premises SharePoint to Office 365 – SharePoint Online. Administrators can also use DocAve Replicator to configure business rules that allow end users to publish content to sites, libraries, and lists across different SharePoint versions. With DocAve Administrator, administrators can now also reduce business disruption and improve end user experience by combing site collections, sites, and subsites for broken links across hybrid deployments.\n“With every release of DocAve, we aim to build functionality that meets and anticipates the ever-changing needs of our customers,” said John Peluso, Senior Vice President of Product Strategy, AvePoint. “By introducing new integrations with enterprise-class technology leaders, organizations will have access to expansive performance and speed enhancements, but also the strength and resiliency of knowing their solution will be matched against industry best practices from Rencore and NetApp.”\nThe latest release of DocAve 6 SP 8 is generally available today, November 15, 2016, for SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint 2013. For more information on the platform and product features, please visit AvePoint at ESPC booth #22 or visit our website.\nAbout AvePoint\nAvePoint is the Microsoft Cloud expert.

By: IANS | New York | Published:November 15, 2016 1:33 pm Microsoft said it entered into agreements with two wind farms to power its Cheyenne datacentre from renewable sources. (Image: Microsoft) \nMicrosoft said its Cheyenne datacentre in Wyoming will now be powered entirely by 237 megawatts of wind energy. “Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate,” Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer, said in a Microsoft blog post on Monday. “That’s why we are announcing our largest wind energy purchases yet – 237 megawatts of wind energy – that will allow our datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming to be powered entirely by wind power,” Smith added. \nMicrosoft has also structured the purchase and partnered with the local utility in novel ways to facilitate a shift of cities and states towards a cleaner energy grid. Microsoft said it entered into agreements with two wind farms to power its Cheyenne datacentre from renewable sources. \nOf the two partnerships, Microsoft has procured 178 megawatts from the Bloom Wind Project in Kansas through Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to help bring this new project online and partnered with Black Hills Corp. to purchase wind power from the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nWith these energy deals, Microsoft’s total investment in wind energy projects in the US has gone up to over 500 megawatts.",

      "text": "Company Uses Mixed Reality Technology to Develop Immersive Medical Simulations for its Life Sciences Clients\nSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) November 15, 2016\nMultiple reports have predicted that, within 10 years, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) could produce revenue in the tens of billions of dollars. A recent industry report on the future of AR/VR from September 2016 also estimated that roughly 25% of the investment in this technology will be directed to healthcare.\nViscira, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions and software products for the life sciences industry, has recognized this opportunity and is actively capitalizing on these advancements by offering innovative VR and AR solutions that communicate healthcare information in very personal and immersive ways. Most recently, the company has begun development efforts using the Microsoft HoloLens, a mixed reality, holographic headset that incorporates both virtual reality and augmented reality by seamlessly blending high-definition holograms with the real world.\nViscira’s HoloLens solutions aim to create networked VR experiences by connecting health care professionals (HCPs) remotely and transporting them into 3D virtual worlds. These worlds can depict a mechanism of action of a drug or a virtual conference environment. For example, the HoloLens might “teleport” a hologram of a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) enabling them to speak directly in front of a health care professional in their own environment (e.g. office, living room, etc.). This would simulate the experience of presenting to someone in person in the same physical space, while offering the convenience of remote attendance.\nRodwin Pabello, Viscira’s Director of Product Development, commented on the use of mixed reality technology for developing compelling communication programs for its clients. “We are very excited about the advancements we are seeing with VR/AR technology and what they can do for medical communication and marketing. We are exploring many different applications for using the Microsoft HoloLens. In the future, this type of technology might even supplant the iPad as a primary tool for interaction between a pharma sales rep and a healthcare professional.”\nViscira’s virtual and augmented reality solutions are examples of the innovative, interactive software applications and digital solutions the company offers. Viscira’s strategic approach, combined with its delivery of cutting-edge products, has resulted in an impressive roster of clients that includes 21 of the top 25 pharma and biotech companies in the world.\nAbout Viscira\nViscira is dedicated to the design and development of digital marketing solutions and interactive software applications for the life sciences industry. Viscira provides a suite of programs that integrate best-in-class technology to deliver engaging and memorable content via various electronic channels. Viscira is part of the Sudler & Hennessey Group, a leading global healthcare communications network.

      "text": "These Are 3 Reasons Not to Use Microsoft's New Outlook CRM Offering The technology is great. But are you? By Gene Marks Gene Marks is a columnist, author, and small-business owner. He oversees the Marks Group, a 10-person technology consultancy to small and medium-size businesses. A certified public accountant, Marks has also worked in the entrepreneurial services arm of KPMG. He writes for The Washington Post , Forbes , and The Huffington Post. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nMy ten-person company is a Microsoft Partner and a fan of Microsoft. We specialize in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). We sell their recently re-branded Dynamics CRM product line. We also sell and implement three other great customer relationship management applications too - Salesforce.com , ZohoCRM and GoldMine . \nYesterday , Microsoft announced a new product called Outlook Customer Manager, which is a lighter CRM product that will be included at no extra charge in the Office 365 Business Edition. It looks like a great product, particularly for small businesses. Your team will be able to track - on pretty much any device - customer interactions, emails, activities, notes, deals and other information right from within Outlook. \nSeems like a no-brainer for any Office user, right? Well, hold your horses. \nWe have been implementing CRM applications for more than 20 years. Our company serves more than 600 active CRM clients. We have had many awesome, celebratory, cork-popping successes. Unfortunately, we've also had our share of sad, tearful, profanity-filled failures. Why? Why do some companies succeed with these systems while others fail? We've learned that the product doesn't matter. The size of the company doesn't matter. It's something else. The Outlook Customer Manager can be a huge asset for your business. But, like some of my clients, you may fail with it. And for these three reasons: \nReason 1: You don't have an administrator in charge. \nMicrosoft is giving you a shared database as part of Office 365. That database will quickly turn into useless data unless someone is in charge of it. That person doesn't need to be a technical guru - just a good power user. And you, the owner, need to make sure that this person has your authority to kick butt, wipe noses and change the diapers of the sales and service people who will be entering data into the system. Your administrator is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the database - anything incorrect, out of date or missing is not that person's fault, but it is their responsibility to fix it and implement controls so that it doesn't happen again. If you don't have this person in place (it's a cost, by the way) you will fail. \nReason 2: The boss (that's you) isn't committed. \nFor a CRM system to work, even a lighter version like the Outlook Customer Manager, the executive in charge must be fully committed to it. That's you. You're using the system. You are the leader. You're providing emotional, financial and educational support for your administrator. You tell your team that this is the company's system and everyone's going to use it. You invest in outside help (that's me) to get it up and running and used the right way with the proper training and service. You don't cave in when people complain because they don't like the color of the screen or the font, or that things take extra clicks or that it's not \"user friendly.\" For this system to work, your people will need to do more work. You provide resources to help them but you stand firm because this is your database. You realize that using this product the right way will help you increase your sales, improve your customer service and make your company more profitable...and valuable. Stand firm. Commit. Or you will fail. \nReason 3: You're not using the data. \nMy best clients have 2-3 key reports coming out of their CRM systems every week or so - open quotes, new leads, customer problems, salespeople activities, etc. Managers read these reports and rely on the data to help them run their companies. In the end, the Outlook Customer Manager is nothing more than a shared database that you can use to grow your business. If you're looking at data in the system - through reports or even an output to Excel - you can not only ensure that the data is accurate but that your team is using the system the right way. Have a few key reports or you will fail. \nAs a Microsoft partner with CRM competency, I plan to reach out to our smaller clients and discuss with them the advantages of getting Office 365 with the Outlook Customer Manager. I will offer our services to help them use it the right way. But I will respectfully advise not using this product if a client is not prepared to invest in an administrator or reports or shows little interest in adopting the system into their company culture. \nAny of these three reasons are reasons enough not to use this great new service.

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Tuesday, November 15, 2016 NVIDIA And Microsoft Combine DGX-1 Supercomputer With Azure Cloud To Accelerate AI Artificial intelligence is at the center of several evolving and next-generation products and services, everything from video games a nd smartphones ( virtual digital assistants and messaging ) to self-driving cars and web searchers . It has the attention of companies small and large, including NVIDIA and Microsoft , the two of which are partnering to push AI technologies more aggressively into the enterprise. What this essentially boils down to is pairing NVIDIA's DGX-1 supercomputer with Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. The idea is to \"help companies join the AI revolution\" and this partnership means enterprises now have an AI platform that spans from their data center to Microsoft's cloud. \"Every industry has awoken to the potential of AI,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. \"We've worked with Microsoft to create a lightning-fast AI platform that is available from on-premises with our DGX-1 supercomputer to the Microsoft Azure cloud. With Microsoft's global reach, every company around the world can now tap the power of AI to transform their business.\" The optimized platform runs the new Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit on NVIDIA's GPUs, including the DGX-1 powered by Pascal with NVLink interconnect technology. It also runs on Azure N-Series virtual machines, which are currently being previewed. This gives customers access to \"unprecedented performance\" for deep learning applications, and it's easy to use. It should also speed up adoption, as intended. The Cognitive Toolkit uses a single framework to train models on premises with the DGX-1 or other NVIDIA GPU-based systems, and then run those models in the cloud on Azure. It's a scalable, hybrid solution that fast tracks the path to prototype and deployment for enterprises.\"We're working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world's most pressing problems,\" said Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft. \"By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we've made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.\"This is a big deal for both companies, though perhaps more so for NVIDIA. The GPU maker is heavily invested in AI—in just two years, the number of firms NVIDiA collaborates with on deep learning has jumped 194x to 19,000. It spans several industries, such as healthcare, life sciences, energy, automotive, and more.",

Unfortunately, his brash and aggressive burst of frustration swiftly backfired when the series of threats aimed at the President -elect shortly made it to Reddit and eventually appeared on a number of media outlets, causing PacketSled to place the aggravated CEO on an administrative leave. “I’m going to kill the the president-elect,” Matt Harrigan wrote on his personal Facebook…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft released an update for its Windows Maps app today for Fast ring Insiders, bringing the version number to 5.1611.3191.0. The new build is available for both PCs and phones. \nThe idea behind this update is to allow you to submit a correction. Indeed, the landscape of maps changes constantly, and it's tough for services to keep on top of it. Now, you'll be able to tell Microsoft if a restaurant has closed down, or if there's a new road that's not on the map yet. \nYou'll also be able to point out when something is wrong with a map. Examples that Microsoft provide include a hospital being on a list of Italian restaurants, a missing road, a city in the wrong language, and the wrong details about a business, such as incorrect hours of operation. \nMicrosoft continues to improve its Maps app regularly. It's last update was only a few weeks ago , and it added the ability to \"organize your favorites, and save places into collections.\" \nIf you're not an Insider, you shouldn't have to wait too long to get today's new features. It will likely show up in the Windows Store after a couple weeks. To download or update your Windows Maps app, click here . Tags",

      "text": "By Rebecca Johnson Updated September 15, 2016 . \nEver ask yourself, \"How do I count my words\" while writing a Microsoft Word document? It's easy to view how many words are in your Word 2010, Word 2007 and Word for Mac 2011 documents. The status bar displays the word count, and the steps to view the information are practically the same in all three versions of the software. \nYou may want to view how many words are in your document for a school or work assignment or to meet publishing requirements for a blog post or other document. Microsoft Word counts the words as you type and displays this information in simple form in the status bar. For expanded statistics on character count, paragraphs and other information, just open the Word Count window. Display the Word Count in the Status Bar. Photo © Rebecca Johnson Word Count in the Status Bar for Word 2010 and Word 2007 \nThe word count for Word 2010 and Word 2007 displays in the status bar located at the bottom of the document. It displays how many words are in a document without requiring you to open another window. \nWord 2010 and Word 2007 don't display the word count in the status bar automatically. If you don't see the word count displayed in the status bar: Right-click on the status bar at the bottom of the document. Select ​\" Word Count​\" from the Customize Status Bar options to display the word count in the status bar. \ncontinue reading below our video Ways You're Probably Screwing Up Your Computer Word for Mac 2011 Word Count. Photo © Rebecca Johnson Word Count in the Status Bar for Word for Mac 2011 \nWord for Mac displays the word count differently from Word 2010 and Word 2007. Instead of showing only the total word count, Word for Mac displays the words you highlight along with the total number of words in the status bar at the bottom of the document. If no text is highlighted, the status bar displays only the word count for the entire document. Word Count for Selected Text. Photo © Rebecca Johnson View Word Count for Selected Text in Word \nTo view how many words are in a sentence or a paragraph, select the text. The word count of the selected text displays in the status bar at the bottom of the document. Read Top 5 Timesavers in Word for tips on selecting text. You can count the words in several text boxes at the same time by pressing and holding CTRL while you make the text selections. \nIn Word for Mac, insert the cursor into the document rather than selecting text to display the word count up to the point of the insertion bar. Word Count Window. Photo © Rebecca Johnson The Word Count Window \nWhen you need more than a simple word count, the information is available in the Word Count pop-up window. This window displays the number of words, the number of characters with spaces, the number of characters without spaces, the number of lines and the number of paragraphs. \nTo open the Word Count Window in Word 2010 and Word 2007: Select the \"Review\" tab. Click \"Word Count\" in the Proofing section. Select the check box next to \"Include Textboxes, Footnotes, and Endnotes\" to include these items in the word count. Click the \"Close\" button. \n\nTo open the Word Count Window in Word for Mac 2011: Select \"Word Count\" from the \"Tools\" menu or click the word count in the status bar. Deselect the check box next to \"Include Footnotes and Endnotes\" to remove these items from the word count. View totals for pages, words, characters with and without spaces, paragraphs and lines. Click the \"Close\" button. Give It a Try! \nNow that you see how easy it is to view the word count in your document, give it try! Next time you are working in a Microsoft Word program, glance at the status bar and see how many words are in your document.",

Health Tip of the Day Sign up There was an error. Please try again. Please select a newsletter. Please enter a valid email address. Did you mean ? How to Automate Mail Merge through VBA in Microsoft Excel. Credit: www.exceltip.com / Google Images Updated April 03, 2016 . \nMicrosoft's Mail Merge feature allows you to send the same document with slight changes to a large number of recipients. The term \"merge\" comes from the fact that one document (a letter, for example) is merged with a data source document, such as a spreadsheet . \nWord's mail merge feature works seamlessly with data from Excel. While Word also allows you to create its own data source, options for using this data are limited. Further, if you already have your data in a spreadsheet, it doesn't make much sense to retype all the information into Word's data source. Preparing Your Data for Mail Merge \nTheoretically, you can use any Excel worksheet in a Word mail merge function without any special preparation. However, it is recommended that you take some time to prepare your worksheet to optimize the mail merge process. \nHere are a few guidelines to observe that will help make the mail merge process go more smoothly. Organize Your Spreadsheet Data \nAt the risk of stating the obvious, your data should be organized neatly into rows and columns. Think of each row as a single record and each column as a field you are going to insert into your document. (Check out the Excel data-entry tutorial if you need a refresher.) Create a Header Row \nCreate a header row for the sheet you intend to use for the mail merge. A header row is a row containing labels that identify the data in the cells below. Excel can be finicky sometimes about differentiating between data and labels, so make these clear by using bold text, cell borders and cell shading that are unique to the header row. This will ensure Excel differentiates it from the rest of your data. \nLater when you are merging the data with the main document, the labels will appear as the names of the merge fields, so there will be no confusion as to what data you are inserting into your document. Furthermore, it's a good practice to label your columns, as it helps prevent user error. Put All Data on a Single Sheet \nThe data you intend to use for the mail merge must be on one sheet. If it is spread across multiple sheets, you will need to combine the sheets or perform multiple mail merges. Also, make sure the sheets are clearly named , as you will need to be able to select the sheet you intend to use without viewing it. \nOnce you make sure your data is prepared, you're ready for the next step.

      "text": "Updated February 29, 2016 . About.com Rating \nPrimoPDF is a free PDF converter for Microsoft Word. If you use Word 2003 or earlier, or don't own Microsoft Word but have Word documents, this app will help you turn your documents into PDF format documents. \nIt does not offer the ability to edit PDF files, but there is a paid version that does. Pros of PrimoPDF \nI’m a sucker for free software. Any free program that does what it claims to do without crashing my computer or causing any adverse effects automatically gets 2½ stars. That said, I’m giving PrimoPDF 4 out of 5 stars.Using a broadband connection, I downloaded and installed the PDF converter in a matter of minutes. There were no options to specify, no messy desktop icons to delete and no system reboot required. \nWithin minutes of installing, I had successfully converted a Word document into PDF format (optimized for screen viewing). The conversion process itself was quick, executed through the print function, and the resulting document looked identical to my Word document. \ncontinue reading below our video Get Better Pictures from Your Phone Cons of PrimoPDF \nCompared to the results I got converting a Word document, the negatives of the app are slight. \nFirstly, there is no toolbar button or menu item for the PDF converter; rather, the option is hidden in the print dialog box. The fact that the PDF converter is treated as a printer and is accessed through the print dialog box isn’t a big inconvenience in my opinion. However, you need to know where to look for the option, and users could become annoyed the first-time they use it as they search through menus and dialog boxes to find the command they need. \nSecondly, when beginning the conversion process, you must specify the full file path or use the Browse button to select where the newly converted PDF file will be saved. Otherwise the file won’t be saved or will be saved in a location I have as of yet to determine. \nThese inconveniences will probably diminish as one becomes more accustomed to the software, but the possibility that a document won’t be saved due to an ambiguous interface is never a good thing. \nSummary \nAll in all, I highly recommend this free PDF converter to any thrifty user who needs the ability to save Word files in PDF format but whose version of Word does not include built in support for this.",

      "text": "Anyone Can Use Skype Without an Account Updated 0 \nMicrosoft is making it easier to use Skype anywhere in the world without downloading the app or entering a password. \nSimply join Skype as a Guest to quickly chat with friends or make a voice or video call to family \"without any hassle,\" the company promised. \nGuest access was originally introduced in October 2015 to US and UK users, but the feature is now available to folks worldwide. To get started, visit Skype.com , click \"Start a conversation,\" and enter your name. Then copy and share your unique link to connect with up to 300 people via chat and up to 25 people on a voice or video call. \n\"Best of all, you can still enjoy all of Skype's free features, including one-to-one and group instant messaging, voice and video calls, screen sharing, and even file sharing—so everyone can join the fun,\" a company blog entry said. \nGuests can generate links only via a computer browser, though anyone can join the conversation from any Skype client or as a Guest using Skype for Web. Redmond last year also teased an on-the-go feature for iOS and Android mobile apps. \nBut beware: conversations are limited to 24 hours before disappearing. To return to a discussion, make a call, or use Skype Translator, you'll need to sign up for a free account. \nMembers gain access to additional features such as new Skype bots that can help plan travel or buy concert tickets, for example. The first round of artificial intelligence add-ons produced by Microsoft launched in August. They even allow users the opportunity to chat with Spock, second in command of the USS Enterprise. \nIt's not all positive news for Skype, though. The Redmond-owned company was recently accused of \"failing to adopt basic privacy protections on [its] instant messaging services, putting users' human rights at risk,\" Amnesty International said last month. Snapchat also landed in hot water. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com . Tags",

      "title": "Microsoft and Code.org unveil free Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft and Code.org today announced the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer, a coding tutorial for students and educators created for Hour of Code. Hour of Code is an annual, global campaign held during Computer Science Education Week, Dec. 5 – 11. This new tutorial is available for free at http://code.org/minecraft . This tutorial was created by “Minecraft” game designers at Mojang and Microsoft, in partnership with Code.org. Microsoft highlighted that last year’s “Minecraft” tutorial reached more than 30 million students worldwide. It is available in 10 languages, including Spanish and scheduled to be available in 50 languages by Dec. 5.\n“We are partnering with Code.org again this year to make computer science more accessible to millions of youth around the world with ‘Minecraft’ and Hour of Code,” said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. “I am inspired by the ‘Minecraft’ generation who view themselves not as players of a game, but as creators of the new worlds they dream up. This is the generation that will imagine, build and create our future, and together we can equip them with the computational thinking and problem-solving skills to seize the opportunities ahead.”\nThe Minecraft Hour of Code Designer teaches students to create their own “Minecraft” experience where they can program the rules. Students use Code.org’s familiar drag-and-drop coding interface to learn computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, event handlers and repeat loops. Students face a series of 12 challenges, culminating in creating their own simple game, which they can share with friends.\n“The 2016 Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial builds on the success of the original in a great way,” said Mike Harvey, technology teacher from Falmouth, Maine. “By programming familiar game events themselves, learners will be able to experience computer science in a way that is authentic as well as fun. The open-ended challenges help to show that our favorite games (like ‘Minecraft’) are ultimately created with code.”\nIn support of Code.org and the global Hour of Code campaign, Microsoft said that it will also lead thousands of youth coding events in more than 60 countries. During Computer Science Education Week, there will be hundreds of free workshops hosted by Microsoft Stores across the globe. Students can reserve a spot in a store workshop by visiting microsoft.com/youthsparkprograms and also visit their local Microsoft Store to learn more.\n",

      "text": "  \nHaving missed its opportunity to become a big player in the mobile market, Microsoft has been trying to have a forward-looking approach towards other technology fields over the last few years such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning. And as of today, the Redmond giant managed to achieve some technology breakthroughs such as its speech recognition technology which claimed the lowest-ever error rate in a recent benchmark . \nBut in 2016, Microsoft, which has become a big open source supporter ,is also looking to open up its AI efforts. That’s why the company announced today a new partnership with OpenAI, a nonprofit AI research organization co-founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever. \n“At Microsoft, we believe everyone deserves to be able to take advantage of these breakthroughs, in both their work and personal lives,” explained the company in today’s blog post, adding that “we are committed to democratizing AI and making it accessible to everyone.” In the video below, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research group Harry Shum and OpenAI’s Sam Altman explain why this new partnership will help both organizations as well as other companies deliver more breakthroughs in the AI field. \nThe partnership also makes some sense as OpenAI already chose Microsoft Azure as their primary cloud platform and is also an early adopter of the company’s Azure N-Series Virtual Machines . “OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure’s support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities such as Azure Batch, Azure Machine Learning and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK),” explained Microsoft. \nIn other AI-related news, Microsoft also announced today the launch of an Azure Bot service that will allow developers to leverage the Microsoft Bot Framework to deploy them on Azure. According to the technology giant, more than 50,000 developers are already using the Bot Framework to build chat bots. “We’ve made major strides in artificial intelligence just in the past five years, achieving milestones many people who have devoted their lives to the field wouldn’t have thought possible. Now, we have the opportunity to help our partners and customers use these breakthroughs to achieve their goals,” shared the company. In this story stream:",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced the Azure Bot Service, a first cloud Bot-as-a-Service in the industry. Using Azure Bot service, developers can accelerate the development of bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework and easily deploy and manage them on Azure. Since Bots run on Azure Functions, a serverless environment, so they scale based on demand and developers will have to pay only for the resources their bots consume.\nAzure Bot Service features:\nAccelerated development: Speed up development by working in an integrated environment that’s purpose-built for bot development. Get started in seconds with out-of-the-box templates including basic bot, Language Understanding Intelligent Service bot, form bot, and proactive bot. Microsoft Bot Framework is built into each template to streamline your workflow.\nContinuous delivery: Use your own tool chain and commit your code to popular source control systems such as Visual Studio Team System, GitHub, and Bitbucket, and then automatically publish your code into Azure.\nBroader reach: Increase your interactions and reach to more customers from your website or app to email, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Skype, Slack, Teams, Telegram, text/SMS, and Twilio.\nBoosted bot intelligence: Add the smarts to your bots with a few lines of code. Add Cognitive Services to enable your bots to see, hear, interpret, and interact in more human ways. Developers can connect to other Azure services to enrich their bots. For example, use Azure Search to create sophisticated search capabilities to your bots.\nOperational agility: Scale up or down on demand. As your bots grow in popularity, you only pay for what you use. You don’t have to reserve resources, and you are only charged for the number of executions and resources consumed.\nLearn more about it here .\n",
