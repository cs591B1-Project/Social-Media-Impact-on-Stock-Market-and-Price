      "text": "Your Latest Technology Sector Update: SYMC, AAPL, GOOGL, and More PART 5 OF 7 What Will Facebook’s $6 Billion Buyback Achieve? By Rachel Gunter | Nov 23, 2016 2:06 pm EST Program to begin in 1Q17 \nFor the first time since going public in 2012, Facebook ( FB ) will repurchase some of its outstanding shares. The company has budgeted for a $6 billion buyback program to begin in 1Q17. The buyback will target its Class A common stock in a bold move to return value to patient investors. \nFacebook is introducing its share repurchase program at a time when its cash balance has swollen to ~$26.0 billion. The buyback is expected to appease shareholders who may be complaining about Facebook’s practice of funneling billions of dollars to growth projects, including risky investments. The company forked over $21 billion to acquire WhatsApp, and it parted with ~$2 billion to acquire Oculus VR, a developer of VR (virtual reality) gear. \nFacebook has also made several small acquisitions to strengthen its existing operations and diversify its revenue streams into areas such as e-commerce. Joining tech peers in stock buybacks \nFacebook’s move sees it join its technology peers such as Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ), which have already bought back their stocks. Apple started buying back its shares in 2012, while Alphabet introduced a buyback in 2015. US technology companies worth more than $5 billion made $131 billion worth of stock buybacks in 2015, doubling the amount spent on buybacks in 2012, according to Bloomberg data. \nThe introduction of share buybacks should help Facebook to keep its number of outstanding shares from rising rapidly. The move should also lift the company’s EPS (earnings per share) and create an environment for the stock’s price to surge. Facebook has 2.9 billion shares outstanding, up from ~2 billion four years ago. Employee stock options compensation is a major reason Facebook’s outstanding share count has been rising. Stepping up infrastructure investment \nFacebook doesn’t expect its introduction of a buyback to hamper its growth investments. The company intends to step up its infrastructure development in 2017 as it tries to strengthen its platform given the stiff competition from Google, LinkedIn ( LNKD ), and Twitter ( TWTR ) for advertising dollars.

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nHere’s another fantastic option for getting away from the cold this winter — American, Delta, JetBlue and United are all offering nonstop flights from New York (JFK) and Newark (EWR) to Cancún, Mexico (CUN) for just $246 round-trip. Because four airlines are offering fares at this price, availability is anything but limited from January through February 2017. Cancún is a TPG favorite , so be sure you don’t miss out on these great fares!\nAirline: American, Delta, JetBlue, United\nRoute: JFK, EWR – CUN\nCost: $246 round-trip nonstop\nDates: January – February 2017\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nNew York (JFK) to Cancún (CUN) for $246 round-trip in February on JetBlue: \n\nNew York (JFK) to Cancún (CUN) for $246 round-trip in January on American: \n\nNewark (EWR) to Cancún (CUN) for $246 round-trip in January on United: \n\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).

      "title": "Facebook's accidental 'death' of users reminds us to plan for digital death",
      "text": "Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Not dead yet, Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook. Facebook screenshot \nThe accidental “death” of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and millions of other Facebook users is a timely reminder of what happens to our online content once we do pass away. \nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg’s Facebook profile displayed a banner which read: “We hope the people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.” Similar banners populated profiles across the social network. \nAfter a few hours of users finding family members, friends and themselves(!) unexpectedly declared dead, Facebook realised its widespread error. It resurrected those effected, and shelved the offending posthumous pronouncements. \nFor many of the 1.8-billion users of the popular social media platform, it was a powerful reminder that Facebook is an increasingly vast digital graveyard. \nIt’s also a reminder for all social media users to consider how they want their profiles, presences and photos managed after they pass away. The legal uncertainty of digital assets \nYour material goods are usually dealt with by an executor after you pass away. \nBut what about your digital assets – media profiles, photos, videos, messages and other media? Most national laws do not specifically address digital material. \nAs most social networks and online platforms are headquartered in the US, they tend to have “terms of use” which fiercely protect the rights of individual users, even after they have died. \nRequests to access the accounts of deceased loved ones, even by their executors, are routinely denied on privacy grounds. \nWhile most social networks, including Facebook, explicitly state you cannot let another person know or log in with your password, for a time leaving a list of your passwords for your executor seemed the only easy way to allow someone to clean up and curate your digital presence after death. \nFive years ago, as the question of death on social media started to gain interest, this legal uncertainty led to an explosion of startups and services that offered solutions from storing passwords for loved ones, to leaving messages and material to be sent posthumously. \nBut as with so many startups, many of these services have stagnated or disappeared altogether . Dealing with death Drowning in social media. mkhmarketing/Flickr \nPublic tussles with grieving parents and loved ones over access to deceased accounts have led most big social media platforms to develop their own processes for dealing with digital death. \nFacebook now allows users to designate a “legacy contact” who, after your death, can change certain elements of a memorialised account. This includes managing new friend requests, changing profile pictures and pinning a notification post about your death. \nBut neither a legacy contact, nor anyone else, can delete older material from your profile . That remains visible forever to whoever could see it before you die. \nThe only other option is to leave specific instructions for your legacy contact to delete your profile in its entirety. \nInstagram, owned by Facebook, allows family members to request deletion or (by default) locks the account into a memorialised state . This respects existing privacy settings and prevents anyone logging into that account or changing it in the future. \nTwitter will allow verified family members to request the deletion of a deceased person’s account. It will never allow anyone to access it posthumously. \nLinkedIn is very similar to Twitter and also allows family members to request the deletion of an account. \nGoogle’s approach to death is decidedly more complicated, with most posthumous options being managed by the not very well known Google Inactive Account Manager . \nThis tool allows a Google user assign the data from specific Google tools (such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Photos) to either be deleted or sent to a specific contact person after a specified period of “inactivity”. \nThe minimum period of inactivity that a user can assign is three months, with a warning one month before the specified actions take place. \nBut as anyone who has ever managed an estate would know, three months is an absurdly long time to wait to access important information, including essential documents that might be stored in Gmail or Google Drive. \nIf, like most people, the user did not have the Inactive Account Manager turned on, Google requires a court order issued in the United States before it will consider any other requests for data or deletion of a deceased person’s account. Planning for your digital death \nThe advice (above) is for just a few of the more popular social media platforms. There are many more online places where people will have accounts and profiles that may also need to be dealt with after a person’s death. \nCurrently, the laws in Australia and globally have not kept pace with the rapid digitisation of assets, media and identities. \nJust as it’s very difficult to legally pass on a Kindle library or iTunes music collection , the question of what happens to digital assets on social media is unclear to most people. \nAs platforms make tools available, it is important to take note and activate these where they meet (even partially) user needs. \nEqually, wills and estates should have specific instructions about how digital material – photos, videos, messages, posts and memories – should ideally be managed. \nWith any luck the law will catch up by the time these wills get read.",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nThis woman was also shown Trump’s presidential win back in early May before he won the nomination. She was told at that time as well, that Trump’s presidency would be cut short. Here is an excerpt…. “ He won’t be able to go very far for reasons other than his own. His purposes will be disappointed. His success will be brief, short lived, interrupted. He will be like a once raging fire snuffed out. He will be stopped short.”\nJoanie Stahl\nIn the early morning hours on Saturday, November 19, 2016, the Lord gave me an urgent prophetic dream and warning concerning the upcoming, sudden judgement and destruction that is coming to the United States.\nDream\nIn my dream, I saw myself in a huge, magnificent, palatial mansion. It was so enormous it felt that I could get lost in it. It was full, very full of people, jam packed with people upstairs and downstairs. They were there partying, eating, talking and laughing.\nThe people were not dressed in expensive clothes, but everyone was dressed in regular clothing. The people were every day, common people. I knew I was not part of the party; I was there to work, to assist whomever it was that owned that house. There was maybe a couple of times I was asked to do something for the party, but it was menial and insignificant. I found myself having nothing to do. There was nothing for me to do.\nI found myself standing around and it was getting late, so this told me that my job was done. I looked around for the owner of the house, but I could not find the person who had hired me. This also told me that my job was done and it was time for me to go. I decided within myself that I would just leave.\nI had to take the stairs to leave because for some reason the exit was upstairs. As I got to the top of the stairs, there was woman standing there leaning against the rails. I noticed she was very sorrowful. Her head was hanging very low and her body language was obvious that she was very mournful and sad. I was about to pass by her, but she stopped me.\nShe did not look at all like the other people who were laughing, partying, and eating. She did not look like she was part of it. It was clear that she was not part of the event. Even her clothing was not like the others and this caused her to stand out.\nAs I was about to pass her by, she looked up and said to me, “Wait”. I stopped and looked at her and she was holding out three one-dollar bills.\nI looked at the money, then back at her and said, “What is this for”? I asked because it was only three one-dollar bills. I fully knew she was not one of the people that had hired me to work. She clearly was not part of this social gathering so why would she be giving me anything.\nThe amount was so small and the giving of it unexpected. She answered, “Just take it”. Therefore, I took it and thought within myself that I would go back and let a girl that I had been working with know about the woman who was giving away money. I wanted to do so because the girl I was working with I knew to be very poor. I thought she could use the money no matter what the amount was.\nI went downstairs and found the girl and we headed upstairs. When we got to the top, the woman that gave me the money was gone. She was nowhere to be seen. Then I said goodbye to the girl and we parted ways.\nI went outside and walked away from the house several houses down. I noticed that the home I had been in, as well as the others I was walking by, were located on the ocean. There was no sandy beach. There was only one long running wall that stood between the homes and the sea. There was also a sidewalk I was walking on. Therefore, there was the wall, the sidewalk, then houses next to the sidewalk.\nI got about a few houses down and noticed the ocean. It was horribly turbulent and increasing in violence. I felt terrified as I looked at how horrible the sea looked. I walked further down and saw men; many men were standing where the sidewalk ended and they were all gathered around the edge.\nI came near to see why. I felt even from a short distance that something was wrong. That they were looking at something they were terrified of, something that they could not control. I saw that they had a look of powerlessness and fear.\nI approached them and they screamed at me to stand back, to stay back. I got close enough though to get a good look at what they were looking at.\nI looked and I saw hundreds of killer whales at the wall. There were so many and more were coming in, and coming in masses. It was as if they were gathering. It was in no way normal by any means. They were coming in with speed . They were all at the surface violently thrashing. Like a feeding frenzy about to take place. They looked ravenous and staving. Yet, there was something different about them; something completely unnatural, bizarre and disturbing.\nI looked as one, the biggest one, rose up in a total unnatural way. It stood upright in the water and glared right at me. It had an intelligence about it. It stared at me for seconds and I can tell you that I knew it was in its own way saying to me, “I am going to kill you”. I could feel that as I looked right into its dark, black eyes. I cannot emphasize it enough, but these were not normal killer whales. The one that confronted me had a persona.\nI turned to get away from the killer whales, and someone came to me and said, “You need to go back to that house you just left. All the people are now gone.” Just as that was said, I turned to go back and this is what I saw.\n[ NOTE: As I have indicated from time to time when I am telling the elements of my dreams, I need to let the readers know that in dreams and visions, the Holy Spirit will always over emphasize something to get my attention and to point out the weight and understanding of it.]\nVery close to shore, perhaps only five miles out to sea or less was a wave. This wave was not like any wave that could be on earth. No way.\nThe wave was coming with intense speed. I was looking straight up at it and the best way I could describe the height was that it looked bigger that if 10 empire state buildings were stacked. In fact, that would even dwarf in comparison. I looked to the top edge of the wave and it looked like it reached into the upper heaven.\nI undoubtedly knew there was no escape – It was already upon me. I noticed just then, there was a woman with me. I screamed out as loud as I could, RUN! We both took off running to the house I was told to go back to. We ran as fast as we could. We got inside the door and I screamed, “Lock it!” Then I reached for the lock, locked it, and immediately bolted upstairs. We ran upstairs and continued upwards. As we ran upstairs, skipping every other step, there were little windows placed all along the way up. Through them, I saw and heard the violent impact of the waves smashing against the house.\nWe kept running upstairs and flew past the second story until we found a tiny little chamber on the third story. There were windows all around. I screamed at the top of my lungs to the woman, “Hold on as tight as you can”! We preceded to wrap our arms and hands around the big wrought iron pieces of the railing. I could feel and hear the power and destruction against the house.\nI was so terrified beyond any words that are available to mankind to describe the horror. I began to scream out in tears that turned into heavy wailing. With the full force within my lungs, I screamed as loud as I could, “Oh God! Forgive the sins of this nation”! I began to scream out as loud as I could in my prayer language, but it was causing me to lose my voice from how hard I was screaming. My throat hurt terribly.\nIn this part of my dream, the Lord allowed me to see in a vision what was happening outside of the house I was in. He had to do this in order to show me the full-scale scope of the destruction. I was crying so greatly because I could hear the force of destruction rampaging over the land. I could hear screaming… horrific screaming. And it was extremely loud . It was loud because it was from the untold numbers of humanity screaming so loudly. They were all screaming because they were all dying .\nAs I said, the vision that the Lord showed me within the dream was necessary because He wanted me to see what I could not see in the dream from the tiny little room. I could not have even see this from the windows all around.\nHere is what He showed me. I saw that the wave was destroying not only the area or region I was in. It engulfed the entire United States of America . From an arial view, I watched the whole nation being destroyed and no one was ready for it . The wave came so suddenly and was upon them so fast that no one could escape.\nI wailed in great tears and howling to God because I knew that many of my loved ones were in that destruction and there was nothing I could do. They were not ready for it and not expecting it. I cried and cried as I heard the loud roars of humanity dying and the sound of the destruction upon everything.\nThen I awoke.\nAs soon as I woke up my heart was racing and pounding. I said to the Lord, “God, HOW can we get ready? WHAT can we do? HOW can I pray”? He answered, “IT IS TOO LATE. There is nothing you can do. If you are going to pray, pray for those that are not saved . I want to save those that are left to be saved out of this nation.”\nInterpretation\nThe mansion itself was so huge and enormous; I felt I could get lost in it. This mansion was FULL and “jam-packed” with people. So much so, I had little room to move freely. The people were as common as like you and I. When I said everyone was dressed in inexpensive regular clothing, this represents the everyday, average American. Not one specific class of people were set apart. Monetary status was not the focus here. The focus is that in this situation, financial class meant nothing. Every race and class of people were there just as God created them….as PEOPLE.\nI knew the Lord placed me in such a grand, enormous home to represent America. The mix and volume of people indicate this. However, more importantly the house itself was symbolic of what this nation once was – breathtakingly beautiful in all its splendor. Yet, in an instant will be forever changed and that beauty will cease to exist once the destruction hits.\nMy job in the dream to help serve the guests is relevant to that of which my “job” has been through majority of my life. I have allowed Him to use me as His vessel, to serve others to advance the kingdom of God. I am no one special. I have merely said “Yes Lord” in His call to be of help to all walks of people in this country.\nThe next few sentences are VERY significant. In the dream I said, “I found myself having nothing to do – there was nothing for me to do. I found myself standing around and it was getting LATE, so this told me that my job was done. My job was DONE and time for me to GO.”\nIn a spiritual sense, this clearly represents the lateness of the hour. The judgement of the Lord is upon us. As far as me standing around and my job having been done, I feel the Lord has shown me that this was not referencing myself only. I was a representation of ALL those who have worked so hard to warn of the coming destruction upon this land.\nMy job being all done is clear-cut. The Lord has shown me in this that I have done all I can to warn of His judgement and impending destruction upon America. My job in essence is “complete”. More about completion later. There is no more that I can do in this area of warning. This again represents all those who have led in the cause of warning for so long.\nThere are two categories of people left now. Those who have had ears to hear and received the warnings, and those who have turned a deaf ear and continue living life as they know it, with no regard to the time at hand and how serious God is in keeping His warning.\nThe partygoers were partying, eating, talking, and laughing. The Lord has continually stressed this scenario repeatedly through many of His people using various means such as dreams, visions, etc. Within the dream, He has yet again made clear that His Word in Matthew 24:38-39 stands true in saying,\n“ For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them away …” (Matthew 24:38-39a, KJV ). This Word is eternal, will come to pass, and “shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please…” (Isaiah 55:11, KJV)\nAs I searched, but was unable to find the owner of the house, I feel this is because the owner was a type and shadow of the Lord Himself. The Lord IS the One who is “owner” of this country. It is He who created all lands, nations, and people. Just like I could not physically find the owner of the house, but knew he was there among us, we cannot physically see the Lord. However, we know He is always among us, tending to the affairs of His people just as the house owner was tending to the affairs of the houseguests.\nIn addition, the Lord is right there among all those who remain oblivious to the coming severity of His righteous judgement. He has not left them. There may be but little time, but all one need do is call upon the name of the Lord in asking forgiveness from the heart. He is merciful and not willing that ANY should perish.\nMANY will still lose their life here on earth, yet His mercy will grant them an eternity with Him if they simply cry out to Him. This is why we must focus on individual souls as never before and never give up hope for anyone; even those that seem impossible to save since we serve a God of the impossible.\nI believe the Lord has revealed that the woman at the top of the stairs was a representative of heaven. Her location was at the top of the staircase, or “above”, looking down upon the vast numbers of people concerned on self-gratification and unaware of what was soon to hit.\nHer location can be a reflection of God on His throne, looking down upon His creation and condition of sin and disconnect with Him within this nation. The Lord also made it clear she stood out from the rest in her appearance and demeanor, making certain I recognized she was not part of all that gathered in the home.\nThe woman was so very sorrowful. She depicted an expression of pain, sadness, and mourning. Her face spoke of great heartache, distress, as she stood leaning against the banister. She had full knowledge of what was approaching as she had witnessed the false sense of safety and security the guests presented.\nWorse, there was nothing she could do to warn them that could change their fate as it was already sealed for destruction. The time for warning had passed and it was too late. They made their choice for the “love of this world and the things therein”. This in its entirety represents the state of this nation in this present time. It is too late for her. Judgement is set. Many will also die in their state of oblivion.\nThe payment of three one dollar bills I have full assurance by the Holy Spirit meant a sign of “completion”. The number three, as in the Divine Trinity, means “complete”. Her payment of three dollars further confirms that my work of warning concerning America’s judgement is complete.\nThe amount of financial pay being such a “small” amount was irrelevant. The fact that it was THREE dollars is the critical element. Even more reason why the woman was gone by the time I found my friend who needed physical finances to live. In the dream, little did I know in that moment that my friend would not have any use for finances in the natural.\nThe violent, turbulent waters of the sea embodies what is already happening in the spirit realm. There is a great war between the forces of good and evil. The storm is already here. The waters did not start out calm and later grow angry. The violent sea was already raging when I walked outside. It will only grow fiercer in the upcoming weeks.\nThe masses of whales were coming in first …gathering and teeming up against the wall. By “first”, I mean their arrival was PRIOR to the wave of destruction. There have been many events involving God’s judgement upon the nation that have been smaller in nature. However, the scope of these will PALE in comparison to what lies ahead.\nMore and more of these whales kept on coming in as the sea raged. Recall I said earlier that the violent sea represented the spiritual realm and the war going on – the storm having already arrived. These whales were not just any kind of whales. They were KILLER WHALES. These killer whales symbolize the demonic spirits and forces within the kingdom of darkness sent to wage war against the people of God.\nThese forces have already long been infiltrating the land and bringing their attacks to God’s people. They have also gained power through the sin of the lost & we clearly see the wicked and evil ways of the leaders of this country and the god they serve more openly than ever before as the Lord promised He would expose these wicked practices like this in the end times.\nThe hordes of killer whales preceding the tidal wave of destruction are a sign they are upon the land. Yet, just as more kept coming inland in the dream, more and more will continue coming in to wreak havoc upon the nation and its people before the final blow. The whales were unnatural and disturbing, just as the demonic supernatural entities are in their appearance.\nThe biggest one, which arose upright out of the water, had a supernatural intelligence about it. I stated how it stared into my eyes with a ferocious, evil glare. Within the dream, I knew in my spirit that it somehow “knew me”. Make no mistake about it, if you are a born again child of God, washed in the Blood of the Lamb and following in the footsteps of Christ, EVERY demonic being KNOWS WHO YOU ARE .\nThis is evident in Acts 19 when a group of itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to try to use the name of Jesus to exorcise some who had demonic spirits within them. “And the evil spirit answered and said, “Jesus I know , and Paul I know ; but who are you”? (Acts 19:15, NKJV)\nI also understood that this killer whale was somehow saying to me, “I am going to kill you”. This is exactly how every evil spirit thinks of us. They HATE God’s people with every ounce of their being. Their ONE goal in mind is to destroy us IF they could. “The thief [enemy] does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy…” (John 10:10a, NKJV)\nThe blackness in their eyes represents the pure evil inside, and how they derive from a place that knows no light. They mean business. Those that do not take their position in Christ seriously will be overcome by their power. The one who confronted me had a persona [identity, personality] about him. I believe this only signifies how all spirits have a name, or an individual identity, each with a specific purpose and directive to fulfill that purpose. They have aided in this country to devour all that was pure, holy, and previously of God.\nWithin the dream, the only thing holding back the masses of killer whales was that cement wall. Though the enemy forces are rampant upon the land, I feel the Lord has shown me that this wall is the only thing left holding back the FULL extent of the powers of darkness upon America. Yet, just as I know in viewing the sheer weight and force of each whale as they continue piling into that wall in the dream, knowledge tells me that soon enough the pressure will cause that wall to break.\nThe Lord would have us know that in this same way, at some point He will release His hand, which is the only thing holding back the complete mobilization of enemy forces. When released in full, we will see an extent of evil unleashed as never before. Right behind it will be a destruction upon the United States of hellacious proportion. We must know this IS the only way to bring this nation to its KNEES and call upon the ONLY NAME that can save.\nI then turned to get away from the killer whales and that is when someone approached telling me I could go back to the house I had just left as all the people were now gone. In thinking about this, it is possible that the instruction given me was to make certain that I knew to head that direction once my eyes beheld the massive wave.\nThis was where the upper room of safety was located. The Lord placed me in that particular home due to that chamber because He will protect His remnant. The houseguests having cleared out likely paved the way for me to get to that chamber of safety quickly and easily. He will make the way of safety clear for us.\nThe wave was only about five miles out. This an indication of how little time we now have left. This wave being nothing any human eye has ever encountered again suggests the level of destruction coming will be one in which this country has never experienced since its conception.\nThe number five is also indicative of God’s grace . Though impending judgement will incur a destruction upon America as never seen, I believe He is giving us a SHORT GRACE PERIOD to heed the warning and get our lives right and in spiritual order . It is ONLY by His grace and mercy this country has not paid dearly for the great sin that abounds stronger than ever.\nThis tidal wave was a wave of seismic proportions as far up as the eye could see and endlessly stretched to the east and west. This clarified that this wave was NOT headed to destroy just the area in which I was located. Neither was it representing a destruction set aside for a particular city, town, or state. Rather, this represented that God’s hand of judgement will reach the ENTIRE NATION AS A WHOLE.\nThe sheer speed I noticed the wave traveling in is yet another indicator within the dream that this sudden destruction will be here SOON and it will happen QUICKLY. How soon I cannot say, as this has not been shown to me. The timing is reserved for the Lord alone.\nIn witnessing the extent of the wave, and knowing immediately I had no escape as it was already upon me, means that when this catastrophic event occurs we will know we cannot escape it and it will SUDDENLY be upon us without warning.\nAs I began running to the house, there suddenly was a woman with me. She took off with me as I yelled, RUN! I feel the Lord placed her with me possibly for a few reasons. This lets me know that I will not be alone when this destructive event hits. The same goes for any of you who are sealed by God. We will need one another’s help, support, and guidance – just as I helped in guiding her to safety.\nAnother possibility I was not alone is that I do not doubt she was a fellow Believer and it relates to the passage, “For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them”, (Matthew 18:20, KJV). Though in the dream I was not aware if she was praying along with me, the Lord allowed us both to reach the tiny chamber that kept us safe from the destruction. We will also turn to one another for and in prayer.\nNote that as the two of us made it to the house, I took the time to shut the door and lock it before heading upstairs. Now this was a bit strange considering the circumstances and the urgency to outrun the waters and make it upstairs! Shutting that door and going a step farther to lock it could do nothing to stop the explosive force of the water from easily breaking through. Moreover, this only would seem to waste precious time.\nThe Lord has shown me something of great significance in this small act. The room upstairs was not the focal point of our safety. This takes me back to the incident with the door. “Most assuredly I say unto you, I am the DOOR of the sheep….I am the DOOR . If anyone enters by Me, he will be SAVED ” (John 10:7,9a ,NKJV). I was allowed to take the time to shut the door to see that HE is the door that leads to our safety.\nLocking it affirmed my position of safety in Him. We must take action to gain access to Him in order to have the complete protection He provides. The raging waters of destruction He kept from reaching us, as they had to pass through Him [the door] first. He will also keep the destruction from taking you out at the necessary time.\nAs we ran upstairs, the small windows along the way up allowed me to see and hear the violent impact of the waves crashing against the house. This tells me we will see and hear the destruction taking place all around us in our area as we make our way to safety in the natural.\nNotice we went past the second floor and up to the THIRD. There is that number three again. Though I understood the three dollars given me by the heavenly representative at the party confirmed my work in warning was complete, the number three in the Bible also stands for “finality”. That third floor represented our final destination place that would keep us safe.\nIn the dream, I had not been up in that room on the third floor prior to the wave hitting. However, He led me to that final place where we were sure to be safe.\nIn addition, the Lord would have each one of us know that His judgement is FINAL. There is no praying it away. The sins of this nation have long exceeded that of a holy, righteous God. Judgement is SET. There is no going BACK to a bountifully, blessed America. Those who believe the land will somehow get a reprieve will be most confounded to see and hear the sights and sounds that will resound throughout this world.\nOnce we reached that upper chamber and held on tight to the wrought iron pieces, I felt and heard the power and destruction against the house continue to rage on. This caused me to become terrified beyond words. There was an indescribable horror. Just because we are sealed in the Lord, does not mean that when such a great destruction hits that the human side of us will not feel terrified. That will be a normal reaction in the wake of such tragedy.\nWe will not suffer a fear as those who are lost will suffer. The feelings we will experience will not overtake us that we would forget who we are in Christ. This feeling is what caused me to scream out, cry, and wail before the Lord. Likewise, just as this happened in the dream, so shall it be for us Believers when it hits our nation in the natural. There will not be a single one of us who will not be screaming out to God during this time.\nNote as I screamed out to forgive the sins of the nation, I was screaming this prayer not in my English tongue, but in my heavenly prayer language [tongue]. I believe we will be so overcome by the horrors taking place all around us, there will be no English words strong enough to know how to pray in that situation. It will have to be the Holy Spirit Himself interceding through us on the behalf of all those swallowed from the destruction.\nAn interesting side observation is how we were located in the upper room [or chamber] of the house as the Holy Spirit came upon me giving me power to cry out in my heavenly language. I cannot help but think of the day of Pentecost and how God’s people also gathered in that upper room to receive power from on high as tongues of fire set upon them causing each to pray in their heavenly language as well. Just as His own were in one accord on that day, we will rise as one Body in one accord as this judgement effects each one of us.\nThe Vision Within the Dream\nThe vision within the dream deems no interpretation. It is exactly what it is. The destruction will hit every corner of the United States. No one will be left unscathed. Every man, woman, and child, will see and hear what will ravish our land. None will be left unaffected. We will see things as never before. We will hear the horrific screams from the untold number of humanity crying out of their mouths. The screams bellowing out from those perishing will seem to never end.\nAs in the vision, no one will be prepared for it, as it will come sudden and fast. There will be no escape. I will leave it at this since no interpretation necessary. I do know that great sorrow and morning will consume the land after this devastation occurs, because many of us will know people who will die. Yes, even our loved ones will perish in the wake of this mighty destruction.\nConclusion by Brook A.\nI will keep this short by simply saying YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! Repeatedly we have heard this same kind of warning through so many of His people. The Lord has spoken and has told Joanie, NO MORE! No more praying, or crying, or standing for a land that His judgement is now SET for destruction. I did not say that hope is lost for the people …for souls .\nKnowing what is coming, your own spiritual condition as well as that of the lost should be our MAIN PRIORITY . The ongoing pointless debates on things such as rapture timing, nationality of the Antichrist, the shape of the earth, Trump, and other leaders, along with countless other empty issues becomes FUTILE after reading this.\nJust as in the dream, what we need to fully understand is that we are only a huge group of people that are ALL about to experience an event that will shake our very SOULS. We need to come together and keep this warning ALIVE, because nothing else will matter once it is upon us.\nIt is time to put away our childish ways, grow up, and begin focusing on Him and His Word alone. The ONLY thing that will get us through the devastation ahead, along with the mental and emotional anguish of what our eyes will see and ears will hear is knowing who we are in Christ. That is IT!\nI boldly and unapologetically say, that IF you so dare believe the warnings given within this dream are rubbish, then God help you! This may sound uncompassionate, but it is far past time that His people stop talking and start focusing on what REALLY MATTERS.\nI am speaking as much to myself as to all of you, when I say that we had better wake up and get it together on a spiritual level. God is not playing. He has spoken and the verdict is out and announced. Let us take this and live as if will happen TODAY, because that just may be the case.\nAuthor: Joanie Stahl As a young Jewish girl, Joanie Sthal received Jesus as her Messiah and soon began receiving dreams and visions of world events. At first these gifts scared her, so she asked for them to cease. Instead, they increased and she surrendered her will to His. By spending much time alone with the Lord she learned how to be guided by Him and to wait on Him for interpretation.\nToday, Joanie is a wife and mother. She believes the time has come for the “Bride to make herself ready,” which is why she now feels released to share her dreams and visions received during the past 40 years as warnings of things that will soon take place.\nMore of Joanie Stahl’s prophetic warnings are posted here…",

      "title": "Facebook — an Underrated News Outlet?",
      "text": "6 mins ago Facebook — an Underrated News Outlet? Trump’s victory on 9 November has been confusing for some and outright shocking for others. Especially major media corporations were dumbfounded at the results, given that all polls seemed to have a clear lead going for Hillary Clinton, and only a madman would even consider him a possible victor. Yet, all polls and predictions were proved wrong. Now, a week after the election, some news outlets begin to suggest possible reasons for his success —  namely Facebook . Tentatively, it seems, they realise that previous approaches on predicting election results may not be a viable method anymore. While they keep with their narrative that it was shy voters who let out their emotions on Facebook and informed themselves on certain groups in support of Trump, another aspect of the matter is rather ignored: Facebook’s algorithm creating an echo-chamber of your opinions and preferences . Depending on your likes, dislikes, friends, and websites you visit, Facebook shows content shared by friends, groups, sites, and suggested content, shutting out differing opinions, or “irrelevant content”. Since every single one of us therefore has an individualised “homepage”, it stands to reason that a medium to which we dedicate a massive amount of our time and which knows even our subtle preferences should have a certain influence on us which is likely higher than that of traditional media. With BREXIT, this is now the second surprise turnout of a vote in a year painting a completely new picture of how opinions are formed and how they can be predicted. Already, there are programs that proved to be more accurate in predicting the sentiment of the people . Whether this trend from mass-media generated prognoses to technological data-mining will be beneficial to the people or whether these pose a threat in their own right remains to be seen. It can be asserted, however, that Facebook should definitely receive more attention in the shaping of opinions than it is currently given credit for.",

      "text": "Seeking a route to break into an untapped market of 1.4 billion people in China, Facebook may be exploring a third-party censorship tool to block certain posts in the country, compromising one of its core principles to grow its social media empire.\nChina blocked access to the social network in 2009, deeming it a violation of the country’s strict policies on censorship and creation of online, user-generated content. Several employees spoke to The New York Times anonymously about a new tool the company has begun building that would allow censorship of certain posts before they appear , a feature that could make the site more appealing to governments that take a heavy-handed approach to censorship in their digital spheres.\nThe company hasn’t officially announced or unveiled any new technologies that would bridge that gap.\nRecommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement to The Washington Post. “However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China . Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.”\nTest your knowledge Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. Sources told the Times that Facebook has been working on software that would block posts from appearing in news feeds linked to specified geographic areas by allowing a third party, such as a Chinese partner company, to scan the network for popular posts that violate Chinese standards and block them.\nWhile the company has publicly championed free speech, Facebook has also previously restricted content in Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey, acquiescing to the cultural and legal demands of foreign nations. Yet it has also received backlash for censoring or blocking content that violated its guidelines but served an important public interest in countries where free speech is a protected right.\nIn September, the company came under fire after it blocked an iconic Vietnam War photo, citing child nudity as a justification for censorship. Espen Egil Hansen, the editor at Norway’s largest newspaper, which published the photo, decried the practice.\n\"If you wish to increase the real understanding between human beings, you have to offer more liberty in order to meet the entire width of cultural expressions and discuss substantial matters,\" Mr. Hansen wrote in an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Editors cannot live with you, Mark, as a master editor.\"\nFacebook issued an apology for blocking the photo, vowing to revamp its algorithms to prevent similar instances in the future.\nMr. Zuckerberg has spent time learning basic Mandarin, visiting with internet officials in China, and cultivating a friendly relationship with President Xi Jinping. So far, those efforts have resulted in an advertising partnership between Chinese companies and the social media site, but those in the company say the nation and Facebook aren’t close to striking a deal on civilian usage.\nSources close to the project say that Zuckerberg has supported and defended the censorship initiative, despite its apparent clash with Facebook’s ideals to “make the world more open and connected.”\n“It’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation,” Zuckerberg said in an internal meeting over the summer, unnamed employees told the Times.",

The 49ers need linebacker help and I have not heard anything relating them with Laurinaitis... this is very weird considering he is the rams all time leader in tackles and even if he isn't as good as he once was he would still improve what the niners are currently rolling out and calling a defense... plus everyting I hear about him is positive, he is an extremely hard working, his teammates love him and I hear he is a great leader... It is very puzzziling to me that no where on the internet is even mentioning him to the niners, I mean it's not like they don't have the money to pull a deal off and he wouldn't even require a big contract in the first place....am I missing something? Are the current group of linebackers really that much better than Laurinaitis? Does anyone else want to see the niners sign him? Poll Would you like the 49ers to sign James Laurinaitis? Yes",

      "text": "(c) Linda Nicholas, The Field Museum Like us on Facebook \nThe relationship between humans and turkeys may not be a great one , but it’s certainly enduring. Archaeologists have discovered the remains of domesticated turkeys at the site of a 5th-century CE ritual sacrifice in Oaxaca, Mexico. They published their findings in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports . \nArchaeologists have theorized that humans had started raising turkeys by the year 400 or 500 CE, but they had relatively little evidence. Then, in 2009 and 2010, researchers excavating the famous ancient fortress of Mitla in Oaxaca uncovered piles of turkey bones and eggs. \nOne of those researchers was archaeologist Gary Feinman of The Field Museum in Chicago. “It was very exciting because it’s very rare to find a whole cluster of intact eggs,” he said in a press statement. “This was very unexpected.” \nBone expert and lead author Heather Lapham of the University of North Carolina recognized the remains and their significance immediately. Lapham counted five intact or unhatched eggs, plus the bones of seven newly hatched turkey poults: an offering. Nearby were broken eggshells and the remains of many other juvenile and adult turkeys. \nFeinman, Lapham, and their colleague Linda Nicholas brought the turkey eggs back to the laboratory and examined them under high-powered scanning electron microscopes. They discovered that the eggs were not all the same age. Some were unfertilized, while others had been recently fertilized when they were buried under the floors and in the walls. Others still contained embryos that were nearly ready to hatch. \nThe presence of eggs and turkeys of all different developmental stages suggests that the fortress’s inhabitants had regular access to a flock. These birds weren’t hunted or collected from the wild. They’d been raised here. People carrying turkeys in the marketplace, Oaxaca. Image Credit: © Linda Nicholas, The Field Museum \nThe domestication of these birds by the Zapotec people would have been hugely beneficial to their culture and economy. “There were very few domesticated animals in Oaxaca and Mesoamerica in general compared with Eurasia,” Feinman said. “Eurasia had lots of different meat sources, but in Oaxaca 1500 years ago, the only assuredly domestic meat sources were turkeys and dogs.” \nThat changed with the arrival of the Spanish, who brought over domesticated pigs, chickens, and cows. Yet turkeys remain an important part of life in Oaxaca to this day. They’re given as gifts, included in important feasts, and are still used in ritual offerings. “The reasons might be different,” the authors write, “certainly the gods are different, but this practice among the Zapotec of ritually sacrificing turkeys and egg offerings shows amazing continuity over an extended period.” More from mental_floss...",

Tim also went into the fact that while the Hollywood left claim Trump is a bully, that indeed, the Hollywood left themselves are actually bullies. Josh Sigurdson breaks it down and points out not only the annoying nature of the Hollywood left being a voice to regurgitate for a vast ignorant populace but also what it means to be an anarchist and how important it is to explain to the people that an anarchist is not what the mainstream media claims it is. Anarchists aren't burning cars and causing chaos. Anarchists believe in self ownership and individualism rather than rulers and tyrants.

      "text": "John chalekson was recently banned from linkedin.com. please follow me on Facebook. 16 mins ago The Thanksgiving guide to making conservative arguments liberals can understand Your Baby Boomer aunts are unshakable in their faith in Hillary Clinton. Your nephew Trevor won’t stop spouting vapid Democratic talking points in favor of Obamacare. When Thanksgiving talk turns political, do you feel like you and your liberal relatives can’t communicate? It’s okay. I can help you. I was born in Greenwich Village to a lawyer dad and community-organizer mom. I used to live on Capitol Hill, and now I live in Montgomery County in Maryland. I even served a year as an MSNBC contributor. This is all to say, I speak liberal. You won’t win over your lefty in-laws with appeals to liberty. Those warnings about hubris that tickle your Edmund Burke nerve will ring hollow with Nephew Trevor, who is still infected with his 2008 case of Hope & Change. You need to speak their language. So let me offer my conservative and libertarian readers the first annual Thanksgiving Guide to Making Conservative Arguments in Liberals’ Language. Regulators will ban your organic kale. Your liberal relatives generally trust government regulations to solve problems. They don’t sweat the costs to the economy as much as you do. Throw in a healthy distrust of Corporate America — often even an unhealthy disdain for it — and progressives (this is what they call themselves these days) end up regarding regulation as a force for good. You can plant a seed of skepticism about regulators’ ability to do good, though, by pointing to the salad course Trevor brought. The organic, local, sustainable kale in it might be impossible to get after the Obama administration’s food safety rules go into effect. The Food Safety Modernization Act that Obama signed is finally being implemented, and it has locavores up in arms. Quote Nathanael Johnson at Grist (your relatives know this site): “Everyone wants safer food, but some small farmers fear the rules could force them out of business.” Proposed federal rules on manure-spreading and water-testing seem tailored for industrial farming, impossible for smaller farms to meet. As you discuss this, throw in references to author Michael Pollan. At work here are two dynamics common to regulation: They’re called “regulatory capture” and “the overhead smash.” Obama’s food safety czar is Michael Taylor, former top lobbyist for Monsanto. (You’ll be amazed at the power of the word “Monsanto” with some of your relatives.) Industrial farms and major food processors hire the best lobbyists and thus get a seat at the table when the FDA writes the rules. Thus, the biggest players in the regulated industry have “captured” the agency that regulates them. “The overhead smash” is my phrase for the tendency of regulations to add to overhead — the fixed costs of doing business — which smashes smaller competitors while protecting the big guys. In the food safety realm, small farms are begging to be exempted from these rules that only big farms can afford. In case your aunts think this is an aberration, point them to similar phenomena in the realms of handmade toys, taxi services, bakers, hair-braiders, casket-makers and so on. (All these links are prog-friendly.) Social Security is ripping off minorities. You may worry about Social Security’s long-term solvency, but Aunt Carol, on the verge of retirement, doesn’t give a fig. As a self-employed businessperson, you may resent the 12.4 percent you pay in Social Security taxes, but Nephew Trevor — still working on his Master of Arts in Social Justice — thinks FICA is a houseplant. Also, FDR is still probably a god to these relatives, so you’ve got an uphill battle convincing them Social Security needs reforming. Here’s one place to start: Social Security is funded by a regressive tax and it redistributes wealth from minorities to whites. Here’s a line for you: For every $100 that white beneficiaries pay in taxes, they receive $113 in benefits, blacks receive $89 and Hispanics receive $58. That’s from liberal blogger Brad Plumer at Wonkblog (Note: every progressive under the age of 35 flatters himself as a “wonk.” So impress your nephew by throwing in a humblebrag faux apology like. “Sorry to get so wonky, but … ”) Social Security’s redistribution isn’t due to some racist Republican rule change. It’s due to the nature of the tax (hitting your first dollar, but then stopping after about $110,000 in income) and the nature of the payouts. White people live longer and are less likely to be immigrants, so they earn more credits and collect for longer. Remember these arguments, and you can nudge your relatives an inch to the right this year. On other topics, you’re on your own this year. But don’t worry, we’ll still all be talking about Obamacare’s failures at this time next year. Timothy P. Carney, the Washington Examiner’s senior political columnist, can be contacted at tcarney@washingtonexaminer.com. His column appears Sunday and Wednesday on washingtonexaminer.com.",

      "text": "I took a quick scroll through Facebook yesterday, as one does. My Facebook feed has gotten notably darker these days, what with the encroaching sense of imminent doom, and I’ve adjusted my gauge for what registers as “shocking” accordingly. One post, however, managed to make me take pause. It was a screenshot of a CNN talk show, with a caption at the bottom reading, “Alt-Right Founder Questions If Jews are People.” The context: CNN Host Jim Sciutto was discussing whether or not Trump should disavow the increasingly visible anti-Semitism and racism among his followers on the “alt-right.”\nWhat really got interesting is what happened when I shared the post. Over the course of two hours, I got a pretty representative sample of the various species of responses I’ve been seeing to other Facebook posts about our national downward spiral. Here’s a run-down:\n1. The This-Can’t-Be This sort of reaction is like the denial step in the five stages of grief. The commenter simply can’t or won’t believe the post is real. Surely, this is Photoshopped. Have you checked Snopes?\nPro: It’s good to be skeptical, and good to retain hope that the world is, in fact, not bleak enough for CNN to be actually posing a “both sides” argument about whether or not Trump should disavow neo-Nazis.\nCon: The world is, in fact, getting that bleak.\n2. The Gallows Humorist I certainly tend toward this one quite a bit. This sort of reaction looks at something that’s objectively very troubling and goes, you know what? I’d rather laugh. My favorite reaction to my own “Are Jews People?” post read, “Tag yourself. Personally, I am a chair.”\nPro: Alleviates stress; provides respite.\nCon: Why are we laughing? CNN is legitimately arguing about whether or not neo-Nazis are “that bad” for saying Jews might not be people.\n3. The Reasoner We all have someone — or multiple someones — on our Facebook who will chime in with an explanation about why, in fact, this is really nothing to worry about. After all, they were only discussing the words of a white supremacist, not endorsing them.\nPro: Rational thought is good for the mind and the soul.\nCon: Condescendingly denies that the fact that this is getting airtime at all/that this is the timeline we are living in is terrifying.\n4. The Mourner/Rager This post is something to the effect of “ gghhh” and/or another sort of utterance of despair and/or rage. Also expressed in the “anger” emoji in lieu of a “like.”\nPro: Visceral connection to how scary and sad the world is at the moment.\nCon: Sometimes lacks substance beyond the shared primal scream we are all participating in internally.\n5. The Out-of-Depth Trump Supporter This post comes from the depths of your Facebook friend list — maybe someone you knew in high school, or met once at a party. Maybe a relative. Who knows. But they’ve decided to get on your post and write some sort of truly irrelevant screed like, “When did CROOKED HILLARY denounce the Alt-right?!” (she has), or “This is beside the point, the Alt-right is a fringe group, why should he pay attention?” (Five words: Bannon. In. The. White. House.)\nPro: …you got me there. Maybe the new cell phone you get after you throw yours across the room?\nCon: Derails post; incites existential disappointment in humanity.\nShare Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email CNN Sorry for ‘Are Jews People?’ Banner During Segment on Alt-Right White Supremacists Marcy Oster November 22, 2016 Lana Adler is a Forward Fellow working on opinion.

      "text": "The Boys. Photo via Facebook. \nAh, the Trailer Park Boys. \nFor years Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles have been the voice of Canada's lost and stoned generation. Since 1999, the holy trinity of Canadian dope smokers has been giving us Rickyisms and teaching us valuable lessons. \nNow, it seems that life is imitating art as the trio just signed a deal that will see them bring TBS branded weed to the public. \nIt doesn't take rocket appliances to know that it's probably a good move. I mean, who out there who hasn't wanted to smoke some of that driveway hash or hopefully grab a bag of weed entitled \"Green Bastard\" or \"Steve French?\" It was announced on Wednesday that the legal marijuana company OrganiGram partnered with TBS Productions, the company run by Mike Smith (Bubbles), John Paul Tremblay (Julian), and Robb Wells (Ricky). OrganiGram is a Moncton, New Brunswick-based licensed producer of marijuana. At the moment, the company is focused on medical marijuana but are preparing for the anticipated recreational legalization. That's where the boys come in. A release on the agreement says the two companies will \"develop branding, packaging, and a competitive product portfolio targeted towards recreational marijuana consumers and distributed exclusively by OrganiGram.\" The deal also includes product placement. Read More: Weed Broke the Canadian Stock Market Louis Thomas, the president of Sonic Entertainment Group who is representing the Boys in the deal, said in the statement that TBS Productions has been monitoring the weed situation closely \"to best understand how we might be able to enter the cannabis space in Canada.\" \"After our initial meeting with the Maritime-based executive team at OrganiGram, we all felt strongly that they were the perfect partner and the timing was right to move forward.\" Ray Gracewood, the chief commercial officer at OrganiGram, said the company needed to be strategic to prepare for the possible wild world of legalized pot. \"Brands will play a key role within the cannabis market space, and we're devoting the thought leadership and developing our strategy well in advance of these expected changes to ensure we're prepared,\" he said. Branding may not be a bad idea because as a wise man once said, it's \"survival of the fitness boys.\" Follow Mack Lamoureux on Twitter Share Tweet ",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently banned from linkedin.com. please follow me on Facebook. 8 mins ago Some people voted for Donald Trump because they hate Hillary more than they hate Donald. I've been around for almost 70 years and have never hated him. I've watched him rise up. He's tough. Perhaps, he's tougher than many of you understand. Just because he isn't the best debater around doesn't mean he can't take the heat. I voted for him because I have faith in him. But, if he says something (like that the Clintons are good people), and I hear words from Kellyanne's own mouth that gives me pause, I WILL call him on it. I still support him. But, I want to make sure that he stays on top of a prosecution of Hillary Clinton. Don't get petty by reminding this government major that the president can not prosecute. Oh, REA Y? Gee, I didn't know that! I guess you aren't aware that the current dictator-in-chief was on top of the AG and Comey during their waking moments before they let the Hill off the hook! So, do you REALLY believe that POTUS has no influence over the AG or the FBI? If you do, you are as naive as they get! And, Donald's presidency isn't as much of a shoe-in as we would want. The electoral college meets on December 19th to make a final decision. I expect them to fulfill our wishes. Some have threatened to vote against Trump, even if they were previously \"obligated\" by their word to do so. There are several things that have been said in the past few days that sent up my red flag. I'm hoping, as I've stated before, that President-Elect Trump is just trying to get the despots off their guard. It makes sense to me. Meanwhile, I will say what I feel I have to say ... just to let them ALL know that we plan on staying vigilant. It wouldn't matter WHO becomes Number 45. If they can't take the heat, they don't belong in politics. I learned that many decades ago. However, attacking children and non-participating family members of politicians is crossing the ethical line.",

      "text": "Home > DT Daily > Is Facebook willing to trade censorship for access… Is Facebook willing to trade censorship for access to China? Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nTry quitting it and reopening it, Jack \nYou know that terrible feeling you get when you lock your keys in your car, or in your house? Yeah, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey knows that feeling, too. In what has to be one of the more ironic tech micro-tragedies, Dorsey’s Twitter account was suspended Tuesday . \nAfter what must have been some yelling down the halls at Twitter HQ, Dorsey was able to get the account back online, and posted up a copy of his very first tweet from 2006, albeit with a small edit saying the suspension was an “internal mistake.” \nWhat price access? \nFacebook is getting some heat after they apparently developed a censorship tool for use by governments that like to control what people might see… on Facebook. \nBut analysts –and critics – think CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has learned to speak Mandarin and is reportedly on good terms with Chinese president Xi JinPing, likely signed off on development of the content monitoring tool to help re-enter the Chinese social media market, where Facebook has been banned since 2009. The New York times says the tool is not operated by Facebook, but is instead wielded by whatever government it’s handed over to. \nBack in July, when Zuckerberg faced criticism over the possibility of creating just such a censorship tool, he said that while he didn’t want to do it, he did want Facebook to at least get a toehold in the 1.4 billion person Chinese market, even if that meant having to tolerate some form of censorship. Time will tell if it’s enough for the Chinese overlords to allow Facebook back inside the great firewall. \nShop ’til you drop? Just don’t drop that TV… \nLike we said at the top of the big show, it’s November 23 rd , which mean Black Friday is just two days away, and once again this year, tech toys from TVs to drones to adorable little robot frontloaders will be in high demand.

      "text": "v You’ve been together more than two years now. Must be coming up on three. I checked on Facebook just to make sure you’re both still smiling. And yes, you are. Smiling and blonde and beautiful.\nI teared up. And I know, I’m not supposed to. It’s been long enough. I’ve forgotten your voice in my ear. I’ve kissed plenty of mouths since then. I’ve loved. I’ve loved in such a way, it resulted in a book. \nYou’ve found the right person and I accept she clearly wasn’t me.\nBut still, there are moments that grab me when I least expect it. I remember your mouth. I remember your gentle voice and big hands. Most of the time, I pretend I don’t. \nMaybe it’s wrong how much I wanted to love a broken man, and how you promised I’d be the one to rebuild such a man. \nThe truth, you were never broken. Not in the way you claimed. There’s a difference between confusion and brokenness and I wish you’d just been honest about it. My heart would have healed fast. My ego wouldn’t have spent months hiding beneath the rubble had you just said, “It’s not you.”\nInstead, it was supposed to be. So much so, you came to my home. You fucked me in the place I was raised. Met my best friend where she worked.\nYou did everything you do when you promise someone a future. Not even a week later, you remembered another girl. The girl you’re still with. The girl who was clearly there all along.\nAll this time, she’s still the one you love. So, I’m not allowed to hurt, right? You’ve proven yourselves now, right?\nThis arrow in my chest is just my imagination. Being drunk on nostalgia and regret is my own shit to deal with. I hope you order a special dessert to celebrate such a love. Hope you hold each other tightly. Forget anyone was ever left in the dirt. ",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently banned from linkedin.com. please follow me on Facebook. 5 mins ago There is a *problem* when all your favourite members of the ruling class are eating at a \"pizza\" restaurant decorated with shit like this. It isn't art—it's depictions of child rape. The Twitter accounts associated with this place—now private—were openly referencing \"murder rooms\". The Clinton campaign was ear-deep in this; it's why so many were opposed to her candidacy. There are so many people now implicated and associated with this: from the Clintons to the Royals, it's one disgusting tapestry spanning nations, cultures and probably all of our history. Your ruling class. It didn't end with Savile. It will END when these fucking snakes—these parasites—are driven from their dens, put on trial and surgically removed from active participation in the affairs of this planet. The U.S. election was utterly revelatory in the way the entirety of the establishment dug in behind Clinton. 2016 was the year that the mainstream media destroyed themselves by actively, consciously, deliberately ignoring the criminal corruption of the Clintons when so many could see it, and so clearly. Social media now represent the method by which information will be transmitted and consensus formed. There is no way now that the MSM's lies-by-omission will be able to counter the growing awareness of the nature of the ruling class—a worldwide cabal of bankers, industrialists, politicians and mediamen who practise and glorify murder and paedophilia. Do not look away. This is their ART. Together we will grip the vine by its poisonous taproot and put it to flames, and repair the earth where it grew. #pizzagate",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently banned from linkedin.com. please follow me on Facebook. 16 mins ago Dear President-Elect Donald J. Trump, We elected you, believing that you would DRAIN THE SWAMP of corruption inside the district of criminals. Now that you will most likely occupy the Oval Office on January 20th, we STILL expect you to drain that swamp, disregarding threats, bribes or deals with/from the despots that inhabit that swamp. We STILL expect you to run an administration that is FAIR and EQUAL toward ALL American citizens under the federal laws of this nation. We STILL expect you to fulfill your promises to US and your future oath of office to uphold the Constitution of the United States and OUR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM under the explicit protections enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Therefore, regarding the crimes that have quite apparently been committed by Hillary R. Clinton (\"Lock her Up!\"), and regarding our demand to be protected as EQUALS under federal laws, we expect one of two things: 1) either repeal ALL federal laws and pardon ALL non-violent American inmates who have been imprisoned under federal jurisdiction over the last three (3) decades ... OR 2) investigate and prosecute - to the fullest extent of federal law - ALL politicians and other corrupt and narcissistic elitists who have boldly and blatantly committed apparent felonies under federal jurisdiction and have gone unpunished by their criminal cronies inside the district. You are ON NOTICE that We, the People, are EQUAL TO ALL royals, ALL politicians, ALL celebrities, ALL athletes, ALL military brass and ALL other so-called elitists in this country ... or elsewhere. Therefore, WE expect FAIR and EQUAL TREATMENT under the laws of this country. We are NOT \"ordinary\". We are NOT \"commoners\". We are NOT \"average\". WE ARE the PEOPLE! Signed:The NON-Deplorables and NON-Unredeemables who hope that the true election, on December 19th, will make our wishes prevail ... presenting YOU as the 45th President of the United States!",

      "text": "Also today: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey gets his Twitter account suspended, and the chaos of Black Friday approacheth so check out our tech buyer's guide. More Subscribe on YouTube\nTry quitting it and reopening it, Jack\nYou know that terrible feeling you get when you lock your keys in your car, or in your house? Yeah, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey knows that feeling, too. In what has to be one of the more ironic tech micro-tragedies, Dorsey’s Twitter account was suspended Tuesday .\nAfter what must have been some yelling down the halls at Twitter HQ, Dorsey was able to get the account back online, and posted up a copy of his very first tweet from 2006, albeit with a small edit saying the suspension was an “internal mistake.”\nWhat price access?\nFacebook is getting some heat after they apparently developed a censorship tool for use by governments that like to control what people might see… on Facebook.\nBut analysts –and critics – think CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has learned to speak Mandarin and is reportedly on good terms with Chinese president Xi JinPing, likely signed off on development of the content monitoring tool to help re-enter the Chinese social media market, where Facebook has been banned since 2009. The New York times says the tool is not operated by Facebook, but is instead wielded by whatever government it’s handed over to.\nBack in July, when Zuckerberg faced criticism over the possibility of creating just such a censorship tool, he said that while he didn’t want to do it, he did want Facebook to at least get a toehold in the 1.4 billion person Chinese market, even if that meant having to tolerate some form of censorship. Time will tell if it’s enough for the Chinese overlords to allow Facebook back inside the great firewall.\nShop ’til you drop? Just don’t drop that TV…\nLike we said at the top of the big show, it’s November 23 rd , which mean Black Friday is just two days away, and once again this year, tech toys from TVs to drones to adorable little robot frontloaders will be in high demand. We’re here to help! Be sure to check out our Black Friday buyer’s guide, where we track the best deals from major retailers and more importantly, steer you clear of duds and ripoffs, both online and in stores.\nAnd with a little extra reading , you can learn more about the tech inside the latest gear, and maybe make a better decision when it comes time to pull the trigger. Hit the link here for the latest Black Friday news and our buyers guide . DT Daily is going to take the next couple of days off, we hope you can do the same, so have a great weekend and we’ll be back with more tech news on Monday.\nTwitter fail: CEO Jack Dorsey accidentally suspended from platform Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologizes for Neo-Nazi ad, blames automated system Facebook, Twitter cut off surveillance tool used by police to monitor protesters",

      "text": "According to a recent Deloitte report, Facebook contributes billion and 335,000 jobs to India through its marketing, platform and connectivity efforts. (Source: Reuters) As we aim to connect the next billion people on mobile platforms globally, 70 per cent of them will come from Asia and nearly 337 million from India alone, a top Facebook executive said here on Wednesday, adding that mobility is the future which is driving economic growth in the country. As of the third quarter this year, Facebook reported 166 million monthly active users, 159 million mobile active users, 85 million daily active users and 81 million mobile daily active users in India.\n“For me, five trends — geographic shift in mobile user growth, internet is mobile and mobile is internet, connected device explosion, platform economy and moving to a network level from the mobile ecosystem — are driving the change in the country,” Umang Bedi, Managing Director, Facebook India and South Asia, told reporters here.\nIndia holds tremendous potential for Facebook and is the most critical and strategic market for the company, Bedi said, adding that the country is also the top market for developers for building with Facebook outside the US.\nAccording to a recent Deloitte report, Facebook contributes $4 billion and 335,000 jobs to India through its marketing, platform and connectivity efforts.\nFacebook is available in 12 languages in the country and over 80 per cent of top-grossing apps in India are integrated with the social networking platform.\n“The biggest challenge in making internet relevant locally in Asia including India is local content, local languages and local awareness so we have to move beyond English to make the content locally relevant to consumers,” Bedi pointed out.\nFacebook revealed a three-fold business strategy for India. The first is aligned with the mission of the company which is to help people connect. The second is to drive deep engagement which means build a process that is relevant and the third is to be absolutely valuable to its partners.\n“Our vision for business in India is to be loved and become a trusted brand, to be deeply integrated into the fabric and to provide the experiences which are relevant and valuable to all people who are on our platform, including partners,” Bedi said.\nFacebook which has 1.71 billion users globally has a strategic partnership with India’s top 100 advertisers.\nThere are over two million small and medium businesses (SMB) pages on Facebook in India and more than 30 per cent of active SMB pages on Facebook are owned by women entrepreneurs.\nForty one per cent of people on Facebook are connected to at least one business in a foreign country.\n“All I could say is that we have just started and I am very clear about the fact that everything that Facebook will do in the next few years is about moving real business outcomes for our brands and advertisers — be it large or small,” Bedi added.\nFacebook last week announced that India is now the top market for its mobile messaging platform WhatsApp with 160 million monthly active users.\nIn India, over 80 million people use Facebook’s Groups feature each month and the country is one of the top five adopters of Workplace platform.",

      "text": "Oh, and Fuck Facebook Too. Jim Wright (Facebook). \nRetired Navy officer Jim Wright of the liberal blog Stonekettle Station said this week that he was banned by Facebook for speaking out against supporters of the Nazi Party. \nIn a blog post on Wednesday, Wright explained that Facebook had notified him that his account had been suspended for “violation of community standards.” \n“The community standard I violated is apparently the one where you’re not allowed to criticize actual, no fooling, Nazis,” he wrote. “That’s right, I was banned for criticizing an actual Nazi.” \n[…] \nWright told Raw Story on Wednesday afternoon that his Facebook account was still locked. \n“I know they are aware of the situation,” he said. “But I’ve received no response from Facebook either formally or via informal channels.” \nWright has promised that he will not back down if and when Facebook reinstates his account — even if it means he is banned again. \n“Those who know me, know that I am a veteran who fought under the flag of the United States of America for more than 20 years, can probably guess which way I’ll go,” he wrote. “Given America’s new acceptance of fascism, I suspect platforms like Facebook and Twitter will either have to become more accommodating of actual fascist ideology and less tolerant of people like me, or risk going to the wall themselves – especially given that our new president has made it very clear that he intends to directly control how the media, including social media, reports on his administration.”",

Not the physical gifts, but the infinite beauty tucked into every corner of your life. \nBut you needn’t wait until the fourth Thursday in November (USA) or the second Monday in October (Canada) to be thankful, or giving. \nWhat if, instead, you take 90 seconds each morning and write down three things for which you are thankful? What will your list look like? How will it shape your day? \nAnd what if each day you focus on contributing beyond yourself in one small way: a hug, a meal, or just a few minutes of your time? How will this daily giving shape your life? \nSubscribe to The Minimalists via email . SHARE",

      "text": "Facebook's accidental 'death' of users reminds us to plan for digital death November 24, 2016 by Tama Leaver, The Conversation Not dead yet, Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook. Facebook screenshot \nThe accidental \"death\" of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and millions of other Facebook users is a timely reminder of what happens to our online content once we do pass away. \nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg's Facebook profile displayed a banner which read: \"We hope the people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.\" Similar banners populated profiles across the social network. \nAfter a few hours of users finding family members, friends and themselves(!) unexpectedly declared dead, Facebook realised its widespread error. It resurrected those effected, and shelved the offending posthumous pronouncements. \nFor many of the 1.8-billion users of the popular social media platform, it was a powerful reminder that Facebook is an increasingly vast digital graveyard. \nIt's also a reminder for all social media users to consider how they want their profiles, presences and photos managed after they pass away. \nThe legal uncertainty of digital assets \nYour material goods are usually dealt with by an executor after you pass away. \nBut what about your digital assets – media profiles, photos, videos, messages and other media? Most national laws do not specifically address digital material. \nAs most social networks and online platforms are headquartered in the US, they tend to have \"terms of use\" which fiercely protect the rights of individual users, even after they have died. \nRequests to access the accounts of deceased loved ones, even by their executors, are routinely denied on privacy grounds. \nWhile most social networks, including Facebook, explicitly state you cannot let another person know or log in with your password, for a time leaving a list of your passwords for your executor seemed the only easy way to allow someone to clean up and curate your digital presence after death . \nFive years ago, as the question of death on social media started to gain interest, this legal uncertainty led to an explosion of startups and services that offered solutions from storing passwords for loved ones, to leaving messages and material to be sent posthumously. \nBut as with so many startups, many of these services have stagnated or disappeared altogether . \nDealing with death \nPublic tussles with grieving parents and loved ones over access to deceased accounts have led most big social media platforms to develop their own processes for dealing with digital death. \nFacebook now allows users to designate a \"legacy contact\" who, after your death, can change certain elements of a memorialised account. This includes managing new friend requests, changing profile pictures and pinning a notification post about your death. \nBut neither a legacy contact, nor anyone else, can delete older material from your profile . That remains visible forever to whoever could see it before you die. \nThe only other option is to leave specific instructions for your legacy contact to delete your profile in its entirety. \nInstagram, owned by Facebook, allows family members to request deletion or (by default) locks the account into a memorialised state . This respects existing privacy settings and prevents anyone logging into that account or changing it in the future. \nTwitter will allow verified family members to request the deletion of a deceased person's account. It will never allow anyone to access it posthumously. \nLinkedIn is very similar to Twitter and also allows family members to request the deletion of an account. \nGoogle's approach to death is decidedly more complicated, with most posthumous options being managed by the not very well known Google Inactive Account Manager . \nThis tool allows a Google user assign the data from specific Google tools (such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Photos) to either be deleted or sent to a specific contact person after a specified period of \"inactivity\". \nThe minimum period of inactivity that a user can assign is three months, with a warning one month before the specified actions take place. \nBut as anyone who has ever managed an estate would know, three months is an absurdly long time to wait to access important information, including essential documents that might be stored in Gmail or Google Drive. \nIf, like most people, the user did not have the Inactive Account Manager turned on, Google requires a court order issued in the United States before it will consider any other requests for data or deletion of a deceased person's account. \nPlanning for your digital death \nThe advice (above) is for just a few of the more popular social media platforms. There are many more online places where people will have accounts and profiles that may also need to be dealt with after a person's death. \nCurrently, the laws in Australia and globally have not kept pace with the rapid digitisation of assets, media and identities. \nJust as it's very difficult to legally pass on a Kindle library or iTunes music collection , the question of what happens to digital assets on social media is unclear to most people. \nAs platforms make tools available, it is important to take note and activate these where they meet (even partially) user needs. \nEqually, wills and estates should have specific instructions about how digital material – photos, videos, messages, posts and memories – should ideally be managed. \nWith any luck the law will catch up by the time these wills get read.",

      "text": "facebook fake news roundup zuckerberg facebookf More Facebook is on a precipice. Its critics claim fake news on its site swayed the presidential election, but any changes it has attempted to make to its News Feed have seen it branded a “media company” — a label it has repeatedly rejected .\nSo where does Facebook go from here? In the past week alone, it has made strategic moves to track fabricated content on its site and to stop third-parties from profiting from it. Meanwhile, its management has played down reports of the extent of its fake news crisis, whilst also committing to make content on its platform more diverse. These are positive signs, but its detractors claim it still isn’t enough.\nRead on to find out how Facebook’s fake news problem came to be and how it has called in to question the inner workings of the world’s biggest social network.\nFictional stories and where to find them news feed More To understand the company’s dilemma, it is best to start from its core social sharing tool: the Facebook News Feed.\nBoth internally within Facebook, and externally among the media, there is much talk (and disagreement) over the so-called influence of the News Feed, now used by 1.75 billion people. One thing’s for sure, any real steps to stamp out fake news will start and end with the largely automated timeline.\nMore: How does Facebook censor content? Civil rights groups demand an answer\nAt present, the News Feed prioritizes content it thinks you’ll like based on your activity – such as posts you’ve interacted with through likes, comments, and shares. The social network’s critics claim this system creates a filter bubble (or echo chamber) that only functions to surface content that corresponds to your views and opinions.\nWith that in mind, fake news can wield a negative impact – especially in light of recent findings by the Pew Research Center that revealed almost half of American adults on Facebook get their news from the platform. But fabricated content comes in all shapes and sizes. There’s spam content posted on deceptive sites purely to generate ad revenue; erroneous articles rushed to print online that are later retracted or amended; and hyper-partisan (or bogus) news items that exist simply to put forth skewed political viewpoints. In our post-election landscape, it is the latter that are causing the most concern as to their detrimental affects on social media users.\nEven before the election outcome was decided, a number of reports had measured the extent of Facebook’s fake news problem. Chief among them was John Herrman’s piece in The New York Times detailing the rise of these types of outlets on the platform. “Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy, and journalism into a potent new mixture,” Herrman wrote.\nTwo months later, BuzzFeed published its own report regarding fake political news on Facebook in which it claimed that a hub of pro-Trump sites were being operated far away from the U.S. in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. These sites were spamming Facebook groups with their “baseless” content with no other agenda than to further their own financial gain by raking in ad revenue.\nThis Facebook trending story is 100% made up.\nNothing in it is true.\nThis post of it alone has 10k shares in the last six hours. pic.twitter.com/UpgNtMo3xZ\n— Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) November 14, 2016\nRead More Following election night, an influx of articles on Facebook’s fake news problem articulated the need to hold the company accountable for its so-called part in swaying the result. How did Facebook respond? Over to you, Zuck.\nZuckerberg on the defensive Facebook-CEO-Mark-Zuckerberg More Frederic Legrand/Shutterstock\nIt didn’t take long for Mark Zuckerberg to leap to his company’s defense. During the course of the past few weeks, the Facebook founder has commented on the issue three times in total.\nEarlier this month he made some valid points that hinted at the mainstream media’s disconnect from U.S. voters. Speaking at a tech conference, Zuckerberg made his first public statement on the issue, in which he dismissed the notion that fake news on Facebook swayed the election as “crazy.” He added: “There is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that someone voted the way they did … because they saw some fake news. If you believe that then I don’t think you have internalized the message Trump supporters in this election are trying to send.”\nMoreover, in his second statement shared via his Facebook account, Zuckerberg insisted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on the platform is authentic.\n“Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics,” Zuckerberg said. “Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nHe concluded by stating that Facebook would continue its research into the issue, but warned the company had to remain cautious when implementing any changes. “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,” Zuckerberg said.\nIn the past, these types of changes have come in reaction to a backlash (as in October when Facebook promised to surface more “ newsworthy ” content, following an outcry over its removal of a prominent Vietnam War photograph). And that also seems to be the case now.\nOn November 18 came the revelation that Facebook is actually planning to implement practical changes. Again, it was Zuckerberg that made the announcement outlining the proposed updates.\nChief among the new features is what sounds like an algorithmic update to the News Feed. Using its machine learning tech, the system will, according to the CEO, be able to predict fake news content based on data trends and label it as bogus. Zuckerberg also mentioned a warning system that will alert users who read or attempt to share fake news as to its unreliability. He claimed that Facebook was working on these tools with third-party fact checking sites, journalists, and its community of users.\nThe fact that Zuckerberg had to address the company’s critics several times, and in quick succession, betrays how deeply concerned Facebook is about the matter, which continues to dominate headlines. And now, reports are beginning to surface that those concerns run deep. Indecision on the part of Facebook has reportedly led to disagreements between management and staff members.\nInternal discord facebookComp_head More The big blue social network should have come out victorious after the most recent election season. Last month, it was touting its positive social impact on voter registration . In an otherwise fraught political environment, Facebook managed to brush off earlier accusations of liberal bias by assisting both campaigns with their respective Facebook Live video feeds. Then, just a week before the country went to the polls, it announced another strong quarter of earnings. On the surface, everything was going swimmingly for the social network.\nInternally, however, Facebook is reportedly struggling to deal with the latest round of criticism. The company has allegedly created algorithmic updates to its News Feed to specifically target fake news but it fears implementing the changes could once again lead to accusations of bias.\nThe problem, according to anonymous sources close to the matter who spoke to Gizmodo , is that the sites in question are “disproportionately” right-wing in terms of their editorial content. Facebook fears that by targeting the content produced by these Pages (some of which have millions of likes, and boast high levels of engagement) it could upset conservatives. Its inability to address the issue could be the result of an earlier controversy regarding its Trending Topics feed.\nIn May, Facebook found itself on the opposing end of a similar backlash as to the one it faces today. Following revelations by ex-employees that their colleagues had been suppressing conservative news on the trending topics section, Facebook was forced to issue statement after statement denying managerial involvement. It even launched an internal investigation into the matter, which found no evidence of systemic bias.\nThe trending topics incident “paralyzed” Facebook, rendering it unable to clamp down on fake news in fear of raising doubts over its impartiality, according to employees who spoke to The New York Times .\nFor its part, Facebook claimed it “did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.” It continued: “We always work to make News Feed more meaningful and informative … This includes continuously reviewing updates to make sure we are not exhibiting unconscious bias.”\nIt seems so-called “renegade” Facebook employees are again taking matters into their own hands. “Fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” a Facebook worker told BuzzFeed . Alongside a dozen or so other staff members, the unidentified individual is allegedly part of a task force that is taking it upon themselves to create measures to battle fake news. The group plans to eventually share its recommendations with management. Other employees are Quote: d as saying that “hundreds” of workers are dissatisfied with Facebook’s stance on fake news.\nYet, even in the midst of these reports of internal strife, those paying attention to Facebook will have noticed that short-term changes are already being implemented.\nAdverts speak louder than words Earlier in November, Facebook banned operators of fake news sites from utilizing its ad network to generate income. Despite being viewed as a small step, the move hits fake news vendors where it hurts: their wallets.\n“We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” Facebook said in a statement following its update to its ad policy.\nAside from trying to limit the amount of money fake news outlets can make from its site, Facebook also took another step that could be related to a newfound strategy aimed at flagging fake content. Shortly before its clampdown on ads attached to fake news sites, the company quietly purchased a popular social analytics tool used by media companies to track trending stories. CrowdTangle announced its takeover on its website – Facebook made no official announcement. Why is the company’s latest acquisition important? Well, it just so happens to be the same tool reporters have used to track the rise of fake news on Facebook.\nI used Crowdtangle to report on spread of fake news on Facebook. Now that Facebook has bought Crowdtangle, I worry that use will be gone\n— Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) November 11, 2016\nObama cares Zuckerberg hangs with people like President Obama More Just as Facebook seems to be getting its act together, the issue of fake news is being discussed in the global political arena. President Barack Obama made his strongest remarks on the subject, claiming it is damaging to the U.S. democratic process.\n“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” he said during a press conference in Germany.\n“In an age where there’s so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,” Obama said. “If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect.”\nObama – who, during his presidency, has participated in two Q&A sessions with Zuckerberg – previously referred to the conspiracy theories being floated around on Facebook as creating a “dust cloud of nonsense.”\nReport: Facebook has the tools to fight fake news but isn’t using them Blaming Facebook for Trump’s victory is ‘crazy,’ but there’s work to do Facebook employees wrangled with execs to remove Trump’s posts as hate speech",

      "text": "Share on Facebook A couple weeks ago, Bruce Springsteen made headlines when he wound up stranded at the side of the road just outside his New Jersey hometown. His motorcycle broke down, but thankfully, the Boss was rescued by a gang of bikers that had been celebrating Veterans Day at a legion nearby. Now, Billy Joel has revealed that he's to blame for the motorcycle mishap. The piano man himself apparently hand-built the bike at a shop called 20th Century Cycles in Long Island, NY, and gave it to Springsteen as a gift. At a concert in New York City earlier this week (November 21), Joel told his audience that he had called his buddy Bruce after seeing the news and asked, \"Was that the bike I built for you?\" Turns out it totally was, which prompted an apology from Joel and a \"no worries\" from Springsteen. After all, things ended up working out okay for the Boss. As previously reported, the bikers from the Freehold American Legion gave him a ride to a nearby bar and kept him company while he waited for his ride home to show up. As an act of contrition, Joel treated the crowd at Madison Square Garden to a cover of \"Born to Run\" on Monday evening. Check out some fan-shot footage of the performance below.",

      "title": "5 Ways People Respond When You Post CNN’s ‘Are Jews People?’ On Facebook",
      "text": "I took a quick scroll through Facebook yesterday, as one does. My Facebook feed has gotten notably darker these days, what with the encroaching sense of imminent doom, and I’ve adjusted my gauge for what registers as “shocking” accordingly. One post, however, managed to make me take pause. It was a screenshot of a CNN talk show, with a caption at the bottom reading, “Alt-Right Founder Questions If Jews are People.” The context: CNN Host Jim Sciutto was discussing whether or not Trump should disavow the increasingly visible anti-Semitism and racism among his followers on the “alt-right.”\nWhat really got interesting is what happened when I shared the post. Over the course of two hours, I got a pretty representative sample of the various species of responses I’ve been seeing to other Facebook posts about our national downward spiral. Here’s a run-down:\n1. The This-Can’t-Be This sort of reaction is like the denial step in the five stages of grief. The commenter simply can’t or won’t believe the post is real. Surely, this is Photoshopped. Have you checked Snopes?\nPro: It’s good to be skeptical, and good to retain hope that the world is, in fact, not bleak enough for CNN to be actually posing a “both sides” argument about whether or not Trump should disavow neo-Nazis.\nCon: The world is, in fact, getting that bleak.\n2. The Gallows Humorist I certainly tend toward this one quite a bit. This sort of reaction looks at something that’s objectively very troubling and goes, you know what? I’d rather laugh. My favorite reaction to my own “Are Jews People?” post read, “Tag yourself. Personally, I am a chair.”\nPro: Alleviates stress; provides respite.\nCon: Why are we laughing? CNN is legitimately arguing about whether or not neo-Nazis are “that bad” for saying Jews might not be people.\n3. The Reasoner We all have someone — or multiple someones — on our Facebook who will chime in with an explanation about why, in fact, this is really nothing to worry about. After all, they were only discussing the words of a white supremacist, not endorsing them.\nPro: Rational thought is good for the mind and the soul.\nCon: Condescendingly denies that the fact that this is getting airtime at all/that this is the timeline we are living in is terrifying.\n4. The Mourner/Rager This post is something to the effect of “ gghhh” and/or another sort of utterance of despair and/or rage. Also expressed in the “anger” emoji in lieu of a “like.”\nPro: Visceral connection to how scary and sad the world is at the moment.\nCon: Sometimes lacks substance beyond the shared primal scream we are all participating in internally.\n5. The Out-of-Depth Trump Supporter This post comes from the depths of your Facebook friend list — maybe someone you knew in high school, or met once at a party. Maybe a relative. Who knows. But they’ve decided to get on your post and write some sort of truly irrelevant screed like, “When did CROOKED HILLARY denounce the Alt-right?!” (she has), or “This is beside the point, the Alt-right is a fringe group, why should he pay attention?” (Five words: Bannon. In. The. White. House.)\nPro: …you got me there. Maybe the new cell phone you get after you throw yours across the room?\nCon: Derails post; incites existential disappointment in humanity.\n CNN Sorry for ‘Are Jews People?’ Banner During Segment on Alt-Right White Supremacists Marcy Oster November 22, 2016 Lana Adler is a Forward Fellow working on opinion.

      "text": "facebook fake news roundup zuckerberg facebookf More Facebook is on a precipice. Its critics claim fake news on its site swayed the presidential election, but any changes it has attempted to make to its News Feed have seen it branded a “media company” — a label it has repeatedly rejected .\nSo where does Facebook go from here? In the past week alone, it has made strategic moves to track fabricated content on its site and to stop third-parties from profiting from it. Meanwhile, its management has played down reports of the extent of its fake news crisis, whilst also committing to make content on its platform more diverse. These are positive signs, but its detractors claim it still isn’t enough.\nRead on to find out how Facebook’s fake news problem came to be and how it has called in to question the inner workings of the world’s biggest social network.\nFictional stories and where to find them View photos\nnews feed More To understand the company’s dilemma, it is best to start from its core social sharing tool: the Facebook News Feed.\nBoth internally within Facebook, and externally among the media, there is much talk (and disagreement) over the so-called influence of the News Feed, now used by 1.75 billion people. One thing’s for sure, any real steps to stamp out fake news will start and end with the largely automated timeline.\nMore: How does Facebook censor content? Civil rights groups demand an answer\nAt present, the News Feed prioritizes content it thinks you’ll like based on your activity – such as posts you’ve interacted with through likes, comments, and shares. The social network’s critics claim this system creates a filter bubble (or echo chamber) that only functions to surface content that corresponds to your views and opinions.\nWith that in mind, fake news can wield a negative impact – especially in light of recent findings by the Pew Research Center that revealed almost half of American adults on Facebook get their news from the platform. But fabricated content comes in all shapes and sizes. There’s spam content posted on deceptive sites purely to generate ad revenue; erroneous articles rushed to print online that are later retracted or amended; and hyper-partisan (or bogus) news items that exist simply to put forth skewed political viewpoints. In our post-election landscape, it is the latter that are causing the most concern as to their detrimental affects on social media users.\nEven before the election outcome was decided, a number of reports had measured the extent of Facebook’s fake news problem. Chief among them was John Herrman’s piece in The New York Times detailing the rise of these types of outlets on the platform. “Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy, and journalism into a potent new mixture,” Herrman wrote.\nTwo months later, BuzzFeed published its own report regarding fake political news on Facebook in which it claimed that a hub of pro-Trump sites were being operated far away from the U.S. in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. These sites were spamming Facebook groups with their “baseless” content with no other agenda than to further their own financial gain by raking in ad revenue.\nThis Facebook trending story is 100% made up.\nNothing in it is true.\nThis post of it alone has 10k shares in the last six hours. pic.twitter.com/UpgNtMo3xZ\n— Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) November 14, 2016\nRead More Following election night, an influx of articles on Facebook’s fake news problem articulated the need to hold the company accountable for its so-called part in swaying the result. How did Facebook respond? Over to you, Zuck.\nZuckerberg on the defensive Facebook-CEO-Mark-Zuckerberg More Frederic Legrand/Shutterstock\nIt didn’t take long for Mark Zuckerberg to leap to his company’s defense. During the course of the past few weeks, the Facebook founder has commented on the issue three times in total.\nEarlier this month he made some valid points that hinted at the mainstream media’s disconnect from U.S. voters. Speaking at a tech conference, Zuckerberg made his first public statement on the issue, in which he dismissed the notion that fake news on Facebook swayed the election as “crazy.” He added: “There is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that someone voted the way they did … because they saw some fake news. If you believe that then I don’t think you have internalized the message Trump supporters in this election are trying to send.”\nMoreover, in his second statement shared via his Facebook account, Zuckerberg insisted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on the platform is authentic.\n“Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics,” Zuckerberg said. “Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nHe concluded by stating that Facebook would continue its research into the issue, but warned the company had to remain cautious when implementing any changes. “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,” Zuckerberg said.\nIn the past, these types of changes have come in reaction to a backlash (as in October when Facebook promised to surface more “ newsworthy ” content, following an outcry over its removal of a prominent Vietnam War photograph). And that also seems to be the case now.\nOn November 18 came the revelation that Facebook is actually planning to implement practical changes. Again, it was Zuckerberg that made the announcement outlining the proposed updates.\nChief among the new features is what sounds like an algorithmic update to the News Feed. Using its machine learning tech, the system will, according to the CEO, be able to predict fake news content based on data trends and label it as bogus. Zuckerberg also mentioned a warning system that will alert users who read or attempt to share fake news as to its unreliability. He claimed that Facebook was working on these tools with third-party fact checking sites, journalists, and its community of users.\nThe fact that Zuckerberg had to address the company’s critics several times, and in quick succession, betrays how deeply concerned Facebook is about the matter, which continues to dominate headlines. And now, reports are beginning to surface that those concerns run deep. Indecision on the part of Facebook has reportedly led to disagreements between management and staff members.\nInternal discord View photos\nfacebookComp_head More The big blue social network should have come out victorious after the most recent election season. Last month, it was touting its positive social impact on voter registration . In an otherwise fraught political environment, Facebook managed to brush off earlier accusations of liberal bias by assisting both campaigns with their respective Facebook Live video feeds. Then, just a week before the country went to the polls, it announced another strong quarter of earnings. On the surface, everything was going swimmingly for the social network.\nInternally, however, Facebook is reportedly struggling to deal with the latest round of criticism. The company has allegedly created algorithmic updates to its News Feed to specifically target fake news but it fears implementing the changes could once again lead to accusations of bias.\nThe problem, according to anonymous sources close to the matter who spoke to Gizmodo , is that the sites in question are “disproportionately” right-wing in terms of their editorial content. Facebook fears that by targeting the content produced by these Pages (some of which have millions of likes, and boast high levels of engagement) it could upset conservatives. Its inability to address the issue could be the result of an earlier controversy regarding its Trending Topics feed.\nIn May, Facebook found itself on the opposing end of a similar backlash as to the one it faces today. Following revelations by ex-employees that their colleagues had been suppressing conservative news on the trending topics section, Facebook was forced to issue statement after statement denying managerial involvement. It even launched an internal investigation into the matter, which found no evidence of systemic bias.\nThe trending topics incident “paralyzed” Facebook, rendering it unable to clamp down on fake news in fear of raising doubts over its impartiality, according to employees who spoke to The New York Times .\nFor its part, Facebook claimed it “did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.” It continued: “We always work to make News Feed more meaningful and informative … This includes continuously reviewing updates to make sure we are not exhibiting unconscious bias.”\nIt seems so-called “renegade” Facebook employees are again taking matters into their own hands. “Fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” a Facebook worker told BuzzFeed . Alongside a dozen or so other staff members, the unidentified individual is allegedly part of a task force that is taking it upon themselves to create measures to battle fake news. The group plans to eventually share its recommendations with management. Other employees are Quote: d as saying that “hundreds” of workers are dissatisfied with Facebook’s stance on fake news.\nYet, even in the midst of these reports of internal strife, those paying attention to Facebook will have noticed that short-term changes are already being implemented.\nAdverts speak louder than words Earlier in November, Facebook banned operators of fake news sites from utilizing its ad network to generate income. Despite being viewed as a small step, the move hits fake news vendors where it hurts: their wallets.\n“We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” Facebook said in a statement following its update to its ad policy.\nAside from trying to limit the amount of money fake news outlets can make from its site, Facebook also took another step that could be related to a newfound strategy aimed at flagging fake content. Shortly before its clampdown on ads attached to fake news sites, the company quietly purchased a popular social analytics tool used by media companies to track trending stories. CrowdTangle announced its takeover on its website – Facebook made no official announcement. Why is the company’s latest acquisition important? Well, it just so happens to be the same tool reporters have used to track the rise of fake news on Facebook.\nI used Crowdtangle to report on spread of fake news on Facebook. Now that Facebook has bought Crowdtangle, I worry that use will be gone\n— Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) November 11, 2016\nObama cares View photos\nZuckerberg hangs with people like President Obama More Just as Facebook seems to be getting its act together, the issue of fake news is being discussed in the global political arena. President Barack Obama made his strongest remarks on the subject, claiming it is damaging to the U.S. democratic process.\n“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” he said during a press conference in Germany.\n“In an age where there’s so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,” Obama said. “If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect.”\nObama – who, during his presidency, has participated in two Q&A sessions with Zuckerberg – previously referred to the conspiracy theories being floated around on Facebook as creating a “dust cloud of nonsense.”\nHere's how Facebook plans to fight the fake news empire taking over its platform Report: Facebook has the tools to fight fake news but isn’t using them Blaming Facebook for Trump’s victory is ‘crazy,’ but there’s work to do Why did Facebook buy a social analytics tool used by media companies? Facebook employees wrangled with execs to remove Trump’s posts as hate speech",

      "text": "Need a friendly ear and some direct advice for your survival pool picks? Friend me on Facebook . Or hit me up on Twitter @kevinkaduk . Let’s ride the roller coaster together.\nResources : Yahoo survival pool pick distribution • SurvivorGrid.com\nWeek 11’s biggest killer: Kansas City Chiefs over Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4.75 percent)\nWeek 11’s biggest winner: New York Giants over Chicago Bears (32.91 percent)\nTotal Week 11 eliminations : 5.43 percent of entries\nPerfect entries remaining on Yahoo : 13,552\nIf you’re still playing survival football, you’ve seen a lot of good news and bad news the past three weeks.\nThe good news is that you’re still alive.\nThe bad news is that so are many others.\nOnly 5.43 percent of entries on Yahoo’s platform were knocked out in Week 11, the second-lowest total of the season. (5.42 percent of entries bit it in Week 5.) Pair that with small tolls in Weeks 9 and 10 (10.05 and 11.68) and it really does seem like we’ve been running in place this month.\nThat’s what happens when you’ve got so many consistently terrible teams like the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Chicago Bears.\nSome pools combat seasons like this by going to a survival pool where you must pick a LOSER each week (so you can’t take advantage of, say, the Browns more than once). Others play with a format that requires you to pick two winning teams in the final weeks of a season to ensure the pool gets culled down to a single winner.\nWhatever your rules, if you’re still alive, you still want to be making the best picks you can with the teams you have left. Draw up a road map for these last six weeks of the season and stick with it.\nBefore we look at a few of the Week 12 games, you’ll notice that I didn’t bring any of the three Thanksgiving games into the mix. There’s no real obvious pick and there’s no reason to ruin your holiday after being ousted from contention. (Because we’ve all felt that mourning period after being knocked out in survival. It’s a real thing.)\nNew York Giants over Cleveland Browns\nAre you a person who has gotten this far by picking against the Browns in 10 of the first 11 weeks? (They’ve played the Ravens twice.) If so, email me a screenshot at kevinkaduk@yahoo.com because I want to recognize your commitment.\nPerhaps to my detriment, I’m always a little nervous to be on the bandwagon when it finally veers off a cliff. So at various points this year, I’ve warned against touching the Browns stove only to find it hot. But who am I at this point to counsel otherwise? Over 40 percent of early picks are loading up on the Giants despite them being on the road. And why not? The Giants don’t have a lot of obvious spots left and everyone’s going to have to take at least a week break from the Browns when they finally get a merciful bye next Sunday.\nBuffalo Bills over Jacksonville Jaguars\nNumberfire lists the Bills as 83 percent favorites to win this game , by far the highest number of the week. And Buffalo will probably end up being the second-most popular pick this week when all is said and done. But with other solid options out there, you’re probably best off laying off the Bills because they also get the Browns at home in Week 15.\nNew Orleans Saints over Los Angeles Rams\nBoth teams are 4-6, but the Saints come into the game as a touchdown favorite. The Saints haven’t been tapped much by survival players this year, but this is the weekend to do it. Do you really thinks Jared Goff’s first win is going to come in a shootout against Drew Brees in the Superdome? Me neither.\nMIami Dolphins over San Francisco 49ers\nThe Dolphins are 4-1 at home this year and right in the middle of the AFC playoff race. The 49ers have lost nine straight and will be flying cross-country after the holiday. If you’re not one of the 47.4 percent that successfully took the Dolphins over the Browns in Week 3, here’s your spot.\nMy pick: Saints over Rams\nWho are you picking this week? Let me know in the comments below!\nPresident Ronald Reagan and the annual pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkey on Nov. 21, 1988 in Washington. (Photo: NY Daily News via Getty Images) More",

The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. Those who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don't have your good in mind. The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry. \"It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.\" -- Paul Craig Roberts",

      "text": "LONDON — When someone you love passes away, processing that loss can be incredibly hard.\nThrough the annals of time, the physical vestiges of a person's life — like clothing, letters, photographs and jewellery — have provided comfort to those grieving after their death. But now, social media means a digital imprint of a person's life can also live on after a person has died.\nGrief is a profoundly personal experience that comes in a myriad of forms. But social media is proving to be an outlet for grieving friends and family members who are coming to terms with the loss of someone they love.\nSEE ALSO: How I helped my father grieve when his mother died\nMashable talked to three people who've used social media to cope with loss to find out whether taking your grief online is a help or a hindrance.\nLifestyle blogger Luisa-Christie Walton-Stoev found Facebook to be a reassuring and helpful space when her friend passed away. Walton-Stoev told Mashable that her friend Hester died after taking the unclassified liquid party drug GBL.\n\"Straight after it all happened I wrote on Hester's wall, and even sent a message to her at one point when I was really sad. Sometimes I still find myself on her profile having a click through photos, or posts her friends have left,\" says Walton-Stoev.\n\"It feels reassuring, like I'm still able to remember her and let her know I'm thinking about her.\"\n\"It feels reassuring, like I'm still able to remember her and let her know I'm thinking about her,\" she continued.\nSocial media is both a friend and an enemy After activist Tamanna Miah's best friend died, she found social media played a significant, yet complex role in her ordeal. Miah found out about her friend's death on Facebook — something which made the news even harder to bear.\n\"No one wants to learn that their friend passed away on social media. I screamed and I cried. I didn’t want to find out online,\" Miah told Mashable .\n\"For me Facebook also had a massive impact as a support mechanism. But, while it supported me, it also made things worse,\" Miah told Mashable.\nMiah's best friend died by suicide after struggling with mental illness. For this reason, looking through his Facebook profile became a way for Miah to look back over messages and understand what he had been going through.\n\"I look back through old photos, messages, memories. I look back on the day things happened and wonder why didn’t I do anything about it. I question and judge everything I ever did and try to piece everything together,\" said Miah.\n\"Yesterday I just sat and read through all of our messages and thought how could I not understand what he was trying to say? You never realise what your last words to someone are,\" Miah continued.\nMiah created a Facebook album of memories that she and her friend had shared. And she watched as hundreds of people wrote messages on her friend's wall. \"We would talk to each other. I felt very emotional when I read it all. It was nice to see that people really appreciated him. Nice to see people celebrated and appreciated the things he did for them,\" says Miah.\n\"How was I to know that green little dot on Facebook Messenger would never come up again?\"\nMiah says she is finding social media is both a friend and an enemy in the grieving process. For her, facing constant reminders and memories hasn't been helpful in the grieving process. Having used Facebook as her main means of communicating with her friend, the \"huge absence\" of messages or status updates is extremely poignant.\n\"How was I to know that green little dot on Facebook Messenger would never come up again? And that I wouldn’t ever get a Twitter notification?\"\nGrief as a shared experience\nWhen care worker Emily's ex-boyfriend passed away suddenly while working abroad, Facebook played a considerable role in helping his mum grieve. Emily (who just wanted to give her first name) would go around to his parents' house so they could access their son's Facebook page using her account.\n\"His mum unfortunately wasn't friends with him on Facebook and because of privacy settings at the time, Facebook wouldn't allow access into his account. I used mine so she could see his profile and photos,\" Emily told Mashable .\n\"I think his mum appreciated being able to see photos of him with friends because otherwise that would have been a part of his life she didn't know about,\" Emily continued.\nSimilar to Miah, Emily found other people's comments to be a source of comfort.\n\"I think being able to share photos and memories and comments on social media brought some comfort to everyone grieving because you realise you are not alone even if you don't know the others,\" says Emily.\nImage: Getty Images\n'Social media is the new town square' Grief expert David Kessler believes that social media is extremely helpful in processing what's happened.\n\"I believe social media is the new town square. A century ago, we would meet in the town square and discuss the person who had died,\" Kessler told Mashable .\nNow, he says, social media provides an option for those grieving. If you want to talk, you can usually find someone else on Facebook who's also grieving for that same person. If you don't feel like talking, then you can hide it from your timeline.\n\"People who don't want to be a part of it don't have to watch others grieve and share memories,\" Kessler says.\n\"If you can't sleep at 3 a.m., you can go on social media and you might find someone else who's awake and grieving,\" Kessler continued.\n\"We like things that mark that our loved one was here.\"\nKessler says that Facebook is not just a tool that helps people reach out to other when they're grieving, it also acts as a tangible remainder of that person's life.\n\"When a person dies, their footprint on earth gets a little smaller. We give away clothes, dissemble their room. But their digital footprint can remain forever,\" Kessler says.\n\"We like things that mark that our loved one was here,\" he continued.\nThe ability to hide someone's feed and check out temporarily is a positive aspect, particularly when seeing people's outpourings of grief on Facebook becomes too much during your own grieving process,\" says Kessler.\nDr. Sheri Jacobson — clinical director of Harley Therapy — says that social media allows us to quickly access those who understand what we are going through. But, it can also play a harmful role if used in the wrong way, says Jacobson.\n\"Online mourning can actually lead to conflict and upset if we don't approach it wisely, or even stop us from healing and moving on,\" Jacobson continued.\n\"Mourning is a very individual, personal thing, so we might feel bothered by the way others are choosing to show their sadness or respect.\nFeeling that some people's comments are self-centred, or that the commenter didn't know the deceased well enough can occur when a griever is feeling particularly vulnerable.\n\"If you find social media leaves you feeling worse every time, it might be best to stop using it for a few weeks. Most of all, don't see social media as the only platform you use. In-person support is always better,\" Jacobson.\nEverybody grieves differently and it's important to be cognizant that social media might not always be the most helpful platform during low points. It can provide a comfort when you want to look back over the good times you've shared, but do exercise caution and ensure you don't over-analyse posts and messages.\nMost importantly, do what works for you in what can be the darkest chapter of your life.",

I do,however, and always have relied heavily on Twitter and more recently, Medium. That makes me a rather unique case in point since I am probably one of the few people who use one platform heavily and do not use Facebook. (In much the same way, I could have been on the OJ jury. At that point I didn’t know he was. Obviously, I am not sports follower). I love Twitter because I could curate my own feed. Ironically, this turned out to be much of the problem here. It was the beginning of building my own echo chamber. It’s late, but not too late. I have added some people to follow, and it wasn’t easy. This is vile stuff to read from my point of you.

      "text": "\nImage source: Facebook.\nOn Facebook 's (NASDAQ: FB) third-quarter earnings call in early November, CFO Dave Wehner told analysts 2017 would be a year of \"aggressive investment.\" But apparently there's still room in the budget for a potential $6 billion in share buybacks, which the company's board approved on Nov. 18.\nThe share repurchase authorization will go into effect in the first quarter of 2017 and has no set end date, so it's less about capitalizing on the recent downturn in Facebook's share price than about providing another option for Facebook to deploy the $26.1 billion in cash and equivalents sitting on its balance sheet. The move echoes a similar move made by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) last year, when it announced a $5.1 billion share buyback authorization with $73 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nThe last American President on the last American Thanksgiving?\nTwenty five percent of America suffers from what is called food vulnerability. I sincerely hope your family has a blessed Thanksgiving, complete with all the turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie that you could eat. May you enjoy fellowship with those who are dearest to us. I hope you are one of the 75% who actually has enough to eat.\nAmerica is headed for very profound changes. Tomorrow, I am going to release what is really going on with Calexit and the nefarious people who have become allies and are seeking to impose their will on California through any means possible, it is stunning and frightening. California, by design, this will be your last tranquil Thanksgiving for quite some time. In the meantime, my California friends, avoid placing yourself or your family in large crowds over the next several weeks, particularly if you are white. All will be made clear to you tomorrow.\nHappy Thanksgiving America If you are one of the remaining Americans who has a enough to eat, count your blessings! We Americans may not have many Thanksgivings left to celebrate under the Red, White and Blue!\nIt has been announced that there will be a recount with regard to the general election, in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\nAs it stands now, if Trump remains the President-elect, we will have a revolution courtesy of the George Soros. Hillary and Obama are encouraging the rioting, and as I will be discussing tomorrow, things are about to get real dicey where in many places it may not be safe to leave your home and travel. Hell, it won’t be safe to remain in your house because if Clinton wins in an over-turned election, this will provide the impetus for a revolution as well. Mike Adams was correct when he said, several weeks ago, no matter who wins, blood will eventually run in the streets. Bob Griswold, from Readymadereources.com , told my listening audience that we are in blue-gray situation. No matter who wins the election, there will be a civil war.\nIronically, in this Thanksgiving holiday season, it is becoming clear that food will be a primary weapon to be used against the American people. It is rumored that the meeting between Trump and Kissinger addressed this issue as well. Trump got told what is coming and that he will be powerless to stop it.\nA Nation of Plenty, Sort of…. As you prepared your feast, did you think about the fact that we in America throw away more food than many countries have an opportunity to eat? As you pulled your chair up to your Thanksgiving table, did you think about the fact that half the world goes to bed hungry? America has its shame in this area as well.\nSince the end of WWII, most Americans have been blessed with plenty to eat, so much so, that we simply take our overflowing of Thanksgiving blessings for granted.\nIf you think an 800 number begging you to feed a hungry child is going to appear, you would be mistaken. However, there are people, who have power over us, who would like to make this the last Thanksgiving that America will celebrate as a Constitutional Republic. and to some extent, America is extremely vulnerable to being starved into submission by the bankers as a means of political control. As your family has the Thanksgiving football games on TV today, and you are bombarded by messages of “love your veterans” and aren’t we lucky to live in a land with such blessings, please consider the message of the picture contained in this graphic, or note the statistic listed below in relation to our land of plenty. This is all BS, the powers that be are preparing to put you on your knees through the withholding of food.\n“Happy Thanksgiving! We Are Halfway To Being Starved Into Submission”\nA Global Awakening Brzezinski, one of the most hated and well-known globalists, lamented in 2011 that there is a global awakening to the source of the tyranny on this planet and that “they” must accelerate their timetable for the completion of a global takeover. And the full-court press has subsequently been placed on humanity as we are under assault in ways never witnessed before. Destiny has arrived, America!\nOne of the most popular methods of subjugation has to do with controlling who eats and who dies. Historically, food has been one of the most effective tools of subjugation.\nToday as we contemplate our good fortune with our full plates and full bellies, wouldn’t it be ironic if we had to contemplate a future where millions were kept on the edge of starvation as a means of political control? Of course this could never happen in America, could it? Few people know that seven million Americans starved to death during the Great Depression in what could be called the Great American Holodomor.\nThe Historical Precedent of Subjugating Through Starvation The lessons of history clearly demonstrate that dictatorial regimes, whether they be Socialists, Communists, and Marxists will not hesitate to use food as a weapon against their own people in order to solidify power and impose absolute autocratic control. Food can be withheld from the masses by preventing it from being grown and harvested, by contaminating it and rendering it unfit for human consumption or by simply preventing food from being distributed to a targeted population.\nThe two most notable examples of dictators using food as a weapon in order to destroy the free will of their people comes from the regimes of Stalin and Hitler.\nJosef Stalin engaged in his own Soviet style Holocaust when, in 1932 and 1933, and estimated six to 20 million people in the Ukraine died from starvation when Stalin implemented his prescription of “hope and change” policies in order to eliminate the Ukrainian’s desire for becoming their own nation-state.\nUpon assuming power, the Stalinist Communist regime rapidly nationalized the food industry and forced all of the region’s farms into collectives. Thus, Stalin’s version of the Holocaust came to fruition in what history has dubbed, the “Holdomor,” in which millions perished in only a two year period when the Soviet government began to exterminate the Ukrainian population by taking control of food and food production.\nHitler proclaimed that food could be used as a tool “…to discipline the masses” and he did not hesitate to use the control of food as a type of carrot and stick in which he would reward accomplishment and punish failure as well as to ferment preferential class distinctions in which his armed forces received the largest food ration cards. Skilled workers who were engaged in industries critical to the building of the German war machine, received food ration cards which were slightly less in value. And, finally, the prisoners and the Jews received the lowest valued Nazi food ration cards. Food ration cards were also utilized as incentives to increase industrial production and were also increased in value when productive Nazi workers would be promoted. Food ration cards were diminished in value for the failure to meet Nazi production goals. Hitler’s use of what psychologists refer to as classical conditioning techniques reduced the will of the German population to a pack of Pavlovian dogs who were conditioned to be totally dependent upon the government for their survival. WITH OVER 50 MILLION AMERICANS ON FOOD STAMPS, UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE POTENTIAL FOR HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF IS INDEED REAL! ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO TURN OFF THE EBT CARDS!\nMost recently, Somalia thug, Farah Aideed, systematically starved his people into submission as a brutal civil war raged in both Darfur and Rwanda where the Islamic regimes sought the annihilation of ‘infidels’ and the use of food was one of the primary weapons designed to force compliance. And of course, Pol Pot, Castro and Mao all used food deprivation to quarantine their political opposition and exact absolute allegiance to their respective dictatorial regimes.\nIt is safe to say that the aforementioned dictators did not rule over countries that enjoyed a Thanksgiving feast similar to what you and I are enjoying today.\nThe US Government and Its Mass Starvation Policies The use of food by the U.S. government has been a matter of official U.S. governmental covert policy since 1974-1975.\nIn December, 1974, National Security Council directed by Henry Kissinger completed a classified study entitled, “ National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests.” The study was based upon the unproven claims that population growth in Lesser Developed Countries (LDC) constituted a serious risk to America’s national security.\nIn November 1975 President Ford, based upon the tenets of NSSM 200 outlined a classified plan to forcibly reduce population growth in LDC countries through birth control, war and famine . Ford’s new national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, in conjunction with CIA Director, George H. W. Bush, were tasked with implementing the plan and the secretaries of state, treasury, defense, and agriculture assisted in the implementation of these insane genocidal plans.\nNSSM 200 formally raised the question, “Would food be considered an instrument of national power? … Is the U.S. prepared to accept food rationing to help people who can’t/won’t control their population growth?” Kissinger has answered these questions when he stated that he was predicting a series of contrived famines, created by mandatory programs and this would make exclusive reliance on birth control programs unnecessary in this modern day application of eugenics in a scheme that would allow Henry to have his cake and eat it too in that the world would finally be rid of the “useless eaters!”\nThird world population control, using food as one of the primary weapons, has long been a matter of official covert national policy and a portion of President Obama’s Executive Order 13603 (EO), National Defense Resources Preparedness is a continuation of that policy. Only now, the intended target are not the LDC’s but, instead, the American people and after Obama declares martial law, food will undoubtedly be used to subjugate the more resistant regions of our country.\nCould Obama Become the Next Stalin? The potential for the extreme events like what happened Ferguson, only this time will be spreading across the country are real. If the country was to go into martial law lockdown, would food be used by this administration to control the population?. The epicenter for this rebellion will begin in Los Angles. If the Obama administration is successful in fanning the flames of racial violence on a mass scale, he will never leave office! This is part of the impetus behind the recounting of the votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin which is to create confusion and doubt about who is really in charge.\nObama Has Executive Orders On His Side On the surface, it seems unlikely that any US president would ever starve any segment of the American people to death. However, when one considers the implications of Obama’s EO 13603 , there can be no doubt that Obama would not hesitate to make this Thanksgiving, the last Thanksgiving, if not, why else would Obama have created the executive order.\nObama has total and absolute control over all food where his EO states :\ne) “Food resources” means all commodities and products, (simple, mixed, or compound), or complements to such commodities or products, that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals, irrespective of other uses to which such commodities or products may be put, at all stages of processing from the raw commodity to the products thereof in vendible form for human or animal consumption. “Food resources” also means potable water packaged in commercially marketable containers, all starches, sugars, vegetable and animal or marine fats and oils, seed, cotton, hemp, and flax fiber, but does not mean any such material after it loses its identity as an agricultural commodity or agricultural product.\n(f) “Food resource facilities” means plants, machinery, vehicles (including on farm), and other facilities required for the production, processing, distribution, and storage (including cold storage) of food resources, and for the domestic distribution of farm equipment and fertilizer…”\nThis unconstitutional EO is particularly disturbing in that it clearly states that the government has control over anything that is “capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals…” If you thought that you and your loyal dog, Fido, were going to get through the coming food crisis by storing and consuming dog food, think again.\nHow will farmers maintain the nation’s food supply when all fertilizer, their farm equipment and all of their vehicles are under the control of this sociopathic President or the next power-hungry President?\nThe term “ all food storage facilities ” includes your refrigerator, your pantry and even the very food in your cabinets as well as what is on your kitchen table. In short, anywhere you keep food is now under the control of the government and can be redistributed.\nPlanned Starvation In Modern Day America Were you scratching your head in bewilderment as you watched a couple of years back, on the news, as the Amish have had their farms raided, raw milk producers have been jailed and the kids running lemonade stands have been shut down and ticketed? Now you know why these abuses are being perpetrated by the government in that it represents a mere conditioning process designed to get all U.S. citizens used to the idea that the government owns all food and food production.\nThe most clever aspect of this EO is that no Hegelian Dialectic (i.e., false flag event) is needed as a pretense to seize food and imperil survivability. Section 201(b) of the Obama EO clearly states that this EO is enforceable under both “emergency and non-emergency conditions .”\nConclusion In an interesting footnote in history, Hitler used the Jews as forced labor as he systematically starved them to death in several of the labor death camps. What is to prevent REX 84 or PDD 51 from being carried out on American soil. After all, EO 13603 calls for civilian conscription , under the Department of the Labor, without compensation!\nIs Obama setting the table to take his place among Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Castro and Mao as another despot in the long line of tyrannical leaders who would grant themselves the authority to subjugate the masses by using food as a weapon after declaring martial law? In this scenario, how long do you think that your Thanksgiving left overs will last? Americans desperately need to look at history in order to understand what happens every time the people of a government allows the government to control its food supplies and farms.\nConclusion I sincerely hope that you will enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner, because if Obama does decide to implement EO 13603, today’s Thanksgiving dinner, could become known as ” T he Last Thanksgiving Dinner. ”\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nby Scott Creighton\nJill Stein polled regularly at between 1% and 3% across the country in the run-up to the general election in 2016. The closer it got to election day, the smaller her numbers. You can check Real Clear Politics if you don’t believe me.\nNationwide, Stein finished 4th in the presidential election with 1.02% of the votes . She wasn’t even on the ballot in all 50 states (44 + D.C.) and she lost in a big way to that idiot Libertarian, Gary Johnson who more than tripled her numbers. Plus, they were competent enough with their farce of a campaign to get on the ballot in all 50 states.\nThe Stein team of the Green Party has come out over the past couple of days with a plan to raise enough money to contest the election results in 3 key states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nStein supposedly thinks her numbers were low in those three states and wants a recount.\nIn Michigan she came in 4th with 1.07% of the vote . In Pennsylvania she came in 4th as well with .82% of the vote. And finally, in Wisconsin, Jill Stein came in 4th with 1.01% of the vote.\nHistorically, the Green Party has only gotten more than 1% of the votes once and that was when Ralph Nader ran in 2000.\nSo what is the big controversy? Am I missing something Dr. Stein?\nWere Jill Stein’s numbers really that low in comparison with her overall national results? No.\nWill the recount make any difference at all to Jill Stein’s campaign? No.\nWhy those three states in particular? Why not any others where the results weren’t super close? Why not states won by Hillary Clinton?\nI’ll tell you why, because those states are close between the candidates who finished number 1 and number 2 in the voting, Donald Trump won them all in a surprise result and the combined Electoral College votes from just those three states if flipped, would make all the neocons and the establishment Dems and Republicans very happy by making Hillary Clinton the president of the United States of America.\nCurrently, Clinton is more than 2 million votes ahead of Trump in the popular vote but trails Trump, 232 to 306, in all-important electoral votes. If Wisconsin (10 electoral votes), Michigan (16 electoral votes) and Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes) flipped in a recount, Clinton would win in the electoral count, 278-260 ” Patch.com\nJill Stein is running around doing interviews for MSM “news” sites like she’s been named the next pope or something.\nSomehow or another, this year all the MSM outlets are very interested in the possibility of election rigging on a systemic level. Funny, they have never been interested in that before. Not in Ohio back in 2004, not in South Carolina back in 2010 and not all across the country during the unDemocratic Primary of 2016.\nIn fact, it was downright unAmerican to even suggest such a thing was possible in the month leading up to the election. That is of course if you weren’t saying Russia was going to do it. That was fine.\nBut now, somehow, the complicit media is giving “progressive” Jill Stein a pulpit from which to decry our election system as potentially hack-able from the base level and Jill doesn’t seem to smell a rat as she happily runs around enjoying all the attention.\nAnd her party has raised a shit-load of money doing this little project of theirs.\nStein’s website shows they have raised over 4 MILLION DOLLARS in just over 24 HOURS to fund the recount process . She is on track to collect 4.5 million very soon (in a matter of hours)\nFOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS. And the number is rising with every MSM promo they give her.\nLet’s put that into perspective shall we?\nThroughout her entire campaign this season, Jill Stein and the Green Party collected a total of 3.5 million dollars to make her president .\nAnd now her fan base blows that out of the water by ONE MILLION MORE BUCKS… in a day?\nFunny isn’t it? Jill Stein’s people KNOW SHE’S NOT GOING TO BE MADE PRESIDENT BY THIS RECOUNT IN 3 MEANINGLESS STATES TO HER… and yet they contribute at a breathless pace.\nObviously, Hillary Clinton’s people are funding this effort because quite frankly HILLARY CLINTON AND HER NEOCON BACKERS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM IT.\nJill Stein supporters dont’ care. She’s not going to win anything out of this. And she’s not going to get enough votes in these three states to push the Green Party over 5% nationwide which would give them critical funding help next election cycle. So they get nothing from this.\nBut Hillary’s people. They get everything from it. That’s why they are using Jill Stein as their little patsy to push for the recount.\nThere are currently two schools of thought in the great stolen election debate of 2016. Some say Hillary’s team tried their best to steal it but failed due to unexpected turnout in key states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\nOthers believe the establishment that hated Trump and promoted Hillary like there was no tomorrow decided for reasons unknown to put their fingers on the scale on his behalf.\nI would probably be considered a proponent of the former if I had to make a choice. I kinda believe it didn’t really matter to TPTB and as a result, all stock market indicators have reached record highs, all-time record highs, since neoliberal Trump beat neoliberal Clinton.\nThis could be all being done to create more panic and chaos in the country and that is something that has to be considered. Just imagine what happens after all these anti-Trump protests were staged after the election, if they were suddenly to come back and say, “no wait. Hillary actually won. Don’t change the drapes. Obama’s girl is taking over”\nThis country would implode and might just be what the doctor ordered in order to get that purely authoritarian state they want for the next neoliberal dictatorship in the Shining City on the Hill”\nEither Jill Stein is a useful idiot or she decided to jump on board with the winning team and ride in for the big score. And she will get a big score for this one.\nWhat a disappointment she is.",

      "text": "New road rage initiative named for Lilly Garcia \n  The controversy between outgoing Democratic Senate Leader Michael Sanchez and one Albuquerque family continued this week with one Facebook post. \nTuesday, Sanchez called out the father of 4-year-old Lilly Garcia asking why he wasn’t charged for his role in the road rage incident that led to his daughter’s death. \nThe post created a mixed reaction; some people agreed with Senate leader saying “from day one I’ve been asking the same thing.” \nOthers called him a “piece of work” and a “bully.” \nBefore Sanchez was voted out of office, the mothers of Manzano High School teen Jaydon Chavez-Silver and 4-year-old Lilly Garcia appeared in a political ad accusing him of “cradling criminals.” \nThe group behind the ad, Advance New Mexico Now. \n“Senator Michael Sanchez says we’re just emotional,” Veronica Garcia said. \nIn the Facebook post, without getting specific, Sanchez references recent DUI cases in which children were in the vehicle and the adults were charged with child abuse. He goes on to say, “But a father who starts road rage incident with children in vehicle walks away without any charges…” \nJust after his lost two weeks ago, Veronica and Nicole Chavez spoke with KRQE News 13 saying, “We wanted him to know we experienced a loss that that a lot of people never have to live through. We fought for a babies and we won.” \nAs KRQE News 13 reported, Sanchez has said he may soon take the group behind the attack ads, Advance New Mexico Now, to court.  ",

      "text": "Since the election, Facebook’s role in policing fake news on its site has become a very hot topic.\nAnd it should be. Throughout the election, Facebook’s behaviour has exposed what seems to be a great contradiction at its heart. As the social network has pushed hard to dominate new forms of media, it’s also bent over backward to deny that it is a media company — and denying that responsibility that comes with that label.\nThe truth is that Facebook has already taken on one of the functions of a media company: to act as a gatekeeper. It has labelled satire. It takes down “clickbait” articles which, in its own words, have headlines that “intentionally leave out crucial information, or mislead people”. Its algorithms clearly have some standards for content quality.\nBut Facebook won’t apply those standards to its fake news problem. In fact, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took to his own profile to explain why and to reject the much-discussed idea that false news articles on the network could have affected the election.\nI don’t know if we can lay credit or blame for this election’s outcome at social media’s doorstep. Finding that out would take a lot of research, an army of sociologists and access to a lot of Facebook data I don’t have. \nBut what is troubling about Zuckerberg’s post is his explanation for why Facebook isn’t tagging or penalising false news: “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\n“An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”\nI agree it’s not easy for Facebook to tackle this problem. Worries of a politicised Facebook have dogged its steps before. Those accusations are still haunting the network; Facebook in a statement denied a Gizmodo article claiming it had a solution to its fake news problem but quashed it, fearing backlash from the right.\nIt’s true that Facebook alone shouldn’t define what is the truth. But its prominence as a source of news gives it the responsibility to flag what is false.\nZuckerberg essentially falls back on an old excuse when the fake news issue comes up: that Facebook is just technology firm and a platform ... an aggregator not up to the task of policing its users.\nThat excuse started out thin, and is only getting thinner.\nSure, social media companies may want to deny that they are in the content business. But they are in it — and only getting deeper. Look at where these companies are investing: more photo-sharing, video, virtual reality.\nThose are all new media products that they say they need to survive.\nYet Zuckerberg is sticking to his tech company script, denying responsibility for what is posted on Facebook — even when it doesn’t make sense.\nFor example, to prove his point that fake news has little influence on Facebook, Zuckerberg pointed out that there isn’t that much of it on the network.\n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic,” Zuckerberg said in his post. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics.\n“Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nThat may be true, but doesn’t reflect how Facebook works. A piece of writing crafted to generate clicks, likes and shares, by design, gets outsize attention.\nZuckerberg himself said in his post’s comments that specific users may see more false content on their feeds depending on how they and their friends use the site.\nHe also refuted the idea that slanted news could have on individual voters by citing Facebook’s own research, which shows the network exposes people to a broader set of ideas. Here, again, the issue is more nuanced.\nYes, a recent Pew Research Center study showed social media posts have changed some people’s minds. But the same study showed that people often mute, block or otherwise filter out social media opinions they don’t want to hear.\n“We see people engaging in a broader range of viewpoints while simultaneously taking steps to avoid content that is against their views,” said Aaron Smith, associate research director at Pew. “If there’s one consistency, it’s that you can really see both sides of that coin depending on how you ask things.”\nAnd, Smith added, individuals don’t control everything they see on Facebook — Facebook’s algorithms do. So, again, Facebook is the only one with the power to control what’s on its site.\nAnd for a company that crows over its abilities to convince people to buy products, play games and even convince people to vote, it rings false for Facebook to reject the idea that its algorithms pick couldn’t possibly influence those votes.\nFacebook is not alone in wrestling with this problem. The first Google result that appeared when searching for popular vote tallies linked to a false news report. That prompted both Google and Facebook to say they won’t accept advertisements from fake news sites anymore — a small step that won’t address the larger problem, but at least makes an attempt.\nIn my mind, killing fake news online is a shared responsibility. Social media users should, of course, be critical of the things they read.\nBut Facebook and other social media sites aren’t picking up their share of the work. Otherwise such obviously false information wouldn’t score so well with those so-called neutral algorithms.\nAnd if these companies continue to push their media efforts, they can’t then shy away from the responsibilities that come with the business. If quality and truth are what matter when it comes to content, that has to matter all of the time — not just when it’s uncontroversial.\n— Washington Post",

      "text": "Butter With a Side of Bread Like us on Facebook A traditional Thanksgiving dinner is the meal that keeps on giving. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the leftovers filling your fridge, here are 10 resourceful recipes to give you some post-Turkey Day inspiration. 1. SAVORY CREPES WITH TURKEY AND STUFFING \nIf you’re not out shopping all Friday morning, reward yourself with these savory Thanksgiving crepes from the blog Butter with a Side of Bread. The insides are filled with leftover stuffing and strips of turkey, and then topped off with a drizzle of gravy and cranberry sauce. The recipe even makes use of your leftover mashed potatoes by incorporating them into the batter for the crepes themselves. 2. TURKEY POT PIE SOUP Handle the Heat \nA fast way to get rid of any excess leftover turkey is to transform it into a soup. This turkey pot pie soup from the blog Handle the Heat takes only 30 minutes to cook, and it will provide you with quick and easy meals for the rest of the holiday weekend. The addition of fresh sage is the perfect way to prolong the flavors of fall—even when it starts to feel like winter outside. 3. MASHED POTATO AND STUFFING PATTIES Pocket Change Gourmet \nWhat’s the best way to re-purpose the starchy sides leftover from Thanksgiving? By pressing them into patties and frying them, of course. In addition to using stuffing and mashed potatoes, these patties from Pocket Change Gourmet also call for leftover turkey, so they’re substantial enough to be eaten as a snack or a meal. 4. THANKSGIVING LEFTOVERS STROMBOLI Betsy Life \nThanksgiving sandwiches start to get old after the third or fourth time you make them. If you’re in search of something a little more innovative to do with your leftovers, try stuffing them into a stromboli. This glorious creation from the blog Betsy Life includes turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mashed potatoes, all braided inside a golden-brown crust. The recipe uses pre-made pizza dough, so putting it together takes even less effort than you’d think. 5. THANKSGIVING LEFTOVER CASSEROLE Favorite Family Recipes \nThis casserole from Family Friendly Recipes has it all. Just layer your turkey, mashed potatoes, corn, gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce into a baking dish and 40 minutes later you’ll have a dish that delivers that perfect Thanksgiving taste all in one bite. 6. FRIED MASHED POTATO BALLS Spicy Southern Kitchen \nIt’s easy to overlook the sad bowl of leftover mashed potatoes sitting in the corner of your fridge. This recipe from Spicy Southern Kitchen injects new life into your old mashers with healthy heapings of bacon, cheddar, green onion, and jalapeños. Roll the mixture together into 1-inch balls and fry them for a delicious bite-sized snack. 7. STUFFING SANDWICH \nMost conventional Thanksgiving sandwiches include stuffing between the bread. In this sandwich from Sporkful, the stuffing is the bread. By binding the leftover stuffing with egg, it can then be formed into slice-like patties and fried up to crispy perfection. The stuffing buns make the perfect vehicles for all the classic sandwich components like turkey, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce. 8. PUMPKIN PIE MILKSHAKE Blogging Over Thyme \nSome pumpkin milkshake recipes call for pumpkin puree, or perhaps a scoop of pumpkin ice-cream. This leftover thanksgiving pumpkin pie milkshake from Blogging Over Thyme recipe requires a whole slice of pie. A thermos full of this stuff might make the Monday after Thanksgiving a little more bearable. 9. TURKEY AND SWEET POTATO ENCHILADAS This is How I Cook \nFor a Mexican spin on the all-American flavors of Thanksgiving, use your leftover turkey meat as stuffing for enchiladas . The baked sweet potatoes emphasize the fall flavor profile and smoky chipotle sauce adds an extra spicy kick. 10. THANKSGIVING LEFTOVER PIZZA \nWhen looking for a tasty leftover vehicle, it's hard to go wrong with pizza. This recipe for turkey, mashed potato, and mushroom pizza steps out of the box by swapping out the pizza sauce for gravy. That sounds like a brilliant idea no matter what time of the year it is.

Subscribe Why Asia Will Strike Fear And Awe In Donald Trump (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \nAnswer by Abhinav Sharma , former Facebook employee, on Quora : Did Facebook’s “fake news stories” have a large influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election? The only people who have the right answer to this question work at Facebook and won’t tell us this in a public sphere. It’s arguable if even they can pull up a definitive answer. If I had access to the data here’s what I’d do: Hire fact checkers to label which articles News Feed gave distribution to that were false. There might be a lot of fake news out there but there are ways to simplify this, like assign domains a correctness score and label them in decreasing order of the distribution they got. If you have access to Facebook’s data, it’s relatively easy to determine which way someone is likely to vote. I bet this step is actually really difficult to pull off if you’re Facebook and trying to be a neutral organization, but you could tune news feed to distribute sources historically known to be true over those that are not, run a long term experiment and see if that changes political opinion . This’ll get Facebook into politically gray territory, but it’s not completely out of the question, Google editorializes what sources they consider to be “news”; see Rob Ennals’ answer to Did Facebook’s “fake news stories” have a large influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election? I personally don’t think Facebook will do this, this is less neutral than I’ve seen the organization have a tolerance for, e.g. they removed editorialized trending topics because they were accused of hiring editors with a liberal bent (see Abhinav Sharma’s answer to Is Facebook’s decision to algorithmically select trending topics a good one? ) But that’s just a guess and who knows. Update: It seems from some reporting that this may have been the case: Facebook’s Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative Backlash . Also, an experiment that might change political opinion is arguably more controversial than one that changed people’s moods, and they got a lot of flack for that — Facebook’s Unethical Experiment Manipulated Users’ Emotions . I find Robert Cialdini’s framework for thinking about persuasion helpful in this situation. He lays out that the most common elements of influence are: Reciprocity : Obligation to repay. Consistency and Commitment : Need for personal alignment. Social Proof : The power of what others do. Liking : The obligations of friendship. Authority : We obey those in charge. Scarcity : We want what may not be available. Another one I’d like to add from other sources is “repetition.” Facebook doesn’t influence people one way or another, but it supercharges the velocity at which you can influence someone a certain way and reinforce those beliefs. As Mills points out, false information is nothing new to media, but there are two interesting new things that have happened in the internet era: For any arbitrary point of view, there are virtually infinite “articles” on the internet that’ll support it. Content doesn’t have to be mediated by several layers of the media to flow from a creator to a consumer. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The other extreme when it goes south is state-run media, which is also highly capable of warping facts. Ultimately, it’s the individual’s responsibility to be skeptical, think critically and seek out truth. Knowing what’s true becomes harder when the world is undergoing a huge shift in the media it uses to communicate, like the one we’re seeing now . If you actually do a user study with many 60-year-olds who passively use the internet, they really can’t tell between a new media website that’s real information vs. one that’s fake. So yes, we are going through a phase where fake information is easier to spread widely. How much it influenced the election, well, only Facebook can measure it, and even then it’s a difficult calculation and something they don’t have a strong incentive to do. Over time, we as society build better trust systems and truth validation mechanisms. See for example all the work going on with blockchain. In the asymptote, humans do seek out truth, because having an accurate mental model of the world has been effective in our evolution. Whether Facebook thinks it’s their responsibility to provide that service or its best left to someone else is really just a matter of Mark Zuckerberg’s opinion, all things considered. I will say that there’s a strong financial incentive for Facebook to stay extremely personalized to reinforce people’s belief systems. They can be Fox News to the conservatives and NYT to the liberals, so the less opinions you have the more people you can serve. \nThis question originally appeared on Quora.

A scene from the next episode released online shows how the pirate gets caught lying again, in order to enlist the help of the Rebels. \n[Spoiler alert] \nPirates and the Rebels will collaborate once again in the next episode titled “The Wynkahthu Job.” A video posted on the official YouTube page of the franchise, which can be seen below, shows how Hondo (Voice by Jim Cummings) lied in order to get the help he needed. \nApparently the pirates decided to use mines in order to disable the ship, but since the ship was out of control it drifted into a dangerous place. When his crew decided to board the ship anyway, he abandoned them and went to look for a new group to help salvage the freighter. \nHondo’s crew member is not happy about being left to die, but the pirate manages to win him over by offering 2 percent in the share of the booty instead of one. But, Zeb (Voice by Steve Blum) will not be swayed so easily. \nThe main plot of “Star Wars Rebels” Season 3 episode 8 revolves around a freighter full of weapons that the Rebels want to salvage for their fight against the Empire. Given the importance of the mission, Zeb reluctantly agrees to work with Hondo. \nIn the scene released online, Zeb is not happy about Hondo lying about the freighter. Ezra (Voice by Taylor Gray) attempts to diffuse the situation by pointing out that the pirate did not lie, he just didn’t say the whole truth. But, the Lasat is not convinced. \nZeb is so angry that he wants to tear the limbs off Hondo in “Star Wars Rebels” Season 3 episode 8. The pirate hopes this is just a joke, but Ezra doesn’t answer him. \nCredit: YouTube/ Star Wars",

(© AP Images) \nWhen former Microsoft head Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway chief executive Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge in 2010, the billionaires established a new threshold for big-donor philanthropy. Their initiatives asks wealthy people worldwide to contribute most of their net worth to philanthropic causes . \nAmong those accepting the challenge: Facebook chairman Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. Like Gates and Buffett, they’re following an American tradition: building a fortune and using it to serve others. \nZuckerberg and Chan recently pledged $3 billion to help cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of the 21st century. Their pledge mirrors the ethos of 19th-century steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who believed in giving back to the society that empowered his rise. \n“Philanthropists have provided what an observer once called ‘social venture capital,’ says Leslie Lenkowsky, a philanthropy expert at Indiana University. Frequently, he adds, they invest “in innovations in health care, education, economic development, human rights and much more that governments were unwilling, unable or too short-sighted to try. As a result, men, women and children throughout the world now benefit from the generosity of people they never knew.” (State Dept./Sara Gemeny Wilkinson)",

      "text": "\nThe major social networks have accumulated relatively large audiences and they are a good starting point to find people. In social networks like Facebook , there are groups, which are communities comprised of people who share a common interest.\nOne of the best ways to look for people you want for a certain engagement is by targeting these specialized groups and that is what this lady did recently. She decided to post a query to the Professional Photographers Group on Facebook where she was seeking for someone to cover an event for free.\n\nWell, that request did not sit well with people thanks to the “unpaid opportunity” phrase at the bottom and people were quick to respond to the request. It generated over 100 comments and over 40 shares all trying to explain to Stella about the magnitude of her request.\nYeah this guy was not pleased about the request since he knows the cost of the equipment. \n\nThis guy compared the logic with getting a “free camera” from the camera manufacturer, Nikon. \n\nWell played, Douglas. \n\nDavid here tried to explain to Stella about the logic of paying for a photographer using a visual aid. \n\nDennis was not too happy about the apparent “exploitation” \n\nShadrack over here gave an option (well.. phone cameras are becoming more capable by the day) \n\nThis guy summed up the plight of photographers in this thread perfectly. \n\nHowever, the entire comment thread was not homogenous. Someone decided to view the request from another angle as an opportunity like how Stella framed the request.\n\n \nRead On Web → Request For ‘Voluntary’ Photography Job on Facebook Becomes Unexpected Lesson \n",

      "text": "Facebook is on a precipice. Its critics claim fake news on its site swayed the presidential election, but any changes it has attempted to make to its News Feed have seen it branded a “media company” — a label it has repeatedly rejected .\nSo where does Facebook go from here? In the past week alone, it has made strategic moves to track fabricated content on its site and to stop third-parties from profiting from it. Meanwhile, its management has played down reports of the extent of its fake news crisis, whilst also committing to make content on its platform more diverse. These are positive signs, but its detractors claim it still isn’t enough.\nRead on to find out how Facebook’s fake news problem came to be and how it has called in to question the inner workings of the world’s biggest social network.\nFictional stories and where to find them View photos\nnews feed More To understand the company’s dilemma, it is best to start from its core social sharing tool: the Facebook News Feed.\nBoth internally within Facebook, and externally among the media, there is much talk (and disagreement) over the so-called influence of the News Feed, now used by 1.75 billion people. One thing’s for sure, any real steps to stamp out fake news will start and end with the largely automated timeline.\nMore: How does Facebook censor content? Civil rights groups demand an answer\nAt present, the News Feed prioritizes content it thinks you’ll like based on your activity – such as posts you’ve interacted with through likes, comments, and shares. The social network’s critics claim this system creates a filter bubble (or echo chamber) that only functions to surface content that corresponds to your views and opinions.\nWith that in mind, fake news can wield a negative impact – especially in light of recent findings by the Pew Research Center that revealed almost half of American adults on Facebook get their news from the platform. But fabricated content comes in all shapes and sizes. There’s spam content posted on deceptive sites purely to generate ad revenue; erroneous articles rushed to print online that are later retracted or amended; and hyper-partisan (or bogus) news items that exist simply to put forth skewed political viewpoints. In our post-election landscape, it is the latter that are causing the most concern as to their detrimental affects on social media users.\nEven before the election outcome was decided, a number of reports had measured the extent of Facebook’s fake news problem. Chief among them was John Herrman’s piece in The New York Times detailing the rise of these types of outlets on the platform. “Facebook-native political pages have begun to create and refine a new approach to political news: cherry-picking and reconstituting the most effective tactics and tropes from activism, advocacy, and journalism into a potent new mixture,” Herrman wrote.\nTwo months later, BuzzFeed published its own report regarding fake political news on Facebook in which it claimed that a hub of pro-Trump sites were being operated far away from the U.S. in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. These sites were spamming Facebook groups with their “baseless” content with no other agenda than to further their own financial gain by raking in ad revenue.\nThis Facebook trending story is 100% made up.\nNothing in it is true.\nThis post of it alone has 10k shares in the last six hours. pic.twitter.com/UpgNtMo3xZ\n— Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) November 14, 2016\nFollowing election night, an influx of articles on Facebook’s fake news problem articulated the need to hold the company accountable for its so-called part in swaying the result. How did Facebook respond? Over to you, Zuck.\nZuckerberg on the defensive Facebook-CEO-Mark-Zuckerberg More Frederic Legrand/Shutterstock\nIt didn’t take long for Mark Zuckerberg to leap to his company’s defense. During the course of the past few weeks, the Facebook founder has commented on the issue three times in total.\nEarlier this month he made some valid points that hinted at the mainstream media’s disconnect from U.S. voters. Speaking at a tech conference, Zuckerberg made his first public statement on the issue, in which he dismissed the notion that fake news on Facebook swayed the election as “crazy.” He added: “There is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that someone voted the way they did … because they saw some fake news. If you believe that then I don’t think you have internalized the message Trump supporters in this election are trying to send.”\nMoreover, in his second statement shared via his Facebook account, Zuckerberg insisted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on the platform is authentic.\n“Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics,” Zuckerberg said. “Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nHe concluded by stating that Facebook would continue its research into the issue, but warned the company had to remain cautious when implementing any changes. “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,” Zuckerberg said.\nIn the past, these types of changes have come in reaction to a backlash (as in October when Facebook promised to surface more “ newsworthy ” content, following an outcry over its removal of a prominent Vietnam War photograph). And that also seems to be the case now.\nOn November 18 came the revelation that Facebook is actually planning to implement practical changes. Again, it was Zuckerberg that made the announcement outlining the proposed updates.\nChief among the new features is what sounds like an algorithmic update to the News Feed. Using its machine learning tech, the system will, according to the CEO, be able to predict fake news content based on data trends and label it as bogus. Zuckerberg also mentioned a warning system that will alert users who read or attempt to share fake news as to its unreliability. He claimed that Facebook was working on these tools with third-party fact checking sites, journalists, and its community of users.\nThe fact that Zuckerberg had to address the company’s critics several times, and in quick succession, betrays how deeply concerned Facebook is about the matter, which continues to dominate headlines. And now, reports are beginning to surface that those concerns run deep. Indecision on the part of Facebook has reportedly led to disagreements between management and staff members.\nInternal discord View photos\nfacebookComp_head More The big blue social network should have come out victorious after the most recent election season. Last month, it was touting its positive social impact on voter registration . In an otherwise fraught political environment, Facebook managed to brush off earlier accusations of liberal bias by assisting both campaigns with their respective Facebook Live video feeds. Then, just a week before the country went to the polls, it announced another strong quarter of earnings. On the surface, everything was going swimmingly for the social network.\nInternally, however, Facebook is reportedly struggling to deal with the latest round of criticism. The company has allegedly created algorithmic updates to its News Feed to specifically target fake news but it fears implementing the changes could once again lead to accusations of bias.\nThe problem, according to anonymous sources close to the matter who spoke to Gizmodo , is that the sites in question are “disproportionately” right-wing in terms of their editorial content. Facebook fears that by targeting the content produced by these Pages (some of which have millions of likes, and boast high levels of engagement) it could upset conservatives. Its inability to address the issue could be the result of an earlier controversy regarding its Trending Topics feed.\nIn May, Facebook found itself on the opposing end of a similar backlash as to the one it faces today. Following revelations by ex-employees that their colleagues had been suppressing conservative news on the trending topics section, Facebook was forced to issue statement after statement denying managerial involvement. It even launched an internal investigation into the matter, which found no evidence of systemic bias.\nThe trending topics incident “paralyzed” Facebook, rendering it unable to clamp down on fake news in fear of raising doubts over its impartiality, according to employees who spoke to The New York Times .\nFor its part, Facebook claimed it “did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.” It continued: “We always work to make News Feed more meaningful and informative … This includes continuously reviewing updates to make sure we are not exhibiting unconscious bias.”\nIt seems so-called “renegade” Facebook employees are again taking matters into their own hands. “Fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” a Facebook worker told BuzzFeed . Alongside a dozen or so other staff members, the unidentified individual is allegedly part of a task force that is taking it upon themselves to create measures to battle fake news. The group plans to eventually share its recommendations with management. Other employees are Quote: d as saying that “hundreds” of workers are dissatisfied with Facebook’s stance on fake news.\nYet, even in the midst of these reports of internal strife, those paying attention to Facebook will have noticed that short-term changes are already being implemented.\nAdverts speak louder than words Earlier in November, Facebook banned operators of fake news sites from utilizing its ad network to generate income. Despite being viewed as a small step, the move hits fake news vendors where it hurts: their wallets.\n“We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” Facebook said in a statement following its update to its ad policy.\nAside from trying to limit the amount of money fake news outlets can make from its site, Facebook also took another step that could be related to a newfound strategy aimed at flagging fake content. Shortly before its clampdown on ads attached to fake news sites, the company quietly purchased a popular social analytics tool used by media companies to track trending stories. CrowdTangle announced its takeover on its website – Facebook made no official announcement. Why is the company’s latest acquisition important? Well, it just so happens to be the same tool reporters have used to track the rise of fake news on Facebook.\nI used Crowdtangle to report on spread of fake news on Facebook. Now that Facebook has bought Crowdtangle, I worry that use will be gone\n— Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) November 11, 2016\nObama cares View photos\nZuckerberg hangs with people like President Obama More Just as Facebook seems to be getting its act together, the issue of fake news is being discussed in the global political arena. President Barack Obama made his strongest remarks on the subject, claiming it is damaging to the U.S. democratic process.\n“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” he said during a press conference in Germany.\n“In an age where there’s so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,” Obama said. “If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect.”\nObama – who, during his presidency, has participated in two Q&A sessions with Zuckerberg – previously referred to the conspiracy theories being floated around on Facebook as creating a “dust cloud of nonsense.”\nReport: Facebook has the tools to fight fake news but isn’t using them Blaming Facebook for Trump’s victory is ‘crazy,’ but there’s work to do Facebook employees wrangled with execs to remove Trump’s posts as hate speech",

      "text": "Executive Director, Engagement Planning at OgilvyOne Worldwide 18 mins ago How nice people get corrupted in Facebook? Mark Zuckerburg said that Facebook doesn’t have a fake news problem and, that even if it did, fake news didn’t influence the outcome of this year’s presidential election. I respectfully disagree with him. Here is why. We gather tidbits and knowledge about everyday life through social interactions with other people. This behavior is a nod to the human condition and need to talk with others as a means of making sense of our world and our place within it. In short, people don’t construct reality by themselves. So where do people go to have these conversations? For the most parts, these conversations happen on social media. Americans spend an alarming amount of time checking social media on their phones. People in the U.S. check their Facebook, Twitter and other social media accounts a 17 times a day. That means that at least once every hour that a person is awake, they’re scanning their newsfeeds and interacting with others on social media. As a result, people learn a lot (whether consciously or subconsciously) from shared articles, images, and trending news that appear on their social feeds. That being said, if people are exposed to more fake news stories than real ones, they are more apt to be influenced by the fake stories because that’s what is “trending.” That is the power of conformity. People will change their behavior and beliefs just to align with others. We just have to look at the Asch Conformity Experiment as evidence of how willingly individuals conform to popular opinion. The results of the study demonstrates that people are more inclined to go along with a majority opinion even though they don’t agree with it. People do this simply to avoid being ridiculed or considered “peculiar.” Think of it as choosing the path of least resistance. According to BuzzFeed, during the last three months of the presidential campaign, the 20 top fake news stories on Facebook generated more engagements — shares, likes, and comments — than the 20 top stories from real news websites. In summary, Facebook can be a force for good or evil. Facebook has the power to change governments, as seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and Ukraine. But it can also threaten democratic institutions. As a society, we continuously communicate with one another on social media in order to stay aware of moments in culture and everyday life. But, if the news that we see and share is fake, so to is our conversations. In turn, our social reality becomes a mirage of truth and a center for fake truths. Google and Facebook have a plan, however, to keep this from happening in the future. And for that tenacious plan, I applaud them.",

      "text": "James Gunn is putting his money where his mouth is.\nOn Facebook Thursday, the Guardians of the Galaxy director fielded a question about a much sought-after Easter Egg in the 2014 Marvel film, with a fan asking if he plans on ever revealing it. Gunn responded that he had no plans on revealing the Easter Egg, which the director first teased two years ago and so far nobody has found.\nThis answer prompted another fan to cry foul: \"He won't reveal it because it doesn't exist. The ultimate troll.\"\nGunn brought out the big guns in his response, vowing to pay the commenter $100,000 if there is no Easter Egg.\nNews of the missing Easter Egg first came to light in November 2014, when Gunn was doing press for the Guardians of the Galaxy Blu-ray.\n\"There's definitely one really big thing that people haven't seen, but they may never see it - we'll see. There's other things, too,\" Gunn told ComicBook.com (which also spotted the $100,000 offer.)\nGunn maintains a close relationship with fans thanks to his active social media accounts, where questions about this Easter Egg pop up often (though not as much as requests to know when the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer will arrive.)\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will hit theaters May 5, 2017. Follow Heat Vision on Facebook and Twitter for the latest from the MCU.\nRead more: A Cross-Studio Character Mix-Up Made 'Deadpool' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' Possible",

      "text": "Since Q4 of 2015 , Facebook has paid notable publishers, celebrities, and social media stars over $50 million collectively to create Facebook videos and use its new live streaming platform. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that he is looking to move the platform “towards a world where video is at the heart of [its] services.” Having delivered on Facebook’s in-feed video experience, he’s now looking to do so with Facebook Live.\nLive streaming is set to be a major ad opportunity for the social platform. U.S. online video ad revenue is projected to increase to $16.69 billion by the end of 2020 . Mobile internet usage has surpassed desktop for the first time . And Facebook’s recent quarterly earning reports show that mobile advertising comprises nearly 85% of its total advertising revenue . So it’s not surprising that Facebook Live is becoming a major priority.\nBy publishing original content from already established names like the New York Times, Gordon Ramsey, Tastemade, and more, Facebook is hoping to grow its user base, raise its engagement rates, and ultimately leverage its popularity for ad revenue. Even more, Facebook Live represents a promising opportunity to develop different ad formats, such as live-video in-stream advertisements .\nWith billions of potential video advertising dollars on the line and over $50 million in payouts, the question remains – will Facebook’s gamble on content creators and influencers work?\nFacebook Pays Publishers, Influencers Over $50M To Use Live Video Facebook is currently partnering with nearly 140 video content creators and media companies to promote its video and live streaming platforms. These top influencers, which include YouTube and Vine stars King Bach , Piques , and Lele Pons , are being paid a total of $2.2 million to experiment with Facebook Live and create ongoing content exclusive for Facebook over the course of six months.\n\nFacebook Live’s contracted publishers and influencers vary widely, which should yield an expansive collection of content. Media outlets have posted content ranging from broadcasts of breaking events to professional tutorials and how-to videos.\nFor instance, Mashable launched a series titled #BobDraws on Facebook Live, where Mashable content creator Bob demonstrates how to recreate illustrations.\n\nCelebrities and influencers can likewise bring their brands and stories to the table by building interest around breaking events or hosting occasional vlog and commentary sessions. Here, top influencer King Bach captured one of his YouTube shoots in a Facebook Live session to give his fans a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nFacebook’s strategy to court users is neither new nor shocking.\nIn 2011, YouTube doled out over $100 million to publishers, entertainment companies, and social media influencers to build out their YouTube channels. More recently, YouTube partnered with several top creators for the launch of their shoppable ads and YouTube Red. Snapchat has tapped top Instagram influencers Jay Alvarrez and Alexis Ren for their new Memories feature.\nFacebook Live’s payouts are determined by each influencer’s popularity, total number of live streams, and video duration. Additional payment stipulations do exist for “ exceeding expectations ,” which will likely be informed by different engagement rates.\nIs Facebook’s Gamble Attracting Audiences? Facebook’s $50M video and live streaming deal positioned Facebook Live for significant exposure.\nBy engaging media companies, Facebook was able to attract viewers that were partial to professionally curated, assessed, and edited content. CNN, for instance, used Facebook Live to broadcast commentary from pundits on the 2016 presidential debates. It drew 390,000 views for a short 16 minute video .\nIn tapping celebrities, Facebook Live videos attracted massive fan bases that wanted to view famous personalities reacting in real-time to significant events. Michael Phelps, an Olympian and celebrity athlete, gathered 4 million views on a live video right before his historic last race in the 2016 Rio Olympics. Even more significant, his live stream received 238,000 comments, a vast majority of which occurred in real time. This was just one month after Facebook Live had launched.\nMost significantly, Facebook Live’s recruitment of influencers has attracted audiences that usually consume video on other platforms. These users typically tune in daily. For instance, influencer Logan Paul brought his established audiences on Vine and YouTube to Facebook Live by announcing that he would be posting original content on Facebook. His latest live videos have brought in over 1 million views and 13,000 comments each, showing that users are aggregating on Facebook Live for video content and are enthusiastic about engaging. Aside from increased traffic, influencer presence also contributed to Facebook Live’s overall credibility and relevance.\nIn fact, since Facebook Live’s launch in the beginning of April , search query volume on the term, “Facebook Live Stream,” has seen an increase of 64%.\n\nPaychecks Aside, How Does Facebook Live Benefit Influencers? Influencer presence has certainly shown to be beneficial for Facebook Live. But what are influencers getting out of it other than Facebook’s paycheck?\nInfluencers are constantly looking to expand their presence on the web and to increase their engagement rates.\nThis means that most are willing to work on different platforms in order to maximize their reach. Facebook stands as the most dominant social media platform, with 1.18 billion daily active users and 1.79 billion monthly active users .\nTheoretically there is no better place for an influencer to maximize its audience. Moreover, Facebook’s algorithm updates have made Facebook Live videos more likely to appear in News Feeds. Facebook is also reporting that users spend 3x more time watching a Facebook Live video than a non-live video.\nFacebook’s top influencers, Ray William Johnson and Logan Paul, are testament to Facebook’s potential as a influencer-oriented social media platform. In a single month, Ray William Johnson and Logan Paul saw significant growth in their Facebook Live videos. Views for Ray William Johnson and Logan Paul increased by 56% and 22%, respectively. Both influencers also saw a nearly 40% increased change in shares.\n\nIt’s a win-win relationship. Influencers are helping Facebook generate popular interest by publishing original content on Live. Facebook is in turn empowering influencers by giving them an unmatched audience and specialized audience engagement features.\nLooking To The Future While Facebook Live has experienced immense initial success with its influencers, the platform and video sharing feature will need to continue strengthening those relationships. As we’ve seen in the past, social media platforms that neglect their content creators will lose their substantive content, user base, and relevance.\n",

Well,- this is the rhetorical question raised by Justice Markandey Katju, a former judge of the Indian supreme Court,- known for his unorthodox & politically incorrect views & stringent criticism of the powers that be. In the article below he opines & predicts that we are moving headlong into a fascist dictatorship . This article is over an year old;- dt 21Nov2015 & could not have foreseen the ongoing demonetization crisis in India. However it is farseeing & visionary; a prediction/exposure of the present state of the nation, now deeply polarized and fissured; -on the brink of an unprecedented, deliberately created economic/financial crisis;-imposed by the whim of the central government.",

      "title": "Review: Scott’s Cheap Flights — Flight Deal Subscription Service",
      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nDo you know how something can become such a part of your everyday life that you forget that not everyone knows about it? Well, for us here at The Points Guy, Scott’s Cheap Flights has become one of those staples. Now that Scott’s Cheap Flights is nearing a quarter-million subscribers (247,971 as of yesterday) with at least $2.5 million saved, it’s about time that we did a full review of this up-and-comer of the flight deal world.\nHere’s why we’re making sure to tell you about it now: Scott’s Cheap Flights is running a Black Friday special of 25% off the premium service for everyone who signs up by Monday November 28 . So, if you like what you see, make sure to take advantage of the sale. Personally, I signed up for Scott’s Cheap Flights back in early May. I loved the free service so much that I signed on for a year of the premium service just a few weeks later. Spoiler alert: It’s been well worth the cost.\nWhat Scott’s Cheap Flights Does \nIt’s actually rather straightforward. Image courtesy of Scott’s Cheap Flights. As Scott describes on his website, he’s made it his full-time job to search for flight deals. Unlike other sites that can water down your Twitter feed or email account with domestic flight deals, Scott focuses solely on international fares. Once he finds a cheap flight, he doesn’t stop there. Since he has subscribers all across the country, he checks the other 83 cities — from New York City to Durango, Dayton, Shreveport and Reno — that he covers to see if the deal is also available departing from other airports.\nOnce he’s confirmed the routes, he moves on to finding the cheapest way of booking the flight. Sometimes it’s only available with a promo code through an airline’s website, while other times it’s cheapest to go through an online travel agency (OTA). Since Scott makes his money from premium subscribers, that’s where his loyalty lies. Unlike other flight deal services, Scott won’t send you to a more-expensive website to book your flights so he can get commissions.\nFor this same reason, he’s only going to send out a flight deal when it’s really a deal. That’s why Scott can brag that subscribers save an average of $607 per ticket. As Scott explains in his FAQ :\nQ: Are you going to spam my email with lame deals? \nA: Nah, I hate those email subscriptions that implore you to buy a flight every time the price drops $20 because they get a commission. I don’t receive any commission, so my only interest is helping people find steals.\nOnce he has all of the details put together, he sends off an email to his subscribers. But, this is where there’s a difference between being a standard and premium subscriber.\nFree Service \nAnyone can sign up for Scott’s free email subscription list by entering your email address on Scott’s Cheap Flights website . Free subscribers will get about one-third of flight deals Scott deems worthy of sharing. And, these emails will go out 30 minutes after premium subscribers got the heads-up about the deal. However, you can’t beat free.\nSubscribers choose which region they want to receive flight deals about. Image courtesy of Scott’s Cheap Flights. Scott is far more savvy than just adding your email address to a BCC [blind carbon copy] email list. Each subscriber (free and premium) can personalize his/her preferences. Want Scott to address his emails to you by name? Feel free to add your name. But, the most useful tool is the ability to select which regions you’ll receive flight deals about.\nIf you live in Atlanta, you might not mind driving up to Charlotte (CLT) for a deal. But, it probably isn’t worth it to buy a separate flight to San Francisco (SFO) to save a couple hundred bucks. Whether you’d mind heading to the Northeast or Midwest is up to you to decide. Scott recommends keeping all regions selected at first to see what kind of deals he sends out, so you’ll have an idea what regions you might want to keep.\nPremium Service \nSign up for the premium service to find out about all of the deals first. Image courtesy of Scott’s Cheap Flights. The all-inclusive service of Scott’s Cheap Flights is a premium email list. This email list receives all of Scott’s flight deals as soon as Scott has all of the details arranged. For many of the best cheap flights, time is of the essence. Plus, for 30 minutes, you’ll be competing with a smaller group of fellow deal hounds for flight availability.\nThe standard pricing for Scott’s Cheap Flights premium subscription. Image courtesy of Scott’s Cheap Flights. There’s three price options for the premium subscription : quarterly ($15), semi-annual ($25) and annual ($39). But, with the Black Friday special, you can get 25% off the annual subscription. While Scott gave us an early heads-up about this promotion, we aren’t getting any benefit if you sign-up. But frankly, $29 for a year of the premium service is a great deal if you have any interest in cheap international flights.\nDrawbacks \nScott is only going to alert you to international flight deals departing from the US and Canada. Image courtesy of Scott’s Cheap Flights. Since Scott focuses solely on international flights, he’s not going to be emailing you with great domestic deals like transcontinental flights for just $216 . So, you’re going to want to have your passport ready to go before you sign up for Scott’s Cheap Flights. Or, make sure to book flights far enough ahead to wait out the potentially long passport processing periods .\nIf you’re not based in the US or Canada, you’re probably not going to get much use out of Scott’s Cheap Flights main service, which only covers flight deals departing from the US and Canada. However, Scott is expanding his cheap flights empire to now include separate services for flights departing from Europe , Australia and New Zealand . Scott is based in the US, so the timing of deals might be an issue. We haven’t looked into these services in detail, so we encourage you to test the free service first.\nFor better or worse, the service is dependent on Scott. Image courtesy of Scott’s Cheap Flights. At least for now, Scott’s Cheap Flights seems to be a one-man show. So, when Scott goes on vacation, the flight deals don’t come as often — although Scott does continue to send deals while traveling. The other issue with a one-man operation is that something could happe to Scott. To be honest, one of my fears when signing up for the premium service in May was that Scott would lose interest or not be able to make enough money to continue running the service. This certainly didn’t happen. The possibility is still there, but I would have no hesitation about renewing my subscription today.\nMany of the deals that Scott finds can also be found on other flight deal websites. Sometimes he’ll find the deal first, while other times Scott will alert readers about a deal after it may have already popped up on another website. One of Scott’s Cheap Flights’ main competitive advantages was email alerts, but All The Flight Deals now also provides this service . With that said, Scott’s email frequencies (only a few emails a day), quality of deals and consistency of covering deals even if they originated on another website justifies Scott’s Cheap Flights being your only source of international flight deals.\nBottom Line \nScott’s Cheap Flights is quickly establishing itself as the go-to flight deal email subscription service — and for a good reason. I’ve seen first hand that the flight deals have been consistent and high-quality since I signed up in May. If you’re looking to save money on international flights, it’s an obvious choice to sign-up for the free email service . At $39/year, I have found the premium subscription to be well worth the cost. At $29 during the Black Friday special, it’s even more of a steal.\nHave you tried out Scott’s Cheap Flights? \nFeatured image courtesy of jpgfactory. \nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card APPLY NOW Earn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

      "text": "Facebook 0 \nIn   install two WordPress instances on separate virtual servers with Ubuntu 16.04 OS and Apache, PHP and MySQL installed on them, and how to manage them from a single place using the MainWP WordPress plugin. WordPress is one of the most popular free content management systems, written in PHP that allows web developers to build websites for any purpose. The MainWP dashboard plugin will allow you to manage your WordPress websites from one central location and get nearly complete control of all your WordPress based websites from the MainWP Dashboard. \nThis tutorial was tested and written for an Ubuntu 16.04 VPS , but it should work on any Linux distribution. \nThis install guide assumes that Apache, MySQL and PHP are already installed and configured on your virtual servers. At the time of writing this tutorial, the latest stable version of WordPress is 4.6.1 and it requires: PHP 5.6 or later with the GD graphics library version 2.0.x+, MySQLi and mbstring PHP extensions enabled; Apache Web Server >= 2.0 compiled with mod_rewrite module and with the following directives allowed: RewriteEngine, RewriteBase, RewriteCond and RewriteRule.; MySQL 5.6 or later or MariaDB version 10.0 or later installed on your virtual servers . \nLet’s start with the installation. Download the latest version of WordPress available at https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz to the first server and extract it using the following commands: cd /opt wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip mkdir -p /var/www/html/wordpress unzip -o latest.zip -d /var/www/html/ \nCreate a new MySQL database for WordPress to use and assign a user to it with full permissions: mysql -u root -p mysql> CREATE DATABASE wpdb; mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wpdb.* TO 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yOur-passw0rd' WITH GRANT OPTION; mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; mysql> quit \nDo not forget to replace ‘yOur-passw0rd’ with a strong password. Create a new virtual host directive in Apache. For example, create a new Apache configuration file named ‘wordpress.conf’ on your virtual server: touch /etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress.conf \nThen,   ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/wordpress.conf \nOr, use the a2ensite to enable the ‘wordpress.conf’ configuration in Apache: sudo a2ensite wordpress.conf \nEdit the ‘wordpress.conf’ configuration file: vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/wordpress.conf \nand add the following lines to it: <VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin admin@yourdomain.com DocumentRoot /var/www/html/wordpress/ ServerName your-domain1.com ServerAlias www.your-domain1.com <Directory /var/www/html/wordpress/> Options FollowSymLinks AllowOverride All </Directory> ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/your-domain1.com-error_log CustomLog /var/log/apache2/your-domain1.com-access_log common </VirtualHost> \nOptionally, add/modify the following lines in php.ini configuration file: memory_limit = 256M default_charset = \"UTF-8\" \nSet the proper file permissions for the Apache web server to write to ‘/var/www/html/wordpress/’ directory: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress/ \nEnable the Apache2 rewrite module if it is not already done so: sudo a2enmod rewrite \nRestart the Apache web server for the changes to take effect: service apache2 restart \nCopy the wp-config-sample.php file to wp-config.php : cd /var/www/html/wordpress/ wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php \nEdit the wp-config.php file and change: define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here'); define('DB_USER', 'username_here'); define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here'); \nto define('DB_NAME', 'wpdb'); define('DB_USER', 'wpuser'); define('DB_PASSWORD', 'yOur-passw0rd'); \nRepeat the same installation procedure on the second server where you intend to host the second WordPress website (do not forget to edit the Apache configuration file and replace ‘your-domain1.com’ with the actual domain name hosted on the second server). \nOpen your favorite web browser, navigate to http://your-domain1.com , then open a second tab and go to http://your-domain2.com , and follow the easy instructions to finish the WordPress installations on both servers. \nLog in to the WordPress administration back-end of the first website, go to Plugins >> Add New >> and search for MainWP plugin, then install and activate the MainWP dashboard plugin. On the next page, click Let’s Go >> select ‘Web Host’ and click continue. If all MainWP dashboard plugin requirements are met, click continue. On the next page select the type of hosting (VPS) and the number of child websites you are \nOn the next page, click Let’s Go >> select ‘Web Host’ and click continue. If all MainWP dashboard plugin requirements are met, click continue. On the next page select the type of hosting (VPS) and the number of child websites you are \nNext, select the type of hosting (VPS) and the number of child websites you are planning to manage (less than 50 or more than 50), then click continue. \nThen, follow the instructions and continue with the MainWP dashboard plugin setup according to your needs. \nTo add a second WordPress website, click on the ‘Add New Site’ button, but make sure to go to the administration back-end of your second website and install and activate the MainWP Child plugin first. You can also turn on the ‘unique security ID’ option from the MainWP settings for extra security. \nThen, go to the WordPress administration back-end of your first website. From the MainWP Dashboard plugin , click ‘Add New Site’ and add the URL of the second WordPress website, enter its administrator username and click on the ‘Add New Site’ button. \nThat is it. You can manage the WordPress installations from a single place using the MainWP plugin now. \n  WordPress VPS Hosting   install WordPress and configure it so you can manage multiple WordPress sites from a single place .

      "text": "South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. Photo: Facebook.\nIf confirmed by the United States Senate, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will become the next American ambassador to the United Nations, replacing Samantha Power in that role.\nBecause the UN has become worse than a bad joke – giving despotic regimes a say and vote on issues the international body was established to tackle — its US representative has the particularly tricky and important job of leading the West in setting the right moral tone\nIt is thus not a diplomatic position in the conventional sense. On the contrary, the best US ambassadors have those who make repeated and concerted efforts to put their ill-deserving counterparts in their place, not only through votes and vetoes, but rhetorically, from the podium.\n 3:10 am 1 A Message to Trump: Turkey’s Erdoğan Can’t Be Trusted JNS.org - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was at his repellent best when he was interviewed by Israeli television journalist Ilana...\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan, Jeanne Kirkpatrick and John Bolton are prime examples of shining beacons in the Midtown Manhattan snake pit. Whether Haley lives up to that standard is anyone’s guess. But there is reason to hope that she might, in spite of what critics are pointing to as her lack of experience in matters of foreign affairs.\nIt is clear from Haley’s record, and meteoric rise to her position as the youngest serving governor in the US at the moment, that she possesses the kind of clarity on controversial issues that is required in an arena filled with people whose key purpose is to cloud the distinction between good and evil.\nShe is a fierce opponent of raising taxes, including – get this – on cigarettes.\nShe supports school choice and monetary incentives for teachers, to foster excellence.\nShe led the campaign to have the Confederate Flag removed from the grounds of her state’s Capitol.\nShe is a right-to-life proponent, voting on two separate bills that would require pregnant women to see their ultrasounds and wait 24 hours before being permitted to have abortions.\nShe opposed a bill in her state Senate, which would require transgender people to use bathrooms based on their biological, rather than self-identified sex, viewing the whole thing as a non-issue that should be left alone by politicians.\nShe signed a law to crack down on illegal immigration, and supports legislation that would require voters to produce photo ID at the polls. As the daughter of Indian immigrants who went through legal channels to become American citizens, she is unapologetic about this stance.\nShe also introduced legislation that would outlaw BDS. Though the bill did not mention Israel, its definition of “boycott” — “to blacklist, divest from, or otherwise refuse to deal with a person or firm when the action is based on race, color, religion, gender, or national origin of the targeted person or entity” – implies that behavior towards the Jewish state provided part of the impetus for it.\nThis is why Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon hailed Haley’s appointment, while Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations Riyad Mansour snorted at it.\nFinally – ironically — one equally good sign is that Haley initially supported Marco Rubio in the Republican primaries and then Ted Cruz. When Donald Trump became her party’s nominee, she announced she would vote for him, despite her reservations about his character and abilities. She then called on him to release his tax returns, a move that elicited one of Trump’s notorious Twitter offensives.\nThe above bodes well for two reasons. One is that Haley was not angling to be in the inner circle of the incoming administration. The other is that the president-elect was able to let bygones be bygones and select her for a top spot, based on merit.\nWhen he announced that she was his pick for UN ambassador, Trump described Haley as a “deal-maker” – someone with the ability to “cross the aisle.” Though this is the billionaire businessman’s version of high praise, it is actually not the quality most desirable in a post that demands denouncing and even shunning those whose resolutions are shameful and run counter to American values and superiority.\nIf she is able to translate his words into the kind of action that gives other member-states good reason to follow her direction, however, she will do the office proud.\nRuthie Blum is the managing editor of The Algemeiner.",

      "text": "0 November 25, 2016 Sherri Papini ‘Facebook’ Staged Hoax? Did Missing California Mom Run Away And Fake Kidnapping By 2 ‘Hispanic Women’ With A Gun? [Opinion] Paula Mooney \nThe following article is entirely the opinion of Paula Mooney and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. \nDoubts are already arising on social media and beyond about Sherri Papini, the missing California “super mom” who was reportedly kidnapped by two Hispanic women with a gun as Sherri went for a jog. As reported by CNN , questions still remain after Papini was reunited with her loved ones almost three weeks after disappearing whilst on a run. Whereas “sensitive” information about Papini’s abduction have not yet been released to the public — in the wake of missing information about the once-missing Papini, lots of room has been left for doubts about her kidnapping to be expressed by people on social media. Missing California mom Sherri Papini has been reunited with her family, but questions remain about her disappearance https://t.co/28nqCAeF5Z pic.twitter.com/o3JzUjdCoB \n— CNN (@CNN) November 25, 2016 \nSherri was reported to be very emotional after being rejoined with her family, but CNN experts noted how rare the Thanksgiving Day miracle of Papini being reunited with family is for a woman like Sherri. \nFirst off, Papini told authorities that the public should be on the lookout for a dark SUV containing two Hispanic women with a gun as her possible kidnapping culprits, adding to the oddity of women being kidnappers of other adult women. Also, the fact that Sherri was returned alive is being called a blessing and a boon to all who loved Sherri — but also a rarity after three weeks away. \nPapini’s disappearance after jogging alone spread fears in women who liked to jog in northern California and beyond, with those not wanting to meet the same fate as Sherri experienced. Papini’s husband, Keith, was so worried when Sherri didn’t pick up their children from daycare on November 2, Keith took it upon himself to use the “Find My iPhone” app to find Sherri’s discarded phone. \nShasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko noted that Sherri’s return means Papini’s investigation merely enters a new chapter to figure out who held Sheri captive after Papini was discovered in Yolo County, California. That ironically named “Yolo” is nearly 140 miles from Mountain Gate trail — the location were Papini jogged when she went missing. \nPapini was reportedly still bound and had injuries when she was discovered at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Thursday. [Image by BigLike Images/Shutterstock] \nPapini is certainly receiving plenty of attention on social media. \nSympathy goes out in droves to Sherri, who may have very well endured a scary kidnapping — that could’ve involved untold measures of assault. \nPapini also may have undergone sheer terror from being away from her husband and kids for so long. I just got a call from Keith and Sherri Papini tearfully thanking our GREAT community for all our efforts to bring her home. Thx everyone!!! \n— Missy McArthur (@missy_mcarthur) November 25, 2016 \nDoubts about any wrongdoings by Keith Papini were quelled when Keith took a lie-detector test and passed, and received an alibi from his employer, reports CNN . \nHowever, Papini’s case hasn’t stopped folks from expressing their doubts about the story, as seen in the below quotes from social media users. \nTheories about a Sherri Graeff’s racist rant are making the rounds, but there’s no way of knowing if that is the Sherri Graeff who became Sherri Papini or another woman. [Image by Francesco83/Shutterstock] \nAs known in the case of Mary Osmond, who once suffered from severe post-natal depression and thought of killing herself, as reported by the New York Daily News , Osmond disappeared by driving 250 miles up the coast of California when life became overwhelming to Marie. \nPapini has been called a “supermom” who would not interrupt her routine to stage a kidnapping, but that hasn’t stopped folks from wondering aloud their doubts, as seen below. \n“ Randy Aven : Am I the only one who thinks that Mrs. Papini just needed a few weeks to just get away from it all? # Staged?” \n“ Fl Buckeye Fan: All news media needs to stop with the Papini kidnapping. It’s a farce and will be proven so. Sketchy story CNN MSNBC ” \n“ ChocolateBeauty : Sherie Papini was not [kidnapped] she just went back home for the holidays. She knows she messed up. # sherripapini” \n“ Gershwin Forever : I think there’s a good chance the Sherri Papini case is a hoax.” \n“ Tony Gonzalez: Something just doesn’t add up with this #",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently banned from linkedin.com. please follow me on Facebook. 14 mins ago The road back for Democrats: Identity politics is not the way #Democrats #DemocraticParty The problem with identify politics is that you end up demonizing certain groups of people and that pisses them off. #HillaryClinton and the #ClintonCampaign labeling Trump supporters deplorables, irredeemables, racists, misogynists, bigots and rednecks in flyover country etc. ticked off a whole lot of people. Moreover, it was an attack on white voters. \"One of the more salutary outcomes of the recent election is that Democrats are finally beginning to question the wisdom of basing their fortunes on identity politics. Having counted on the allegiance of African-Americans, Hispanics, gays, unmarried women and the young — and winning the popular vote all but once since 1992 — they were seduced into believing that they could ride this “coalition of the ascendant” into permanent command of the presidency. They’re reconsidering now not because identity politics balkanizes society, creates state-chosen favored groups and fosters communal strife. They’re reconsidering because it’s not working.\"",

      "text": "Facebook post to be used in sentencing Jimmie E. Gates , The Clarion-Ledger 4:48   Gerome Moore was convicted in the January 2015 shooting death of Carolyn Temple in Belhaven. (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger)   \nProsecutors will use a Facebook post from 2010 when Gerome Moore was 13 showing him in possession of a handgun and \"arguably\" displaying gang signs to try to show Moore should be sentenced to life without parole in the January 2015 shooting death of Carolyn Temple in Belhaven. \nMoore was convicted of capital murder in September, but his sentencing is on hold . A capital murder conviction had meant a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling said judges must consider the unique circumstances of each juvenile offender.. The court this year made the ruling retroactive to those sentenced prior to 2012. Moore was 17 at the time of the crime. He didn't shoot Temple, but his gun was used. He and at least two others were driving around that evening looking for someone to rob. \nProsecutors say they followed Temple's vehicle, a Mercedes, to her boyfriend's house in Belhaven. Once she got out her car and went to the curb to retrieve her boyfriend's garbage can, two of the individuals tried to take her purse . She resisted and one of them shot her. Prosecutors believe Moore stayed in the car and was the getaway driver, although he provided the weapon. \nIn court filings, Assistant District Attorney Randy Harris said, \"The cumulative resume of Gerome Moore qualifies him for that exact sentence of life without parole.\" \nHarris said Moore's unwillingness to abide by the decent standards of society and to abide by the criminal laws began long Temple's shooting. In addition to the Facebook post, by the time Moore was 17, he would tell investigators he never went riding without his gun, according to Harris. \nHarris also talked about other crimes Moore was involved in as well as escaping from the Hinds County Detention Center after his arrest. He was later recaptured. \n\"Truth is that Moore was two months shy of attaining 18 years of age when this capital murder was perpetrated,\" Harris said. \"Had the crime happened merely two months later, this discussion of the propriety of life without parole would not even be taking place as there would be no argument that without parole was an appropriate and legislatively approved sentence.\" \nMoore's attorney, Aafram Sellers, argues his client shouldn't receive a sentence of life without parole. \n\"Clearly, a child who did not actually kill or intend to kill anyone will not be among the uncommon and rare juvenile homicide offenders who might permissibly receive the state's harshest prison sentence,\" Sellers said. \nSellers said punishment of life in prison without parole would be disproportionate to the sentence of the shooter in the case, Antwain Dukes, who received a sentence of 25 years to serve. \nIn July, Dukes pleaded guilty to depraved-heart murder in Temple's death. He was given a 25-year sentence. He also pleaded guilty to armed robbery and house burglary in separate cases. He was given a total of 70 years in the three cases, but they will be served concurrently, meaning the maximum time he will serve is 25 years. Dukes also agreed to testify against his co-defendants. \nA third suspect in the Temple case, Antreal Jones, is awaiting trial. \nContact Jimmie E.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Previous Next \nIt’s something that impacts almost everything you see on social media, but you probably don’t even know it’s happening. \nIt’s called the “echo chamber effect” – and it influences the types of posts and ads that show up in your Facebook based on what you're already clicking on. \nStudents in Kristy Sheeler’s class at IUPUI have been learning about the phenomenon and how powerful it can be. \n“There are these sophisticated algorithms out there that know what you like, what you click on, what you shop for. And as a result, your news feed is adjusted accordingly,” said Sheeler. \nSo what does it look like? Well, the Wall Street Journal has an interactive tool that shows you what red and blue news feeds look like. And depending on what you follow and click – it will continue to show you that same type of content instead of other views and opinions. \n“It causes us to dig in, it causes us to assume that our opinion is right,” said Sheeler. “If we surround ourselves with opinions and narratives that support our point of view, it’s going to further polarize us.” \nAccording to Pew Research, 61 percent of millennials use Facebook as their primary source of news about politics and government, which makes this kind of advertising a problem. \nSo what are some tips to help you “break out” of the echo chamber? Adjust your news feed preferences – select a wider variety of content Follow well-rounded people and organizations Fact Check \nWith so many fake news stories taking over our Facebook feeds, the best thing you can do is to learn what’s real and what’s not. To do this, you can use sites like Snopes.com , Politifact.com or FactCheck.org . Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

In future, terrorism will evolve into cyber terrorism and there also might be cyber wars between nations,\" Southern Zone IG S Murugan said.\n\"In the digital world nothing is deletable. Once we insert the details they can't be deleted. So women should not use their pictures for profiles in Facebook as it is being misused (by some) nowadays,\" he said, adding, 'unlawful acts' using electronic devices were on the rise. Speaking at a seminar in the St.Xaviers College, Palayamkottai here titled \"Cyber Crimes and Social Media Issues,\" Murugan said having fake IDs and hacking of websites among others were \"punishable offences.\" He noted that modern day youth were 'addicted' to social media like Facebook and Whatsapp.",
