      "text": "VIDEO: Neil Patrick Harris Talks Netflix's 'Series of Unfortunate Events' on THE VIEW November 30 Scoop: THE VIEW on ABC - Monday, November 7, 2016 November 04, 2016 \nOn this week's THE VIEW on ABC, actor Neil Patrick Harris gave the co-hosts a glimpse at his role in Netflix's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events.' He also revealed that The Red Organization benefiting AIDS research has joined forces with Omaze and Coca-Cola to give lucky fans the opportunity to win a night out on the town with NPH and David Burt ka. Go to Omaze.com/NPH to learn more. Watch the appearance below! Based on the internationally best-selling series of books, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events chronicles the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents' untimely death in a fire. A careless oversight initially places the children in the custody of a distant relative named Count Olaf, a mysterious and devious figure who is seeking fortune by way of stealing their inheritance. After his elaborate plans are foiled and his evil intentions are revealed, Count Olaf ( Neil Patrick Harris ) employs a variety of outlandish disguises to situate himself in the children's path, causing mayhem for the Baudelaire's and their subsequent guardians. As the children manage to evade Count Olaf's scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they pick up clues along the way about their parents' past. The series is created by Daniel Handler (author of the Lemony Snicket series of books) and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld (Pushing Daisies, Men in Black, The Addams Family). Along with Harris, the series also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Malina Weissman (Violet), Louis Hynes (Klaus), Presley Smith (Sunny), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O'Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe), Aasif Maandvi (Uncle Monty), Don Johnson (Sir) and more. The series premieres January 13, 2017 on Netflix around the world.",

      "text": "| Product News \nNetflix has long offered a huge library of movies and TV shows, but there’s always been one small problem: you needed an active Internet connection on your iPhone or iPad to actually watch the stuff. Well, today that finally changes . Netflix now supports offline viewing via its iOS and Android apps. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nTo use the feature, you’ll need to grab the latest version of the Netflix app for iOS and be subscribed to any of the company’s streaming video plans . Once you’re updated and logged in, you’ll see a new “Download” button on select shows. \nYou may have noticed the word “select” in the previous sentence, and that’s the unfortunate part of today’s announcement. Only certain TV shows and movies currently support offline viewing, although Netflix promises to make more content available over time. \nThe ability to download Netflix content for offline viewing makes the service much more attractive for users on the go. Not only will you be able to binge on the latest episodes of Orange is the New Black or Stranger Things while camping or flying, but those with mobile bandwidth caps can queue up their shows via Wi-Fi at home before heading out the door. It also counters recent offline viewing moves from competing video streaming services like Amazon . Share this:",

      "text": "Netflix is finally letting you watch shows offline \nWelcome to the party, guys. By Corinne Iozzio   12:44pm \nCorinne Iozzio \nYou can now download select TV shows and classic movies to watch offline, which means easy binge-watching on the subway or in flight. \nAs of today an update to the Netflix app on iOS and Android allows subscribers to download movies and shows, so they won’t be bereft of Stranger Things when they leave the comfort of their home Wi-Fi networks. \nNetflix isn’t the first streaming service to allow for downloadable content (Amazon Instant Video rolled out offline viewing to Prime subscribers last September), and they certainly won’t be the last. \nFor the time being, only a select number of titles are available. Most Netflix Originals, including The Crown and Narcos , are available, as are many titles for which Netflix owns licenses. \nThough incomplete, the selection will probably outstrip what’s available on even the best airline in-flight entertainment offerings; it features cinematic crowd-pleasers like Jaws and Amelie as well as mainstay TV series like Breaking Bad and Parks & Recreation . \nAnd, predictably, Netflix says more titles are “on the way.” \nSubscribers can find downloadable content one of two ways. The app menu features an “Available for Download” sorting option, or by stumbling on a download icon (a downward-facing arrow) in a movie or show’s details page. \nViewers also have control over how and when downloads can occur. By default, they’ll only happen over Wi-Fi, but you can opt to switch to cellular data (only do this if you’re really desperate; it’ll eat through your data in a heartbeat). \nYou can also choose between what Netflix is calling “standard” and “higher” quality videos, but the company doesn’t specify what either means in terms of actual video specs. What we do know is that “standard” eats up less storage and downloads more quickly, and the opposite is true for “higher” quality. Access these settings by scrolling all the way to bottom of the app’s pull-down menu and tapping “App Settings.” \nThe addition of offline viewing is a bit of a reversal for Netflix. Two years ago, the company’s director of corporate communications and technology, Cliff Edwards, told TechRadar offline viewing was “never going to happen.” But competitors rolling out the feature, in addition to third-party workarounds, may have pushed its back against the wall. \nIn addition to Amazon Instant Video, PlayOn Cloud allows DVR-like recording of streaming video services, including Netflix, Hulu, and HBOGo through its iOS app. And TiVo users (yes, those still exist) can transfer recordings to their mobile devices through the TiVo app to watch on the go. \nThe push for offline viewing capability comes at an interesting moment for mobile Wi-Fi. As cellular carriers ready for the eventual switch to 5G towers, demand for connectivity is forcing more providers to explore Wi-Fi-based options. \nGoogle’s experimental Project Fi network , for one, relies heavily on a vast network of trusted hotspots. Meanwhile, commuter networks—be they underground or in the air—continue to promise faster, more-reliable speeds. GoGo, the provider who owns the majority of in-flight Wi-Fi, recently announced upgrades to its network to help speed downloads and uploads. \nStill, the more users start downloading episodes of Breaking Bad with reckless abandon on these public-access hotspots, the harder it will become to grab what you want when you want it. That’s why some mainstay streaming services, specifically Hulu, will stay online-only for now. \nFrom a functionality point-of view, the end-game for offline viewing is all about persevering mobile bandwidth. The more crowded networks get, the more painfully sluggish streaming and downloading become—that is, if they don’t grind to a complete halt. The ability to download a movie or TV show over Wi-Fi before leaving home, Hulu’s head of experience Ben Smith told CIO insider , is the key to avoiding bandwidth bog-down. “I actually think offline is more interesting in relation to bandwidth, and how people consume bandwidth,” he said.

Reports indicate the first downloadable programs will include \"Orange is the New Black\" and \"The Crown,\" but \"House of Cards\" is expected to be available for the new feature when Season 5 comes out early next year. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8",

      "text": "Who Wins In A La Carte TV, Besides Netflix? Who Loses, Besides Disney? Nov. 30, 2016 2:47 PM ET | Summary \nESPN is still showing signs of growing strain. \nOnly three of eleven content companies lose in an a la carte system, and Disney's losses are by far the largest. \nIf the bundle does collapse, those channels most underpaid by the current system will see the biggest bounce in an a la carte world. \nCBS is a clear favorite. Introduction Anyone who has read my work lately knows that I have been increasingly bearish on ESPN and the traditional cable bundle, and thus by extension on Disney (NYSE: DIS ) as a whole since ESPN is the largest share of its earnings. Disney says ESPN's subscriber losses are slowing, down to 2M in FY2016 from 3M the year before, and 4M the year before that. But that does not include Disney's massive loss in October subscribers, so losses may be accelerating again. I will not rehash the old debate again, at least not today. I say Disney is in trouble, others say it's doing fine. But if I'm right, how play the long side of this equation? Crockett's Charge Four years ago, I came across this Deadline article concerning the economic value of the various major content companies in American Pay-TV. I am well aware a lot has changed in the last four years. I don't offer the article as a perfect snapshot of today's market. Nevertheless, while its specific numbers are probably long out of date, there is still something valuable we can take away from it. The article itself was merely a summary of work done by analyst Barton Crockett. Crockett had just done a major survey of pay-TV customers to find out how much they valued the various channels in the cable bundle. Nothing special there, there have been literally hundreds of such surveys, both before and after Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) came along. The interesting thing about Crockett's work was what he did next. Most surveys stopped there. How much do you like each channel and what would you be willing to pay for it? Crockett went further and asked two additional questions. First, he asked, in the existing bundle system, what channels absence would cause you to cancel your whole Pay-TV service? That is, how much would the absence of each channel reduce total bundle membership? From this he extrapolated a brand value for each channel, and by grouping channels by owner he extrapolated one for each content company. Second, he also asked those channels themselves how much affiliate fees they got from the existing bundle system. And finally, he divided the existing Pay-TV cash flows by the \"loyalty share\" of each content company to calculate whether they were overpaid or underpaid by the existing system. He excluded premium channels since, as add-ons, they were already in a sort of ala carte system. Better Off Alone The results were more than a little astonishing. It quickly became clear that Crockett's most important takeaway was not the specifics of exactly how well or poorly each company would do if the bundle went away. The most important finding was the imbalance between winners and losers in the current system. In surveying consumers about their desire to pay for the various pieces of eleven major content companies, he found only three companies which would lose out in an ala carte system: Disney was the big one, as we would all expect. TimeWarner (NYSE: TWX ) and 20th Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) were also on the short end, although their losses were projected to be less than half of what Disney's were. The other eight companies all achieved various degrees of benefit under an ala carte system. Viacom's (NASDAQ: VIAB ) (NYSE: VIA ) benefit was the smallest, as it only barely broke above even. But even that is rather significant. Viacom is one of the purest cable channel plays out there, a company one would expect to have a lot invested in the success of the existing bundle. And yet since it lacks both a broadcasting powerhouse and sports content - unlike Disney - it has been forced to accept so many sub-par payment deals that it is now more or less indifferent to the bundle's fate. Meanwhile other, more focused cable companies like A+E Networks, Discovery Communications (NASDAQ: DISCA ) and Scripps Networks (NYSE: SNI ) all fare substantially better under an ala carte system. Crockett's numbers four years ago actually showed that their earnings could increase as much as 150%! Nor was that the biggest number. CBS (NYSE: CBS ) was the biggest winner of all even before counting whatever gains Showtime might get, with the non-premium company segment alone projected to raise earnings 400%! AMC Networks (NASDAQ: AMCX ) had to settle for a meager 80% boost. Even NBCUniversal was projected to gain 66%. Of course, being owned by Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) might cause some issues with getting NBCUniversal execs on board with ala carte - in fact that was one of the reasons consumer groups cited to try to block the merger - but so far Comcast has played nice with Internet based TV groups, as its consent order from the FCC requires it to. How Dated Is This? Sadly, no one else has done a similar survey since, at least as far as I can tell. Various companies do run quarterly surveys of consumer willingness to purchase various channels ala carte. But as I have pointed out before, those surveys often distort results by failing to incorporate into their questions the pricing differentials between the various channels. Lining up ESPN and A+E and simply asking which one consumers prefer is a somewhat slanted question, since one would cost $15 or more a month in an ala carte system and the other would cost only $1. Crockett's work actually incorporated pricing differentials. There is also at least some evidence that Crockett's work might not be so out of date. AT&T (NYSE: T ) just recently launched their new DIRECTV Now service, a new digital TV service offering a traditional linear package of TV channels. The service is one of if not the most comprehensive available, with almost every major content provider included. CBS, however, is reportedly the only network to refuse to join, suggesting that it still thinks it is uniquely disadvantaged by the traditional bundle scheme relative to its content's value. Like Viacom, CBS doesn't really have a sports-focused cable channel, although its flagship broadcast channel does show a lot of sports including the NFL and the NCAA. Nevertheless, they seem to feel that their content is being underpaid to prop up ESPN's expensive sports contracts - and Crockett's work suggests that they're right. I have researched over the past few days the earnings reports of the other content companies. While some do show real growth, not a single one shows the kind of explosive earnings growth to suggest that the gross disparities Crockett identified in their compensation has been addressed in any substantial part. For CBS, for example, the biggest victim of the current system, even now advertising remains the single biggest revenue category for the whole company. That is followed by syndication and distribution. Subscription fees are the smallest category, compared to ESPN where subscription fees are 80% of revenue. Perhaps this is why CBS has been the first to launch an independent streaming service, CBS All Access, to monetize this content more effectively. It thinks it can get a better deal without having to carry ESPN. I wouldn't be surprised if Crockett's numbers are more or less accurate still today. Conclusion Despite the somewhat dated data, I believe Crockett's work might still be the best guide available to how to play the long side of the cable bundle's demise. CBS is a clear favorite here, with maybe Discovery and Scripps as other candidates although they have less than half the upside of CBS according to Crockett. I would not invest in Comcast, as I expect that the boost to NBCUniversal will be more than offset by the hit to its core cable business.

      "text": "Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nYou can almost feel the internet suddenly slowing down \nIt’s finally happened: you can now download TV shows and movies from Netflix to your mobile device. Of course, there’s a catch: not everything Netflix offers is available for download. But a lot of stuff we love is, like Stranger Things, House of Cards, The Crown and Orange is the New Black. \nYou’ll note those are all Netflix originals, but many movies are also available for you to enjoy while offline, which is something that Netflix has said it would never do in the past. So why the change? In a word: competition, especially from Amazon Instant Video, which has allowed downloading for a while now. \nYou’ll need to update your Netflix app and once you do, you can tell a show or movie is savable if it has a little arrow at the bottom of the screen, and Netflix says that yes, more and more content will be downloadable as time goes on. Thanks, Reed! \nGoPro sharpens its focus in bid to stay afloat \nThe tough times continue over at actioncam icon GoPro, with news now that 200 jobs are about to vanish, the company’s entertainment division is about to close and the company’s president, Tony Bates, is on his way out. \nIt’s been tough sledding recently for GoPro as competitors make inroads with competing cameras and a massive recall of their Karma drone, which was supposed to be a breakout new product for the company. There’s still no word on when or if the Karma will fly again, but GoPro did say that sales of their new camera, the Hero 5, are up 35 percent heading into the holidays, so some good news there at least. \nGoPro’s “entertainment” division was essentially a system that paid content creators for their video efforts, and it paid out about a million dollars over the last year. But, no more. Here’s hoping 2017 flies a little higher for the company. \nWe need a blocking program for it called Skipper… or maybe Ginger \nAndroid smartphone users have a new malware threat to deal with, called Gooligan. Security experts at Check Point say the malware is typically hidden in third-party apps that have the ability to root a user’s phone and send user data to a remote server. \nOnce infected, the phone becomes a platform for a fraudulent ad campaign, and those responsible do have access to everything on the phone, including google Docs and so on. We’ve got more details on the malware and how to avoid it, so hit the link below for more information. ",

Or that Metro commute to work.\nThe new feature, which was announced on Netflix's company blog and Twitter Wednesday morning , is mobile-friendly, too --even for you Android users.\nMany Netflix Original series are already available to download, a statement on the Netflix website says, including “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos,” “House of Cards,” “Stranger Things,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “Master of None” and “The Crown.” There are also a few non-Netflix shows you can watch offline, like “The Office,” “The Flash” and the animated movie “Minions,” according to Variety .\nThe Netflix app just has to be updated to start downloading, and that’s it.\nPeople react to Netflix and download.",

      "text": "Netflix finally did it.\nOn Tuesday, the beloved streaming service debuted the feature we've all been waiting years for. Subscribers can now download certain movies and TV shows to watch later, without an internet connection.\nWhile binge-watchers everywhere are celebrating this game-changing opportunity to view Westworld on a flight to Cuba or while walking the dog, there are still some features Netflix is missing.\nSEE ALSO: Netflix finally gives us the feature we've been waiting for\nHere are some suggestions on the features Netflix can roll out to make our streaming experiences even more enjoyable, because it's 2016 and streaming is life.\nThe ability to see what your friends are watching, like on Spotify\nImage: screengrab/spotify\nWondering what to watch next?\nThe ability to see what people you \"follow\" are watching would make that decision a no-brainer. Though Netflix offers recommendations based on shows or movies you previously viewed, being able to confer with a trusted acquaintance who has both seen the show and knows you personally would be super helpful.\nThe friend's activity feed has the potential to spark discussions, connections and even debates between followers. It will also serve as a fun way to keep track of which episode of a show your friend is on and compare who's binge-watching more successfully.\nAlso, as we've learned from the Spotify feature, it's also just insightful to see what your friends are into this week.\nA native way to watch with other people at the same time\nWe're dying for a simple to way to host long-distance Netflix and chill sessions. Imagine how amazing it would be if Netflix made it possible to share your screen with others. You could watch a movie at the same time while in different locations and not have to coordinate the bathroom break pauses by talking. Just hit pause. Ah, the possibilities.\nEasy access to hidden categories\nCodes to several Netflix hidden categories.\nImage: screengrab/mashable\nNetflix has a bunch of hidden categories , but to be honest they're kind of a pain to find. Though some specific categories relevant to your viewer history show up on your home page, you're missing out on so much.\nAnyone can access the many hidden categories by typing specific URLs into a browser, but when watching on a television things can get tricky. Netflix needs to provide a more efficient way to browse its hidden categories — some of which don't even appear when typed into the search bar. How about giving us access to a tab with the master list so we can easily filter things like \"Steamy Romantic Movies, \"Supernatural Thrillers\" and \"Korean TV shows.\" Being hidden is overrated.\nThe ability to make more than one customizable list, and share\nNetflix's very limiting \"My List\" option.\nImage: screengrab/netflix\nRight now, Netflix gives us the ability to add items to a \"List\" to keep track of favorites or things we're planning to watch in the future, but we need more options. Like Spotify Playlists, it would be ideal if Netflix allowed users to create more than one list, label them and share them with others.\nA way to password protect your individual profile Sure, you share your Netflix password with loved ones, but you might not want to share your viewing history. Wouldn't it be extremely convenient if there were a way to hide what you watch from the people you share your account with? The option to password protect profiles within a single account would keep your viewing history private from nosy roommates while ensuring no one messes with your carefully constructed queue.\nThe option to create customizable \"Are you still watching?\" screens\nThe dreaded \"Are you still watching\" screen.\nImage: FLICKR, CHRISSY MARIE\nThanks to a handy Chrome extension , it's possible to disable one of Netflix's most irritating (and subtly judgmental) features: the continue watching button. Although the annoying message kills our binge-watching vibe, it might be nice to have the ability to create custom, personalized reminders.\nFor example, to make sure you're well taken care of during your Netflix binge, it'd be helpful to be able to program a custom \"Look outside\" reminder or a \"Don't forget to eat\" reminder that would appear after every four episodes.\nThe ability to hide things from reappearing in suggestions\nWhat we really want.\nImage: Mashable composite: screengrab/netflix\nAre you sick of Netflix suggesting to you watch Failure to Launch ? Same. There needs to be a feature that allows you to hide unwanted films or TV shows from the library. Netflix offers a \"More Like This\" feature that allows you to see similar films, but we also want a \"Less Like This\" option that will rid our feeds of similar films we have no interest in.\nA wider selection of movies and TV shows that don't disappear Wondering whether or not your favorite Netflix items will be removed at the start of every month is extremely stressful. A recent study found that the site only offers around 30 of IMDB's top 250 movies... so in addition to drastically expanding its library, we'd appreciate it if Netflix didn't chop our existing options every month.\nThanks for making one helpful change, Netflix, we look forward to future innovations.\nBONUS: This is what happens when you binge-watch Black Mirror",

      "text": "What to Download on Netflix From Gossip Girl to Stranger Things . Twitter ©CW Network/Courtesy Everett Collection \nYou asked for it and Netflix answered: you can now download movies to watch offline. As in, without an internet connection. As in, on an airplane. The future is here. The future is now. The future is glorious. \nBest of all, there are a ton of movies and TV shows to choose from on the streaming platform's app. From Netflix originals (hi, Stranger Things !) to the films you know you watch time and time again, there are so many options to pick from, you may not know where to start. Allow us to help. We sifted through the app and found 20 picks that never get old. The only drawback? Checking to see if you have enough data available on your phone. (Maybe ask for an upgrade this holiday season?) Love Actually Yep, just in time for the holiday season, you can now get the snot kicked out of you by love with the ultimate ensemble movie. Gossip Girl While you're waiting for the reboot, watch the show from the beginning. (As if you needed us to tell you twice.) Orange is the New Black One of Netflix's first original shows is still one of its best — if you're not over the way the last season ended, watch the show from the first episode. Blue is the Warmest Color This French film about young love is so poignant and powerful. If you haven't seen it yet, you have no excuse now. 30 Rock Because it's only Wednesday, Lemon — and if you ever feel like your job is driving you nuts, this will be a welcome reminder. Parks and Recreation Of course, we can't talk about 30 Rock without mentioning Parks and Rec . Treat yo'self. Bring It On Raise your hand if you still know all the cheers. Yep, we do, too. The Wedding Planner Few rom-coms will ever touch the Jennifer Lopez cannon. Sorry, this is just fact. The Nanny Diaries This movie is for anyone who has ever so much as babysat once. Oh, and like, Chris Evans, h . The Get Down This series, which chronicles the birth of hip-hop in the Bronx is the kind of technicolor musical only Baz Luhrmann can deliver. Stranger Things We don't need to tell you about Stranger Things . We know you're already obsessed. The Crown This is for anyone who wants to bond with their mom over a period piece in which the actors just passive-aggressively stare at each other for minutes at a time.

      "text": "‘Masters of Sex’ season 5: Is it possible for canceled Showtime series to end up on Netflix, somewhere else?   \nEarlier today, Showtime made a decision that was sad, but also not entirely surprising: They canceled “ Masters of Sex ” after four seasons on the air, ending the show with the characters of Bill Masters (Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (Lizzy Caplan) being married. \nNow that this has transpired, is it time to start looking elsewhere to see if someone else will pick up the show? If you look at places like a Hulu, an Amazon, or a Netflix, they’ve been keepers of many prestige series as of late; in particular, Netflix is now known for reviving shows like “ Gilmore Girls ” and “Arrested Development” to great acclaim. \nHowever, it may be a little bit different in the case of this show. While popular, we don’t get the sense that the cult following is here en masse like it was with the two shows we just mentioned; also, the most-recent ratings for season 4 were far from stellar. They averaged in total around 450,000 viewers in live+same day airings, which was a drop in almost 24% from the third season. While we know that there are many more people who watch the show via DVR or streaming apps / on-demand services, this is a jumping-off point for ratings discussions and it’s far from a good one. This is a show that needs a strong footprint to convince another provider to give it a show. \nAlso, unfortunately it’s fallen off the map insofar as awards consideration goes, given that it didn’t receive much recognition for a polarizing third season and we don’t expect much to change for season 4, either. This is the sort of thing that can attract network suitors even to a low-rated show, since they view awards consideration as a way to build up a little bit more of a stronger footprint. \nIs there still hope? Absolutely, since far crazier things have happened than a show of this quality getting picked up for a new home! If Sony Pictures TV is interested in looking at other avenues, maybe Netflix and Hulu in particular are strong possibilities. We don’t see another network picking it up on TV, especially given the limitations that its content would provide to many of them (i.e. the racy scenes would need to be toned down anywhere but an HBO, a Cinemax, or a Starz). As for Amazon, they’ve claimed in the past that they are only interested in developing new properties as opposed to picking up existing ones. \nThe best thing that you can do is tweet to various providers, write on their Facebook pages, and let them know via customer service that you’re interested in picking up the show. While sometimes this falls on deaf ears, a large enough movement can inspire some change. \nFor all of you who try, best of luck — we’ll see what happens. (Photo: Showtime.)",

But the company said it will add many more titles in the future. \nAmong the content you can download right now to watch later are hit shows Orange is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown. \nThe new feature is included in all plans at no extra cost and available for phones and tablets on Android and ioS.",

      "text": "Reddit \nNetflix has finally introduced its long-rumored offline viewing option, and it is available to more users than pessimistic rumors had initially suggested. There are some limitations to the feature — you have to use an iOS or Android mobile device, for example — but it’s still a pretty great option, and one that’s straight-forward to use. Assuming you have an iPhone, iPad, or Android mobile device, here’s how to download Netflix movies for offline viewing. \nFirst things first, you’ll need to make sure you’re running the latest version of the Netflix app. The easiest way to do that is to head into your respective app store and check whether there’s an update listed as available for the app. If there is, tap to download it and wait for the update to finish. \nOnce that’s out of the way, fire up the Netflix app. Log in if necessary. You’ll be presented with a big white display that announces the new feature — it’ll look like the one below: \nDon’t tap out of this window too quickly — it has a shortcut link that takes you directly to all the content available for offline downloads. Tap “Find something to download” and it’ll take you to a personalized video library full of things you can watch offline. Though not all Netflix content can be downloaded, quite a bit can be, as shown by the following screenshots: \nTap on any of these shows, and you’ll see a new special button — the download button, which is a simple arrow pointing toward the ground. The first time you open a downloadable show, Netflix will highlight the button so you know the option’s available. \nYou can access your downloaded content at any time by opening the Netflix menu in the app and scrolling down to where it says “My Downloads.” Tapping that menu option will show you whatever videos you have downloaded, and also offers a link that takes you to all the content with offline viewing support.

      "text": "Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an Internet connection. Notably missing from the download menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an Internet connection to watch on Netflix. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where Internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. The change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive Internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. The offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an Internet connection.",

      "text": "Dan Verderosa , 11/30/2016 \nEver wonder how Netflix knows what movies you like or how Pandora can turn you on to a band you’ve never heard of? It’s all based on recommendation algorithms: computer codes that analyze what you watch, listen to or buy and recommend something new that you might enjoy. MegsRadio was officially launched during Porch Fest in September 2016. (Photo courtesy of MegsRadio) \nThanks to a new grant from the National Science Foundation , Ithaca College Associate Professor of Computer Science Doug Turnbull is working to make those algorithms better and cheaper to make, so that more people can take advantage of the technology. \nThe grant, which totals $500,000, will be split between Turnbull and researchers at Cornell University. Turnbull and his students will work on their music app MegsRadio.fm , which uses a recommendation algorithm to suggest local musicians to listeners. The data provided from the app will be used by researchers at Cornell to test more effective algorithms. \nRisky business Testing changes to an algorithm can be a risky and expensive proposition, according to Turnbull. “Recommender systems are slow to evolve because every tweak to the system involves getting new users to try it out, and there’s a risk there,” he says. \nFor example, Amazon uses an algorithm to recommend items for shoppers to purchase. When it tests changes to its algorithm, the company could lose money if those changes result in lower sales. But if Amazon could test its algorithm against already existing data, it could reduce that risk. \nIt’s called “counterfactual learning,” and that’s what Turnbull and his colleagues at Cornell are studying. In short, counterfactual learning tests algorithms using already existing data on previous users’ choices. That way, the algorithm isn’t tested on actual live users. \nBut that process isn’t easy, since the existing data can’t match up perfectly with the new algorithm. Under the grant, researchers are working on ways to align the two, so that the data bears accurate results when used to test new algorithms. \nIt’s All About the Data Studying counterfactual learning requires existing data from recommender algorithms. However, that data is valuable and companies like Amazon or Google won’t just hand it over to anyone who asks. That’s where MegsRadio comes in. Associate Professor Doug Turnbull \n“Our role in this is to build the MegsRadio system to generate the kinds of data that we would need for this kind of learning and to interact and try to improve the playlist algorithms,” said Turnbull. \nTurnbull and his students built MegsRadio using a prior grant from the NSF. It officially launched this past September. The app functions like Pandora, except that it recommends music from artists from in and around Ithaca that users might enjoy. It does that using a music recommendation algorithm that analyzes music waveforms, social data, listening history and user preferences. \nThe data produced by MegsRadio is sent to Cornell, where researchers use it to experiment with counterfactual learning and test tweaks to the recommender algorithm. They then send the new algorithm back to Turnbull to improve the quality of the listening experience on MegsRadio. \nIn the course of that back-and-forth between IC and Cornell, researchers hope to enhance the quality of counterfactual-based testing. That could pay dividends for existing and new companies interested in recommender algorithms, as they could test changes without the associated risks and costs. \nUsers, of course, stand to benefit in the form of more useful search engine results and better movie and music recommendations. \nTurnbull also points towards economic benefits for the City of Ithaca. MegsRadio not only recommends local artists, it also tells users when and where those artists are performing. As MegsRadio gains users it could help drive people to bars and music venues, supporting local business owners and bolstering the local economy. \nExperiential Learning For Ithaca College students studying computer science, the MegsRadio project has been invaluable. \nA team of 10 students are involved in developing the app and doing outreach in the community. Turnbull acts as a manager, letting students do the bulk of the work. \n“In terms of how we approach and solve problems, it’s student-driven,” said Luke Waldner ’17, a computer science major who works on the project. “That’s really valuable especially for getting jobs in the industry because we have actual experience working with a team and doing actual problem-solving and self-motivated research.” \nMariah Flaim ’16, who helped build the MegsRadio iOS app as a student, says her experience helped her land job interviews after graduation. She now works as a technical consultant at the software company Red Hat. Flaim, like several other graduates, still helps work on MegsRadio. \n“I love the team and I am passionate about the project,” she says. “I really believe that the apps will go places.”",

      "title": "How to Download Netflix Shows & Movies to iPhone",
      "text": "Recently, Netflix announced the most exciting feature update since that streaming service first arrived. Anyone can download Netflix shows and movies to their iPhone or Android device without paying anything extra.\nAdvertisement\nSince its early days as a DVD delivery service, Netflix has wanted to change the way that people consume television shows and movies. At first, it was about letting users choose from an online queue and get their movies with as little effort as possible. The company changed the nature of television by letting users watch entire seasons of their favorite shows from any phone, tablet or television set.\nRead: 13 Common Netflix Problems & Fixes\nThrough the years, Netflix has made changes to streams. The one thing that it never changed was its requirement that you be online to take advantage of the service. With the new ability to download Netflix content, everyone can enjoy their favorite programming whenever they want, wherever they want.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s how to download Netflix shows and movies to your iPhone or Android device with the new feature.\nAdvertisement\nWhat You Need to Know Before You Try to Download Netflix Shows & Movies Before you get started, there are some things that you’ll need. First, turn on your iPhone, iPad or Android device and head to its App Store. Check for app updates to make sure that you have the latest version available. To download Netflix shows and movies, you need the version of the app that launched following the November 30th announcement or later.\nOf course, this being Netflix, you’ll also need a valid Netflix subscription. If you don’t have a Netflix subscription of your own, you’ll need to borrow a friend’s credentials or sign up for the service. Netflix starts at $9.99 a month for high-definition content and streaming for two people.\nNetflix isn’t using downloads as a way to get more money out of users. Both the entry-level $9.99 a month plan and the $11.99 a month plan support downloads.\nAdvertisement\nLastly, you’ll want to have access to a Wi-Fi network, if you don’t want the download to count against the data package on your phone.\nDownloading Netflix Shows & Movies to iPhone With the latest version of Netflix installed on your iPhone, go to the home screen to open the app.\nIf you’re asked to provide a profile, go ahead and choose the one you’d normally use. Note that if you use the app frequently, you may not be asked to choose a profile; the app already has one assigned to you.\nNow you should be at the home screen. You can stream any Netflix show or movie that you see here, but it may not always be available for download. That’s because Netflix had to work with the people who make shows and movies to enable the feature on their content. Not all shows or movies can be stored on your iPhone. Luckily, Netflix has also introduced a hub for browsing just the content that’s downloadable. Tap the menu icon in the top-left of the app.\nAdvertisement\nNow select Available for Download .\nChoose the show that you’d like to download.\nAdvertisement\nNow tap the download button to the right of each episode preview. Note that movies will have the download button just below the preview image.\nOnce you’ve begun a download, a blue progress bar should appear at the bottom of the app. Tap or click on it to see all the episodes you have saved in the My Downloads area.\nIf you go back to the menu and choose App Settings , you get a breakdown of how much storage your device has available for streaming, and an option to enable downloads over your mobile data connection. You can also switch the quality of video content from Standard to Higher Quality. Higher Quality content will consume more of your device’s storage, but look better on the iPhone’s Retina display.\nThat’s all there is to it. Note that downloading Netflix shows and movies on Android smartphones and tablets should work the same way. The two apps are similarly designed. Unfortunately, users of other devices are out of luck. Netflix for Windows doesn’t yet offer downloads for Netflix shows and movies. Updates for that app usually come months after updates for iPhone and Android. As such, there’s still hope.\nVideo game consoles and set top boxes don’t have the feature either. That’s because those devices aren’t meant to act as travel companions anyway. What’s more, they’re expected to be constantly connected to a wireless network.\nRead: 15 Netflix Tips & Tricks\nDon’t be discouraged if your favorite show or movie isn’t available for download just yet. The Netflix catalog is always evolving and getting refreshed. At some point soon, Netflix might get the right deals in place to make downloads of that show possible.",

(Reuters) Digital streaming service Netflix will now allow its users to download some of its shows and films and watch them offline.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Netflix said in a blogpost.\nIt added that now subscribers can click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and watch it later without an Internet connection.\nThe titles available for download currently include The Crown, House of Cards, Sky Latter, Stranger Things, Narcos, Orange is the New Black and Black Mirror.\n“The new feature is included in all plans and is available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS,” Netflix Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu said in the blog.\nNetflix is facing growing competition from services like Amazon .\nThe company, which has 86 million subscribers globally, had launched services in India last January.

In an article from The Huffington Post , Netflix has updated the app to allow you watch your favorite show or movie whenever and wherever you want, without the support of the internet.\nAll you have to do is download the latest version of the Netflix app. The new version will allow you to download shows and movies so you won’t need the internet to watch it. So if you’re traveling on a plane with no internet, or you just don’t want to use any data while on the road, just simply download what you want to watch and be on your way!\nThank you Netflix!\n",

      "text": "0 \nStreaming services on our smartphones have become new \"norm\" when it comes to media consumption in the 21 st century. From movies to music to cable TV, the media world is your burrito for under $10 a month per service. There isn’t much to dislike about streaming services . Well, except for the fact that sometimes you’re confined to only being able to use it when you have an Internet connection, which could prove to be troublesome to the many people who either don’t have unlimited data plans or aren’t always around Wi-Fi. \nBut for one service, that won’t necessarily be an issue anymore. At least, not all the time. Today, Netflix announced that subscribers would be able to download certain shows and movies for offline viewing on smartphones and tablets. \nThe update has already been released, so if you already have Netflix downloaded on your smartphone or tablet but aren’t set to automatically receive updates, you should have an updated queued in your designated app store. \nBy the looks of it, it’s a very limited selection – but we’re not complaining. I can’t necessarily find a rhyme or reason as to which shows are able to be downloaded. After poking around, I came to the conclusion that Netflix originals were off-limits as BoJack Horseman , Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , Black Mirror , and several others were off limits. Additionally, popular TV shows like Bob’s Burgers , Trailer Park Boys , Gilmore Girls , 3 rd Rock From the Sun , Phineas and Ferb , Once Upon a Time , and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia weren’t available either. \nWhat I did find available wasn’t too shabby of a deal for viewing on-the-go – especially for parents with kiddos. I don’t know about you guys, but I’m guilty of keeping the kids quiet on long car rides with a tablet and a favorite TV show or movie, so this feature is like an early Christmas for us. Home , Minions , Hotel Transylvania 2 , The Road to El Dorado , and The Prince of Egypt , and my personal favorite, The Gruffalo , are just a few titles that you can download for offline viewing. Some children’s TV shows like Sid the Science Kid , Barney the Dinosaur , Curious George movies, and LEGO movies are part of the line-up as well. \nTV and movies more tailored towards adults proved difficult to find, at least going by suggestions in my feed. Benchwarmers , White Chicks , Curse of Chucky , and most comedy specials appear on the list, as well as a new favorite of mine for fall and winter, Fireplace 4K: Crackling Birchwood . \nIt’s a good start, though. One true drawback to Netflix’s new feature is that it doesn’t appear that phones with microSD cards have any advantage here, which is what I was really excited about. When you download a show or movie, there are no additional options regarding where to place the media. It automatically downloads to internal storage. \nThere are a couple of good aspects of the service (aside from the obvious aspect that it even happened) worth mentioning. Users have some control over video quality. The default is set to standard, but users can change it to high quality (although it does not explicitly state whether \"high quality\" means 1080p or 720p). Users can also download using cellular data, which is something that Amazon Video, another media streaming service that allows users to download some shows and movies for offline viewing, doesn’t allow. \nAlthough the service is off to a slow start, Netflix has acknowledged that other shows will eventually be available to, such as Orange is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown . \nOverall, it seems like a sweet deal, especially for people who are already subscribed to Netflix as it doesn’t require an additional charge (yet – unless you consider the $2 increase that occurred earlier this year to be in anticipation of this, which it very well might have been). I know I’m happy to have it. Source:",

It’s even harder when it’s a beloved TV show returning after a decade hiatus, and it’s coming back on the biggest streaming service on the planet. There’s just a lot to do, and a lot to consider, so it’s completely understandable if things accidentally slip right through the cracks — like, maybe forgetting to tell the cast of Gilmore Girls that Gilmore Girls is coming back.\nLauren Graham’s brand new book, Talking As Fast As I Can , spills on a lot of behind-the-scenes Gilmore Girls information, from the original show to the revival. She also explains just what it was like waiting for the revival to happen. According to her, it was being discussed between Netflix, Warner Bros. and Amy Sherman-Palladino for a very long time, and the talks just went on and on . While she knew Gilmore Girls was nearing a deal to come back, no one actually told her it was coming back. No one told any of the residents of Stars Hollow.\nHer story starts actually way before that.\n“[After the ATX festival ] I heard the deal was getting close. I heard the deal was falling apart. Scott Patterson went on a podcast and mentioned there were ‘talks,’ which had basically been true since the day the show ended in 2007,” Lauren writs in her book. “A few weeks after the festival I got a call from my agent saying that he’d finally heard Netflix had committed to making eight to ten episodes of our show. Great news! I emailed Amy, who said she’d heard no such thing.” And this continued on for the rest of 2015.\n“Then one day, out of the blue, there was a press release that said Netflix would indeed carry the new episodes — four 90-minute movies. This was exciting, but news to practically everyone. Sean Gunn posted a picture of himself on Twitter next to the announcement on his computer. He looked completely surprised, because he was.” Lauren’s talking about this picture. This is genuine Gilmore Girls shock:\n‼️ pic.twitter.com/ZjORrb7Qef \n— Sean Gunn (@seangunn) October 20, 2015 After the initial shock wore off, everything else began to fall into place (and the rest of the cast was, you know, told they were coming back for Gilmore Girls ).

      "text": "You can now watch Netflix Offline.... Download and watch later Advertisement It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. Netflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. The feature comes free of cost with all Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new \"download\" button. Up until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) Posted: 7:58 a.m. By Brett Molina , USA TODAY Posted: 7:58 a.m. 0 \nNetflix users finally get to hear the two words they have been waiting for: offline mode. \nThe streaming media company confirmed in a tweet that subscribers will get to download their favorite programs instead of just stream through a broadband connection. \n\"Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time,\" reads a tweet, which includes a promotional video touting the feature.

Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nThe feature is available now for download on iOS and Android. Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation says the download feature is available on all plans. \nOn the iOS app, users can visit the menu and discover a section of content \"available for download.\" The selection includes a mix of original programs such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , as well as older movies and TV shows from networks such as Parks and Recreation . More shows and movies will support downloads in the future, says Wu. \nAmazon offers an offline viewing option through its Instant Video service, but it's only available for a select group of movies or TV shows hosted by the service. Streaming services from Epix and Starz also support offline viewing. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .",

      "text": "Netflix is famous for revolutionizing the way people watch movies and television shows. Now, the media company is bringing a whole new development to the content streaming game.\nHow many times have Netflix users wanted to catch up on the latest season of \"Orange is the New Black\" on an airplane, or in their dentist's office's waiting room? Quite often, according to Netflix, which announced on Wednesday that it would allow users to download certain content and take it with them, even to places without easy internet access.\nThis is just the latest development in a long series of cord-cutting measures taken by streaming companies, experts say, but it could be one that inspires content creators and distributors to re-evaluate the industry.\nRecommended: How well do you know your family sitcoms? “This might not be that big of a deal at first, but if Netflix is doing it, then Amazon and Hulu are going to do it,” says Sacramento State University professor Daniel Smith-Rowsey, author of “The Netflix Effect.” “In general, the major studios and Silicon Valley companies are definitely going to be watching this.”\nTest your knowledge How well do you know your family sitcoms? Netflix says that while not all of its content will be downloadable, the new feature will be available to all Android and iOS users on phones and tablets. Users must simply update their Netflix app to to the latest version in order to be able to access the new feature.\nThe streaming company has not yet released a full list of all downloadable movies and shows, although many Netflix originals such as \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos\" are on the current limited list , as are some movies and shows created by other parties.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their \"Stranger Things\" binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection,\" announced Netflix's Director of Product Innovation, Eddy Wu.\nNetflix has been setting the gold standard for the modern content viewing industry for more than a decade.\nIn the beginning, Dr. Smith-Rowsey says, movie studios and Silicon Valley companies were able to scoff at Netflix’s postal DVD delivery service. Now, however, “they’re long past the laughing stage.”\nIn fact, Smith-Rowsey says that today’s announcement could mean that “long tail” economics are not yet dead.\nCoined by Wired writer Chris Anderson in 2004, the “ long tail ” refers to media streaming services that host massive catalogs full of both popular and obscure content. While the top items in any of these streaming sites may be the most viewed by far, the company loses next to nothing if just one or two listeners or viewers reach the uncharted regions of their catalog per month.\nAt the time that Anderson was writing, he reported that approximately one-fifth of all Netflix rentals came from outside the top 3,000 items in its catalog.\nAnd although Netflix has trimmed some of its more obscure movie selections in recent years, this measure could mean that it is still chasing niche users, which has implications for every major Silicon Valley company and the big six Hollywood studios.\nNetflix’s decision to allow users to download content and take it with them wherever they go, he says, is certainly going to force other companies to think differently about their business models.\nOther media experts disagree, however, and say that Wednesday’s announcement is simply one more small step toward cutting the cord.\n“This was predictable,” says Barry Orton, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It is a small and incremental step towards severing the cord and getting rid of time restraints.”",

By: PTI | New York | Updated: November 30, 2016 10:20 PM It added that now subscribers can click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and watch it later without an Internet connection. (Reuters) \nDigital streaming service Netflix will now allow its users to download some of its shows and films and watch them offline. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Netflix said in a blogpost. \nIt added that now subscribers can click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and watch it later without an Internet connection. \nThe titles available for download currently include The Crown, House of Cards, Sky Latter, Stranger Things, Narcos, Orange is the New Black and Black Mirror. \n“The new feature is included in all plans and is available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS,” Netflix Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu said in the blog. \nNetflix is facing growing competition from services like Amazon . \nThe company, which has 86 million subscribers globally, had launched services in India last January. With booming smartphone adoption and falling data prices, on-demand video service market has been growing in the country. \nIndustry watchers are confident of manifold growth in the segment in coming years.

      "text": "The Get Down's Justice Smith is getting up onstage. The actor of the Netflix series has joined the cast of Yen, MCC Theater announced Wednesday, along with Chance actress Stefania LaVie Owen and Ari Graynor. They join the previously announced Manchester by the Sea star Lucas Hedges in the new production. Trip Cullman (Significant Other) will direct Anna Jordan's Bruntwood Prize-winning off-Broadway play. Previews begin Jan. 12 ahead of a Jan. 30 opening at MCC's regular home, the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York. The limited engagement is set to run through Feb. 19. In Yen, Bobbie (Smith) and Hench (Hedges) are home alone. Days are filled by streaming porn, playing video games, watching the world go by. Their mom (Graynor) rarely visits these days, and it's chaos when she does. But when animal-loving neighbor Jenny (Owen) takes an interest in their dog Taliban, the boys discover a world far beyond what they know.",

      "text": ". SAN FRANCISCO \nNetflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. ©2016 by The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Get Down's Justice Smith is getting up onstage.\nThe actor of the Netflix series has joined the cast of Yen, MCC Theater announced Wednesday, along with Chance actress Stefania LaVie Owen and Ari Graynor. They join the previously announced Manchester by the Sea star Lucas Hedges in the new production.\nTrip Cullman (Significant Other) will direct Anna Jordan's Bruntwood Prize-winning off-Broadway play. Previews begin Jan. 12 ahead of a Jan. 30 opening at MCC's regular home, the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York. The limited engagement is set to run through Feb. 19.\nIn Yen, Bobbie (Smith) and Hench (Hedges) are home alone. Days are filled by streaming porn, playing video games, watching the world go by. Their mom (Graynor) rarely visits these days, and it's chaos when she does. But when animal-loving neighbor Jenny (Owen) takes an interest in their dog Taliban, the boys discover a world far beyond what they know.\nRead more: How Baz Luhrmann's Netflix Series 'The Get Down' Painstakingly Re-Created the '70s",

      "text": "Netflix While Netflix’s “ Gilmore Girls ” revival had its flaws, heading back to Stars Hollow, particularly at such a unstable moment in history, felt to me like slipping into a pair of Lorelai’s cozy puppy pajamas.\nI was particularly moved by the last two episodes, in which the show’s creators let the women of each Gilmore generation hit their own emotional bottoms , reinforcing the idea that life, and especially family, necessarily comes with a side of heartbreak, if only the pain of mortality. The loss of Richard ― Emily’s husband of 50 years and Lorelai’s father ― is central to the emotion behind the episodes.\nAnd it wouldn’t be “Gilmore Girls” without fraught parent-child dynamics. The scenes where Emily and Lorelai attempt to begin the process of restoring their shattered mother-daughter relationship in therapy are some of the most devastating, and Rory and Lorelai’s codependent enmeshment again results in an explosive disagreement followed by radio silence.\nBut it’s Lorelai’s attempt to grieve her troubled relationship with her late father Richard that is most affecting.\nI cried my eyes out at least six times during “Summer” and “Fall,” including once just when Melissa McCarthy showed up, but my hardest blubbering came during the scene when Lorelai, after viewing a majestic vista on her thwarted “Wild” trip, calls Emily to finally recount her favorite memory of Richard.\nShe tells a story about being broken up with and teased by a boy at school on her 13th birthday, who calls her weird and loud and questions if she’s even a Gilmore. She flees school in tears and goes to the mall, where she by chance encounters her father, Richard, even though he “never goes to the mall.” When he demands to know why his troublemaking daughter isn’t in school, she simply bursts into tears.\nAnd then, she tells Emily: “I got up enough courage to look up at him. And he was standing there with a pretzel. A giant pretzel, covered with mustard. And he handed it to me and he said, ‘Let’s go.’ And he took me to the movies.”\nThey see “Grease” and “An Unmarried Woman” (which, incidentally, Kelly Bishop was in) and Lorelai tearfully describes it as the “best birthday she ever had.”\nWhen I was a teenager, I confessed a youthful wrongdoing to my mother after weeks of fretting over it. It was something she was going to find out eventually, but I was terrified to tell her. And like Lorelai, I have never forgotten the feeling of relief and acceptance I felt when she greeted my confession with love and comfort instead of reprisal.\nIn some ways, the Lorelai-Rory relationship is the funhouse mirror version of every parents’ fantasy: your child never stops liking you, always wants to hang out with you, never truly leaves the nest. In practice, of course, we don’t really want this fantasy to come true because we know that if we’re doing our jobs right, we’re preparing our children to live without us.\nThe relationship between Lorelai and her parents is more like a parental nightmare ― that you do your best, but drive your child away before they’re ready. That you choose wrongly in a moment you didn’t know was a test, and that they never forget.\nWhen Lorelai came to Emily and Richard as a pregnant teenager, despite the best intentions that most parents have, their reaction, combined with Lorelai’s headstrong nature, fractured that relationship nearly irrevocably.\nBut the beauty of that phone call is that despite the damaged relationship Lorelai had with her father, she also held on to the fierce love of that moment.\nAnd that moment, that memory, is to me what parenting is all about. Because there will come a time when your child will come to you in pain ― maybe over something seemingly silly, maybe in real trouble, maybe having done something you consider to be wrong ― and you will have to choose your reaction.\nSometimes, just sometimes, choose to take them to the movies.\nAlso on HuffPost \"Gilmore Girls\" Baby Products \"Gilmore Girls\" Baby Products 1 of 44 Luke's Onesie, $29.99, Available at Etsy Share this slide:\nEtsy/GiggleTee More: Parenting Grief Television Gilmore Girls Suggest a correction PARENTS 1.47 M 1.07 M 458 ",

We’ve contacted Netflix to find out for sure, and are now trying to write with every single finger crossed.\nPerhaps with hours of back to back episodes we’ll finally learn that middle bit of the full theme tune.\n\nImagine hours and hours of Carlton’s dance, Uncle Phil’s admonishments, and Jeffrey. Oh Jeffrey. Get the snacks in now.\n\nWe are not the only ones who are insanely excited about this.\n@ NetflixUK https://t.co/1OdzokD95M \n— \nJon (@MrDalekJD) November 30, 2016 @ NetflixUK its not unusual to be loved by anyone https://t.co/OIQSKiP4dL \n— \nMini Matt Smith (@MineCartMayhem) November 30, 2016 @ NetflixUK https://t.co/30QH26EmfH \n— \nKirstie Saunders (@AlohaKirstie) November 30, 2016 @ NetflixUK 👏🏻👌👍 https://t.co/P92bNp6uRn \n— \nLaura Louise (@Laura_Louise999) November 30, 2016 Watch this space to see if this is a goer.\nMORE: Will Smith has some bad news for The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air fans \nMORE: MTV play video marathon to Prince, accidentally include a Fresh Prince video ",

      "text": "YES. Now you can download movies and TV from Netflix for offline viewing. And it’s perfect timing since so many people will be traveling for the holidays and will want to keep themselves and their children entertained. All you have to do is update your Netflix app and then you can start downloading so you can continue your binge watching wherever you go.\nThere are time limits for the things you download. There are some shows and movies not available for downloading yet, but Netflix has plans to add more to their list, so don’t worry. But there are definitely high quality things that you can start watching offline now, like Parenthood and Stranger Things.\n",

Maybe you’re headed Southbound 35 for Christmas, unless you have 3G in your car, you can’t watch Netflix.\nYes, it may be a first world problem, but Netflix is handling it with their brand new feature that allows you to download all your favorite shows and movies. All you have to do is update the app in iTunes.\nTold you! Best day EVER!!!\n",

      "title": "Black Mirror on Netflix",
      "text": "3,262 Posts Is anyone else watching Black Mirror on Netflix? It is a British show from 2007 or 2008 and each episode is a standalone. I was surprised that the show is listed as science fiction, but it has slight futuristic themes to it. For fans of Downton abbey, the woman who played lady Sybil is in the second episode and the dude who played her husband is in episode one. Here is a review that doesn't give too much away: http://www.theverge.com/tldr/2014/12/1/7315405/black-mirror-sci-fi-finally-streaming-netflix One of the best science fiction shows around is finally available in the United States. Black Mirror is now streaming on Netflix, and you should absolutely watch it. Created by Charlie Brooker, the British miniseries is like a darker version of The Twilight Zone updated for the anxieties of modern technology. Each episode stands alone, but they all take place in a relatively near future where some element of the current technological landscape has been ratcheted up to an absurd but disconcertingly plausible degree. There are terrorists who use public humiliation, not bloodshed, to capitalize on social media virality. Theres a company that takes all the data that deceased loved ones created during their lives to build a sort of mourning-bot. And in one of the best episodes, optical recording implants enhance memory while becoming vectors for neuroses and jealousy. THE TWILIGHT ZONE UPDATED FOR THE ANXIETIES OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY This episode, \"The Entire History of You,\" is a perfect example of whats great about Black Mirror. Yes, there are memory chips and optical implants, but its really the story of a jealous husband. Black Mirrors characters may live in dystopian worlds, but theyre still recognizable humans, acting out ordinary ambitions, vanities, and fears. As it does in real life, technology fades into the background even as it exerts a powerful influence on the way people live. Also like real life, the technology in Black Mirror is often as appealing as its effects are unsettling, which makes the show all the more disturbing. There are two three-episode seasons so far, and earlier this year Robert Downey Jr. bought the rights to make a film version of \"The Entire History of You.\" The next episode  a Christmas special starring Jon Hamm and Oona Chaplin  airs on December 25. Before you go off and watch it, I should say, Black Mirror is dark. Like, really dark. The first episode in particular is unlike anything Ive seen on television. Its satire, but the sort of satire that starts as a joke until you realize Brooker is prepared to mercilessly follow through on his premise.",

      "title": "The 14 Best Christmas Movies on Netflix to Watch in December 2016",
      "text": "Writes about movies at Temple of Reviews and Film School Rejects. Complains a lot. 5 mins ago The 14 Best Christmas Movies on Netflix to Watch in December 2016 Tons of picks for Christmases both white and blue. W hen it comes to holiday movies on Netflix, the situation is currently pretty dire. You could lose yourself in a sea of made for TV crap for hours before coming across something worth watching. Don’t let that happen to you. Use this handy list we’ve put together to plan your holiday movie watching schedule. It’s easy. Just click on the film’s titles to be taken to their Netflix pages. Pick of the Month: Happy Christmas (2014) If you’ve ever been a scumbag drunk in your 20s, or had to put up with a sibling who was a scumbag drunk in their 20s around the holidays, then Joe Swanberg ’s darkly funny indie drama Happy Christmas is for you. Swanberg’s movies started off polarizing, but they’ve continued to get better and better, to the point where I can’t see anyone not being entertained by them these days. There’s a lot of insight here. There are complex characters, and they’re portrayed with a ton of honesty, to the point where they don’t even really feel like movie characters so much as they feel like people you know. Anna Kendrick is so charming as the screwup, it’s unreal. Swanberghimself plays the older brother who’s letting the screwup crash in his basement, and he brings that unique Swanberg smarm to the role that’s always delightful. Swanberg’s real life son is playing his baby, and he’s such a mental patient that you can’t take your eyes off of him. Melanie Lynskey steals the movie like she always does, but she does it in amazing fashion here, by making the nagging wife archetype three-dimensional and likable for once. Also, Mark Webber shows up playing a kind-hearted weed dealer, and he’s responsible for one of the most skin-crawlingly awkward make out scenes ever put on film. It needs to be seen to be believed. All that and the movie takes place on Christmas! Christmas, Again (2014) If you were tasked with explaining this movie to someone, you’d probably start off by using some sort of nonsense phrase like “tone poem.” Christmas, Again doesn’t tell much of a story. It’s just a small portrait of a clearly sad man ( Kentucker Audley ) living in a trailer, selling Christmas trees on the streets of New York, and trying to escape something from his past that’s got him all tore up inside. What this movie does real well is establish a mood. If you’re the type who’s prone to getting blue around Christmas, you’re going to be very familiar with that mood, and I’ve found that wrapping yourself up in it in the form of a movie that’s insightful and beautiful to look at can be pretty therapeutic. Misery loves company, and all that jazz. Christmas With the Kranks (2004) Let’s be clear, Christmas With the Kranks isn’t a good movie, but a whole generation of kids grew up watching Tim Allen ’s The Santa Clause jointsaround Christmas, and those things aren’t available for free streaming, so this is the best you’re going to get. There are some reasons to put this one on though. They got M Emmet Walsh to play the wacky neighbor. How nuts is that? Also, Jamie Lee Curtis ’ performance is so bad, you have to check it out. She’s usually great, but she cannot do this big, broad, wacky comedy thing. She comes off as a cross between the mom from Carrie and the Chicken Lady from The Kids in the Hall . Dutch (1991) Even though Dutch came out when Ed O’Neill was at the height of his Married With Children fame, and even though its got the pedigree of a John Hughes script, it didn’t really receive the warmest reception when it was released. That’s stupid though, because it’s basically a close cousin of Planes, Trains and Automobiles , where an odd couple is forced into taking a disastrous road trip home together for the holidays, and it’s nearly as fun to watch as that movie is. O’Neill is exploiting the shit out of his Regular Joe charms, and a young Ethan Embry makes for a great, stuck-up, snooty foil for him to play off of. Like you would expect from a Hughes story, even though these characters start off as caricatures, they deepen over time, you begin to care about them, and their plights even let you learn a few lessons about what’s really important around the holidays. Also, there’s a nudie playing card bit in here that’s just to die for. Ernest Saves Christmas (1988) I can see you snickering over there, pretending that you don’t like Ernest movies. It’s okay. Let go. Admit that, though these things can get pretty dumb, Jim Varney was a decently talented, old-school entertainer who struck gold with the Ernest character, and he’s always good for a legit laugh or two. Plus, even if goofy voices and silly catchphrases isn’t your thing, Ernest Saves Christmas is still worth a watch because it works so well as a Christmas movie. It’s all about cultivating kindness and finding fellowship with lonely weirdos, which is truly the spirit of the season. Douglas Seale weirdly makes for one of the best movie Santas there’s ever been in this movie, too. The guy is really good in this Ernest movie, doing a straightforward, earnest (ha!) portrayal of Good Ol’ Saint Nick. When Seale thinks that Christmas is ruined and there isn’t going to be anyone to carry on the mantle of Santa Claus, shit gets emotional. I’m not going to say that I cried at an Ernest movie, but it got close. Get Santa (2014) This is a totally weird Christmas movie, which makes it a nice change of pace from the usual holiday fare that’s all about schmaltzy themes of togetherness and whatnot. It’s got Jim Broadbent playing a version of Santa who’s a little bit wild-eyed, a little bit scattered — like if Doc Brown was suddenly infected with the spirit of Christmas. It’s about this slightly left of center Santa crashing his sleigh, getting thrown in the slammer, and the father/son team ( Rafe Spall and Kit Connor ) who then have to clean up the mess he’s made in order to save Christmas. It’s got farting reindeer, guns that shoot balls of poop at the police, and a scene where Santa tries to act hard while his hair is in corn rows and ‘Straight Outta Compton’ plays over the soundtrack. The kids will love it. Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmas (1999) Looking for something to plop the kids down in front of? There’s where you’re in luck. Netflix is full of Christmas specials from all sorts of animated properties. Cycling through them reveals a depressing lack of quality though. Is there anything on here you can watch too? Yes. Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmas is an anthology film that manages to rekindle some of the charm of classic Disney animation. There’s a Donald story here, a Goofy story, a Mickey and Minnie story, and even a series of bumpers that are delightfully narrated by Kelsey Grammer . If nothing else, maybe sitting down as a family and watching this holiday treat could serve as a nice way to ease your children into watching Frasier . It’s never too early to learn to appreciate the droll repartee shared between Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce. Miracle on 34th Street (1994) Probably, if you were thinking about watching Miracle on 34th Street this Christmas, you were thinking about watching the 1947 version of the film. It’s a classic — a throwback to a more innocent time that charmingly didn’t think that it was so innocent. Netflix doesn’t have that though, it’s got the 1994 remake, but it’s not such a bad consolation prize. At its core, this is still a movie about melting cold and skeptical hearts and filling them up with warmth and hope, and there’s really nothing that’s more hardcore Christmas than that. Also, Richard Attenborough makes for a great Kris Kringle, Elizabeth Perkins really anchors the film with her nuanced, affecting performance, and Dylan McDermott is also in the cast. Ladies seem to like him. Right? Whatever your tastes, there’s no way you’re going to turn your nose up at a super-tiny Mara Wilson talking all adult. Some people say that this is the role that got her the job starring in Matilda . Hard to believe, I know. Pee-Wee’s Playhouse: Christmas Special (1988) It’s true that the Pee-Wee’s Playhouse Christmas special isn’t a real movie, but it was twice as long as your typical episode of Pee-Wee’s Playhouse , and it is one of the most ridiculous things that’s ever been made, so it needs to be included here. So much work went into all of the little details and Christmas decorating of this thing that to watch it feels like being transported instantly to Christmas morning. Plus, it’s just such an oddity. The assortment of celebrity guests it got was insane. You had legit big stars of the time, strange relics of yesteryear, and about a million icons of the LGBT community. This thing is a potent pill of camp culture, shoved straight down your throat, it’s all weirdly Christmas-wrapped as some kind of variety show for children, and it’s just so much fun that it’s almost too much to take in. Plus, it still manages to teach important Christmas lessons about putting other people before yourself and how gross fruit cakes are. This is a Christmas special that has everything. The Ref (1994) What The Ref does is clever. It takes the normal-though-crippling family dysfunction that everyone can relate to, and it blows it up into a metaphor for an insane criminal endeavor gone terrifically wrong, giving the whole thing life and death stakes. The comedy here is black as coal, the actors pulled together for the ensemble are strong, and the film is helmed by Ted Demme —  who also made the best Black Wednesday movie of all time, Beautiful Girls —  so you know that you’re in good hands. Admittedly, the writing is a little thin, but does that matter when you’re giving Kevin Spacey plenty of opportunities to play put-upon, Denis Leary so many opportunities to play incredulous, and Judy Davis unlimited opportunities to dazzle? If you’re looking for a holiday movie with a mean streak, give The Ref a shot. Scrooged (1988) Back in 1988 it must have seemed like casting legendary smart-ass Bill Murray as an updated version of the Ebenezer Scrooge character was a guaranteed home run, and it absolutely was. Despite the fact that Scrooged is painfully 80s, and it goes to slimy, coke-fueled places that aren’t always pleasant to go to at Christmastime, it’s still become a modern Christmas classic that people make an effort to revisit every year. Maybe what makes this one so memorable is that it’s full of iconic actors who look like a motley crew when they’re listed next to each other. Who would have ever thought that they’d get to see a movie starring Bobcat Goldthwait , Robert Mitchum , Carol Kane , Buddy Hackett , Karen Allen , and Robert Goulet ? That’s insane. Richard Donner was on a roll with the movies he was directing in the 80s, and this one is no exception to that rule. He made it right in between Lethal Weapon and its sequel! What a run. Son in Law (1993) Are we cheating here a little bit by calling Son in Law a holiday movie? Maybe. It’s about a college freshman ( Carla Gugino ) coming home to her parents’ conservative farm for the holidays with a crazy guest ( Pauly Shore ) in tow, but it’s focus really isn’t on the fact that it’s the holidays. Still though, the climactic scene takes place during a Thanksgiving dinner, the movie is all about our relationships with our families — and how that can change after we’ve been away from our families for a while — and it’s just too good to not put on a list about holiday movies. Shore has become a bit of a punchline over time, but he was a huge media figure in the early 90s, and this movie and his first big foray into Hollywood acting, Encino Man ,both totally hold up as 90s comedies. This thing has Kelly Kapowski in it, for the love of Mike. What’s surprising though is that there’s a legitimate character arc that happens due to Shore’s character and Lane Smith ’s uptight dad character clashing at first and then eventually learning to bond, and it’s actually kind of nuanced, and it’s totally earned, so Son in Law isn’t just about Shore’s catchphrases and all of his “Weasel” character nonsense. It’s actually a real movie. That’s not to say that Shore’s “Weasel” character wasn’t funny though. It had a shelf life, but it also had its time. And who doesn’t have a huge crush on Carla Gugino? A Very Murray Christmas (2015) When it was announced that Netflix was making and releasing A Very Murray Christmas , everyone seemed to assume that it was going to be some kind of post-modern deconstruction of the old-school Christmas special. It ended up being a much more straightforward love letter to those old Christmas specials though, that was full of celebrity guests, musical numbers, and sentimentality. If that doesn’t sound like something that would fly these days, usually it isn’t, but Bill Murray has earned so much cultural clout that he could basically get away with anything. This Christmas special is boozy, it’s smoke-filled, and it’s the sort of thing that makes one long for years gone past — the time before our culture was decimated by things like social media and memes and grown people caring about whatever the latest Miley Cyrus stunt was, even though at one point the latest Miley Cyrus stunt was her appearing in this special. White Christmas (1954) If you’re looking to watch a true Christmas classic this year, a member of the canon that people have been dragging out every Christmas forever, then White Christmas is going to be your pick as far as Netflix is concerned. This one has lasted forever, and for good reason. It’s very Christmasy, it tells one of those classic stories about a big show needing to be put on in order to save an institution that’s being put out of business, and it’s full of unforgettable song and dance. Bing Crosby , Danny Kaye , Rosemary Clooney , and Vera-Ellen  — they’re all mega talents, and they’ve all carved out a place for themselves in history with this movie. Not enough can be said about Crosby’s version of ‘White Christmas’ though. That’s in the pantheon of Christmas songs, and it’s something that’s going to be heard on Christmas for thousand of years to come. Or at least until the robots finally take over and decide to brutally kill us all. Merry Christmas.",

      "text": "How to Download Movies and TV Shows from Netflix on Your iPhone or iPad to Watch Them Offline Posted by Khamosh Pathak   tweet \nFinally, Netflix has introduced offline playback feature for its mobile apps – for the iPhone and iPad. There’s no offline support for desktop users. Given the risk of increased piracy, that makes sense. But this move means that you’ll be able to binge watch your new favorite Netflix find when you’re community on the metro or when you’re on a vacation, far from cheap/stable internet connection. \nThis is how the feature works. By default, downloads occur on Wi-Fi only. How to Download a Movie or TV Episode on Netflix \nNote : Not every movie and TV show is available for downloading offline (content from Disney for example). But there’s quite a lot of stufff here. \nStep 1: Open the Netflix app and tap on the “ Menu ” button in the upper-left corner. \nStep 2: Tap on “ Available for Download “. \nStep 3: This will give you a list of shows that this feature works with. Swipe around, find something you want to watch offline. Then tap on the movie or the show. \nStep 4: When you’re in the detail view, you’ll find the “ Download ” button next to the movie preview or the episode preview. Tap on it to start the download. How to Remove Downloaded Movie or TV Episode \nStep 1: After tapping that “ Menu ” button, select “ My Downloads “. \nStep 2: Tap on the title of the show if it’s a TV show. Then tap “ Edit “. \nStep 3: Tap the “ Delete button ” (looks like an “x”) next to the title to delete. How To Stop Downloads \nIf for some reason you’d like to pause or stop the download (you’re switching to another Wi-Fi network), it can be done from the same “ My Downloads ” section. \nNext to the title you’ll see the familiar circular progress that shows how much of the download is done. Tap on it to pause the download. How to Download in HD \nBy default, all the content is downloaded in Standard Definition (SD). On retina screens, especially the iPad, that might not be good enough. You can switch to HD from the settings. \nStep 1: Tap on the “ Menu ” button and select “ Settings “. \nStep 2: Tap on “ Download Video Quality “. \nStep 3: Switch to “ High “. \nThis of course means that you’ll end up using a lot more storage space. If you have an 16 or 32 GB device, it’s advisable to stay with SD. Limitations of This Feature \nWhen we tried downloading the same for the 3/4th time, after cancelling it, we got an error message saying we had reached the yearly limit for downloading the video for offline use (as you can see the screenshot below). \nAlso, you can’t download the same video on more than one devices (even if you have the two screen streaming plan). The other device will show an error code and won’t let you download the video till you’ve deleted it from the first device (using the steps we’ve shown you above). Does This Make Netflix Better for You? \nDoes this feature make Netflix more valuable or useful for you? Share with us in the comments below.",

TV is good and TV is plentiful: this is an incredibly crowded environment that shows now signs of slowing down. Industry experts are predicting that 500 scripted shows will be produced in 2017. \nWhile this may be the golden age of television the challenge of securing a faithful audience is becoming ever more intense. In addition, viewers have an expectation that they should be able to watch their entertainment whenever and wherever they’re most comfortable. With competition escalating, we wanted to highlight two standout shows on Netflix that resonate with and captivate their audiences: Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things. \nGilmore Girls was first released in 2000 on the CW and was unique at the time. It featured two female protagonists—a single mother who was a teen mom and her daughter. The pair navigated their relationship more as best friends than mother/daughter. The first millennials to go to college quite literally grew up with Rory Gilmore, who herself graduated from Chilton High in 2003. \nOn the other hand, Stranger Things came completely out of the blue. The series is an homage to 80s horror films and the decade as a whole. Playing on nostalgia with creative storytelling, the show has quickly cemented itself as a pop culture pillar. \nUsing social data, we wanted to see how Netflix reignited an existing audience (with Gilmore Girls) and how a brand new audience (Stranger Things) responded in the months after the show’s release. Television Comes To Life \nThere’s no debate about the importance of creating a bit of real world magic or spectacle for marketers. Not only do real world activations allow fans to build a deeper association with the show in question, they also turn each fan into a brand ambassador for those who may not have heard about the phenomenon yet. While Netflix knew Gilmore Girls had a devoted a faithful audience they still faced the challenge of reminding them what they loved—and remaining true to it sixteen years later. \nTypically, when a studio plans to promote a property they go to a high-volume event like SXSW, Comic Con, or major sporting events. These events bring together large, diverse audiences that make for a quicker way to make a big splash. In the above chart, we have the number of tweets associated with activations during SXSW for Game of Thrones, Suicide Squad and Mr. Robot. These were all popular and featured long lines every day they were open. \nBut at the head of this chart we see #LukesDiner, with 7,000 more social mentions than any of the other activations’ mentions. First, what in the world is Luke’s Diner and second, how did this single-day activation gather more momentum? \nThe answer: Netflix re-branded coffee shops across America as Luke’s Diner on one day in October to build momentum for the show’s Black Friday release. Luke’s was a diner located in the fictional setting of Star’s Hollow and featured prominently in the show, known for its surly eponymous owner and strict “No Cell Phone Policy.” This word of mouth wasn’t limited to Twitter, and the activation was photo-worthy (think Luke’s cups in Starbucks’ cups’ stead)—so on Instagram, we saw over 12,000 photos tagged during the day, boasting an average of 29 likes per photo. \nFrom a demographic perspective, this activation was also a hit: the vast majority of Tweets came from the target audience of the show, younger women: \nNot only did the original audience, women aged 25-34, talk about Luke’s Diner, but the largest volume of conversation came from those who were too young to watch the show when it originally aired. We therefore have proof that Netflix was able to both reach their existing fans and gain new ones in its lead up to the relaunch. \nNetflix was able to reach existing fans and gain new ones in its lead up to the relaunch. \n\nAnother instance of television crossing over into the real world that caught our eye was the fortuitous meeting of Stranger Things and Halloween. \nOver the Halloween weekend, we looked at all Tweets that contained #HalloweenCostume or Halloween and Costume. We then looked at what entertainment properties were being referenced in combination. When people mentioned these in their Tweets, we were able to see just how successful Netflix’s Stranger Things has been. The show was most likely to invoke Twitter chatter and the only streaming property to be so heavily associated with the holiday. \nOver on Instagram, the show was tagged more than 36,000 times during the Halloween weekend. That’s 3x as many photos as Gilmore Girls had based on people spontaneously dressing up as a character. But were there other signs on social—before Halloween and its costume opportunities—that could have predicted this enthusiasm? \nFor television shows that are released all at once we typically see conversation patterns that follow movies (as intuition would imply). In our fifth Smart Social Report we determined that “50% of all audience conversation about a movie takes place three weeks after its release.” In the above chart we see a similar conversation flow happen with both House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black, which had 75% percent of their conversation take place on Twitter within two weeks of their release. \nOn the other end of the spectrum is the way that people talk about a serialized show. Both Game of Thrones and Mr. Robot follow a predictable weekly ebb and flow as each new episode hits the airwaves. But we see one television show not following either of these trends: Stranger Things. \nFrom the day of its release on Netflix, people would not stop talking about the show. It received a consistent volume of conversation day over day as word of mouth about the show spread awareness to a much broader audience. Pieces of the Same Puzzle \nWhile we know that Netflix is able to create content that is popular both on and off social, how do all of these pieces fit together to make a larger whole? Does the social evidence point to Netflix’s success? \nOn Twitter, we looked at the gender difference for followers active in the last 30 days of these shows’ official accounts. We can quickly see how see how a show like House of Cards, which has a male-dominant following on Twitter, is complemented by shows like Orange Is The New Black and Gilmore Girls, which trend more female. So Netflix has gender down pat, according to social. \nOur next step was to take each of these shows and average out their audience into age groups. This gives us a full picture of just who these super fans of Netflix programming are. In the last month, over 75% of the conversation we were able to identify was generated by Netflix users 24-years-old and younger. This is an audience who are building their media viewing habits that will last a lifetime–in other words, a group the company can’t afford not to connect with. Again: a sign of strength for Netflix. Social Context for all Marketers \nWhile the way that audiences access entertainment continues to evolve, the challenges they face are the same as ever. Who are the people watching these shows? Are they telling their friends about them? For Netflix, we’ve got a clear picture of a young and engaged audience that’s more than willing to evangelize a show when they love it. Any marketer can use social to layer on information about the broader appeal of their campaigns—and which audiences they resonate with the most. If the target audience isn’t the one responding, then perhaps it’s a signal that the value is in a new unexpected place, or that messaging needs to be reworked to better communicate with the desired group.

      "text": "Netflix And Amazon Have A New Battleground Dec. 1.16 \nNetflix will finally launch a download option, like Amazon has offered for years. \nThe new capability will significantly enhance Netflix's appeal to subscribers. \nHowever, the apparent exclusion of Amazon Fire may hurt Netflix more than Amazon. Introduction I have been a loud proponent of downloadable streaming video for quite a while now, and also bullish on the video services - principally Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Video - which offer them. After years of insisting that downloads were not needed, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has just announced that it too will offer download capability, effective immediately. I have spent the day more or less playing with all the different variants of the feature. Including on several different brands of phones and tablets and on a few different WiFi networks. I reviewed the official blog post making the announcement, as well as the new articles in the Help Center outlining the new capability. My impression is generally positive, with one significant qualifier. The Value Of Downloads First, the good news. Netflix now offers downloads. As a feature that wasn't being offered before that is now, that is an unambiguous positive. It will allow Netflix customers to continue to enjoy their subscriptions on airplanes and subways, as well as on long road trips far away from cell towers and other dead zones. This can only enhance the appeal of a Netflix subscription. And by finally matching Amazon in this regard, it may also give those who were considering dumping Netflix for Amazon's cheaper Prime service - which also comes with music streaming and free shipping - one more reason to stay. It is true that not everything in the Netflix catalog is downloadable, but I do not regard that as a substantial impairment. Amazon also has certain \"download gaps\" in its answer to coverage gaps, and it does not appear to have hurt the service's appeal to consumers. Nor is there really any reason it should. With literally thousands of titles available consumers do not need the entire catalog to be downloadable. They just need enough downloadable titles that they have something to watch when they are offline. At over 60 hours per month , Netflix users clearly have no trouble finding several titles that interest them at any given time. If a subscriber is currently jumping between three different TV series they like, for example, they only need one of them to be downloadable to make Netflix much more valuable to them. They will simply catch up to the other two when they return to civilizat- I mean, broadband connection. International Progress This new option may be especially significant on the international front. Netflix's domestic DVD and streaming operations are both in the black, but its international segment continues to post losses. Some territories are already profitable, but many others are struggling. One reason, among others, has been that lower-income nations have far less developed broadband networks. This means more people have no internet access at home except for their mobile devices, which come with tight data caps that make video streaming infeasible, at least on a regular basis. But many of them can access Internet somewhere over the course of the day. A cafe, a library, a government building, etc. That does them no good to stream live at home, but if they can walk to a public place, download a few titles, and then return home, the international appeal of Netflix in lower-income countries may be greatly strengthened. This will allow Netflix to hit break-even in more territories faster and accelerate the company's journey to sustained profitability internationally. That Leaves Just A Few Questions… Despite this, the news could have been even better. Netflix has indeed created a download feature, but unlike Amazon, it does not appear to have lifted all strings with regards to downloads. After using the feature and reading about it I still have a few questions. First, the articles themselves give little clarity with regard to the accounting of downloads. Do downloads count against the streaming limit in any way? And is there a cap on total titles downloaded at one time? Is the cap the same for Premium and Standard accounts? At least one limitation is already clear, and it may hurt Netflix substantially. Netflix appears to have used its new download feature as a way to strike against Amazon. As I've said before , one of Amazon's advantages in the streaming video sphere is that it makes its own hardware, the Fire line of tablets. In fact, when Amazon first launched downloads you could only use it on Fire devices. That restriction has since been lifted, but the ability to design hardware and video software together is still an advantage for the company. As is the opportunity it gives Amazon to showcase its own service to Fire owners, front and center, while making them go digging for Netflix in the app store. Netflix Sparring With Amazon Netflix probably won't be building hardware anytime soon, but it still seems to be looking for a way to counter Amazon's Fire advantage. While the press release today said that the service applied to both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Android (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) devices, Amazon's Fire, which runs a forked version of Android, has been excluded. I confirmed this twice by checking to see if the app update which was pushed to all iOS and Android devices today was pending on my Fire devices (I own no less than five of them.) It was not. This is a real limitation, not a detail. Amazon Fire is the only major tablet vendor which is still growing sales globally , outside of China where domestic manufacturers continue to be favored by the government. It is the device of choice for an increasing number of customers. While it is possible some customers will consider the lack of Netflix downloads a reason not to buy a Fire, it is also just as possible that customers will see less value in Netflix, especially since Amazon Prime Video's catalog is continuing to grow in caliber itself. Slow Or Sly? It is almost certain that this constraint was imposed by Netflix, not by Amazon. Starz, another competitor video service which recently cut the cord and began offering an online subscription offering without a cable subscription, also incorporates downloads into its service. And when they announced the new download option earlier this year Amazon voiced no objection to including it on Fire. It is true that when Starz launched their new app it wasn't ready day-and-date on Fire like it was for iOS and Android. So it's possible no one is excluding anyone; maybe the Fire app is just still in the works. But given the increasingly sharp competition between Amazon and Netflix, it is also very possible that this is Netflix trying to get a leg up on an increasingly dangerous competitor. In which case it may have shot itself in the foot, since customers will not appreciate having their choice of devices constrained by Netflix. The war with Amazon, if that's what it is, is particularly unhelpful. Netflix is already challenging Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and Disney (NYSE: DIS ) to remake the TV ecosystem. Adding Amazon to the enemies list is nothing but counterproductive, especially since many Amazon Prime subscribers continue to subscribe to Netflix as well. Conclusion I see Netflix's download option as a substantial positive, regardless, but it would be even stronger if these constraints weren't present. More clarity is needed from the company to investors about how this will work, exactly, as well as on the company's future relationship with Amazon. Nevertheless, Netflix downloads are long overdue, and investors should welcome their arrival.

Also cast in the series, from The Killing creator Veena Sud and Fox 21 TV Studios, is Patrick Murney (Public Morals).\n\nMosley will play Joe “Fish” Rinaldi, a seasoned New Jersey detective assigned to work with prosecutor KJ Harper (still to be cast). Murney will portray Gary Wilcox, a cop working with Diangelo (David Lyons), Osorio (Raul Castillo) and newcomer Peter Jablonski (Beau Knapp) on the Narcotics squad in Jersey City.\nSource: Deadline ",

On Wednesday, Netflix released the news that they were finally allowing users to download shows so they can watch offline. Bye-bye, any hopes of getting pity A-minuses. Hello, sweet, sweet procrastination.\nSo far this feature is only available on the mobile app, and users can only download select shows. But more content will be available in the future. Right now you can watch binge-worthy shows like House of Cards , Parks and Recreation , Master of None , and more.\nThought you would be able to concentrate on your p-sets in Crema? Thought you could use the excuse of unreliable wifi in Starbucks to look at lecture readings instead of Stranger Things or The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ? Nope. Your finals will suffer, your papers won’t be the best, but you at least you will be able to download videos in standard or high quality to watch at your leisure. C's get degrees, people.\nWhen the next Harvard blackout occurs, it will nice to be able to watch Orange is the New Black while waiting for the wifi to restart . Though it would have been nice to have this new addition before Thanksgiving to help us deal with long flights (and avoiding relatives ), we'll take any good news we can get in 2016.\nShare Stay up-to-date on Harvard campus happenings, all the time.\nSign up for the Harvard Today email newsletter.",

      "text": "1-Dec-2016 What do Netflix, Google and planetary systems have in common? Same class of algorithms used by Google and Netflix can also tell us if distant planetary systems are stable or not University of Toronto \nIMAGE: Artist's depiction of a collision between two planetary bodies. view more Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nMachine learning is a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from fraud detection and sorting spam in Google, to making movie recommendations on Netflix. \nNow a team of researchers from the University of Toronto Scarborough have developed a novel approach in using it to determine whether planetary systems are stable or not. \n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" says Dan Tamayo, lead author of the research and a postdoctoral fellow in the Centre for Planetary Science at U of T Scarborough. \nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. \n\"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" he says. \nIt's important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed. It can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation. \nThere are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, notes Tamayo. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is the result of a series of workshops at U of T Scarborough covering how machine learning could help tackle specific scientific problems. The research is currently published online in the Astrophysical Journal Letters . \n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he adds. \nIt may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year. The two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system. \n\"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" says Tamayo. \n\"It could be a very useful tool in better understanding those systems.\" ### \nDisclaimer:  ",

      "title": "All You Need to Know About Netflix's Video Download Feature",
      "text": "Netflix videos can be downloaded only on Android & iOS apps, not desktops Not all Netflix videos can be downloaded at present Netflix videos cannot be shared with other users \nNetflix has introduced a new offline viewing feature that allows you to download movies and shows to your mobile device so you can watch them even when you don’t have Internet access. The feature is not available for all devices however, and comes with a few restrictions. Here’s everything you need to know about the new Netflix video download feature . \nHow to get started with the Netflix download feature If a Netflix movie or TV show is available for offline viewing, you will see a download icon on its details page. Just tap that, wait for the download to finish, and your Netflix content is ready for offline viewing. Netflix downloads are only available for mobile devices The Netflix video download feature is only available for mobile devices for now. This means that you can use the Netflix download function only on smartphones and tablets powered by Android and iOS. This means you cannot download videos to your PCs from the browser, or the dedicated macOS or Windows Store apps.\nNetflix download feature don’t cover the whole catalogue The new Netflix download feature doesn’t let you take everything offline. Apart from Netflix original shows, only select TV shows and movies fall under the Netflix download feature’s ambit. Since some movies and shows that are not Originals are covered by this feature, it will probably be extended to more titles over time. \nNetflix download feature gets its own tabs In app menu (accessible by tapping the hamburger icon on the top left), you will see two tabs dedicated for the Netflix download feature. The My Downloads tab is home to all the videos you have taken offline via the Netflix download feature. The other is the Available for Download tab that shows you a list of movies and TV shows that can be downloaded. \nYou can’t share downloaded Netflix videos with friends The videos taken offline via the Netflix download feature cannot be shared with others, even if they use the service as well. The files do not appear in the file system on your phone, or when it connected to a desktop. \nThe downloaded videos work only in Netflix app The movies and TV shows you took offline can be viewed only on the Netflix app, and do not appear in the default video player of the device, or third-party apps. \nNetflix downloads can’t be played on your TV via Chromecast There’s bad news for users who wish to cast their downloaded Netflix videos to their TV via Chromecast. The new feature does not let you do this. What’s worse is that the downloaded Netflix video becomes the default video, so even if you wish to stream the video at home by searching for it and choosing to stream it, the Netflix app will still pick up the downloaded video, which you can’t cast. To stream it again, you need to delete the downloaded file. \nYou can pause Netflix downloads but not put them on priority Picture this: you start downloading an episode of Arrested Development, but then you decide you want to pause the earlier download and start downloading something else. Netflix won’t let you do that! You cannot prioritise Netflix downloads; instead, you must wait for the first download to finish before the other videos – that you want to watch first maybe – can start downloading. Pausing downloads will pause all downloads, and you can’t select just one video download to pause. \nOne workaround is to cancel a video download, and start downloading it later, but then Netflix will start downloading it from the scratch. All the data saved from the first download attempt will be lost.",

      "text": "What do Netflix, Google and planetary systems have in common? December 1, 2016 Dan Tamayo is a postdoctoral fellow in the Centre for Planetary Science at U of T Scarborough. Credit: Ken Jones \nMachine learning is a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from fraud detection and sorting spam in Google, to making movie recommendations on Netflix. \nNow a team of researchers from the University of Toronto Scarborough have developed a novel approach in using it to determine whether planetary systems are stable or not. \n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" says Dan Tamayo, lead author of the research and a postdoctoral fellow in the Centre for Planetary Science at U of T Scarborough. \nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. \n\"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" he says. \nIt's important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed. It can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation. Artist's depiction of a collision between two planetary bodies. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nThere are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, notes Tamayo. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is the result of a series of workshops at U of T Scarborough covering how machine learning could help tackle specific scientific problems. The research is currently published online in the Astrophysical Journal Letters . \n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he adds. \nIt may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year. The two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system. \n\"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" says Tamayo. \n\"It could be a very useful tool in better understanding those systems.\"",

      "text": "Travelers rejoice! Netflix to allow offline streaming. December 1, 2016 by roadwarriorette Leave A Comment \nJust in time for the crazy holiday travel season, Netflix has announced that they will be allowing offline streaming of their movies and shows. What does this mean? All you have to do is upgrade the Netflix app on your phone or tablet, and when you select certain movies or shows you will have the option to download and watch later. No change to your subscription needed. \nPeople who travel often know that streaming tv and movies can helppass the time on a layover or long security line. Now you can watch your shows while you’re in the air too! No wifi on your regional jet? No problem! I do predict that this will lead to a decline in productivity, but an increase in overall traveler happiness. \nOn a related note, we just finished watching Luke Cage. It was great, beautifully shot with fantastic music. Unfortunately it’s not available for offline streaming, but I still highly recommend it. Now I need suggestions for a new show! \nReaders, do you watch streaming tv and movies when you travel? What are you watching these days?",

Previously, you would have to access these cable channel streaming services through a separate application, but now you can do it right through Amazon for easy access and convenience in one place.\nYou can add HBO for $14.99 a month, the same price as the standalone HBO Now subscription. However, as of now, the only downside to subscribing to HBO through Amazon Prime instead of getting HBO Now is that you would have access to a live channel stream to watch new shows as they air. You’ll only be able to access programming just after it airs. The same goes for Cinemax as well.\nEven with that slight disadvantage, this is a smart move for Amazon to keep users in their app instead of getting programming elsewhere. Just like the other HBO and Cinemax subscriptions, paying through Amazon gets you OnDemand access to all of HBO’s current shows (again after they air) like Girls, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , but perhaps more importantly, Westworld and Game of Thrones .\nAlso, this also includes all of the old series from the cable network including hits like The Sopranos, The Wire, Curb Your Enthusiasm, True Blood and many more. There are also HBO Documentary Films that are part of the library, and a bunch of stand-up specials and of course, movies.\nWith Cinemax, you’ll get access to their somewhat less impressive roster of original programming like Quarry, The Knock, Strike Back and Banshee . That also includes access to all their movies and probably all that Skinemax programming you used to sneak around and watch as a teenager.\nWe’re getting closer and closer to having a very efficient a la carte cable subscription system, but right now it’s far too spread out to be any less of a hassle than paying for cable. But with Amazon bringing in channels like HBO and Cinemax like this, it’s presumably only a matter of time before they get other channels and subscription services on board.\nThe post HBO and Cinemax Are Now Available Through Amazon Prime appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "\"Full House.\" ABC\nIf Netflix’s Fuller House reboot has proven anything, it’s how much people still love Full House . (Behold the magic of many years of broadcast syndication.)\nHowever, if you needed further proof that Tanner nostalgia is a real thing, look no further than the fact that Full House creator Jeff Franklin just bought the San Francisco house that acts as the Tanner home for $4.15 million from a previous owner frustrated with the constant stream of Full House tourists.\nCharlie and I went to San Fran to go house hunting. This one looks familiar. Think I should buy?! #fullhousehouse pic.twitter.com/FSi9M0QdlV\n— jeff franklin (@fullhouseguy) May 31, 2016 “There are probably 250 fans per day that show up and take a picture in front of it,” Franklin told The Hollywood Reporter . “It will be a lot more fun for the fans because now the house will look like the Tanners really live there. It’s a gift to the fans but it’s also fun for me to own it.”\nThe house in question, which is located at 1709 Broderick Street in San Francisco’s Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood, didn’t have much to do with the original Full House production, despite being one of the most recognizable parts of the series. The show used many of the same stock shots of the exterior of the house for the eight seasons.\nFranklin added: “No one has allowed us to shoot in that house since we did our very first stock shoot back in April of ’87. Our audience has watched the same cars drive by that house now for 29 years. It’s going to be really nice to see some new cars drive by the house.”\nABC\nFranklin is already at work restored (or is it de-storing?) the house to its former Full House glory. He had changed the door from seafoam green back to its Tanner red. The Fuller House producer plans also plans to redo the modern interiors to make it more sitcom-y, as if the Tanners actually live there. We await the inevitable Pinterest design board.\nFrankly, even if Franklin didn’t want the house for himself or to rent out (which he says is his ultimate plan), this is a great buy. Not only can Netflix use it for any future seasons of Fuller House that may come to be, but it is also kind of a genius marketing move for the second season of Fuller House that’s set to drop on Netflix in a few weeks on Dec. 9.\nIf none of that pans out, the house could definitely be turned into some kind of Full House Museum a la the A Christmas Story House that I am moderately convinced is one of Cleveland’s main tourist attractions. Full House fever is real, folks. When you’re lost out there and you’re all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home.\nRead the original article on Collider . Copyright 2016.

      "text": "0 \nLast Updated December 1st \nLook, we know you want to Netflix and Chill. Who doesn’t? But until Netflix creates a “Netflix and Chill” category– a real one, this time –you might find yourself struggling to come up with new movie suggestions to keep things fresh.

      "text": "A Peek at Netflix's Playbook for the Domestic Streaming Market PART 5 OF 12 Netflix’s Take on Its Relationship with Disney By Shirley Pelts | Nov 30, 2016 4:57 pm EST Netflix’s deal with Disney \nEarlier this year, Netflix ( NFLX ) entered into an exclusive streaming deal with The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ). From September this year, Netflix started exclusively streaming movies from Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. \nIn its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call, Netflix talked about its exclusive streaming deal with Disney. The company stated that, as a part of this deal, Zootopia was the first popular movie to stream on Netflix. Netflix also stated that Zootopia is doing well on Netflix and is proving to be extremely popular among kids. It added that it believes that Disney is the sole brand that has managed to it right when it comes to the economics of producing tentpole movies catering to family viewing. \nNetflix also stated that it does not have exclusive streaming rights for Disney movies on a global basis. The company remarked that, in the United Kingdom ( EWU ), it lost the streaming rights to 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA) Sky around two years ago. What is the nature of Netflix’s relationship with Disney? \nDisney entered into an exclusive syndication arrangement with Netflix for the Pay 1 and Pay 2 windows for films released through the 2018 calendar year. This means Netflix can stream new Disney movies released from 2016 onward. \nHowever, because Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released in late 2015, it will go to STARZ. As the chart above shows, Disney has a strong IP (intellectual property) portfolio. \nAdditionally, in its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call, Netflix said that, considering Disney’s strong content portfolio and the rising popularity of OTT (over-the-top) services, it makes sense for the company to distribute it on OTT platforms such as Hulu and Netflix. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"NFLX\",\"DIS\",\"FOXA\",\"EWU\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Netflix, Inc.\",\"The Walt Disney Company\",null,\"iShares MSCI United Kingdom Index (ETF)\"]} X",

      "text": "A Peek at Netflix's Playbook for the Domestic Streaming Market PART 4 OF 12 Netflix’s View: Original Content versus Content Licensing? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 30, 2016 4:57 pm EST Original programming \nNetflix ( NFLX ) expects to spend ~$5 billion on content acquisition in 2016 and $6 billion on content in 2017. Currently, 10% of its content spending is on original content. The company would like to raise that amount to 50%. \nNetflix believes original content will strengthen its brand and drive up viewing hours. Netflix is aiming for 600 hours of original programming in 2016 and intends to take this up to 1,000 hours of programming in 2017. \nHowever, in its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call, Netflix stated that it has no fixed target when it comes to the proportion of original content and licensed content on Netflix. The company further explained that it expects licensed content to decrease gradually as a percentage of its business, but it expects its licensed content to grow on an absolute basis. \nNetflix also stated that, on a financial basis, it would like to produce its own content. However, when another media company owns the intellectual property (or IP) to a popular show and Netflix would like to bring the show to its subscribers, the company has no option but to obtain the license to show the content. \nAccording to an April 2016 Business Insider report, citing research from AllFlicks, Netflix’s original content has an average rating of 3.9 out of 5, as shown in the graph above. According to the report, Netflix Originals perform 11.5% better than other content. Netflix’s content licensing agreements \nIn July 2016, Netflix entered into a content licensing agreement for Star Trek with CBS ( CBS ) Studios International. In 188 countries, excluding the United States and Canada, Netflix will exclusively stream Star Trek, starting with the original series that debuted in 1966 through to other spin-offs. Netflix has also entered into a content licensing agreement with 21st Century Fox (FOXA). According to the terms of the deal, Netflix will have exclusive streaming rights to its FX channel series, American Crime Story . {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"CBS\",\"FOXA\",\"NFLX\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"CBS Corporation\",null,\"Netflix, Inc.\"]}",

This is what Netflix users had been waiting for. The latest version of the Netflix app for Android and iOS now adds the ability to download and save episodes of TV shows and also full length movies, on the phone or tablet you may be using, and watch them later even if you don’t have a 3G or Wi-Fi connection. \nTo get this new feature, you’ll need to head to the application store on your device and update the Netflix app. The latest version is available on the Google Play Store for devices running Android 4.4.2 or newer variants, and also on Apple iPhone and Apple iPad running iOS 8.0 or newer operating system. For this, Netflix is using the new AVCHi-Mobile and VP9-Mobile encodes, for video compression, improved encoders and better optimization. \nSo how does this work? \nThe first time you open the app after the update, a pop-up will tell you about the new download feature and also provide a helpful link that takes you to all the content that is currently available for download and offline viewing. There is also a new ‘Available for Download’ category in the app for quicker access to content that you may want to save for viewing later. \nEven if you are browsing the library as you normally would, this download option will show up on all the content that is available for offline viewing. For movies, it will show up with the movie title. For TV shows, you’ll have the option of downloading individual episodes. You simply need to tap on the option, and let the download happen in the background. \nUnlike a lot of other apps, the only limitation in terms of the amount of storage Netflix will be able to use is the amount of storage that is available on your phone. For example, if your phone has 128GB storage space, then it will be great for those who love binge watching. There is also no limit as to how many times you may want to watch the same piece of offline content. \nTo allow users to better access and manage the downloads, there is a My Downloads section that has been added to the main menu. Here, everything that you have saved for offline viewing will be listed, and anything that is currently being downloaded will show up as something that is in progress. If you are done watching a movie or even an episode of a TV show, you can simply delete it from here. \nIn the settings, Netflix is offering controls for video quality (standard or high quality) as well as the ability to restrict downloads to only Wi-Fi. Helpfully, the storage space available on your phone or tablet is also shown here. \nThis new feature will be great news for those who want to catch up on their favourite TV shows or movies while travelling, and don’t have the luxury of expensive 3G/4G data plans that allow heavy usage. For Netflix, this could be perfect timing, at least in India, with the potential launch of the Amazon video streaming service just a few weeks away.",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,””House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Here's how Netflix downloading works The streaming service finally unveiled a long-awaited feature this week. Here's what you need to know. Share on Facebook Print Netflix The latest season of Black Mirror is among the Netflix-created shows you can download for watching offline. Why, it's almost as if the dystopian screen-soaked future we're hurtling toward isn't coming quickly enough... By: Andrew Fifield Metro Published on It’s been on the wish lists of subscribers for a very long time, and this week Netflix finally announced users will be able to download programs for offline viewing. So to all the straphangers, frequent flyers and sufferers of wandering wi-fi, here’s everything you need to know to get started. Can I Download Anything For Future Viewing? We’re afraid not. At least for now, only Netflix-owned shows like Making A Murderer, The Crown and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt can be saved for offline viewing. It's a good bet that copyright lawyers were involved in this decision. Well That’s A Bit Of A Drag, But I Get It. What Devices Can I Download To? If you want to take your Netlix shows on the go, you’re going to need the iOS or Android app. Then again, if you want to take your Netflix shows on the go, you probably already have it. Either way, your device will need to be running at least iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 to be compatible with the app. I Notice “Laptop” Missing From That Answer Correct! Only the mobile app can download programs for future viewing. You also won’t be able to move downloaded files over to your computer. How Much Data Does Downloading Guzzle? Downloading a program requires the same data needed for streaming it, so it’s best to load up at home on your personal network before hitting the road to avoid hitting your cap. How Much Storage Space Will I Need? That all depends on how much programming you save, of course. An average hour-long episode in standard definition clocks in at around 280MB. SD is the default download setting, but if you crave that high-definition action, you’ll need roughly twice that. Everything you save will be stored by and accessible within the app, similar to Spotify or common podcast apps. Will My Downloads Expire? This one is kind of all over the place because each program has a different shelf life. If a saved episode expires in less than seven days, your app’s My Downloads section will show you a countdown. Other programs will have to be completed within 48 hours of the first time you press play. Sounds Simple Enough. ",

      "text": "Warning: Spoiler alert! Do not proceed if you haven't finished watching all four episodes of Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\nGilmore Girls star Matt Czuchry has some surprising advice for his character, Logan, following the shocking final scene .\nIn Netflix's A Year in the Life, Logan and Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) engaged in a secret \"friends with benefits\" relationship -- only Logan was engaged to Odette, often mentioned but never seen, and Rory was with Paul, her forgettable boyfriend. At the end of the revival, Rory revealed to her mother, Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ), that she was pregnant.\nRELATED: 7 Things the 'Gilmore Girls' Bosses Revealed About the Surprising Ending\nThough the father of Rory's unborn child remains a mystery, it's been speculated that Logan may very well be the dad. Czuchry shared the one piece of advice he'd give Logan following that emotional cliffhanger.\n\"Don't marry Odette,\" he said during a Facebook Live chat on Thursday. \"Chase down Rory. Make that work. She is the love of your life. Odette, I always kind of looked at as part of his family obligations, so I would say, if I could give Logan one piece of advice, it would be to chase down Rory. Follow his heart.\"\nWhen asked how Logan would react if he learned that Rory was with child, Czuchry was coy.\n\"That's a question that I can't really answer,\" he said with a chuckle. \"Those four words obviously impact someone and it was left open, so I'll leave that for [executive producers] Amy [ Sherman-Palladino ] and Dan [ Palladino ] to say who is the father of that child.\"\nRELATED: Alexis Bledel and Matt Czuchry Defend Rory and Logan's 'Surprising' Romance\n\"Logan will always love Rory for the rest of his life, and that's why they can't quit each other,\" Czuchry said of Rory and Logan's romance. \"From Rory's perspective, I'd like to say that she feels comfortable with Logan. She can call him up when she's going through a difficult time. She knows that he'll provide for [her].\"\nIn the final installment, Logan and Rory seemingly broke things off after they had one last evening of debauchery with the Life and Death Brigade.\n\"What I loved was that goodbye,\" Czuchry said. \"The ending between Rory and Logan was incredibly bittersweet. I think Amy and Dan did a beautiful job writing that.\"\nRELATED: Every Unanswered Question We Still Have After 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'\nNetflix\n\"I loved the Life and Death Brigade,\" he added. \"That whole 'Fall' experience was the best of Logan, the best of Rory and the best of them together.\"\nBledel opened up to ET about Rory and Logan's complicated relationship in the revival at the Year in the Life premiere in November, admitting that their adulterous romance surprised her.\n\"I think it's a little uncomfortable for [Rory] even though she's kind of putting on a brave face that she's fine with it. I think she's actually not that emotionally connected to it,\" Bledel confessed. \"I think she's kind of just going through the motions at this point when we pick up with them.\"\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming on Netflix.\nFor more on Rory and Logan's romance, watch ET's exclusive interviews with Bledel and Czuchry below.\nRelated Articles\nVictoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016: Must-See Moments Elizabeth Hurley Flaunts Killer Abs at Age 51 Ciara Shows Off Baby Bump on Red Carpet",

      "text": "Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson and Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector in ‘The Fall.’ (Photos: Netflix) More Warning: This interview about the Season 3 finale of The Fall , “Their Solitary Way,”\ncontains spoilers.\nIt’s been a month since the third (and at least for now, final) season of The Fall aired its finale in the U.K. and hit Netflix. Fans now know that Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan), the Belfast Strangler, is dead, having committed suicide, and our hero, Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson), lives to fight another day. Yahoo TV spoke with creator/writer/director Allan Cubitt about the finale’s key scenes, Paul’s amnesia, Stella’s revealing conversations with Dr. O’Donnell (Richard Coyle) and young Katie ( Aisling Franciosi ), and that parting shot of Gibson.\nWe’ll focus on the finale, but to begin: When did you realize that Paul claiming he couldn’t remember the years after 2006 would be the framework for Season 3?\nAllan Cubitt: It was always in my mind when I was looking at what kind of trauma he could suffer as a result of the shooting [ in the Season 2 finale ] and what would be good to complicate the situation for Gibson. I suppose it was partly finding a way of keeping [Gibson and Spector] apart again. Finding that there were once again people interposing themselves between her and him — in this instance, medical professional people. I was interested in the professional reaction to him, given what he stands accused of and given who he might be. [The doctors and nurses] don’t know; he hasn’t been tried and he hasn’t been convicted. I was interested in the tensions it would create — trying to save the life or treat this individual who, all the signs are, is responsible for terrible, terrible things.\nReading reviews of the final episode, and just having conversations with friends, it’s clear people have different opinions about whether Paul’s amnesia was real, in the end. I’m guessing that you love the fact that people are debating that, but how did you view it?\nIt’s not something I want to pronounce, because I do like the fact that people are debating it. It seemed to me that if I resolved it either way by revealing that it was completely fake or by suggesting that it was entirely real, it would be a compromise, it would be a cop-out in some kind of way. I think the ending is so self-destructive. It’s so full of the kind of destructive nature of his character that there’s no doubt that there’s continuity to his character, do you know what I mean? It’s not as if he’s a changed person in that regard, and in part it’s playing off those aspects of his character that always were easier to contemplate — his intelligence or his apparent charm and so on, and how those come to work on other people.\nI think one of the reasons why Dr. Walden is there to say to Dr. Larson, “Look, it has to be malingered” and why Gibson continues to say, “It has to be malingered” is because that’s partly the conclusion that you need to reach. His symptoms are impossible to fake when he first comes around, so he’s genuinely confused, and there may possibly be some foundation to amnesia that’s real in the first instance. But my feeling is that he builds on that. As people keep saying, “If it’s not entirely malingered, then it’s probably exaggerated, and he’s using it toward his own ends.” I think that’s probably the case, because as I say, in the end, he behaves in a way that fulfills his own sort of prophecy in Season 2, where he says to Katie, “Serial murder is a form of slow suicide.” He says to her, “Not my style,” but I think anyone who embarks on crimes of that nature knows that chances are they will perish as a result of it.\nThat smile … More When they decide to suspend the final interrogation scene, there’s that great moment when Gibson is staring at Spector with a look of satisfaction, and Spector smiles. You could read that smile as either, “You got me, I’ve been faking, but I’m figuring out how to attack you now” or “Fine, I’m going to give in — you think the worst of me, if it’s really in there, I’m going to let it out now.”\nYes, I think that’s absolutely right. It sort of wants to be open to interpretation because, I think, what I’m trying to reflect is a kind of reality whereby these things are never clear-cut in the real world either, how far someone is feigning. I mean, it’s partly the conclusion that they sort of move toward in The Sopranos when Dr. Melfi decided that she wasn’t going to treat Tony anymore on the basis of some research that suggested that sociopaths actually enjoy the talking cure because it was a possibility for them to rehearse their responses to situations as if they were a normal person. They cry crocodile tears. The thing that people consistently say about these individuals is that you might see something that looks like remorse, but it’s more likely to be remorse that they’ve been caught than it is remorse for their victims. It’s interesting to me that those things are open to interpretation, and that’s the way it should be, because the reality is that you can never know for sure and so you’re always trying to interpret the signs, you’re always trying to make sense of the thing that’s placed in front of you, working off the best evidence you can. I’m glad you picked up on that moment. It’s a kind of a key one, you’re right.\nRead More Related: On the Set of The Fall: Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan Prepare for a Final Showdown\nSome people think the level of brutality of Spector’s physical attack on Stella is evidence that he had been faking, because there was so much rage. But, on the other hand, this woman had just detailed the sexual abuse he remembers suffering at the orphanage and told him what kind of attention-seeker he’d become and to grow up and accept responsibility for his actions. So again, he could be thinking, “Fine, I’ll be who you say I am.”\nI’ve always wanted to suggest that the people who perpetrate crimes of that sort are driven by a fantastic level of rage, and that’s something that’s been a part of him and was released in Season 1 when he’s attacked by Joe Brawley — his rage was off the charts. We approached the attack on Gibson on the basis that he wouldn’t stop attacking her unless he was stopped from attacking her. There was no sense in which he was teaching her a lesson or something; he would kill her if he was allowed to. But yes, he has, just before that, said, “I’m fascinated by this person. I want to learn who the real Paul Spector is.” The look that he gives her feels as if he has been defeated in some kind of way and that he’s going to react in a Spector-like way, which is to unleash the rage that has obviously been part of his life ever since childhood.\nSpector tracks Stella before attacking her. More The look that Spector gives right before he attacks Stella is absolutely chilling. Did it take a lot of takes to get?\nNo, it was something I saw Jamie do on that shot, as it were. There’s the look beforehand, but there’s also that look that he gives as she walks, where he follows her with his eyes briefly. I knew I had both of those things, and I didn’t ask Jamie to do them, that’s just what he did in the moment. Jamie is, I think, a brilliant actor, and he very much finds those moments for himself. The look he gives there is really stunning because it’s complex — he is both defeated in that moment and defiant in that moment — and it is chilling for the coldness, the contempt.\nBut, of course, he’s fueled by a massive amount of self-contempt. Good actors can make things self-reflective. It’s like in the first episode [of Season 3] when Gibson talks to Tom Stagg in the corridor about the best way to approach Rose, the best way to approach a woman after a sexual assault of some sort, and the brilliant thing about Gillian is that she brings it back to Stella in some kind of way, so you get the sense as she’s doing it that she’s really talking about a time in her life when she needed kindness and tenderness and understanding and didn’t perhaps get them. I think they’re both actors that have the capacity to do that, to make it self-reflective, to make you think, “Oh my God, she’s talking about herself.” That’s a great quality.\nDr. Lawson (Krister Henriksson) sealing Paul’s fate? More When, in your mind, did Paul decide to kill himself? Was it sealed when Dr. Lawson (Krister Henriksson) told him that he was treatable but not curable, that he’d need to learn how to experience feelings and not act on them?\nIt’s an interesting question, isn’t it, because as I say, I think it’s an inevitable end for him. I wanted the audience to think that he might be in the process of trying to get out. In the initial visit to Larson’s office, to find Larson’s office dark and locked, it’s not completely clear, and then of course Larson walks back into the trap, as it were. Spector had seen the plastic bag when Larson stowed his keys away in the airlock, and so he’s got it in his mind … Yes, there comes a point where he thinks the game is up. I’m aware of the fact that, again in reality, quite a few of these individuals do, at that point in time, take the opportunity to take their own life because they want to maintain some kind of control, even if it’s the ultimate self-destructive control. The desire to control the situation, the desire to undermine any sense of Gibson getting satisfaction. Gibson is desperate to see justice done, she’s desperate to see him go to trial, to be convicted, to spend the rest of his life in prison. And like I say, quite a few of these individuals say, “You’re not going to have that satisfaction” — a bit like deciding to take Gibson to see Rose at the end of the second [season], it’s another attempt to regain control of his life. Even if in this instance it’s just his death, he’s in control.\nSpector now knows how his story will end, but Bailey (Conor MacNeill) doesn’t. More It’s somewhere around the Larson conversation that he knows it’s the end of the road for him in some kind of way, and I think it possibly comes in the “man of double deed” and “death and death and death indeed” moment. It’s a sort of death sentence on them both, him and Mark Bailey, though of course Mark Bailey doesn’t know that. So it’s one last revoltingly destructive act, both in terms of the callousness and pointlessness of the murder and then his self-murder as well.\nDeath … More Why does he strangle Mark? Knowing Mark’s backstory with his sister, was there a part of Spector that thought Mark deserved to die, or was he just an easy target to help feed his demons one last time?\nI think it’s both of those things. I think on the conscience level, it transgresses Spector’s view of children — the age of [Mark’s] sister was crucial to Spector’s understanding of it. But that ultimately is just another act of, as you say, feeding his own demons. Again, it’s defiant. It’s going out with a “bang” basically, and not a whimper, to paraphrase T. S. Elliot. It’s an attempt to do that, but it’s futile and hideous as well. So it feels fitting for Spector to make this last grandiose act, but it’s a shabby and disgusting one.\nAnd death … More There is a moment when Paul is dying where he seems to reach up as if he wants to try to stop it.\nI think that was precisely it, not that he would necessarily want to stop it, but again, you’re feeling that sense of, “Oh, my God.” I suppose I feel that for a lot of people, when they’re taking their own life, there must be that moment. People who’ve survived suicide attempts have often reported that in that moment they want to live.\nFrom the very beginning of The Fall , one of the things that I was trying to write about was the will to live, which I think is incredibly strong in people. I’ve talked about this before, but one of the reasons why I had Sally Ann as a neonatal nurse and had the idea that there would be a premature baby in the drama at the beginning, was to try and convey to the audience that, for the most part, all of us have a real will to live, and that that’s apparent in the baby that’s 21 weeks old who has got a powerful urge to live. I was trying to contextualize the idea of someone who then chooses to take other people’s lives: What it is that you’re doing at that point, how horrifying it is that you would snuff out someone’s life. You feel you have the right in some kind of way, or you’re driven to an act of that enormity. I wanted to try and capture something that conveys the horror of the idea that you could end someone else’s life — and that someone would know their life was ending in this sort of squalid and horrible way. So I suppose even Spector has a life force, from that point of view, that might have been struggling against his own actions. I guess that’s why he does the bag and the belt and goes to those lengths to stop himself from saving himself, as it were. He’s beyond redemption.\nRelated: The Fall Postmortem: Creator Allan Cubitt’s Deep Dive Into Season 2\nThere was some conversation after the finale aired in the U.K. about the depiction of Paul’s death. To me, when you have a character talking about “a visible and an invisible world,” you need to show the reality of that moment.\nI think so. I don’t know how you would do it otherwise. One of the things that we’ve always been committed to in The Fall , and I hope this came across in the medical stuff, was to try and make it as real as possible. Obviously, there are ways in which you cut around that and cut away from it, and you don’t want it to be overly graphic and so on, but I think it could have been deeply unsatisfying if you didn’t have a sense of what he was doing, or how he had done it. If you simply came back to find him dead on the floor, it could have been really quite anticlimactic. But also because, as I say, it’s a squalid ending, I didn’t push it. I’ve seen deaths of that sort before where they concentrate on the fact that people urinate and defecate and all the rest of it; we didn’t do any of that. It was trying to address the reality of the situation, but I don’t think it was especially graphic compared to some of the other things I’ve seen in other dramas across the years. But it was shocking, I think.\nGibson shares her similar backstory with Katie (Aisling Franciosi) after hearing she’s cutting herself. More You’re also weaving that Spector sequence with Stella’s conversation with Katie, as Stella’s trying to convince her to fight for herself. That was surprising, to see Stella open up and reveal more of her own backstory about how she, too, cut herself after her father’s death.\nRight from the very beginning, I’d always seen Gibson as an enigmatic character, someone who reveals herself only little by little and slightly reluctantly gives up any of her own personal details. She’d hinted at it at the beginning of the second season by saying to Annie Brawley, “I once found having a band around the wrist and flicking it helped me, you might find it helps you.”\nShe goes further than that in the conversation with Katie, but I think that’s because I wanted her to reunite with the feminine side of herself, if you like, that she’s at times had to batten down. Particularly in the third season, it’s been eating away at her — it happens when she’s watching Sally Ann, and it happens when she goes to see Olivia in the hospital — so it’s something that’s coming to the fore in Gibson. That was a conscious and deliberate emotional arc for her in the piece. She’s operating, as she says to Ferrington, in a patriarchal, paramilitary organization, and that’s the world in which she’s chosen to work for all kinds of really quite powerful reasons. Right from the very beginning my idea was always that she has a particular interest in protecting and saving female lives. So the focus across those seasons began to narrow down to Rose and to Olivia and ultimately to Katie.\nNow Katie, or Sally Ann for that matter, is not someone she had taken a particular interest in prior to that — seeing Katie as someone who was acting out in an adolescent kind of way and was basically creating problems. But there’s something about the self-harming that strikes a chord with Gibson whereby she feels that Katie is someone who can be redeemed. I suppose what I was going for, without it being simplistic, was the idea that Katie stands a chance of surviving. Just as I think Olivia stands a chance of surviving — that last scene with Olivia is supposed to do something of a similar sort. I wanted Gibson, basically, to be talking to Katie at that point more as a woman, rather than as a police officer or someone with that kind of world experience, and as a corrective to what it was that Spector represented and stood for throughout the course of the drama.\nRelated: The Fall Star Gillian Anderson Takes Us Inside Stella Gibson’s Mind\nI’ve always had this notion that it really is about the power of love. There’s scenes right from the very beginning [of the series], the scenes with Sarah Kay’s sister or Sarah Kay’s father are always the ones that I would find most moving in terms of writing them — the sort of sense that people are connected to one another, they have loving relationships and those loving relationships are the things that allow us to survive. Bit by bit, we begin to understand that Spector’s been starved of those loving relationships at a crucial, formative time. What Gibson is saying [to Katie] is, “Look, we both lost our fathers and that’s traumatic to us, but we were loved. We were loved when we were little. We were loved and supported, and that gives us strength.” And of course by implication, that’s the strength that Spector doesn’t quite have. Which is why even Olivia might survive, because she has actually been loved despite the terrible destructive nature of Spector’s influence on her life.\nIt seemed to me that it was where the heart of The Fall lies, and it’s also that corrective to what it is that Spector’s doing, which is this extremely masculine, destructive behavior — which is, as I say, a kind of male response to powerlessness, a deep and abiding rage, for some men. What Gibson’s talking about is being creative and nurturing and saying, “You won’t get any of that stuff from him. You need to put him out of your mind because he won’t support you, and he doesn’t love you, and he doesn’t even know you exist, he doesn’t care about you at all, and it’s crazy that you have any vested emotion or investment in him.”\nDr. O’Donnell (Richard Coyle) has a late-night chat with Stella. More Another revealing scene was when Dr. O’Donnell sat with Stella in the hospital and began asking her questions. I loved the way they played that.\nIt’s quite an interesting thing to me that in myth, there’s quite often what is sometimes seen as a kind of campfire scene after an ordeal. If they survive that ordeal, there’s a scene of regrouping, and it’s often a downbeat, quite quiet scene. So you’ve had the brutality of the attack on her, and then in the middle of the night, someone pays a visit and it doesn’t advance the plot [laughs], it’s just a character moment.\nI was conscious of the fact that I wanted there to be some good men in The Fall . And O’Donnell might be a little bit arrogant and a bit full of himself, but he’s definitely a good man. And Larson is a genuinely beautiful man, I think. I just thought it was ironic and it amused me, the idea that Gibson would reveal more of herself in terms of personal details to someone who is in some ways a complete stranger than she had across the entire three seasons thus far. I found that enjoyable and I thought rightly that they played it very well. They had a bond there that was two professionals who do these fantastically difficult jobs and they do them with great commitment and at some personal cost. I think if he’s a full-on A&E consultant, then there’s no doubt that by the time he’s 40, you start to think, “Oh my God, there must be some other way of making a live.” Because it’s exhausting and demanding. I have massive respect. I had a really brilliant A&E consultant who worked on the series with me, and just the times when he would text me, “Oh, I’m at work,” and I would hear bits of local news, like someone being attacked with a samurai sword or something, and then I’d talk to him and he’d say, “Yeah, he came in and his arm was severed and we couldn’t save …” It’s extraordinary that people are doing that sort of thing all the time, making an attempt to save people’s lives regardless of whether they’ve been stupid, or whether they had done something daft, or if they’re reprehensible characters.\nHe harks back to that idea that, during the troubles [in Northern Ireland], you could have someone who’d set a bomb and blown themselves up and blown up other people as well, but you’d be treating people, as he says, according to their clinical needs, not according to your attitude toward them or your moral judgments about them. I thought that was interesting.\nThe hero returns home. More Their conversation is also nice because he asks Stella if she likes flowers, and we hear she does, and then when we see her return home to her flat at the end of the finale, she’s brought some with her. Was that always how you imagined the final shot of Stella — returning home alone, drinking wine in front of the flowers she’d abandoned when she left for Belfast, avoiding opening her mail?\nThe thing I didn’t get to shoot was her stopping at a delicatessen and buying the flowers, and so someone said to me at some point, “Who gave her the flowers?” [laughs] I was like, “It was just I never managed to shoot the scene where she bought them.” So, no, they hadn’t been sent by Spector or something. But yes, just a little bit of beauty, I suppose, a little bit of “and then life goes on” kind of feeling. Just positioning her so that hopefully you’re thinking what a traumatic journey she’s been on and yet she’s still standing. “She’s my hero, and she’s still there.” It’s a hollow victory to be sure, but she survived. As she said to Rose, “You survived. That’s what’s important is you survive.” How people cope with trauma is again one of the things The Fall is about: You go through traumatic events and it’s so important how you seek to deal with those traumas, and who can deal with them and who can’t. Again, she’s saying to Katie, “You can deal with these things if you get loving support from the people who really care for you, but you can’t survive traumas otherwise, I don’t think.”\nRose reads the Grimm Brothers’ ‘The Frog King’ to her daughter. More You mentioned Rose. There’s that scene with her reading the Grimm Brothers’ The Frog King to her daughter, with the princess throwing the frog against the wall instead of kissing him. How should we interpret that moment?\nI’m one of those writers who finds a resonance and enjoys it. I’m a conscious artist, if you like, but at the same time, I like what happens if you just set something up to resonate and you leave it for people to interpret. Partly, it’s got to do with Rose has survived and her daughter has not lost her mother. They’ve got that bond, and that bond will mean that maybe Rose will get over what she’s been through but also her daughter will grow up loved and supported by her parents, and particularly her mother in that instance. But yes, it is that inversion, it is retelling some of those kind of classic tales from a more feminist, more female point of view.\nI read an interesting deconstruction of “Blue Beard,” which applies well. At the end of that, the person who’s naïve has to gain knowledge and realize that this man is essentially a serial killer, as it happens, but in the story, she’s saved by her brothers just in time. But of course you can view that as being actually her growing on the forces of her own animus, you know? It’s finding those strengths within you. One of the things The Fall has always been about for me is Spector as a sort of dark intruder represents all our fears about what might be out there, but you have to balance that with the bravery to go out into the world and achieve things in the world. So she’s saying essentially to her daughter, “You can’t be naïve about this stuff. There are dangers out there, and you need to recognize them. Not because you want to spend your life cowering in fear, the reverse; because you need to properly integrate those fears to make you a stronger person who understands that there is a shadow side to life.” The fairy tales are all very strong in that respect, and it seemed like a nice idea given the mythic quality. [ Laughs ] One of the things I’m always trying to do is to make a story work with the power of a myth. Gibson’s been on a quest: She leaves the normal world and she goes into an abnormal world and she brings hope to some people and she, basically, survives. She comes through it, and there are lessons learned, and some lives have been touched along the way. Some healing can be done, so let the healing begin, I suppose, is partly the idea.\nAssistant Chief Constable Burns (John Lynch) loses it after Spector attacks Stella More I also wanted to ask about Assistant Chief Constable Burns (John Lynch). The amount of drinking he was doing, and the way he yelled for DCI Eastwood (Stuart Graham) to get his hands off of him when Burns went after Spector following Stella’s attack, made me wonder if there was more at work there than Burns simply having investigated the pedophile Father Jensen.\nIt does feel like that. I think his investment in that is more than just a police officer who was traumatized by what he discovered on the arrest. I think it’s a police officer who’s had some history of abuse himself. The “get your hands off me” could just be a rank thing, like, “I’m your superior, how dare you touch me,” but because John was in tears when he said it… I think he’d got himself into a place whereby the torch that he’s carried for Gibson, which might be even the reason why he brought her in, in the first place, has gotten nowhere; he’d been to see Father Jensen [in jail in Season 2’s “The Perilous Edge of Battle,” asking for information about Spector] and had found that a futile and painful experience; and he’s ridden with guilt about things like that happening in the Catholic church and him being a Catholic, which is not to say it doesn’t happen in every other kind of church as well, but you know what I mean. Of course, Gibson’s reply to that would be, “Well, you have these ‘boys only’ clubs, then these things are going to occur.” But I think you’re right: his ultimate demise would suggest that he’s had some experience or abuse that goes beyond just arresting a pedophile and hearing the horrors.\nAlso, I was playing around with the idea that anyone who was a police officer in Northern Ireland through the troubles has been traumatized, and it’s a question of how they deal with it. They’ve seen so much carnage, so much death and destruction, as a younger police officer. I had a speech that he made about his past and how he got into being a police officer and the implications for his family in becoming a police officer as a Catholic, but I ended up taking it out. I don’t think I achieved it particularly well, so it ended up hitting the cutting room floor. But yes, a sad arc to Burns’s story. [ Laughs ]\nDS Anderson (Colin Morgan) after trying to stop Spector’s attack on Stella More And Anderson’s arm will be okay?\nAh, poor Anderson, yes it is. Yes it is. I don’t think it’s the end of his career.\nI’ve seen you say that you’d be open to doing more of The Fall in the future, but that you have other things that you may want to pursue first. Is there any update on either end?\nI don’t know at the moment, really. I kind of positioned it with Gibson so I could [do more], but I would need to have — and I don’t think I do have at the moment — a compelling story that I want to tell. Some of the things that I think about as potential stories, I feel like I’ve already covered some of the ground through Spector. Some of the issues, for example, surrounding criminality which are about childhood, about some of the dysfunctions and things that lead people to behaving in anti-social ways, so right now I’m not chomping at the bit to write another crime story, to be honest.\nI’ve been working on a play at the moment. I’m adapting a dark and intense novel by a guy called Eugene McCabe, [ Death and Nightingales ], which is set in County Fermanagh, so it’s another Northern Irish project but in the 1880s. That’s exciting. It’s a powerful, slightly Gothic kind of love story. I have a lot of ideas in the early stages of developing which would allow me to try and do something a little bit different again, perhaps with TV drama. I think a lot of television is based on other television programs, and I think it’s incumbent on us all to try and come up with things that don’t feel like that. The best shows feel fresh and original in some kind of way and you don’t think, “Oh, I’ve seen all this before.” But there’s a lot of telly that you watch where you think, “I’ve seen this before.” I have a particular bête noire which is characters who are talking in a kind of TV language rather than having a psychological truth to them. I like things to be about something, and not all TV dramas are.\n(Credit: Netflix) More To that end, is the message of The Fall encapsulated by that Quote: Stella hangs on her refrigerator? Does it go back to what you were saying earlier about love being the key to overcoming trauma?\nIt’s not the message of the show, but it’s an important part of the message of the show. [ Laughs ] If that makes sense. It’s [Nurse] Sheridan’s message to Spector, but obviously it resonates with her. And it’s coming from a simpler place than Gibson would articulate. I loved the character Sheridan, and I loved the relationship between her and Spector. Again, she’s trying to save him in some kind of way. Of course she’s his ICU nurse, so she has a very important critical care kind of relationship with him, but she obviously sees something in him that she’s attempting to redeem him again and say to him, “Whatever you’ve done and whoever you are, there is the possibility of redemption.” She’s coming obviously from some kind of religious place, and therefore the religious Quote: is a reflection of that. That’s one of the things that religion, at its best, offers — the idea that you can be redeemed. Spector would say he can’t, and Larson says, “Well, you can’t be cured,” so there are correctives to that view.\nI think the fundamental thing is true, that if you’re not loved, then you do abide in death, but that is not to say that someone like Spector, by being loved at this point in his life… The thing that really fascinates me, and the thing that haunts me, is there’s obviously arguments about whether there’s a genetic predisposition. And therefore Gibson’s very interested when she hears that Spector’s biological father is in jail for murder. She says, “A female victim?” and is told, “No, a male victim.” She’s obviously immediately thinking, “Is there some genetic predisposition?” For the most part, I think these individuals are made by appalling life circumstances, and, of course, there are people who go through similar traumas in childhood and don’t grow up to be murderers, who grow up to be good, upstanding citizens and loving fathers and things. Love in itself at the right time for Spector could have saved him perhaps, as a child.\nAll three seasons of The Fall are streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "AT&T on Monday afternoon unveiled pricing and bundling details of its much-anticipated DirecTV Now streaming video service, which launches Wednesday for as little as $35 per month, and Wall Street on Tuesday morning started discussing what it will mean for content companies, Netflix and the broader pay TV industry.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall in a report asked whether the streaming service was \"good for media?\" DirecTV has unveiled \"a potentially great product with Now, in our view, that leverages having some of the best programming costs in the business due to scale, as we think DirecTV's programming costs are some 20 percent-30 percent below the industry average,\" he said. \"This may force competitor products to come down to DirecTV's price point even if their wholesale costs are much higher.\"\nThis would not only be good news for consumers, but will \"as a result likely mitigate pay TV sub erosion, though by how much is impossible to know just yet,\" Cahall argued. \"On the flipside, we think some of those subs may come from smaller linear multichannel video programming distributors, and virtual multichannel video programming distributors' churn would be higher.\"\nConcluded the analyst: \"We see the mitigation of TV sub erosion as THE biggest issue for media investors. We see DirecTV Now and future launches as constructive to media valuations.\"\nTelsey Advisory Group analyst Thomas Eagan said Tuesday that he also remains bullish on pay TV companies and doesn't expect \"material cannibalization yet from DirecTV Now.\"\nDiscussing its effect on competitors, Wells Fargo analyst Marci Quote: : \"We view this product as competition for the Slings and PlayStation Vues of the world rather than for the core cable customer.\" She concluded it would be \"no real threat\" for cable operators.\nRead more: AT&T Exec on Getting Reese Witherspoon, Taylor Swift for DirecTV Now; Why CBS Is Missing\nEagan similarly wrote in a report that the new service \"could compete with [Dish's] SlingTV,\" while \"Netflix [is] still a complement.\" He explained: \"While we estimate the number of broadband-only video households grows to 5 million this year, it's still relatively small and price elastic to support multiple OTT players. We, therefore, expect share shift from within OTT services. We see DISH's SlingTV (the only other live TV streaming service) as vulnerable due to the streaming issues that have lowered retention. Conversely, we see a neutral to possibly favorable impact to Netflix. With its original programming and low price, it remains a complement to a pay TV or streamed base package.\"\nWhich consumers will DirecTV Now appeal to? \"Priced at between $30-$50 per month, the cost with broadband could total $80-$100 per month yielding nominal savings versus pay TV for households that watch a lot of TV, especially with only 1-2 streams,\" Eagan said.\nCahall said DirecTV Now's starting price point of $35 per month should help it make a statement compared with competitors from launch. \"This offer, while potentially not money-making on a per-sub basis, should help Now attract critical mass in subs early on,\" he wrote. \"The unusually low on-sale $35 per month price point [promotion] for the $60 per month package suggests to us that AT&T has more business in mind. For one, DirecTV Now will stream free on AT&T mobile subs, suggesting gaining mobile subscribers is a key cross-sell strategy of Now. Secondly, we suspect that AT&T hopes to graduate Now subs up to premium DirecTV packages over time at far more accretive price points, long-term contracts etc.\"\nOverall, he argued that AT&T and other companies planning streaming video service launches are using content as a cross-seller. Peers \"will also have additional services unique to their respective businesses they will seek to promote and cross-sell with, including Hulu (media now owning some distribution), YouTube (adding Google/YouTube users) and potentially Amazon and Apple,\" Cahall said. \"The 'content as a cross-sell' model is, In our view, the reason AT&T is paying such a premium for Time Warner.\"\nRead more: AT&T Unveils Pricing, Content Details for DirecTV Now Streaming Service, Teams With Reese Witherspoon",

Credit: Photo by Ken Jones Close Machine learning is a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from fraud detection and sorting spam in Google, to making movie recommendations on Netflix. \nNow a team of researchers from the University of Toronto Scarborough has developed a novel approach in using it to determine whether planetary systems are stable or not. \n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" says Dan Tamayo, lead author of the research and a postdoctoral fellow in the Centre for Planetary Science at U of T Scarborough. \nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. \n\"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" he says. \nIt's important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed. It can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation. \nThere are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, notes Tamayo. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is the result of a series of workshops at U of T Scarborough covering how machine learning could help tackle specific scientific problems. The research is currently published online in the Astrophysical Journal Letters . \n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he adds. \nIt may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year. The two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system. \n\"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" says Tamayo. \n\"It could be a very useful tool in better understanding those systems.\" \n  University of Toronto .
