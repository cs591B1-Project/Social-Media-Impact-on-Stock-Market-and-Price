      "text": " Google+\nLane Turner/Globe Staff\nMaster mechanic Rick Chadwick changes tires on a cab at Tommy&apos;s Taxi in Framingham.\nBy Lenny Megliola Globe Correspondent November 25, 2016\nFRAMINGHAM — A town can be synonymous with myriad things: a historical building; a college; great sports teams.\nBut a taxi company?\nAdvertisement\n“I was born and raised in Framingham, and I take a lot of pleasure working in a business that’s part of the fabric of the community,” said Jo-Anne Thompson, owner of Tommy’s Taxi. “We’re kind of an institution.”\nWith competition from new-wave companies like Lyft and Uber, Tommy’s Taxi must be doing something right. It’s been taking Metrowest residents to airports, beauty salons, shopping centers, movies and doctor’s appointments for 70 years.\nIf you’re stranded somewhere, Tommy’s is at your service. “We do a lot of bar pickup. It’s the safest way to get home,” said Thompson. “And there’s nothing like a big snowstorm for business. The phone just rings and rings. We tell them it might be a two-hour wait. And their driveway must be clear [of snow].”\nThompson, 63, never married. She took over the downtown business in 1999 after her father, John, died. He started the company on a whim in 1946 with one car, a 1939 Oldsmobile. “I never thought I’d go in the taxi business,” she said. “I resisted for a long time. I’m an only child. It wasn’t an attractive picture of the life I wanted to have.”\nThompson was a college graduate (Skidmore), taught English at Framingham North High and worked at Data General in Westborough as a marketing writer.\nAdvertisement\nIn 1986 she began to give her dad a helping hand. “I started coming in nights and weekends to set up the accounting. Then I started doing a little bit of everything.”\nShe’s been there ever since, only now she’s the boss. Her yellow taxis, about 30, are familiar sights around Framingham, the most-populated town — almost 70,000 — in Massachusetts. Tommy’s breadth of service is significant, picking up and dropping off passengers in Marlborough, Ashland, Wayland, Northborough, Natick, Westborough, and Clinton.\nSome customers use Tommy’s Taxi so frequently that the dispatcher, often Thompson, just has to tell the driver “go get Ken.”\nNatick resident Mildred Hutchins, 65, doesn’t drive, but has two jobs: at Waterview Lodge rehabilitation and healthcare in Ashland and MetroWest Medical Center in Natick. She uses Tommy’s Taxi for everything. “I live alone. If they folded I’d be very sad because I wouldn’t be able to get anywhere,” she said.\nGetting customers to their destination on time is critical. “If I call and say I need a taxi at 2 o’clock, it’s here at 2,” said Hutchins.\nFramingham resident Antonio Paiva, 53, was in a car accident in Brazil when he was 18. He hasn’t driven since. In March he had brain surgery. He works at Five Guys in Framingham and takes a cab every morning at 6. “They’re always on time,” he said. “The drivers are reliable. Whatever I do, I take a cab.”\nThe company has about 43 drivers; two are women. Framingham resident Sean Murphy, 50, has been driving for the company for 17 years. “I like the social aspect of the job, talking to the people,” he said. “Some people hate driving. I love it.”\nOK, there are setbacks. “One person threw up in the back seat,” said Murphy. “Another time a guy spilled a bottle of whisky. I had to clean it up so they didn’t think I was drinking on the job. I’m a cab driver. It’s not a glorious job.\n“But it’s easy when you enjoy what you do. I didn’t go to school to do this, but it’s what I want to do.” Murphy is divorced, and has put two children through college. He said the company has good benefits and health care.\nTommy’s Taxi minivans are a familiar presence at Logan Airport. Murphy has taken customers as far as Albany, N.Y. “I kill for those trips. We get paid by commission.”\nThompson does all the hiring and says her vetting of applicants is extraordinarily thorough. “Then I have them checked out by the Framingham Police Department. My drivers are employees, not independent contractors.”\nThompson never thought she’d do this for basically half her life. She may have started to just help her dad, but she’s found that the taxi business is in her blood. Well, pretty much. “It’s not a glamorous lifestyle,” she said. “We open at 5 a.m. every day and close at 1 a.m., 2 a.m. on weekends.” Occasionally even later. She concedes Lyft and Uber are “definitely competition.”\nWhen John Thompson served in World War II soldiers started calling him “Tommy” because of his last name. It stuck. When the war ended he returned to Framingham and went to work to help the family. He had seven siblings. Tommy delivered oil and ice. One of his stops was Framingham’s Cushing Hospital where wounded servicemen were treated.\nThen he started the taxi company. Framingham had a much different vibe in the 50’s and 60’s. Downtown bustled with three movie theaters — St. George, Gorman and Hollis — and fancy stores like Gilchrist’s. It had the Kendall Hotel. For years though, Framingham has struggled to bring life back to the downtown area. Not much is left of the past.\nBut Jo-Anne’s company keeps rollin’ along. Her regular customers are ever grateful. “I really need Tommy’s Taxi,” said Antonio Paiva. It’s 6 a.m. His cab is waiting.\nLane Turner/Globe Staff\nJo-Anne Thompson talks with dispatcher Bob Cummins and customer service representative Devon Esty. Thompson took over after her father, who founded Tommy’s Taxi, died in 1999.\nReach Lenny Megliola at lennymegs@aol.com . Follow him on Twitter @lennymegs .",

      "text": " Google+\nGary Cameron/Reuters/File\nSenator Elizabeth Warren was considered to be a skilled interrogator of witnesses during committee hearings.\nBy Victoria McGrane and Annie Linskey Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Capitol Hill is abuzz with speculation that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will pursue a new high-profile Senate committee assignment as she seeks to reach beyond being Washington’s chief Wall Street critic and become the Democrats’ most powerful Donald Trump antagonist.\nOne position some in the Senate believe Warren is eyeing is a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThe panel will be the epicenter of Democrats’ efforts to challenge Trump’s pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, on the US Supreme Court, one of the most consequential battles looming on the Senate’s horizon.\nAnd it appears that Democrats will have an opening to fill on the judiciary panel. New York Senator Chuck Schumer will be stepping down from all his current committee assignments when he takes over as Senate minority leader next year, said Schumer spokesman Matt House. That includes Schumer’s seat on the Judiciary Committee.\nThe seasonal game of musical committee assignments on Capitol Hill is far from over, and it’s being overseen by Schumer, a savvy and strategic political operator.\nCongress watchers say the incoming Senate Democratic leader will be looking to award coveted committee slots in ways that best serve the entire Democratic caucus. Several Capitol Hill sources expressed skepticism that Schumer would give Warren, a first-term senator, preference over other lawmakers who are interested in the panel.\nSchumer’s spokesman declined to comment on Warren’s potential committee assignments, as did Warren’s office.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Warren’s talent for delivering that YouTube moment while grilling witnesses during hearings and her well-honed legal skills could be a boost for Democrats as they take on Trump’s first Supreme Court pick. And there could be more, since three of the remaining eight justices are over the age of 75.\nSimultaneously, the perch would enable Warren to expand her issue portfolio beyond her involvement in Wall Street reform and middle-class economic welfare to other heavyweight topics.\nThe Judiciary Committee oversees immigration issues, for instance, and Democrats believe it could play a central role in pushing back against Trump’s controversial immigration ideas such as barring Muslims from immigrating to the country.\nWarren has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in the weeks since the election.\nShe blasted the president-elect’s choice of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general, saying Trump should rethink his decision, essentially saying that the Sessions nomination continued “the bigotry that fueled his campaign.”\nOtherwise, Warren said, it would be up to the Senate to “exercise fundamental moral leadership” and reject Sessions.\nSessions’ nomination will be considered by the Judiciary Committee, which also exercises oversight of the Justice Department.\n‘You want someone who is going to look at the record and ask tough questions.’\nWarren’s statement was a sharp contrast to the more measured reaction put out by other Democrats, whose news releases reflected the tradition of treating fellow senators with a collegial touch. Her response was cheered by liberal advocates who believe Democrats must adopt a take-no-prisoners stance against the Trump administration.\n“Elizabeth Warren has a unique and spectacular ability to ask laser-like questions . . . that break through the political fog,” said Ben Wikler, Washington director of the progressive group MoveOn. If she can do to Trump’s Supreme Court nominee what she’s done to bank executives and regulators, “the country will benefit enormously,” he said.\nWarren would “be terrific” on the judiciary panel, said Judith Schaeffer, vice president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.\nShe praised Warren’s grilling of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf a few months ago — Warren accused him of displaying “gutless leadership” and told him to resign — as a model of the senator’s ability and willingness to challenge people before the committee.\n“You want someone who is going to look at the record and ask tough questions,” Schaeffer said.\nShe also pointed to Warren’s statement on Sessions for having “none of this Senate clubby stuff. . . . It was ‘Look at his record. This is of grave concern.’ ”\nSome observers see Warren as being of limited utility to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\nIlya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said that if Democrats try to block Trump’s Supreme Court nominee next year, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell will “go nuclear” and change Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\nA change instituted by Democrats three years ago means that all other executive branch nominees need only a simple majority vote to be confirmed, but Supreme Court nominees still must get 60 votes to succeed.\nWarren’s fighting style on the Judiciary Committee could be a good move for Democrats in terms of firing up their base and raking in campaign donations, Shapiro said\n“A YouTube moment, I’m sure, would be useful for fund-raising, but, at the end of the day, she’s not going to be convincing one of the Republicans on the other side to vote against” Trump’s nominee, he said. “In fact, quite the opposite. Depending on how stridently she would approach it, she could solidify the Republicans in terms of voting to get rid of the filibuster.”\nOver the summer, Warren hinted at interest in one major issue covered by the Judiciary Committee when she delivered a big speech calling for far more muscular antitrust enforcement — including for tech giants like Apple, Google, and Amazon.\nMore recently, she has repeatedly made statements about the need for Democrats to stand up to bigotry in all its forms.\nBut it’s not entirely clear the committee assignment would be the best match for her interests.\n“I don’t think she’s seen primarily as a leader on issues like civil rights, domestic surveillance, voting rights,” and other issues at the core of the Judiciary Committee’s mission, said Steven A. Cash, a former chief counsel to California Senator Dianne Feinstein, who will be the top Democrat on the judiciary panel next year.\n“She is best known for her involvement in financial and banking issues,’’ Cash said. “That said, I have no doubt that if she wanted to, she could become expert in those things. She is a true utility infielder type.”\nWarren’s current assignments include the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which most Warren watchers believe she will retain. She also serves on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the Energy and Natural Resources panels.\nVictoria McGrane can be reached at victoria.mcgrane@globe.com .

      "title": "Helping the police help people with mental illness",
      "text": " Google+\nMikael Damkier /Fotolia\n November 26, 2016\nF or families, there’s probably no situation more stressful than dealing with a loved one in the throes of a psychotic episode. For police, there are probably few distress calls more unpredictable. A bill before the Legislature could help more police across the state assist those with mental illness who are the subject of 911 calls and, in the process, divert these individuals away from the criminal justice system and toward mental health services. In doing so, they could save the state money as well as lives.\nThe bill , filed by Senator Jason Lewis, to establish a “Center of Excellence in Community Policing and Behavioral Health,” would standardize and expand the crisis intervention training that many departments across the state now use. The center would establish a central clearinghouse and research center for best practices in dealing with people with mental illness and those with substance abuse issues, as well as provide training. The center would also make resources available statewide that departments now piece together individually.\nAdvertisement\nThe training itself would help officers recognize symptoms of mental illness and guide them in how to approach people who appear disoriented and on the verge of harming themselves or others. In most cases, the protocol is far different from — even the opposite of — how police deal with violent criminal offenders: a soft, conversational voice instead of loud commands, addressing the person by name, trying to avoid a show of force. Simple adjustments can be made, such as not using a siren or shining lights in someone’s eyes. In all cases, the emphasis is on de-escalation of a situation that could easily grow violent, even lethal. Meanwhile, an arrest can lead to a downward spiral for those struggling with severe mental illness — job loss, the breakup of families,\nhomelessness.\nThe Massachusetts chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that 25 percent of inmates in state correctional facilities are receiving mental health treatment, and up to 50 percent of men in local jails and county houses of correction. At MCI Framingham, for women, the rate is as high as 70 percent. These inmates, often incarcerated for minor offenses, are not eligible for Medicaid, and so their treatment falls to the taxpayer. This doesn’t even begin to include the baseline costs for incarceration, and the strain on local resources, from police departments through the courts and the Department of Correction. And there’s also the human cost of wrecked lives.\nOf course, no amount of training can guarantee a\npositive outcome for every situation. (The death in October of Terrence Coleman , a man suffering with mental illness who was shot by police, was a stark reminder of how these moments can escalate out of control.) But the proposed bill gives police — and families — much better odds, and would make for safer, healthier communities.",

      "text": " Google+\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nStudents worked in the plumbing shop at Worcester Technical High School in 2014.\nBy Michael Levenson Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nMore than 3,000 students were on wait lists for vocational education programs in Massachusetts last year, evidence of growing demand for the specialized training that can help students find their way into well-paying careers in health care and manufacturing.\nThe finding, part of a new report by the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, could lend momentum to efforts to reduce the backlog of students, many of whom may not excel in traditional high school classrooms.\nAdvertisement\nThe report found, however, that it would cost the state $27 million annually to eliminate the wait list of 3,200 students and to provide seats for 2,200 additional students who would probably enroll if the state were to expand vocational classes to the 50 mostly rural communities that have no such programs.\nChris Gabrieli, chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education, said the report underscored the importance of providing more access to vocational high schools, some of which are immensely popular with parents and children.\nPresident Obama, for example, spoke at Worcester Technical High School in 2014 and noted the school had 400 students on its wait list.\n“It’s really striking,” Gabrieli said Friday. “Voc schools used to be thought of as a track kids would be sent to who weren’t seen as good material for the general population high school. Now, you’ve got these in-demand voc-tech schools that have waiting lists. It’s almost as if they were charter schools.”\nBecause the state does not track wait lists at vocational schools, the report was based on figures provided by the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators.\nAdvertisement\nMost of the 3,200 students on wait lists live in Worcester, Springfield, New Bedford, Brockton, and other “gateway cities,” generally considered to be those with stubborn economic challenges, the report said.\nBoston does not have a wait list for its lone program, Madison Park Technical Vocational High School, which has struggled for years with low MCAS scores and graduation rates.\nThe $27 million price tag was based on the $5,000 in additional costs per pupil the state would have to spend to send 5,400 more children to regional vocational schools. It does not include the costs of any new school buildings.\nNoah Berger, president of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning research group, suggested the investment was well worth it. He pointed to studies that show students in high-quality vocational education programs are more likely to enroll in college and can boost their annual earnings by about 11 percent, or roughly $2,500.\n“There’s a lot of evidence that vocational schools are effective and are a good investment,” Berger said. “This is definitely one of the things we should be thinking about, in addition to smaller class sizes, early education, and other reforms that have proven effective.”\nNancy Hoffman — a member of the state Board of Higher Education and a senior adviser at Jobs for the Future, an education nonprofit — said she was glad the report highlighted vocational schools in Massachusetts, which she said are among the best in the country. But she said quality technical education doesn’t have to be confined to vocational high schools.\n“The real problem in Massachusetts and across the country is that, because we have had a high premium on high academic performance, any career education is gone from comprehensive high schools,” Hoffman said. “So what you’re really doing is bifurcating what should be a single way of thinking about schooling: that everybody goes to high school to get a career.”\nHoffman said she was doubtful the state, which faces perennial budget strains, would be able to eliminate the wait list. But she said officials are planning to expand other career-focused initiatives, such as early college programs that allow high school students to earn college credit.\n“So getting people off the wait list in the current vocational schools is only one part of a larger set of questions which are under debate in a very promising way in the state,” she said.\nThe Baker administration responded to the report with a statement saying it was proud of its support for vocational education, which includes $24 million in grants over two years that were recently announced to expand such programs statewide. The statement added that “over the coming months we will continue our expanded investments in career technical education and explore new ways to enable all students to have access to quality programs which will lead to successful career pathways.”\nEdward A. Bouquillon, superintendent-director of the Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School District in Lexington, said more support is needed to meet demand. He said Minuteman saw a 40 percent increase in applications last year from its 16 member towns, and a 60 percent increase in applications from other cities and towns, including Boston. He said that, though Minuteman has open seats, some programs have wait lists.\n“Parents are starting to question the huge investment and, in most cases, the crippling debt load,” associated with a four-year college degree, Bouquillon said. “At vocational-technical schools, we tell parents we create in the kids a light at the end of the tunnel. We help them discover what they love to do and do well, and connect that to a college major or a career.”\nMichael Levenson can be reached at mlevenson@\nglobe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nVaughan Merchant/Canadian Press\nScenic views along the Cabot Trail in Cape Breton.\nBy Brian MacQuarrie Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nALDER POINT, Nova Scotia — Scott Erickson, a burly 54-year-old fisherman on remote Cape Breton Island, is thanking the political gods that the Americans — finally — have chosen a new president.\n“For the past year or so, that’s all I’ve heard about,” said Erickson, the frowning skipper of the 36-foot Nick and Jen.\nAdvertisement\nBut Erickson, who hauls lobsters for a living, could be hearing about the divisive election for a while. Some Americans who are worried about a Donald Trump presidency are looking northward, to Cape Breton, as a possible refuge.\nCape Bretoners are calling it the “Trump Bump,” and much of the attention can be traced directly to a website — called Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins — that a local radio host launched in February as part lark, part marketing ploy, and part political statement.\nMore than 2 million visitors have tapped the site since then, three-quarters of them American, and the flood of Web hits, e-mails, and phone calls is spiking again since Trump was elected Nov. 8.\nAlso, on election night, the official Canadian immigration website crashed amid a surge in traffic. The island’s official tourism office has been inundated with interest, too.\n“I’ve been getting e-mails from Americans: ‘Please help me. How do I move?’ ” said Mary Tulle, chief executive officer of Destination Cape Breton.\nAdvertisement\n“Would this have happened without the Trump Bump? No, it would not have happened,” Tulle said. “It’s all the same message: It’s people expressing fear.”\nCape Bretoners say they have never seen anything like it. The rugged island is known for its beautiful Cabot Trail, its fiddlers and Scottish Highland heritage, and its close-knit bond with nature.\nIt also was known for much of the 20th century for sending job-starved immigrants to “The Boston States,” as America had long been known here. And when the steel plant and last coal mines shut down more than a decade ago, the people continued to flow outbound. Now, just maybe, the tide might be reversing.\nRob Calabrese, the radio host who launched the Cape Breton if Trump Wins website, said he spends about an hour every day answering e-mails from the United States.\n“I’m still half-convinced that this must be a joke, but I’m willing to play along for now,” a 40-year-old Massachusetts man wrote to Calabrese. “I am, however, no longer joking about the plight of this nation. . . . I believe more and more that the USA is facing some ugly times.”\nCalabrese was stunned by the response. In a single day shortly after the website was created, 250,000 visitors called up its photos of gorgeous scenery and information about relocating. In all, more than 6,000 people have gone a step further and made contact with Calabrese.\nThe site began as a whimsical effort to help stem out-migration. “We’re hemorrhaging people here,” Calabrese said. But another reason was his alarm at Trump’s rhetoric.\n“At first, I enjoyed following along because he was a clownish character,” Calabrese said. “But when he made the comment about the Muslim ban, he seemed to move to being more of a danger.”\nTrepidation about Trump has not fueled all the traffic, said Calabrese, who works in blue-collar Sydney. A few respondents looked into Cape Breton in case Hillary Clinton won, he said, and many others have come from around the globe.\nVaughan Merchant/Canadian Press\nRob Calabrese has been overwhelmed with the response to his tongue-in-cheek website.\nCalabrese soon realized he had tapped into a vast pool of serious interest, and he began treating his website seriously. He provided a link to the island’s official tourism site, and he began answering every e-mail he could — including questions about whether Cape Breton is hospitable to black people, to Muslims, and to members of the LGBT community.\nThat link boosted the tourism site’s traffic by more than 700 percent this year — to 561,672 visits from 67,438 — when compared to Feb. 15 through Nov. 17 last year. California leads all states in visits, while Massachusetts ranks sixth.\n“We’re exhausted,” said Tulle, who added that the tourism office is not designed to assist immigration. “I can help somebody plan a visit,” Tulle said, “but I can’t go beyond my scope.”\nStill, Tulle said, she has been receiving as many as 150 e-mails a morning from Americans looking for options.\nReal estate prices — even prime waterfront lots — are cheap when compared with much of coastal New England. Many three-bedroom homes in Sydney, Cape Breton’s biggest community, are listed for under $150,000.\nBut so far, Cape Breton’s landscape and prices haven’t caused a bump for the brokers, said Catherine Harvey, who owns a real estate business in the lakeside town of Baddeck.\nVaughan Merchant/Canadian Press\nThe port of Sydney, Cape Breton.\n“We’re not noticing any effect; that’s a bunch of baloney. Who the hell wants to move to Cape Breton?” Harvey said.\nIf they do, Americans cannot just pack up and settle here. They can buy property and stay up to six months a year, but for people without a college degree, moving to Canada is “well nigh impossible,” said attorney Damien Barry, who leads the immigration team at Cape Breton’s largest law firm.\nEven for professionals, the process is geared toward attracting immigrants — such as doctors and lawyers in rural areas — who can answer specific needs. And it can take years to clear the immigration hurdles.\nCuriosity is one thing, but Cape Bretoners wonder whether Americans are ready for the adjustment.\nOnly 136,000 people live on this island that is three times the size of Rhode Island, and the winters are long and sometimes harsh. Jobs are scarce, and young people routinely leave to seek work in Ontario or the western provinces.\nFred Lavery, a musician and music producer, shook his head at the prospect of an American diaspora in Cape Breton.\n“People here usually talk about the weather. Now they talk about Donald Trump,” Lavery said. “But the fact that Americans are even thinking about leaving the country where they’re citizens . . . and moving north with the Eskimos, I don’t think they understand what it’s like to live in Canada.”\nIn the next room at his studio in Point Aconi, the vocalist Michele Stephens recorded a song called “Another Cape Breton Postcard.”\nHer parents run a restaurant in Baddeck, a town on Bras d’Or Lake where the inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, owned a home. This summer, she said, the business was unusually brisk — and many of those extra tourists were Americans.\nStill, many Cape Bretoners are pragmatists. It’s fine to talk about moving to Canada. It’s another to actually become a reverse snowbird.\n“If they come, they won’t stay too long. It’s so remote in Cape Breton,” said Julie Sutherland, smiling as she poured a cup of coffee at her Sydney cafe. “But if they do, we’re happy to help.”\nVaughan Merchant/Canadian Press\nScott Erickson of Alder Point fished lobster off Cape Breton.\nRelated Here’s an option for American refugees fleeing a Trump presidency Seven reasons to move to Massachusetts instead of Canada\nBrian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nProtesters joined hands in prayer on Thursday as police lined the hill at Standing Rock during an ongoing dispute over the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nBy Blake Nicholson and Amy Forliti Associated Press November 26, 2016\nBISMARCK, N.D. — The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said Friday that the US Army Corps of Engineers plans to close an area where people have been camping for months to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline.\nDave Archambault said in a statement that he received a letter from the Corps, dated Friday, which says all lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed Dec. 5.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘The letter states that the lands will be closed to public access for safety concerns,’’ Archambault said.\nRepresentatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn’t immediately return messages Friday seeking comment and verification of the letter.\nThe letter, provided by the tribe, says: ‘‘To be clear, this means that no member of the general public, to include Dakota Access pipeline protesters, can be on these Corps lands.’’\nIt says anyone on land north of the river after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and may be prosecuted. It also says anyone who stays on the land does so at his or her own risk.\nThe letter, from Army Corps of Engineers Colonel John Henderson, says the closure is necessary to protect the general public from violent confrontations between protesters and authorities and to protect demonstrators from illness, injury, or death during North Dakota’s harsh winter months. It also says that the area does not have necessary first responder services or facilities to protect people during the winter.\nAdvertisement\nA free speech zone will be set up south of the river.\nArchambault said the land to be closed includes the Oceti Sakowin camp, a sprawling encampment on Army Corps land about 50 miles south of Bismarck. For months, opponents of the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline have been camping in the area to protest the pipeline.\nSome of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations and hundreds of arrests. A clash earlier this week near the main protest camp left a police officer and several protesters injured, including Sophia Wilansky, who suffered a serious arm injury and is in satisfactory condition in a Minneapolis hospital.\nThe Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes are fighting the Dakota Access project because they fear it will harm drinking water and cultural sites. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that and says the 1,200-mile pipeline through the Dakotas, Iowa, and Illinois will be safe.\nThe pipeline is nearly complete outside of a stretch beneath a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota, just north of the Standing Rock reservation.\n‘‘Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever,’’ he said. He’s asking pipeline opponents to continue to fight the pipeline’s permitting process.\nMeanwhile, the leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux in South Dakota called for pipeline opponents to boycott businesses in North Dakota’s capital, a move Bismarck’s city administrator says is uncalled for and disappointing.\nThe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council voted in September to not spend money in Bismarck and neighboring Mandan, and Chairman Harold Frazier at the time called on all tribal members to join the effort. Earlier this week, he sought to broaden the boycott to make a statement against what he calls ‘‘heavy-handed, illegal, and violent oppression’’ of people who have protested against the pipeline for months.\nBismarck City Administrator Keith Hunke said Friday the boycott is disappointing given that the city’s businesses aren’t involved in the dispute. He said no businesses have reported an effect from boycotts and said protest activity in the area is inconvenient but hasn’t cut into businesses’ bottom lines.\n‘‘We’ve had some of our streets blocked for a period of time, but generally after a period of time the protesters disband and business gets back to normal,’’ he said.\nMore than 560 protesters have been arrested since August in the Bismarck-Mandan area and at the main protest camp, including more than 30 at a Bismarck mall Friday — one of the busiest days of the year. Police said protesters gathered for a prayer at Kirkwood Mall, and some refused to leave the entrance to a Target store when ordered.\nRelated Photos: A Thanksgiving protest against Dakota Access pipeline Trump’s stock in company building disputed pipeline raises concern",

      "text": "Reddit \nWhen Google ‘s new Pixel smartphones were launched last month, they were the first Android devices to come running the latest version of the Nougat OS , 7.1. At the time, Google said the software update would be made available for other phones sometime in early December, and now we finally have a concrete date, for Nexus devices at least. \nNow, Android 7.1 has been available on the Nexus 6P, 5X, and Pixel C before now, but only as developer previews. Starting December 5th, version 7.1.1 will be and over-the-air update for all Nexus users. This date comes from release notes published by Vodafone Australia . \nFor the Nexus 6P, the OTA update is expected to weigh in at around 650MB. Along with including security fixes, Android 7.1.1 will including new emoji featuring men and women of various professions and the ability for developers to add app shortcuts, while the Pixel and Pixel XL will get new ‘double-tap to check phone’ and ‘lift to check phone’ features. \nThe December 5th rollout of the update will follow Google’s usual release pattern. Vodafone’s notes mention that the first three days will see 10,000 randomly selected devices notified that the update is available to download, followed by the next 10 days seeing an additional 10% of eligible devices added per day, with users needing to check manually, and starting on the 14th day the update should be available for all users.",

      "text": "Why you should start using Google Keep right away Artificial intelligence is transforming Google's yellow sticky note app into an indispensable peripheral to your own mind. Contributing Columnist, Computerworld | Nov 26, 2016 3:00 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. The fastest way to capture your ideas with an iPhone is to use 3D Touch on Google Keep, then select \"New Audio Note.\" Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware \nGoogle Keep is probably the best Google service that most people don't use. \nServices like Keep, Evernote and Microsoft OneNote are often called \"note-taking apps.\" But it's an obsolete label. They've grown beyond their roots, now offering collaborative workflow, reminders, checklists, geofencing, optical character recognition, voice transcription, sketching and more. \nA few years ago, I would have recommended Evernote. But over the summer, Evernote took a wrong turn. The company changed its pricing structure in a way that practically forces users to pay or quit. Specifically, Evernote added limitations to the free version, called Evernote Basic. It's now accessible via a maximum of two devices per year -- a total deal-killer, as far as I'm concerned. They limit uploads to 60 megabytes per month, which is absurdly low. And they raised prices on premium tiers. The paid versions of Evernote now cost $34.99, $69.99 and $120 per year. \nAlternatives abound. \nMicrosoft OneNote is a great choice for people invested in the Microsoft world -- Windows users who subscribe to Microsoft Office 365 or who carry a Windows Phone. \nApple Notes is rudimentary, but ideal for people who use a lot of Apple products but not many Google products and heavy Siri users who feel comfortable in the warm embrace of iCloud. \nFor most people, however, I recommend Google Keep, especially for anyone who uses the many products Keep integrates with. These include Chrome, Calendar, Gmail, Photos, Drive, Docs, Google Now, Google Assistant and Google Home. The integration of Keep with these other apps is powerful stuff. \nKeep is best in class for three unsurprising reasons, given that it's Google we're talking about here. Keep's integration with other apps, search and artificial intelligence (A.I.) are all superior to the competition. (You'll see these advantages in the tips below.) \nSome people still think Keep is just a dumb sticky-note app. I'm here to tell you that since Keep launched more than three and a half years ago, Google has quietly added so many new features (many leveraging Google's powerful A.I.) that it's a completely different product now. \nGoogle will almost certainly unveil an API at some point, enabling third-party companies to create apps and services that read or write notes. \nMeanwhile, Google will probably integrate Keep deeper into a growing range of Google products. \nThe most transformational of these integrations will be into the Google Assistant, Google's next-generation A.I. virtual assistant. In the same way Assistant will scan your email, calendar and other data-packed Google apps, Assistant will also scan Keep and make all the information in Keep available to you through a conversation or chat. \nWhen Assistant can use Keep to remember things for you, it will feel like part of your mind. It will whisper reminders in your ear and provide you with any information in Keep whenever you ask for it. \nSo if you plan to use Google Assistant, now is the time to start populating Keep with all your personal facts, information and ideas. \nBesides, I think Keep is already the best note-taking app out there. Here are the amazing things you can do right now with Google Keep. Instantly capture anything \nWhen you get an idea or encounter information in the world that you want to remember forever, Keep captures quickly. \nUse a widget on the Today screen for iOS or home screen on Android for one-tap capture. The widget shows four buttons: \"Note,\" \"List,\" \"Photo\" and \"Audio.\" One tap and you're off to the races. \niPhone users: Place the Keep icon as one of your four \"Dock\" icons for quickest access. If you've got an iPhone 6s or later, use 3D Touch: Press hard on the icon and choose from \"New Audio Note,\" \"New Photo Note,\" \"New List\" or \"New Note.\" \nThe fastest choice is Audio -- just select and talk, and your words will be captured and even typed out in searchable text. \nIf you need to capture written information -- on a whiteboard, sign, business card, menu, article, contract, license plate or even a screen -- tap the \"Photo\" button and take a picture. Keep scans and captures the words in that photo, making the note searchable. To extract the words, tap on the photo and choose \"Grab image text\" from the menu. The words in the photo will be transformed into text. You can also import into Keep photos you've already taken, and those will be scanned, too. \nThe word-scanning feature works for the English language only, but Google Keep project manager Mario Anima told me more languages will be added in the future. \n(Bonus tip: Both the audio you record and photos you take in Keep are stored in Google Drive and count against your Drive storage limit. After Keep extracts text, you can delete the recording or photo and keep just the words.) \nOf course, you can also choose \"Note\" or \"List\" to capture free-form text or checkbox lists. In a \"Note,\" you can use asterisks or hyphens for bullet lists, and Keep auto-creates the next bullet. In a \"List,\" Google uses A.I. to guess what items you're adding, which speeds up list-making. \nWith the \"OK Google\" command on Android phones, you can create notes by just talking. You can even add and edit lists by voice alone. For example: \"OK, Google: Create a shopping list with kale and milk.\" You can then change your mind by saying: \"Remove kale\" and \"Change 'milk' to 'non-fat milk.' (After the list is saved you can add new items by voice alone, but not change or remove them.) \nIf you use Google's Chrome browser, Install the Keep Chrome extension app -- just go to the Keep site and find the app page option on the hamburger menu. By pressing the Keep button that the browser extension installs, you'll capture a link to the currently selected tab, with an opportunity to add a note. \nSpeaking of browsers, open each of your most frequently used Keep labels in a separate tab for quick capture and reference while using your PC or laptop. When you're already in a specific label category, new notes will automatically be tagged for that category. \nOr, better yet, run the Chrome browser app, shrink it to a skinny column and keep it open next to your browser for instant access while you work. Remember faster \nGoogle Keep has an amazing search function. But when you click or tap on the \"Search\" icon, and before you can even search, you'll be presented with options for finding stuff. These options include note type (\"Reminders,\" \"Lists\" and \"Photos\"), labels (which you can create by either using the pop-out menu or by creating hashtags in the notes; each note can have as many labels as you want), people (the complete list of people you've shared notes with or who have shared notes with you), things (Google's A.I. auto-categorization of your notes, which includes categories like \"Books,\" \"Food,\" \"Movies,\" \"Music,\" \"Places,\" \"Travel,\" and others) and colors . Add Reminders in Keep (not Inbox) \nGoogle Reminders is a feature that spans three products: Inbox, Keep and Calendar. The feature lets you be alerted based on time and date or location -- for example, you can set a reminder to pick up your dry cleaning next time you drive near the cleaner's. You can also set recurring reminders. \nMost users enter Reminders from Inbox. But adding them in Keep is better. Reminders added in Keep show up in Inbox, but those added in Inbox do not show up in Keep. (Reminders show up in Calendar, regardless.) \nThe Keep interface for Reminders is better than in Inbox. You can use the full range of options: \"Notes,\" \"List,\" \"Photo\" and \"Audio.\" Just create any kind of Keep note, then tap on the Reminders icon. Use Keep as a \"smart napkin\" \nThe Android version of Keep allows free-form sketching and hand-written notes, just as you might do on a napkin at a lunch meeting. (The iOS version of Keep will get this feature soon, according to Google's Anima.) The difference is that Google applies amazing A.I. to make your doodles searchable. Google can recognize and convert into text most hand-written scribbles. Even more amazing, Google A.I. can even recognize some of your drawings. So if you sketch a house, a car and a martini glass, you should be able to find the sketch later by searching for these words. Google recently demoed this A.I. inside a fun game called Quick Draw . Google guesses what you're drawing in real time, as you're drawing it. \nOpen the Keep app for Android and tap \"New drawing.\" You can also add a drawing to an existing note or draw all over a photo imported into Keep. Once you're in drawing mode, use the various drawing and highlight tools to enhance your drawings. Prioritize your mind \nUse drag-and-drop to rearrange your notes or \"pin\" notes to the top. \nHere's a secret shortcut that brings any note to the top of the rotation, but not \"pinned\": Archive the note, then un-archive. When it emerges from the Archive, it will be placed as if it were a new note (the \"archive\" button is a box with an arrow on it). Incubate your ideas \nDon't just capture your ideas in Keep. Develop them over time. This is the single best Keep tip for creators. Sure, when genius strikes, capture the idea. But go back and spend quality time with your notes. When you have further thoughts or find related facts or resources, add them to the existing note. Write entire passages (because ideas about how to express or articulate something need to be captured, too). \nYou can also dragoon others into helping you to develop your ideas by simply tapping on the \"Share\" button on the desktop version or the \"Collaborators\" item on the mobile app's \"More options\" menu. \nIs your idea ready to hatch? \"Graduate\" the Keep note into a Google doc. On the mobile app, the \"Copy to Google docs\" option is on the \"plus\" button in the lower left. On the desktop browser version, it's on the \"More options\" menu (the vertical dots). \nEach note can be up to 20,000 characters in length, roughly 12 times the length of this column, and the title field maxes out at 1,000 characters. For lists, each item can be up to 1,000 characters and you can have up to 999 items per list. Think of Google Keep as a peripheral to your mind \nMake Google Keep central to your life. Use it obsessively. When you do that, t becomes a mirror to your mind, an extension to your thought processes that never forgets -- a nursery for your best ideas, projects, goals and plans. \nAs Google evolves Keep's A.I. and connects it to the services you use every day, the distance between inspiration and execution grows ever shorter. \nGoogle Keep isn't a dumb yellow sticky note app. It's an always-present, A.I.-powered tool that magnifies the powers of your mind.

Considering that the Pixel and Pixel XL are already running Android 7.1, it was a little odd that the older Nexus devices were put through the developer preview before seeing the official release. \nAccording to Vodafone Australia , Google will begin seeding the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update to the Nexus 6P starting on December 6th. The update will weigh in at about 650MB and will be available via an OTA and will be rolled out in stages. \nVodafone is claiming that the update will include December’s Android security patch and will take up to 2 weeks for the update to be fully rolled out. It’s also unknown whether the Pixel, Pixel XL, and Nexus 5X will see the update on the same date or if there will some type of discrepancy.",

      "text": "Google AI Creates Its Own Language to Translate Languages It Doesn’t Know AFP by Charlie Nash 26 Nov 2016 0 26 Nov, 2016 26 Nov, 2016 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Google Brain’s Neural Network AI has reportedly created its own universal language , which allows the system to translate between other languages without knowing them. \nBy simply teaching the AI “how to translate from Portuguese to English and English to Spanish,” the system was able to then translate from Spanish to Portuguese on its own without any outside guidance. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n“In the last 10 years, Google Translate has grown from supporting just a few languages to 103, translating over 140 billion words every day,” declared Google in their research blog . “To make this possible, we needed to build and maintain many different systems in order to translate between any two languages, incurring significant computational cost. With neural networks reforming many fields, we were convinced we could raise the translation quality further, but doing so would mean rethinking the technology behind Google Translate.” \n“In ‘Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation,’ we address this challenge by extending our previous GNMT system, allowing for a single system to translate between multiple languages,” they continued. “Our proposed architecture requires no change in the base GNMT system, but instead uses an additional ‘token’ at the beginning of the input sentence to specify the required target language to translate to. In addition to improving translation quality, our method also enables ‘Zero-Shot Translation’ — translation between language pairs never seen explicitly by the system.” \n“The described Multilingual Google Neural Machine Translation system is running in production today for all Google Translate users,” Google concluded. “Multilingual systems are currently used to serve 10 of the recently launched 16 language pairs, resulting in improved quality and a simplified production architecture.” \n“Theoretically, Google Brain’s systems can learn any language, without lessons,” explained the Inquirer’s Chris Merriman . \nUsers can test out the new and more advanced version of Google Translate now, which incorporates Google’s new AI feature. \nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

But instead of the correct name appearing, users see the building labeled as “Dump Tower.” \nThe name change has reportedly been fixed as of 9 p.m. EST, though some Google Maps users say they still see Trump Tower with its vandalized name. \nMore from WPIX: \nThe trend caught on Saturday evening with the a second Trump renaming. Trump International Hotel & Tower in Columbus Circle had also been renamed Dump International Hotel & Tower. \nIt isn’t immediately clear who changed the name on Google Maps or how it was done. \nSince being elected president, Trump has used Trump Tower as a meeting place with his advisers, potential cabinet and administration officials, in addition to world leaders.

(AP) — Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. says President elect-Donald Trump offered him the job of education secretary, but that he turned it down for personal reasons.\nFalwell tells The Associated Press that Trump offered him the job last week during a meeting in New York. He says Trump wanted a four- to six-year commitment, but that he couldn’t leave Liberty for more than two years.\nAdvertisement\nFalwell says he couldn’t afford to work at a Cabinet-level job for longer than that and didn’t want to move his family, especially his 16-year-old daughter.\nTrump announced Wednesday he had selected charter school advocate Betsy DeVos for the job. Falwell says he thinks DeVos is an ‘‘excellent choice.’’\nTrump spoke at the Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia, in January and Falwell later endorsed him.",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Jeff Jacoby Globe Columnist November 27, 2016\nO f the prayers that observant Jews recite each day, the one I appreciate most is offered before going to bed . Here is how it begins:\n“Master of the universe, I hereby forgive anyone who angered or antagonized me or sinned against me — whether physically or financially or through disrespect, or in any other matter affecting me; whether involuntarily or willfully, carelessly or deliberately; whether by word or by deed. I forgive every person: Let no one incur punishment because of me.”\nAdvertisement\nOne of the rules I try to live by is not to take offense when no offense is intended. A corollary to that rule is to presume, whenever possible, that no offense was intended. This is not, I admit, a discipline I’ve mastered perfectly. But make a daily point of affirming that you harbor no ill will, and you won’t smolder with unresolved umbrage. At a time when Americans by the millions keep themselves in a state of high dudgeon, choosing not to be offended can be wonderfully refreshing.\nNot taking offense isn’t the same as not having pet peeves. (I’ve got a bunch of those.) Nor does it mean never condemning shameful or destructive behavior. (Where would newspaper columnists be if we never uttered any criticism?) It does mean recognizing that being offended is always a choice, and that other people’s words can bend you out of shape only if you let them.\nThis isn’t a column about politics, but during the recent “Hamilton” kerfuffle, Vice President-elect Mike Pence provided a pitch-perfect demonstration of how not to take offense. He didn’t bristle or fume when he was booed by audience members and pointedly addressed by the cast during the curtain call. “ I wasn’t offended ,” he said afterward. He praised the “great, great show” and the “incredibly talented” cast, and made clear that actor Brandon Dixon’s impassioned statement from the stage didn’t trouble him.\n“I nudged my kids,” Pence told Fox News , “and reminded them, ‘That’s what freedom sounds like.’ ”\nUnfortunately, picking at scabs has become a national pastime. Americans have lost their ability to shrug off other people’s obnoxious comments or insensitive gestures or politically incorrect views. Instead of rolling their eyes and letting it pass, they proclaim: “I’m offended.” They demand apologies. They insist on “ trigger warnings ” and “ safe spaces .” They howl about “ microaggressions ” and whinge about “ mansplaining ” and compile lists of banned words . When they get offended, they expect heads to roll or companies to be blackballed . They even take offense on behalf of people who don’t take offense .\nAdvertisement\nRemember Frank Costanza? He was the character on “Seinfeld” who invented Festivus, a family holiday commemorated with a dinner, an aluminum pole, feats of strength, and — the high point — an Airing of Grievances . “I got a lot of problems with you people!” bellows Costanza to those at his Festivus table. “And now you’re gonna hear about it!”\nIt was funny as a sitcom shtick. As a national pastime, perpetual outrage is exhausting and debilitating. America could do with a little less Frank Costanza and a little more Mike Pence.\nWaxing wroth when we’re offended may feel temporarily satisfying, but the weight of all those chips on our shoulders does long-term damage. “In my work treating alcoholics,” writes psychiatrist Abraham Twerski, a founder of the renowned Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh, there is “great emphasis on divesting oneself of resentments,” since “resentments are probably the single greatest factor responsible for relapse.” Twerski Quote: s one recovering alcoholic’s insight : “Carrying resentments is like letting someone who you don’t like live inside your head rent-free.” No lasting benefit comes from it, but a lot of misery does.\nIn a society that thrives on taking offense — just turn on talk radio, or read an online comments section, or follow Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren on Twitter — it can’t be overemphasized that nursing a grievance is always optional. You may not be able to control other people’s opinions, obnoxious jokes, or political loyalties. But you alone determine how you react to them.\nEveryone has heard the biblical injunction to “love thy neighbor as thyself.” Less well known is the first half of the verse : “Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge.” That’s excellent counsel, for believers and nonbelievers alike.\nJeff Jacoby can be reached at jacoby@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Bryan Marquard Globe Staff November 27, 2016\nBefore turning to radio commentaries, Mrs. Page had been a print journalist and a weekly newspaper editor.\nOne day when she was 86, Ruth Page put off plans for an afternoon of writing to take “a simple, half-hour’s walk” near her Shelburne, Vt., home. For Mrs. Page, even a casual stroll tended to be brisk, but she contemplated the woods around her with the inquisitive eyes of a scientist, the lyrical thoughts of a poet. At times, the beauty made her stop and stare.\n“No artist’s palette can match nature’s. She offered so many shades of green it made me dizzy,” she recounted in a September 2007 commentary for Vermont Public Radio . “When the breeze blew, leaves I’d been admiring for their deep, dark green suddenly flashed with the brilliance of melted emeralds, gold along their edges, every vein visible in the X-ray vision of the sun.”\nAdvertisement\nBefore turning to radio commentaries , she had been an award-winning journalist in Vermont: a weekly newspaper editor and a pioneering woman in the state’s press corps. On that day, though, she recalled that “when I was a kid, I read the Doctor Dolittle books, and I remember his asking the youngster who joined him whether he was a good noticer; did he really see what was going on around him? I have tried ever since to be a good noticer, and I get most of my rewards from what I used to think of as the simple beauties of nature, but of course they’re not simple at all.”\nMrs. Page , whose “Gardening Journal” radio segments in the 1980s were aired on more than 170 stations , including many in New England, died of complications from a stroke Oct. 30 in Wake Robin, a Shelburne, Vt., continuing-care community. She was 95 and previously lived for half a century in a Burlington, Vt., house that overlooked Lake Champlain.\n“Her voice was distinctive, rather like a cross between a really smart teacher and a loving parent just about out of patience,” Betty Smith-Mastaler, a producer and reporter at Vermont Public Radio, said in an on-air tribute after Mrs. Page died. “In fact, she didn’t think her voice was good enough and had to be talked into the idea of speaking on the radio.”\nAfter ending her on-air gardening journal in the late 1980s, Mrs. Page recorded two decades of radio commentaries that aired until she was nearly 90. In that role, she “had a lively sense of humor and a keen eye for beauty,” said Smith-Mastaler, who added that in focusing on the environment, Mrs. Page “often saw potential problems well ahead of the rest of us.”\nMrs. Page’s observations of humanity’s effect on the natural world could swiftly turn a pastoral recollection into an environmental admonition. In one 2008 commentary, she described “a perfect October day” when nature showed off lingering red and gold foliage “like a 16-year-old peacocking around in her first formal gown for her junior prom, as if she had to prove how lovely she could be.”\nAdvertisement\nThat perfect day fell on Oct. 21, however, and “I had to force myself to remember that it was not a virtue, but a human fault, that made so glorious a day of 70-degree temperatures possible in a northern state in midautumn. How could we possibly revel in this relaxing warmth when we recalled how abnormal it was? We know it was our own fault that there was no longer hope of the October chill, and sometimes snows, of 40 or 50 years ago.”\nRuth Wolf Page was born on March 8, 1921, in Upper Darby, Pa., a daughter of Morris Wolf, a history professor, and the former Hilda Yerpe, who had been a concert pianist and gave lessons on a grand piano in their Victorian home.\nThe youngest of three children, Mrs. Wolf went to Swarthmore College, from which she graduated in 1942 with a bachelor’s degree in English literature. Relocating to New York, she worked at the Book Publishers Bureau as the director’s executive assistant, and lived in Greenwich Village, where Proctor Page Jr. resided in an apartment across the street. After he finished a military assignment that took him to India, they married in 1945 and moved to Vermont, where he had grown up.\nShe worked as a bank teller before their three children were born. When they built their home near Burlington’s Appletree Point, they called it Wild Thyme after the herb that grew at the site. Mrs. Page relished the breezes that blew off Lake Champlain as she went about the many household chores that were supplemented in 1957 with newspaper duties, when she and her husband purchased the Suburban List, a weekly in nearby Essex Junction, Vt.\n“She was one of the most energetic people you can imagine — a nimble mind and a nimble body,” said her daughter Candace Page of Burlington, a longtime Vermont journalist. “She was always moving, always doing something every minute: typing editorials at the kitchen table, hanging the laundry, doing the dishes. She did everything every mother did and had a full-time job.”\nSelf-taught as a journalist, Mrs. Page was the weekly newspaper’s only real reporter. Along with writing the “Lady Fare” column, she set straight officials in local towns who thought they could hold all meetings off the record. “Her stories were always full of her lively voice and had a very conversational tone, so anybody could understand them and enjoy reading them,” her daughter said.\nWith Mrs. Page as the editor, the weekly won many awards. She became the first woman to serve as president of the Vermont Press Association and also served on the board of what is now the New England Newspaper & Press Association, her daughter said. In subsequent years, Mrs. Page served on the boards of the Vermont State Colleges and Green Mountain Power, a utility company.\nIn the late 1970s, Mrs. Page and her husband sold their newspaper. He ran a printing company in Essex Junction and died in 2004.\nBefore turning to public radio commentaries, Mrs. Page edited the newsletter of what is now the nonprofit National Gardening Association, eventually turning the publication into a magazine before she retired in 1986. She and her husband had taken up organic gardening at their Burlington home long before that approach became popular, and she turned a collection of her “Ruth Page’s Gardening Journal” radio commentaries into a 1989 book with the same title.\nA service has been held for Mrs. Page, who in addition to her daughter Candace leaves another daughter, Patti Ruth of Colchester, Vt.; a son, Robert of Oakville, Ontario; five granddaughters; and a great-grandchild.\nIn her environmental commentaries, Mrs. Page often set an example for listeners to follow, reminding them to do something as simple as picking up discarded beer cans while out for walks.\n“I’m hopeful,” she said in 2008 and added: “We’re catching on, maybe in time to save most of Earth’s stunning diversity of life forms.”\nBryan Marquard can be reached at bryan.marquard@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff/File\n‘‘The people have spoken and the election is over,’’ Donald Trump declared Saturday. He added, ‘‘We must accept this result and then look to the future.’’\nBy Steve Peoples Associated Press November 26, 2016\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday condemned a growing push to force recounts in three states pivotal to his Nov. 8 victory, confronting the Green Party-backed effort for the first time even as he worked to address key Cabinet vacancies.\nThe New York billionaire, who charged the election was ‘‘rigged’’ on a daily basis before his victory, called the developing recount effort ‘‘a scam’’ in a statement released by his transition team.\nAdvertisement\nTrump had been ignoring Green Party nominee Jill Stein’s fight to revisit vote totals in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Wisconsin officials announced late Friday they are moving forward with the first presidential recount in state history.\n‘‘The people have spoken and the election is over,’’ Trump declared Saturday. He added, ‘‘We must accept this result and then look to the future.’’\nAt the same time, Trump was scrambling to address unfilled administration jobs, having barely scratched the surface of creating the massive team needed to run the government before his Jan. 20 inauguration.\nExperts say presidential transitions are periods of great vulnerability for the nation, and among the vacancies on the Trump team are leaders of the departments of State, Defense, and Homeland Security.\nTrump, who has virtually no experience in foreign affairs, offered a one-line tweet Saturday morning in reaction to the death of Cuban leader Fidel Castro — ‘‘Fidel Castro is dead!’’ — before issuing a more detailed statement.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,’’ Trump said.\nHis transition team did not respond to requests to clarify his Cuba policy, which was inconsistent during the campaign.\nThe incoming president paid little if any attention Stein’s recount push, but Democratic rival Hillary Clinton forced his hand Saturday by formally joining the effort. Stein, who drew 1 percent of the vote nationally, is raising millions of dollars to fund the recounts.\n‘‘Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves,’’ Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias wrote Saturday in a blog post. ‘‘But now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.’’\nElias said Clinton would take the same approach in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Stein were to follow through with recount requests in those states, even though that was highly unlikely to change the election outcome.\n‘‘Regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself,’’ Elias wrote.\nClinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trump won 290 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232, with Michigan still too close to call. It takes 270 to win the presidency.\nTrump, who repeatedly challenged the integrity of the US election system before his win, called the recount push ‘‘a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded.’’\n‘‘The results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,’’ he said in the statement, which didn’t mention Clinton’s involvement.",

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nRiders brought their horses to the edge of the water for a drink as police stood atop the hill in Cannon Ball, N.D., during an ongoing dispute over the building of the Dakota Access pipeline.\nBy James MacPherson Associated Press November 27, 2016\nCANNON BALL, N.D. (AP) — Dakota Access oil pipeline protesters will not follow a government directive to leave the federal land where hundreds have camped for months, organizers said Saturday, despite state officials encouraging them to do so.\nStanding Rock Sioux tribal leader Dave Archambault and other protest organizers confidently explained that they’ll stay at the Oceti Sakowin camp and continue with nonviolent protests a day after Archambault received a letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that said all federal lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed to public access Dec. 5 for ‘‘safety concerns.’’\nAdvertisement\nThe Corps cited the oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters, who believe the pipeline could harm drinking water and Native American cultural sites, and police.\nStanding Rock tribal members believe the land in which the encampment is on is owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government.\n‘‘We are wardens of this land. This is our land and they can’t remove us,’’ said protester Isaac Weston, who is an Oglala Sioux member from South Dakota. ‘‘We have every right to be here to protect our land and to protect our water.’’\nThe vast majority of the several hundred people fighting against the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline have created a self-sustaining community at the sprawling camp, which is on Corps land in southern North Dakota, and have put up semi-permanent structures or brought motor homes and trailers in advance of the harsh winter.\nOn the unseasonably warm Saturday, people were chopping wood and setting up tents at the encampment, which is more than a mile from a Missouri River reservoir where the final large segment of the pipeline is yet to be completed due to the Corps consulting with the tribe. Authorities had set up a staging area about a mile away on a hill overlooking the site.\nAdvertisement\nDallas Goldtooth, a protest organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said it is ‘‘an atrocious example that colonization has not ended for us here as indigenous people,’’ and that the government’s request will escalate already rocky tensions.\nRepresentatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn’t immediately return multiple messages Friday or Saturday seeking comment and verification of the letter. Last month, the Corps said it would not evict the encampment, which started as overflow from smaller private and permitted protest sites nearby and began growing in August.\nPresident Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline in that area earlier this month, something Kelcy Warren, CEO of Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press is not an option from the company’s standpoint. Obama said his administration is monitoring the ‘‘challenging situation’’ but would ‘‘let it play out for several more weeks.’’\nSome of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations — one woman suffered a serious arm injury last weekend — and more than 500 people have been arrested since August.\nThe Corps’ letter, according to Archambault, said that those who stay on the land after Dec. 5 may be prosecuted, and that there’ll be a free speech zone south of the river.\nArchambault said Saturday that he doesn’t believe the Corps will forcibly evict people from the camp, adding that the tribe is working to provide protesters protection from the elements on its reservation, which is south of the Cannonball River, but offered few details.\nIt’s the federal government’s job to peacefully close the camp because it allowed people to stay there in the first place, Gov. Jack Dalrymple said in a statement Saturday.\n‘‘Our state and local law enforcement agencies continue to do all they can to keep private property and public infrastructure free from unpermitted protest activities, and its past time that the federal government provides the law enforcement resources ... to enforce their own order to vacate,’’ the Republican said.\nThat sentiment was echoed by Morton County Commission chairman Cody Schulz, who said county and state leaders have been seeking federal law enforcement help for months. ‘‘It’s now time for the federal government to live up to its obligations’’ said Schulz.\nRepublican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven and Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said the protesters need to move for public safety.\n‘‘The well-being and property of ranchers, farmers and everyone else living in the region should not be threatened by protesters who are willing to commit acts of violence,’’ Hoeven said in a statement Friday. He also called on the Obama administration to let work on the pipeline move forward, saying, ‘‘this difficult situation has gone on too long and we need to get it resolved.’’\nHeitkamp said the Corps’ order is ‘‘a needed step to support the safety of residents, workers, protesters and law enforcement.’’",

      "text": " Google+\nRose Lincoln for The Boston Globe\nVolunteer Karl Debisschop, of Quincy, taught a nervous Brandon Darden, 7, of Hyde Park how to rappel down a rock wall during a Boy Scouts program at New England Base Camp in Milton focusing on diversity and cultural sensitivity.\nBy Jacob Carozza Globe Correspondent November 25, 2016\nMILTON -- It was at a camp in the Blue Hills Reservation that Maggie Wierzbowski first heard Amharic, a language spoken in Ethiopia. A young Cub Scout was doing so, and in exchange, the 17-year-old high schooler from Quincy introduced him to Polish, which she speaks fluently.\nThe pair added the Amharic and Polish words for “hello” to a board containing a multilingual collection of greetings. The words telegraphed the varying backgrounds of the Scouts, parents, and staff members like Wierzbowski gathered at New England Base Camp in Milton that late October Saturday. As they took in the board, said Wierzbowski, the Scouts would inquire, “Where’s that from?” Or, “Where’s the country located?”\nAdvertisement\nThe Scouts -- almost 350 of them, according to Darrin Johnson, the camp’s general manager -- had come from neighborhoods in Boston and throughout the suburbs, as well as out of state, to participate in activities promoting diversity and cultural sensitivity.\nIn the midst of rising tension across the country over race, religion, and ethnicity, Boston-area Boy Scout leaders have been increasingly focusing on teaching Scouts to respect different cultures and heritages, said Chuck Eaton, executive director of the Spirit of Adventure Council, which oversees some 12,400 Scouts in 385 troops, packs, and other groups spread throughout 76 cities and towns in Greater Boston.\nThat a Boy Scouts council would take the lead on such a hot-button subject might come as a surprise, given the controversy that long surrounded the national organization’s ban on gay Scout leaders, a policy it abandoned just last year.\nView Gallery Photos: Camp Diversity\nBoston-area Boy Scouts\n“That policy was very difficult for this council in particular, and we were really glad that it was changed,” said Eaton. He added that his group has provided sensitivity training for adult leaders for about 15 years, and that there are openly gay Scout leaders in Greater Boston.\n“We really think and have always thought that Scouting does a fantastic job of helping young men and families deal with diversity and open people’s thought process about understanding, respect, and differences,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nThe local council tailors its programs focusing on racial and cultural diversity to specific age groups. Since 1979, Scouts in middle and high school have been able to earn an “American Cultures” merit badge. To do so, they are required to learn about groups with different racial, cultural, national, or ethnic backgrounds than their own. That can mean going to cultural festivals, learning traditional songs and stories, visiting places of worship, or speaking directly with people of different heritages.\n“The older kids are encouraged to sit down and have real conversations,” Eaton said, “and [we] challenge them to come out with a deeper understanding, and even do some written work on it.”\nAnd for younger Scouts, such as those in first or second grade? “They’re going to be excited to play games from another country,” Eaton said.\nEarlier this year, the mother of a Needham Cub Scout mentioned to Eaton her son’s joy at meeting a Spanish-speaking Cub Scout at a day camp. It was the first time the third-grader could remember meeting someone who wasn’t white, Eaton recounted.\n“We know that that happens all the time,” Eaton said. “It was great to understand that the kids themselves think that that’s wonderful.”\nThe interaction took place at New England Base Camp, a recreation center with outdoor offerings for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, as well as school field trips, corporate outings, and the general public. When it comes to Scouts, especially, programs at the camp are often designed to facilitate interactions where those from different backgrounds work toward common goals and learn about each other.\nOn a wall at the camp hangs a map where Scouts are encouraged to mark the countries in which their ancestors lived. Other activities include making postcards to send to an international Scout center in Switzerland, where they will be distributed to Scouts all over the world, and a board where Scouts can write their definitions of “peace,” and how they think peace can be sustained.\nThese days, the campfires warm not just s’mores, but Vietnamese dumplings, too, thanks to a visit a few weeks ago from a troop associated with a Vietnamese cultural center in Dorchester. “They came and taught the staff how to make Vietnamese food on the outdoor fire,” Johnson said, so the workers can pass the skill on to Scouts.\nThe camp gets many visits from Scouts who live in densely populated neighborhoods in Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, and other cities. Many of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, and many others are racial minorities with older familial roots in the United States, according to Komba Lamina, the Spirit of Adventure Council’s Urban Scouting and Exploring executive.\n“My role is to really go out to communities where Scouting is less prominent or does not exist at all,” Lamina said. There, he partners with various organizations to start Cub Scout packs and Boy Scout troops, with the goal of getting enough parents and community members involved to have them run independently.\nThe adults that do get involved, Lamina says, tend to come away with a better understanding of other cultures.\n“We bring all of these folks together from different walks of life,” he said. “You’re having parents that are coming together, and the focus is the pack. And they’re all helping to run a project. They’re all helping. Whatever expertise they have, they’re all lending a hand. Those lines, whether it’s cultural lines or financial lines or whatever, they begin to dwindle.”\nAnd Lamina says that Scouting can have the same effect on youngsters, merely by exposing them to diversity.\n“It helps get them more comfortable now, and as they grow,” he said.\nNine-year-old Eli Burke became a Cub Scout in the second grade, when the urban Scouting initiative came to his Hyde Park charter school. Now a fourth-grader, he’s become more social from the experience, said his mother, Angela.\n“I know it’s subtle, but he actually knows people’s names now,” she said. “It means he’s actually making connections.”\nBurke said her son “looks very ‘other’” -- he is of black, Native American, Jamaican, and Puerto Rican ancestry -- but is not yet very conscious of race. “He thinks of it as the color, and not the racial identification,” Burke said.\nShe said her son and his fellow Cub Scouts enjoyed the activities at New England Base Camp that October Saturday but did not, at their age, comprehend the underlying purpose of the event.\n“The Scout leaders have to be more explicit about how they make those connections for them,” Burke said. The youngsters are “capable of it, but they’re not going to do it on their own.”\nStill, Burke says she’s impressed that the Boy Scouts are “bending with the times,” and teaching young people to be good citizens.\n“I’m excited to see what they do with it,” she said of the organization’s leaders.\nJacob Carozza can be reached at jacob.carozza@globe.com .

      "title": "Worcester/Framingham line service worsens, as Keolis eyes improvements",
      "text": " Google+\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff/File\nPassengers waited for a train at the Framingham station. Keolis has had a coach shortage.\nBy Nicole Dungca Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nThe numbers back up your complaints, Worcester/Framingham train riders: Your service has been particularly bad lately.\nLast Monday, the new general manager of Keolis Commuter Services, David Scorey, told the fiscal and management control board that only about 61 percent of trains on that line had run on time over the past 30 days.\nAdvertisement\nThe line is one of the busiest of all the commuter rail lines, threading through towns including Wellesley and Framingham. And other lines barely come close to its tardiness rate. The next worst is the Fitchburg line, which ran about 68 percent of trains on time during the same time period.\nSadly, Worcester/Framingham line riders are used to late trains.\nAccording to the MBTA’s own data site, Keolis Commuter Services was able to run about 73 percent of Worcester/Framingham line trains on time last November.\nScorey has pointed out that a number of speed limits have contributed to the tardiness of trains on the line, including construction of a station near New Balance headquarters in Brighton, and a red signal near the Worcester end that slows down turnaround for some trains.\nThe company is also replacing ties on the track to improve conditions, which adds even more speed restrictions. But Keolis has also been rocked by a shortage in coaches, particularly because the company has gotten behind on federally required inspections.\nAdvertisement\nIt has gotten bad enough for the Worcester/Framingham line that the company has formed an action committee to examine the problem, train by train. It will also be implementing some short-term solutions, including adding more conductors to certain packed trains to reduce the time stopped at stations, and changing some routes.\nThe line has had other problems besides speed restrictions. Earlier this month, the company allowed a damaged train to carry passengers when employees failed to report a late-night accident — an issue the Federal Railroad Administration is investigating.\nWith winter approaching, Scorey has said that Keolis workers are busily preparing for any problems with snow. But he also says the end of fall brings its own respite, as the company will no longer have to deal with the “slippery rail” season — when wet leaves fall on the tracks, creating slick conditions that make it harder to control the train’s speed and braking.\n“A number of things will improve,” said Scorey. “We’re doing a lot of good work in the mechanical department to raise the number of locomotives that are available, and number of cars that are available.”\nNicole Dungca can be reached at nicole.dungca@globe.com .

      "text": "An online stunt involving Trump Tower in New York and Google Maps caused quite a stir on social media.\nTrump Tower, where President-elect Donald Trump lives, was showing as “Dump Tower” on Google Maps November 26, BuzzFeed reports.\n\n\nThe high-rise, located on New York City’s 5th Avenue, has become a popular tourist destination since Trump’s presidential campaign began, and is now home to secret service agents who are protecting the President-elect.\nWhen the name of Trump Tower was changed to “Dump Tower” on Google Maps, social media users responded.\n“High five to the Google Maps genius who changed T***p Tower to its rightful name, Dump Tower,” Lesley Abravanel tweeted.\n“Rigged! [Google] Maps shows Trump Tower as 'Dump Tower,'” Evan Smith, CEO of the Texas Tribune, tweeted.\n“‘Dump Tower.’ Oh. My. Love it!!” Ariane Bellamar tweeted.\nDump Tower also has its own Twitter account now, and responded to its Google Maps existence.\n“[Google Maps] thank you for recognizing me as the real home of [Donald Trump]. His place is always here, even when he is at the [White House],” the account tweeted.\nTrump Tower had its name restored by early morning November 27, CNN reports, as did Trump International Hotel & Tower in Columbus Circle, which had been changed to Dump International Hotel & Tower.\nThis is not the first time a location on Google Maps was maliciously altered.\nIn May 2015, Google Maps users who searched for “N***a House” were directed to the White House.\nThat occurred after Google announced it would no longer allow public edits to locations. The company referred to the White House incident as vandalism.\nThere were social media users who were not happy with the renaming of Trump Tower, and targeted Google with their complaints.\n“‘Dump Tower’ Come to think about it, why should I trust Google at all? They collect my info & try to manipulate me. #DumpGoogle,” Stephanie Marsilia tweeted.\n“How mature of Google to name Trump Tower ‘Dump Tower’ real mature! Remember Google there are many search engines! #BoycottGoogle,” Trump supporter Krystalth2183 tweeted.\nIt is unknown how Trump Tower was changed to Dump Tower on Google Maps.\n",

      "text": " Google+\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/File\nWaves slammed against Scituate’s sea wall during a January 2015 storm.\nBy Jacob Carozza Globe Correspondent November 25, 2016\nWith winter approaching, municipalities south of Boston will soon be busy tuning up snowplows and stockpiling road salt. But officials in some of those communities are also thinking about some longer-term weather-related challenges.\nMunicipal officials and specialists will meet in Norwell on Dec. 1 for a symposium on the threat that climate change and sea-level rise poses to South Shore towns. Presentations will focus on what communities have been doing, and could do in the future, to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects.\nAdvertisement\nAnne Herbst, senior regional environmental planner at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, said people living along the coast already feel that they’re seeing climate change firsthand.\n“We’re seeing an increasing frequency and intensity of storms; we’re seeing erosion of beaches, and damage to seawalls,” she said.\nRising sea levels, in particular, pose a pressing threat to coastal communities like Hull, especially when it leads to flooding.\n“We’re a flood hazard zone, so we’re educating our citizens about how to build in a flood zone and be prepared for flood events,” said Chris Krahforst, the town’s conservation administrator.\nHull recently completed an assessment to identify the areas most vulnerable to climate change. Next steps are likely to include creating strategies to mitigate the potential impact of rising sea levels on those areas, Krahforst said.\nAdvertisement\nFlooding is nothing new in Hull. Data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency show that more than $15 million has been paid to private flood insurance owners for flood-related losses in the town since 1978; among Massachusetts towns and cities, that amount is larger only in Scituate, Marshfield, and Nantucket.\nKrahforst said the town has a program in place to waive some building fees for homeowners who elevate their houses above flood levels.\nAway from the coast, river flooding has become a larger problem as well, as precipitation has increased. That’s been the case in Norwell, according to its conservation agent, Nancy Hemingway.\n“Where is this inland water going to flow to? Inland folks and inland communities are not realizing that this is going to have a tremendous impact on them as well,” Hemingway said.\nCollaboration on these issues has already begun. For example, officials from several South Shore communities recently met to discuss best practices to minimize flood damage, and they’ve heard from those focused on climate change on Cape Cod.\nBut the symposium will offer a chance to look at a wide range of climate change-related issues, and the differing steps being taken by communities to prepare for the future.\n“What I hope comes out of it is that it’s the beginning of a larger, longer dialogue,” Hemingway said.\nThe specialists expected at the symposium include Chad McGuire, chairman of the Department of Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth; Julie Conroy, senior environmental planner at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council; Ashley Green, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fellow; and Barry Keppard, public health director at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.\nJacob Carozza can be reached at jacob.carozza@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nWater runs free at the site where another dam in Norwell was removed.\nBy Andy Rosen Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nNORWELL — Third Herring Brook winds through a plain of dark, cracked silt that once formed the bottom of the pond behind the Tack Factory Dam.\nThere’s not much of the pond left and, soon enough, there will be no pond at all. Workers are preparing to demolish the dam, leaving the narrow stream to cut a new path across a landscape where it has not flowed freely since 1674.\nAdvertisement\nThe project will remove a crumbling piece of infrastructure that once helped drive industry in the area. In its wake, more than eight miles of stream will be allowed to flow free again, creating new habitat for the herring that give the brook its name.\n“People are starting to realize that rivers have intrinsic value,” said Samantha Woods, executive director of the North & South Rivers Watershed Association, which is leading efforts to remove dams. “To see them being restored as nature intended them to be is pretty profound.”\nThe association’s effort comes amid a push in Massachusetts and across the country to remove dams that no longer serve the purpose that led to their construction. About 3,000 dams dot the state, environmental officials say, but just 10 to 15 percent remain in active use.\nMany of the dams are little more than mounds of soil and rock that can be costly and complicated to raze. Over the past 15 years, more than 30 dams have been removed in Massachusetts, and up to 30 projects are in planning at any given time.\nThough they often no longer have any immediate purpose, dams — and the ponds they create — have become a part of the aesthetic landscape of the communities that surround them. In Norwell, neighbors said they’ll be sorry to see the Tack Factory Dam go.\nAdvertisement\n“It was a very popular spot. People ice skate there,” said Warren M. Childs, whose property backs up to the former edge of the pond. “It was a great place for kids to go, just to explore around the pond, look for frogs, turtles, things like that.”\nHe said some neighbors disputed the need to get rid of the dam, arguing the pond had its own ecosystem that would be disrupted by the change. But Childs and his wife ultimately decided there was nothing to be done.\n“We’d prefer to have the pond there, but I think most people recognize that these dam removals are happening, and we’re trying to make the best of it,” he said.\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nThis dam in Norwell will be removed soon, allowing Third Herring Brook to flow into the North River for the first time since the 17th century.\nThe dam is now owned by the nonprofit Cardinal Cushing Centers. Workers used to make tacks on the site, but it had shut down long before it burned in 1983.\nUnder state law, owners are liable for injuries and damage caused by dam failures, which provides another incentive for them to work toward taking them down.\nState officials and groups such as the watershed association try to push the process along by offering help to plan and pay for demolition. In the case of the Tack Factory Dam, state, federal, and private grants helped the owner pay for the $420,000 project.\nMassachusetts is among only a handful of states that have dedicated staff to help owners with dam removal, and the work is starting to make headway, according to Beth Lambert, aquatic habitat restoration program manager in the state Department of Fish and Game.\n‘After the dam goes out and the natural river reestablishes itself, the neighbors really enjoy that.’\nBeth Lambert, Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game “Interest is definitely growing,” she said. “We get more calls from dam owners every year than we can provide assistance to.”\nA 2005 crisis involving Taunton’s Whittenton Pond Dam helped highlight the issues presented by the state’s inventory of aging dams.\nThat structure was on the verge of collapse after a period of heavy rain, drawing national attention as the specter of a catastrophic flood loomed over downtown Taunton. Workers were able to shore it up before it was demolished in 2013, but the lessons reverberated, Lambert said.\n“That really raised the awareness of the failing dams,” she said.\nAnother dam on Third Herring Brook gave the watershed association its first opportunity to try a removal in the river system that flows into the North River.\nThe group had been working to gather support for such a project for more than a decade before it took down the Mill Pond Dam in 2014.\nIt was an encouraging project, said Woods, of the watershed association, but it had nowhere near the ecological benefit of the Tack Factory project, which is downstream and blocks fish from swimming into Wildcat Brook, Silver Brook, and other waters.\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nSamantha Woods of the North & South Rivers Watershed Association says river restoration is “pretty profound.”\nThe demolition should be done by the end of the year, after workers scoop enough of the earth away to make room for the brook to flow through in perpetuity.\nWoods said she believes the project will make a difference for the herring population, a food source that helps sustain offshore fisheries for cod, tuna, striped bass, and other commercial catches.\nSome argue that the construction of fish ladders, which allow fish to traverse dams, could help the herring get upstream while keeping dams and ponds in place. But Woods believes that it is best to remove the man-made structures blocking the water. As she puts it, “Fish like rivers.”\nOn a recent morning, Woods drove over to where the Mill Pond Dam had been. In contrast to the bare landscape left behind by the pond at Tack Factory, the brook at Mill Pond flows through cattails and grasses that sway in the breeze.\nEventually, a similar scene will grow at the newly cleared site downstream, she said.\nLambert said she understands it is hard for people to say goodbye to the ponds that have been a part of their landscapes for generations, but she said successful projects create a different kind of natural beauty.\n“After the dam goes out and the natural river reestablishes itself, the neighbors really enjoy that also,” she said. “They enjoy the sound of the moving water as it trickles over the rocks, and in the end they really like the project. It’s just really difficult for people to imagine that in advance.”\nAndy Rosen can be reached at andrew.rosen@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @andyrosen .",

      "text": " Google+\nRae Cook for The Boston Globe\nBy Linda Rodriguez McRobbie Globe Correspondent November 27, 2016\nA flock of starlings in flight is called a “murmuration,” one of the most pleasing collective nouns. It’s also one of nature’s most pleasing sights, an undulating mass of thousands of black dots that coalesce into hypnotic shapes, like an airborne Rorschach test or a lava lamp.\nBut to some in the United States, a murmuration of starlings is unwelcome. Loud and aggressive, the species is said to bully the native woodpeckers and bluebirds. Starlings also have a problematic tendency to murmurate near airfields; in 1960, a Lockheed Electra took off from Logan Airport into a flock of some 10,000 starlings and crashed, killing 62 passengers. In 1990, a writer in The New York Times opined that the starling had “distinguished itself as one of the costliest and most noxious birds on our continent.” This, according to the paper, is a pestilent, ravenous bird that defiles with droppings what it doesn’t eat, costing farmers millions.\nAdvertisement\nThe big problem with starlings is that they don’t belong here. They are what‘s called an introduced, alien, or exotic species. If a species is bad enough, like the aggressive starling, we call it “invasive.” In 1992, famed Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson branded “exotic animals” the second-largest cause of extinctions worldwide, behind habitat destruction. He expressed what was then coalescing into the dominant discourse about introduced organisms: They’re bad news. We don’t want them.\nThis, in part, is why conservationists were alarmed this past summer when odd species of turtles were spotted in Quincy and Western Massachusetts . It’s why park officials in Des Moines are trying to weed out non-native honeysuckles and Florida conservationists are trying to persuade chefs and supermarkets to serve up lionfish . It’s why the United States and the European Union have been fighting a trade dispute about Maine lobsters in Sweden .\nSo what should we do about starlings — and all these other interlopers?\nFor a growing minority of biologists, conservationists, ecologists, and environmental writers, the answer is simple. Nothing.\nT he occasion for the Times’ scathing op-ed on the starlings was the 100th anniversary of their introduction into America. On March 6, 1890, Eugene Schieffelin, a wealthy pharmaceuticals maker and inveterate bird importer, released 60 European starlings in Central Park. The starlings loved America. All of it. By 1929, they’d made it as far as Oklahoma. By 1942, they were in California. Now, some 200 million starlings eat, defecate, and bully in almost every state in the Union.\nAdvertisement\nThe Department of Agriculture now considers the bird one of the most worrisome invasive animals, right up there with the nutria gnawing through Louisiana river banks and the Burmese pythons swallowing alligators in the Everglades. “It’s the poster child for what it is we don’t like about invasives,” declares Ron Rohrbaugh of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Between 2014 and 2015, more than 1 million starlings in 45 states — notably, just half of a percent of the total US starling population — were killed by the federal government in a bid to curb the bird’s destructive presence.\nBut starlings may not be as problematic as we think. For one thing, though there is evidence that starlings moving into an area can lead to a local decline of certain native bird populations, there is no evidence that there is a decline in the larger population. In their case against the starling, the USDA notes, “From 1990 to 2013 European starlings were involved in 3,348 aircraft strikes resulting in $6,865,043 in damage costs to the airlines.” Yet during the period of 1990 to 2014, red-tailed hawks — so American they sailed into a John Denver song — cost airlines $23,649,229, the government estimated, and few are arguing to exterminate them.\nSupposedly, the birds eat $800 million worth of grain in the United States each year. Yet environmental writer Fred Pearce points out that, if the starling displaces native birds, it’s displacing birds that would have fed on (and defecated on) the same crops. Starlings have done some good things: During the 1934 drought in Illinois, for example, starlings and their ravenous appetite reportedly saw off the destructive chinch bug.\nWhile not exactly defending starlings, Pearce and others worry about what they see as the simplistic dogma of conservation biology: Native is good, foreign is bad. Pearce, an environmental journalist for The Guardian and others, explored the knee-jerk rejection of introduced species in his 2015 book, “The New Wild,” ultimately arguing that successful non-native species, including those labeled invasive, have a lot more to offer than dogma dictates.\nN ot all alien species are disliked. Both cows and honey bees, for instance, were introduced. The honey bee is now the state insect of 12 states. But during the 20th century, sentiment turned against non-native species, sometimes without regard to their actual impact. In a 2011 paper, Dr. Martin Schlaepfer of SUNY Syracuse and his colleagues determined that “a bias persists against non-native species among scientists.” The positive effects of an introduced species are rarely reported, and scientific literature about non-native species is “frequently scattered with militarized and xenophobic expressions.”\nTo the US government and the European Parliament, an invasive species is defined as one that might “harm” the ecosystem. But the meaning of “harm” is often based on what humans need or want, not what’s best for nature.\nStill, for government, the mandate to oust invaders is clear. “There are a lot of invasive pests where there is really no question, and I would say that a majority of them would fall into that category,” said Dr. Rosalind James, who studies invasive pests of crops in the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service. She points to citrus greening, a disease currently devastating the Florida orange crop. It spreads via the Asian psyllid, a tiny bug that has cut a swath through citrus trees from China to Afghanistan and now the Western Hemisphere. The US government has plunged $380 million into eradicating the disease, and the bug, since 2009.\nOne of the reasons that the insect and the disease have been so devastating is that the citrus groves are dominated by a single type of orange, said Dr. Matthew Chew, a biologist at Arizona State University. “Any agricultural pest does threaten the food supply,” he said, “but what also threatens the food supply is the choices we have made about agriculture and standardizing it.” Usually, it’s human activity, from pollution to habitat destruction to extermination to increasingly narrow farming practices, that causes the greatest harm to ecosystems and provides a foothold for alien species. The pest takes the blame.\nThe way we regard alien species is wrapped up in how we view nature and our place in it — or not in it.\nPearce agrees that there are situations in which an organism, introduced or not, may become a problem for humans. Those situations, he maintains, are not as clear-cut as we’d think. The zebra mussel, for example, is the great villain of invasive species. The New York Times described it in 2014 as a “silent invader” responsible for “vast economic and ecological damage” around the Great Lakes, after its accidental transportation from Central Asia in the ballast of cargo ships in the 1980s.\nBut that’s not the whole story. The mussel first made it to Lake Erie, which was so polluted in the 1960s and ’70s that it was declared “dead.” The mussels thrived because they encountered little resistance, because so few creatures remained. But as Pearce explains, the Great Lakes owe a debt of gratitude to the hardy mussel: It could not only thrive in Erie’s fetid waters, but also filter pollution and initiate the Herculean task of making the lake livable again.\nThis surprising pattern emerges in other cases, while the promised alien species apocalypse rarely happens. Ken Thompson, plant biologist at the University of Sheffield and the author of “Where Do Camels Belong? Why Invasive Species Aren’t All Bad,” agrees: “We should be a bit more grateful,” he says, “that given how totally we’ve messed up that there are animals and plants that are still happy to live in these places.”\nPearce worries that seeing off successful non-natives and invasives would sacrifice the one quality that they exhibit so aggressively: the ability to survive. “The problem is that when we root out invasive species, we’re reducing nature’s resilience,” he said. This fits squarely in the mounting evidence that the principle of natural selection works over decades, not just over eons.\nT he way we regard alien species is wrapped up in how we view nature and our place in it — or not in it. EU legislation targets only those “alien invasive” species that arrived in their new habitat as a consequence of human intervention. “It starts from the very beginning that humans are not part of the natural world,” said Thompson.\nThe implication is that we have severed ourselves from the natural world to such a degree that we don’t recognize that we are living in an ecosystem and that we’re probably the most invasive species in it. How do we care for something that we must also shape to our own needs?\nWhich brings us back to our original question: What about the starlings? We could spend time and money trying to exterminate them, more than we already do; certainly, other governments are taking that line. This July, the government of New Zealand announced an ambitious plan to eradicate all of the island nation’s introduced predatory species by 2050, including, but not limited to, cats, rats, possums, and stoats. While conservationists in New Zealand lauded the move, others in the field questioned its ethics and efficacy.\nExtermination is costly, can be grisly, and doesn’t always work. It also might just make things worse, damaging ecosystems that have forged new balances. “I’m a big believer in picking fights you’re going to win, and that’s a fight you’re not going to win,” said Thompson. Though he does not concur with Thompson’s perspective on invasives, Rohrbaugh agrees — any management plan needs to take into account the “cascading effects” of removal, “especially if those invasive species have been in place for dozens or hundreds of years, and they have become part of that ecosystem.”\nAnd even then, even after forming a conservation solution based on the best available science, “those management solutions might be entirely impractical and might do more harm to an ecosystem than doing nothing at all,” he said.\nLinda Rodriguez McRobbie is an American freelance writer living in London.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google Artificial Intelligence Whiz Describes Our Sci-Fi Future \nThe next time you enter a query into Google’s search engine or consult the company’s map service for directions to a movie theater, remember that a big brain is working behind the scenes to provide relevant search results and make sure you don’t get lost while driving. \nWell, not a real brain per se, but the Google Brain research team. As Fortune’s Roger Parloff wrote , the Google Brain research team has created over 1,000 so-called deep learning projects that have supercharged many of Google’s products over the past few years like YouTube, translation, and photos. With deep learning , researchers can feed huge amounts of data into software systems called neural nets that learn to recognize patterns within the vast information faster than humans. \nIn an interview with Fortune , one of Google Brain’s co-founders and leaders, Jeff Dean, talks about cutting-edge A.I. research, the challenges involved, and using A.I. in its products. The following has been edited for length and clarity. \nWhat are some challenges researchers face with pushing the field of artificial intelligence? \nA lot of human learning comes from unsupervised learning where you’re just sort of observing the world around you and understanding how things behave. That’s a very active area of machine-learning research, but it’s not a solved problem to the extent that supervised learning is. \nSo unsupervised learning refers to how one learns from observation and perception, and if computers could observe and perceive on their own that could help solve more complex problems? \nRight, human vision is trained mostly by unsupervised learning. You’re a small child and you observe the world, but occasionally you get a supervised signal where someone would say, “That’s a giraffe” or “That’s a car.” And that’s your natural mental model of the world in response to that small amount of supervised data you got. \nWe need to use more of a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. We’re not really there yet, in terms of how most of our machine learning systems work. \nCan you explain the A.I. technique called reinforcement learning? \nThe idea behind reinforcement learning is you don’t necessarily know the actions you might take, so you explore the sequence of actions you should take by taking one that you think is a good idea and then observing how the world reacts. Like in a board game where you can react to how your opponent plays. Eventually after a whole sequence of these actions you get some sort of reward signal. \nReinforcement learning is the idea of being able to assign credit or blame to all the actions you took along the way while you were getting that reward signal. It’s really effective in some domains today. \nI think where reinforcement learning has some challenges is when the action-state you may take is incredibly broad and large. A human operating in the real world might take an incredibly broad set of actions at any given moment. Whereas in a board game there’s a limited set of moves you can take, and the rules of the game constrain things a bit and the reward signal is also much clearer. You either won or lost. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nIf my goal was to make a cup of coffee or something, there’s a whole bunch of actions I might want to take, and the reward signal is a little less clear. \nBut you can still break the steps down, right? For instance, while making a cup of coffee, you could learn that you didn’t fully ground the beans before they were brewed—and that it resulted in bad coffee. \nRight. I think one of the things about reinforcement learning is that it tends to require exploration. So using it in the context of physical systems is somewhat hard. We are starting to try to use it in robotics. When a robot has to actually take some action, it’s limited to the number of sets of actions it can take in a given day. Whereas in computer simulations, it’s much easier to use a lot of computers and get a million examples. \nIs Google incorporating reinforcement learning in the core search product? \nThe main place we’ve applied reinforcement learning in our core products is through collaboration between DeepMind [the AI startup Google bought in 2014] and our data center operations folks. They used reinforcement learning to set the air conditioning knobs within the data center and to achieve the same, safe cooling operations and operating conditions with much lower power usage . They were able to explore which knob settings make sense and how they reacted when you turn something this way or that way. \nThrough reinforcement learning they were able to discover knob settings for these 18 or however many knobs that weren’t considered by the people doing that task. People who knew about the system were like, “Oh, that’s a weird setting,” but then it turned out that it worked pretty well. \nWhat makes a task more appropriate for incorporating reinforcement learning? \nThe data center scenario works well because there are not that many different actions you can take at a time. There’s like 18 knobs, you turn a knob up or down, and you’re there. The outcome is pretty measurable. You have a reward for better power usage assuming you’re operating within the appropriate margins of acceptable temperatures. From that perspective, it’s almost an ideal reinforcement learning problem. \nAn example of a messier reinforcement learning problem is perhaps trying to use it in what search results should I show. There’s a much broader set of search results I can show in response to different queries, and the reward signal is a little noisy. Like if a user looks at a search result and likes it or doesn’t like it, that’s not that obvious. \nHow would you even measure if they didn’t like a certain result? \nRight. It’s a bit tricky. I think that’s an example of where reinforcement learning is maybe not quite mature enough to really operate in these incredibly unconstrained environments where the reward signals are less crisp. \nWhat are some of the biggest challenges in applying what you’ve learned doing research to actual products people use each day? \nOne of the things is that a lot of machine learning solutions and research into those solutions can be reused in different domains. For example, we collaborated with our Map team on some research. They wanted to be able to read all the business names and signs that appeared in street images to understand the world better, and know if something’s a pizzeria or whatever. \nIt turns out that to actually find text in these images, you can train a machine learning model where you give it some example data where people have drawn circles or boxes around the text. You can actually use that to train a model to detect which pixels in the image contain text. \nThat turns out to be a generally useful capability, and a different part of the Map team is able to reuse that for a satellite-imagery analysis task where they wanted to find roof tops in the U.S. or around the world to estimate the location of solar panel installations on rooftops. For more about Google, watch: \nAnd then we’ve found that the same kind of model can help us on preliminary work on medical imaging problems. Now you have medical images and you’re trying to find interesting parts of those images that are clinically relevant. \n",

      "text": "Trump Tower Was Temporarily Renamed ‘Dump Tower’ on Google Maps by Ken Meyer | 3:30   \nAn online prankster decided to take a shot at Donald Trump by giving his home a rather unflattering new name on Google Maps. \nTrump Tower has been the primary base of operations for the President-elect as he continues to prepare his White House transition. For a few hours on Saturday, though, people took notice of something odd that happened for anyone who happened to look up Trump’s address. High five to the Google Maps genius who changed T***p Tower to its rightful name, Dump Tower pic.twitter.com/W1DC53F8pn \n— Lesley Abravanel (@lesleyabravanel) November 27, 2016 Rigged! @google Maps shows Trump Tower as \"Dump Tower\" pic.twitter.com/L8pZk1y0zc \n— Evan Smith (@evanasmith) November 26, 2016 Who wants to take a dump at Dump Tower? pic.twitter.com/fe8uwO4AKm \n— Veronica (@VeroniGabrielle) November 26, 2016 \nWPIX noted that Trump International Hotel & Tower was also changed to “Dump International Hotel & Tower.” Both names have been changed back, and a Google spokeswoman said that the incident most likely occurred because the site allows users to contribute edits and updates to the Map Maker service. \n“Some inappropriate names were surfacing in Google Maps that should not be, and we apologize for any offense this may have caused,” the spokeswoman said. “Our teams immediately took action and have fixed the issue.” \n[image via Glynnis Jones/Shutterstock]",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nAccording to Yahoo! News, Chinese media gave favorable tidings concerning President-elect Donald Trump Tuesday following a phone call between Trump and the President of China, Xi Jinping.\nChinese media reportedly hailed Trump’s rise to power as the beginning of a possible “reshaping” of Sino-American relations.\nThe president and president-elect spoke Monday, and the conversation was described as “diplomatically impeccable and has bolstered optimism over bilateral relations in the next four years,” according to the Chinese newspaper Global Times.\n“Trump is probably the very American leader who will make strides in reshaping major-power relations in a pragmatic manner,” the paper continued.\nThis comes as a stark contrast to what the mainstream media would have us believe. It does not appear that we have any kind of trade war on the horizon.\nOne of the major contentions about Trump that many voters had voiced during his campaign was his rhetoric concerning China; he has gone so far in the past as to call the economic giant America’s enemy.\nThe New York Times published a transcript of a Trump foreign policy speech given in April 2016 in which Trump asserted that “(w)e have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it.”\nThat’s bold talk for anyone who is now having civil conversations with China’s head of state, but perhaps the Chinese appreciate strength and straightforwardness. Regardless of past rhetoric, it at least appears that China is willing to deal with the president-elect.\nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about China’s reaction to our incoming president!\nWhat do you think of China’s reaction to Trump?

      "text": "| Topic: Cloud \nWith Amazon Web Services hosting its annual powwow this week talk about the price for performance and agility equation will be everywhere. Special Feature Cloud Computing: Moving to IaaS \nInfrastructure as a Service providers make a very compelling argument for businesses to stop running their own data centers and simply purchase server capacity on-demand and scale up and down as needed. This is our deep dive on IaaS strategy and best practices Read More \nKnowing AWS' re:Invent conference is kicking off this week, the largest cloud service provider has been busy cutting prices for various instances. Rest assured that Google and Microsoft are likely to toss in their own price cuts as AWS speaks to its base. \nBut the cloud pricing equation is getting complicated for compute instances. Not so shockingly, these price discussions have to include discounts. Like everything in enterprise technology there's the street price and your price. Comparing the cloud providers on pricing is tricky given Microsoft, Google and AWS all have different approaches to discounts. \nAlso: IaaS: What you need to know about pricing, options, best practices | Eight questions to ask before choosing an IaaS vendor | IaaS checklist: Best practices for picking an IaaS vendor \nFortunately, RightScale on Monday will outline a study on cloud compute prices. Generally speaking AWS won't be your cheapest option for compute. AWS typically lands in the middle between Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. \nThe bottom line is that AWS uses reserved instances in 1-year and 3-year terms to offer discounts. Microsoft requires an enterprise agreement for its Azure discounts. Google has sustained usage discounts that are relatively easy to follow. \nOverall, RightScale found that Google will be cheapest in most scenarios because sustained usage discounts are automatically applied. Among the key takeaways: If you need solid state drive performance instead of attached storage Google will charge you a premium. Azure matches or beats AWS for on-demand pricing consistently. AWS won't be the cheapest alternative in many scenarios. Then again AWS has a bigger menu, more advanced cloud services and the customer base where it doesn't have to go crazy on pricing. AWS just has to be fair. Your results will vary based on the level of your Microsoft enterprise agreement and what reserved instances were purchased on AWS. \nHere are three slides to ponder from RightScale. \nAdd it up and you'd be advised to make your own comparisons, check out RightScale's SlideShare and then crunch some numbers. In the end, enterprises may have to have all three cloud providers in their company--if only to play them off each other.

      "text": "— Rob Woodyard (@robwoodyard1) November 27, 2016 A search on Google Maps for Trump Tower comes up as Dump Tower...cause google is passive-aggressively awesome. #NotMyPresident pic.twitter.com/gETxgdXSIb — Girls Really Rule. (@girlsreallyrule) November 27, 2016 Perhaps not surprisingly, Dump Trump also seemed to have ties to Russia. @PIX11News When you search Google Maps for 'Dump Tower NYC' you get it in cyrillic, though not actual Russian. pic.twitter.com/czbwxZeyWq — Tami Mars (@Tami_Skye_Mars) November 27, 2016 But wait. How could this have happened? Who has access to Google Maps, anyway? Let’s turn to the Google Support Frequently Asked Questions for guidance. Google Support By Sunday, however, the Dump Tower name had been returned to its rightful owner. It is now known once again as Trump Tower. \n\"Some inappropriate names were surfacing in Google Maps that should not be, and we apologize for any offense this may have caused,” a Google Maps spokesperson told Pix 11. “Our teams immediately took action and have fixed the issue.” \nTrump has spent his early morning tweeting about the Wisconsin vote recount and the rest of the day tweeting about how he would have won the popular vote if he had tried harder. As of this writing, there has been no Twitter mention by Trump about Dump Tower.",

      "text": " Google+\nEvan Vucci/Associated Press\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Jeremy C. Fox Globe Correspondent November 28, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump attempted on Sunday to call into question election results in New Hampshire, claiming — but offering no evidence — that there had been voter fraud in the swing state narrowly won by Hillary Clinton.\n“Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California — so why isn’t the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!” the Republican tweeted.\nAdvertisement\nThe claim, which critics quickly mocked as implausible, echoed in part assertions that were made and debunked in the days before the election.\nThomas D. Rath, the former New Hampshire attorney general who has opposed Trump, tweeted, “This will probably cost me my spot in the Cabinet but there was no fraud, serious or other, in this election in NH. There just wasn’t.”\nRath, a Republican who served as New Hampshire primary campaign co-chairman to Ohio Governor John Kasich, did not respond to request for further comment.\nThis will probably cost me my spot in the Cabinet but there was no fraud, serious or other, in this election in NH. There just wasn't.\n— Tom Rath (@polguru) November 28, 2016 View Story It’s official: N.H. goes to Clinton Donald Trump’s campaign had until 5 p.m. Monday to seek a recount, but didn’t.\nTrump’s media office did not immediately respond to a request Sunday night for information about what led him to allege that voter fraud had affected results in New Hampshire and the other states.\nHis message followed a series of earlier posts on Sunday in which Trump voiced opposition to recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania proposed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and supported in Wisconsin by representatives for Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\nAdvertisement\nTrump also continued to claim — without providing any support — that voter fraud had been widespread in the Nov. 8 election.\nMidafternoon on Sunday, he tweeted, “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”\nNo evidence has been reported of widespread voting fraud anywhere in the country.\nIn New Hampshire, a spokesman for outgoing Governor Maggie Hassan, pushed back against Trump’s claim. Hassan, a Democrat, also won a narrow race in New Hampshire, unseating incumbent Republican US Senator Kelly Ayotte.\n“His tweet is completely unsubstantiated and claims of voter fraud in New Hampshire have earned Politifact’s rating of ‘Pants on Fire.’ ” said the spokesman, William Hinkle.\nHinkle was referring to a report by the non-partisan fact-checking website that debunked claims by then-New Hampshire Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu, who later won the election for governor.\nOn Oct. 31, Sununu said on Howie Carr’s WRKO radio show that Democrats had abused the state’s same-day voter registration law and bused in voters from Massachusetts, according to published reports.\n“We have same day voter registration, and to be honest, when Massachusetts elections are not very close, they’re busing them in all over the place,” Sununu said, according to the Concord Monitor .\nSununu later walked back some of his claims.\nPolitifact found that voter fraud had been reported in New Hampshire — but only on a small scale, and that Sununu provided no evidence that out-of-state voters had been bused into the Granite State.\nIt Quote: d New Hampshire Secretary of State William M. Gardner saying there had been prosecutions for election fraud in each year since 2000 and that out-of-state residents had been caught voting there, but that fraud had not been a widespread problem.\n“I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,” Gardner said, according to Politifact. Gardner and two deputy secretaries of state could not be reached for comment Sunday night.\nPolitifact called Sununu’s claim “ridiculous.”\nOn Sunday, Sununu spokesman David Abrams said he had not yet seen Trump’s tweet, but that Sununu’s “position on voter fraud and election reform is well recorded.”\nAbrams said that Sununu had expressed to him no concerns about voter fraud in New Hampshire in the nearly three weeks since the election.\nSome New Hampshire Democrats responded in outraged terms to Trump’s claim.\nJeff Woodburn, a state senator, wrote on Facebook that he took “great pride in the integrity of New Hampshire’s voting process.” Woodburn said he believed Sununu’s earlier comments were the source of “President-elect Trump’s outrageous, unsubstantiated claim that New Hampshire’s election was rigged by ‘serious voter fraud.’”\nColin Van Ostern, a Democratic member of New Hampshire’s Executive Council who ran unsucccessfully for governor this year, tweeted , “This false attack on NH’s elections reveals how threatened he is by the power of voters -- which he wants to restrict. Resist!”\nDean Barker, a Democratic blogger in New Hampshire, wrote : “This is a real moment of truth for #NHGov-Elect Sununu. Will he knock this falsehood down or drag our state’s reputation down with it?”\nBarker also pointed out that the Trump campaign had the opportunity to request a recount in the state but allowed the Nov. 14 deadline to pass.\nSerious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016\nGlobe correspondent Felicia Gans contributed to this report. Jeremy C.

      "text": " Google+\nDaniel Hertzberg for The Boston Globe\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs November 27, 2016\nPart of a weekly series on the economic choices facing the United States and its relations with the rest of the world. For previous entries, click here .\nOf all of the purposes of government, one of the most important but often neglected is to mobilize science and technology to solve critical challenges. Modern society depends on highly complex technological systems for our safety and prosperity. Without these advanced technological systems, we’d have no chance to sustain national prosperity, much less to meet the basic material needs of a global population of 7.4 billion people. Yet managing and improving those technologies requires a large and sustained investment by government alongside business and academia.\nThe key idea here is “directed technological change,” meaning that scientists and engineers are pulled together to solve a complex challenge in the national interest. The challenge is not only important and solvable, but because of its nature, is not the kind of challenge that the private sector alone will solve in a timely way on a for-profit basis.\nAdvertisement\nModern American history is replete with such endeavors. No doubt the most famous and consequential of all was the Manhattan Project during World War II. It is a stunning example of directed scientific and technological effort, showing how the most complex and cutting-edge scientific challenge can be met through targeted investments.\nIn 1938, on the eve of World War II, European physicists discovered the principle of nuclear fission (splitting an atom by a neutron, releasing enormous energy and more neutrons) and the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. Within a year, physicists realized that this could lead to a new kind of atomic bomb and the threat that Nazi Germany might get there first. Albert Einstein and Edward Szilard wrote a world-changing letter to President Franklin Roosevelt advising the president of this risk and urging a US effort to develop such a weapon before Germany.\nThe Manhattan Project got underway intensively in 1942 and culminated in the atomic bomb in 1945. The project engaged many of the world’s leading physicists in the effort and led to countless scientific and technological breakthroughs in a three-year period. Thus was born the nuclear era.\nThe mobilization of great minds, national laboratories, and private companies in pursuit of well-defined objectives is therefore not a quixotic quest. The lessons of the Manhattan Project were taken up after World War II in many important areas of national security, public health, new technologies, and general science. From the birth of modern computing, to the polio vaccine and the space age, to the human genome and the Internet, directed technological change has repeatedly shaped and advanced the US economy and the modern world.\nThese efforts are all characterized by highly complex challenges; a sense of national urgency; and a mix of academic, philanthropic, commercial, and government organizations and financing.\nAdvertisement\nConsider Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine, developed half a century ago. The main financing came through a nonprofit organization (popularly known as the March of Dimes) launched by FDR in 1938. Jonas Salk led a scientific team at the University of Pittsburgh for seven years, from 1947 to 1954, to develop the vaccine. In 1955, the vaccine was tested and massively disseminated in an unprecedented public health campaign that engaged governments at all levels. Salk’s vaccine, followed by Albert Sabin’s vaccine a few years later, ended the US epidemic. Polio is now on the verge of global eradication. When asked who owned the patent on the polio vaccine, Salk famously replied, “There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”\nAs with the Manhattan Project, the US space effort was launched as a national security effort, part of the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union successfully launched the Sputnik satellite, in 1957, the US ramped up its own efforts. In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy inspired the nation with his call for America to commit itself to “achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.” The United States thereafter spent around 0.5 percent of GDP each year for the balance of the decade to support NASA’s successful moon effort, mobilizing an estimated 500,000 workers and 20,000 companies. The spillovers in computing, semiconductors, aeronautics, telecommunications, materials sciences, and countless other areas of science and technology have of course been profound.\nThe Internet was similarly given birth in a US government effort again linked to national security. In this case, the Defense Department was interested in creating a network of computers that could support a resilient command-and-control system military, supported by a geographically dispersed access to a few major computer centers around the country. The core building blocks of the Internet were developed as part of the Defense Department’s ARPANET project that ran from the late 1960s until 1990. Building on ARPANET, the US National Science Foundation during the 1980s established and developed a network linking major US universities. From the 1990s onward, these publicly financed efforts became the foundation of the Internet and the vast commercial business world built upon it.\nThe list of such targeted technology efforts is long and inspiring. Moore’s Law, the repeated doubling of computer power roughly every two years since the late 1950s, builds on industry and government technology roadmaps. The Human Genome Project, to map the human genome, was a breakthrough program during 1990-2003 that engaged leaders in academic biology, private biotech startups, and major government research centers in the United States and abroad; the continuing spillovers in countless areas of public health, medicine, agronomy, archeology, anthropology, and many other disciplines remain vast. Even hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to produce oil and gas from shale rock depended on the early initiatives of the US Geological Survey.\nFor these reasons, the frequently heard political complaints about federal funding of early-stage technologies (e.g., of the solar company Solyndra or electric vehicle Tesla) seriously miss the point of the key role of publicly supported R&D in delivering cutting-edge technologies (a point well documented by economist Mariana Mazzucato in her book “The Entrepreneurial State’’). Not every R&D project bears fruit, to be sure; such is the nature of cutting-edge research. Yet the track record of public-private-academic-philanthropic partnerships to advance science and technologies in critical areas is a key pillar of America’s prosperity and technological excellence.\nOne of the threats to America’s well-being indeed is the current insufficiency of such efforts in areas of critical need. There are many highly promising and crucially important areas of R&D where purely private and profit-driven efforts based on the incentives from patenting are falling far short of social needs.\nCompare, for example, the $30 billion per year funding that is directed to biomedical science through the National Institutes of Health (itself too low a budget) with the mere $7 billion per year that is currently spent by the federal government on research into renewable or other low-carbon energy technologies. The threat of climate change is on the scale of trillions of dollars of damages per year, and the solutions depend on the rapid transition from fossil-fuel-based energy to zero-carbon alternatives.\nConsider two promising areas of energy research. The successful ramp-up of renewable energy depends in part on low-cost, highly reliable batteries with higher energy density (energy per unit weight). Battery technology is a major scientific and technological challenge, with the need for extensive research, much of it by highly sophisticated trial and error. Yet federal battery research is estimated to be around $300 million per year, a small fraction of the amount that could be usefully deployed by the nation’s laboratories and universities.\nAnother case is carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, the only climate-safe way to deploy fossil fuels in the future. Some technologies are attracting private capital, but much of the science (such as the geological research) is almost entirely a public good that requires public rather than private financing. Worldwide, the scale of public financing for R&D related to CCS remains minuscule, and clouds the prospects of any potential significant and timely deployment.\nOther areas crying out for greater public investments in R&D include: smart grid systems to manage 21st-century infrastructure; fourth-generation nuclear energy; advanced materials sciences for environmental sustainability; the early identification and control of emerging epidemic diseases such as Zika and Ebola viruses; advanced agricultural technologies for crop resilience to climate change; improved nutrition; geriatric medicine (including the soaring costs of Alzheimer’s disease); and improved cyber-security, including for important e-governance functions such as online voting.\nBecause of America’s chronic underfinancing of discretionary public spending, America’s technological leadership is being undermined. Yes, America is home to more of the world’s leading universities than any other country, and still has the greatest depth of scientific and engineering capacity, yet the chronic under-investment in cutting-edge science and technology puts the US technological capacity at risk.\nMeasuring R&D as a share of national income, the United States now ranks ninth among high-income countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. US R&D outlays are around 2.7 percent of national income, compared with more than 4.0 percent of GDP in Korea and Israel, and more than 3.0 percent of GDP in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, and Norway. In total dollars, China is currently around three-fourths of US outlays, and is very likely to overtake the United States during the coming decade on current trends.\nAs in past grand, projects should be guided by urgent public needs, and by areas where public financing is vital because private financing is inappropriate. That includes areas of basic science (where patents simply make no sense); challenges where market-based approaches are inappropriate (such as control of epidemic diseases); goals that depend on the very rapid uptake of new technologies, so that private patents would clog rather than accelerate deployment (smart power-grid protocols for integrating intermittent renewable energy); and goals that involve major social policies regarding risk and liability (nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage).\nIn many areas, such as disease control, crop productivity, and zero-carbon energy, much of the effort should be global, with costs and benefits shared across the world. Just as the moonshot eventually turned into significant global cooperation in space, our global-scale challenges also behoove us to create international as well as national frameworks for expanded R&D. The Department of Energy under Secretary Ernie Moniz is currently engaging 21 other countries to expand R&D on low-carbon energy, in the Mission Innovation Initiative. In this case, private-sector investors led by Bill Gates are stepping up alongside the government to invest “patient capital” in early-stage technologies.\nHere is my recommendation for President-elect Trump and the incoming Congress. Turn to our glorious national scientific institutions: the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, for a 2017 report to the nation on the most promising areas for directed research and development in the years to 2030. Ask the academies to recommend a strategy for ramping up the national R&D efforts. Call on America’s research universities to add their own brainstorming alongside the National Academies. When the report is issued, late in 2017, the president and Congress should meet in a joint session of Congress to set forth a new technology vision for the nation and a new R&D strategy to achieve it.\nJeffrey D.

      "text": " Google+\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff/File\nDonald Trump on the campaign trail in New Hampshire earlier this fall.\nBy Glenn Kessler The Washington Post November 27, 2016\nIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Angered by demands for a recount in the three states that gave him an electoral college victory, President-elect Trump made a bold but unsubstantiated assertion in a tweet - that ‘‘millions of people’’ voted illegally in the presidential election. He suggested they voted for Hillary Clinton, who now leads in the popular vote by 2.2 million votes, and thus he actually also won the popular vote.\nWinning the electoral college is all that counts in the presidential race. But losing the popular vote by such a substantial margin apparently gnaws at Trump. Is there any basis for his claim?\nTHE FACTS\nAdvertisement\nThe simple answer is no. This is a bogus claim with no documented proof.\nOur colleagues at snopes.com and PundiFact have already examined this claim, back when it was hot in the right-wing blogosphere, not a statement made by a future U.S. president.\nThe whole thing started with a few tweets by a self-described conservative voter fraud specialist, Gregg Phillips.\nView Story Trump claims he won the popular vote, alleges illegal voting “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump wrote on Twitter.\nHe tweeted, ‘‘Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team.’’\nThen, he tweeted, ‘‘We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens’’ and said his group would be part of legal action.\nAdvertisement\nThese claims were then picked up by such purveyors of false facts as Infowars.com, a conspiracy-minded website that, among other things, claims that no one actually died in the Sandy Hook shootings. One article described Phillips as being affiliated with voterfraud.org but in reality he claims to be founder of votestand.com, supposedly an app that detects vote fraud. Phillips also has claimed that Obamacare is the ‘‘biggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world’’ because it provided opportunities for voter registration.\nIn any case, Phillips made this claim - and then has refused to provide any evidence to back it up, even though reporters have asked.\n‘‘He said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy,’’ PundiFact reported. ‘‘Phillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used.’’\nIt’s certainly rather odd that Phillips would make such a claim before he had verified whether it was true. He did not respond to a query from The Fact Checker after Trump tweeted, though he gleefully celebrated anger at his claim.\nBack when Trump was trailing in the polls and was threatening to dispute the election results because the system was ‘‘rigged,’’ we’ve previously given Trump Four Pinocchios for making a number of bogus claims about alleged voter fraud.\nAmong other things, Trump falsely asserted that illegal immigrants were tipping the results in elections, based on a misinterpretation of disputed data. Even the researcher who produced the data said his findings were being taken out of context by Trump: ‘‘Our results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by non-citizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions.’’\nA representative of the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for evidence of Trump’s claim.\nThe Pinocchio Test\nSimply put, there is no evidence that ‘‘millions of people’’ voted illegally in the election.\nNow that Trump is on the verge of becoming president, he needs to be more careful about making wild allegations without little basis in fact, especially if the claim emerged from a handful of tweets and conspiracy-minded websites. He will quickly find that such statements will undermine his authority on other matters.\nRelated Trump claims he won the popular vote, alleges illegal voting",

      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS/Joe Skipper\nUS President-elect Donald Trump boarded his aircraft in West Palm Beach, Fla. on Sunday.\nBy Richard C. Paddock, Eric Lipton, Ellen Barry, Rod Nordland, Danny Hakim and Simon Romero New York Times November 28, 2016\nMANILA, Philippines — On Thanksgiving Day, a Philippine developer named Jose E.B. Antonio hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila’s poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for.\nIn October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila’s financial district — a 57-story symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan “Live Above the Rest.” And now his partner on the project, Donald Trump, had just been elected president of the United States.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the election, Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the president-elect’s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Antonio’s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including Trump-branded resorts in the Philippines, Antonio’s son Robbie Antonio said.\n“We will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,” the elder Antonio, one of the richest men in the Philippines, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his star-studded celebration in Manila.\nAntonio’s combination of jobs — he is a business partner with Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the president-elect — is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table.\nAmong them, Duterte has urged “a separation” from the United States and has called for U.S. troops to exit the country in two years. His anti-drug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial, prompting criticism from the Obama administration.\nSituations like these are leading some former government officials from both parties to ask whether U.S. reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family’s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise U.S. efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite.\nAdvertisement\n“It is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,” said Michael J. Green, who served on the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration and before that at the Defense Department.\nThe globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Trump’s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What’s more, the true extent of Trump’s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.\nIn an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business — and his family’s ability to keep it running after he takes office.\n“I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world,” Trump said, adding later: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.”\nIn a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings.\n“Vetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,” she said.\nBut a review by The Times of these business dealings identified the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies.\nIn Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro — one of Trump’s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake — is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project.\nSeveral of Trump’s real estate ventures in India — where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America — are being built through companies with family ties to India’s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Trump’s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans.\nIn Ireland and Scotland, executives from Trump’s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization’s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail’s habitat — a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States.\nAnd in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Trump’s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Trump came to the defense of Erdogan — suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup — the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Trump’s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests.\nTrump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. “I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. “It’s a tremendously successful job. It’s called Trump Towers — two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It’s two.”\nThese tangled ties already have some members of Congress — including at least one Republican representative — calling on Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them.\n“You rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,” Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., said in a Twitter message Monday. “If you have contracts w/foreign govts, it’s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp”\nDavid J. Kramer, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Trump’s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency — and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad.\n“This will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,” Kramer said.\nEven if Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president’s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.\n“The working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,” said Michael H. Fuchs, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. “They will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.” (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) At the same time, Fuchs said, U.S. diplomats in countries where Trump’s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.\nAnother question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of U.S. capitalism built in the name of the president?\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Trump’s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization’s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders — of Turkey, Argentina and Japan — having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide.\nTrump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team.\nFederal law does not prevent Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels.\n“I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, OK? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care,” Trump said, adding, “The only thing that matters to me is running our country.”\nRobert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in.\n“Let’s listen and not prejudge,” said Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I want to see what he does as president.”\n— Brazil: Nation Under Pressure and Ventures Under Scrutiny\nDonald Trump Jr., the president-elect’s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish 171-room beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a 4,000-square-foot nightclub.\n“This is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,” the younger Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time.\nBut just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the president-elect in their dealings in Latin America’s largest country.\nAnselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Brasília, opened an investigation in the weeks before the U.S. election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio.\nThe Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds — Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins state — put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra.\nIn 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil’s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries.\nBut Brazil’s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades.\nThe hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic.\nThe examination of the project by Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has found a series of “highly suspicious” potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. “It is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,” Lopes said in documents filed in October.\nIn his filings, Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies.\nTrump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of João Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil’s 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently.\nIn a statement, Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.\nAlan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, said in a statement Friday that the investigation was not targeting Trump or his company — given that it does not own the hotel — and “has no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.” (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister José Serra, Brazil’s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a “nightmare.” Although Temer has formally congratulated Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect.\nEven if Brazil’s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent.\n“Brazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that’s about all they can do,” said Maurício Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “This is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.”\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) — India: Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles\nOn the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing.\nIn 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state’s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization’s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed.\nThe participants recall the meeting differently: Trump’s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Chavan could formalize a policy so the project could continue. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Trump and his partner were “requesting a concession that could not be given.”\nBy the end of the meeting, it was fairly clear that the younger Trump’s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after.\n“He thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,” Chavan said.\nKalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai, the Trump Organization’s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Chavan that he had sought a special favor.\n“The notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,” Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. “The Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.”\nThis example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a U.S. president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians — officially or unofficially — to push projects through the bureaucracy.\nOften, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats “whose main goal in life is to attract rent,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India.\nOne of Trump’s projects, Trump Towers Pune, is under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country’s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to U.S. efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs.\nIt is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official.\nPoliticians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans.\nTop officials might “think in some way the U.S. president will help them,” and “can put in a friendly word with the banks” to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure.\n“If the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,” he said. “They will think the president is meeting them.”\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Another pitfall is that Donald Trump’s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits.\nTrump’s first projects in India, which are expected to increase in number over the next year, follow this pattern: His partner for Trump Towers Pune is Panchshil Realty, owned by a family that has a close and long-standing family relationship with one of the state’s most powerful politicians, Sharad Pawar, head of the small but influential Nationalist Congress Party. (Trump was photographed — in an image distributed on Twitter but since taken down — with executives from Panchshil Realty on Nov. 15.) Pawar’s daughter, Supriya Sule, a member of Parliament, holds a 2 percent share in Panchshil’s parent company, she said in an interview.\nTrump’s partner in the Trump Tower Mumbai is the Lodha Group, founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party — the governing party in Parliament — in Maharashtra state. The Lodha Group has already negotiated with the U.S. government; it announced a landmark purchase of a property, known as the Washington House, on tony Altamount Road, from the U.S. government for 3.75 billion rupees, almost $70 million.\nHis partner in an office complex in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, is IREO, whose managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the brother-in-law of a Bharatiya Janata member of Parliament, Sudhanshu Mittal. In an interview, Mittal has denied having any connection with the real estate company\nSuraj Hegde, secretary of the All India Congress Committee, a national body of Indian National Congress party members, said he was troubled by the dual roles Trump and his family would play in Indian affairs — particularly given real estate’s important role in India’s fast-growing economy, and the clout the United States has on the world stage.\n“Basically, this is the globalization of lobbying across countries, which then tries to establish monopoly over real estate,” Hegde said. He added that he was calling for an independent parliamentary investigation of such maneuvers, including Trump’s real estate ventures in India.\n“Establishing monopoly at the cost of small players by business connections to Mr. Trump is very worrisome,” he said. “This is not at all healthy for a democracy.”\n— Turkey: Mixing Business, Politics and Islam\nTrump’s business interests in Turkey are emblematic of two weighty contradictions for a businessman turned politician.\nAs a candidate, Trump railed against moving U.S. jobs overseas and promised to do something about it. As a businessman, he invested in a partnership with a furniture company in Turkey, making luxury furniture in the firm’s factory in western Anatolia and selling it in the United States and worldwide — a partnership that apparently remains active.\nTrump the candidate inveighed against Muslims and threatened at least a temporary ban on their entering the United States. Trump the businessman has in recent years had some of his biggest expansions overseas, including in Muslim countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even Azerbaijan.\nOne of the most visible Muslim-world symbols of that contradiction is in the bustling commercial district of Sisli, on the European side of Istanbul, where a pair of cantilevered modernist towers, nearly 40 stories high, bear Trump’s name.\nTurkey’s leader, Erdogan, visited Trump Towers Istanbul — one holds luxury apartments and one office space, with a shopping mall connecting the two — after their completion in 2012, with Trump and Ivanka Trump appearing as part of the celebration the next day.\n“We look forward to this being the first of many world-class developments undertaken together in Istanbul and throughout Turkey,” Trump said in a statement issued during the visit. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Beyond real estate, there is the Trump Organization’s 2013 partnership with Dorya International, a luxury furniture maker with a factory in Manisa province, near the city of Izmir, to build pieces sold under the Trump Home Collection.\nBut the presidential campaign demonstrated how the goals of his business and politics ventures can come into direct conflict, particularly once Trump in December proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, implying that all Muslims might pose a terrorist threat.\n“We regret and condemn Trump’s discriminatory remarks,” Bulent Kural, the manager of the Trump Towers Mall, wrote in an email to a reporter at the time, as he announced that the mall was considering removing Trump’s name. “Such statements bear no value and are products of a mind that does not understand Islam, a peace religion, at all. Our reaction has been directly expressed to the Trump family. We are reviewing the legal dimension of our relation with the Trump brand.”\nErdogan weighed in on the issue, too, saying, “The ones who put that brand on their building should immediately remove it.”\nTrump’s next move helped re-establish his standing. After a failed coup in Turkey in July, he defended Erdogan’s crackdown on dissidents, saying in an interview with The Times that the United States has to “fix our own mess” before trying to alter the behavior of other nations.\n“I don’t think we have a right to lecture,” Trump said in the interview. “Look at what is happening in our country,” he added, referring to violence in the United States. “How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?”\nIn between his two remarks — one infuriating the president of Turkey, the other comforting him — the calls for the renaming of the Trump Towers Mall ended. But much more is at stake in relations between the United States and Turkey than a shopping mall and two skyscrapers.\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Turkey is a key player in U.S. efforts to combat the Islamic State in the Middle East, and sits next door to Syria as the United States has armed rebel groups in an attempt to remove Syria’s president, Bashar Assad, from power.\nThe recent postelection telephone call between Trump and Erdogan suggests that business and political roles will continue to be mixed.\nAccording to a Turkish journalist, Amberin Zaman, writing in the independent online news outlet Diken, Trump told the Turkish leader that he and his daughter — who participated in the call — admired both Erdogan and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, Trump’s business associate in the towers, whom he called “a close friend.”\nZaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said no government officials had disputed her account of the conversation. “I’m of the opinion they were quite happy for this to be published,” she said. A spokeswoman for Trump declined to comment about the call.\nJennifer Harris, who served on the staff of the National Intelligence Council and on the State Department’s policy planning staff, said the twin hats that Trump and his family would be wearing in Turkey would almost certainly complicate the jobs of U.S. diplomats there.\n“It makes me wonder if the Trump administration will use the power of the state to help political or business allies and hurt political adversaries and business rivals,” she said.\n— The Philippines: What Stance Toward Duterte?\nDuterte’s anti-drug campaign has led to the summary deaths of thousands of suspected criminals at the hands of police and vigilantes since he took office June 30. The killing has been condemned by human rights activists — and the Obama administration.\nIn August, Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said the United States was “very deeply concerned” about reports of “extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities of individuals who are suspected to have been in drug activity in the Philippines.” She added, “We have also made our concerns known.”\nThe question now, former State Department officials say, is just what kind of a stand the Trump administration will take as Trump and his family balance their personal and financial ties with foreign policy demands.\nAntonio first met Trump casually in the 1990s and has been his business partner in the Philippines for five years. Duterte named him special envoy to the United States as the Philippines angrily pushed back at President Barack Obama for criticizing his deadly campaign. At the time of the appointment, Clinton was leading in the polls in the U.S. presidential election.\nDuterte has made clear that he does not appreciate U.S. meddling in his country’s domestic affairs.\n“I am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,” Duterte told reporters in early September, before a scheduled meeting in Laos with Obama that never took place. “I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody.”\nDuterte hand-picked Antonio as his intermediary with the United States, said his press secretary, Ernesto Abella, because of his business success, his previous experience as a special envoy to China and the Philippine president’s “deep intuition about people.” The appointment will be advantageous for the Philippines, Abella added, because Trump knows Antonio.\nEven before Trump has been sworn in, Antonio flew to New York and visited Trump Tower, where he met with Trump’s children, who are executives at the Trump Organization — which oversees the president-elect’s real estate ventures. This was a business trip, not a diplomatic one, said Robbie Antonio, Antonio’s son and the managing director of the family business. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) The two families are considering new ventures as they finish work on the Trump Tower in Makati City, a financial center within metropolitan Manila that is one of the country’s wealthiest enclaves and home to many of the nation’s elite.\nThe $150 million tower — one of the tallest in the Philippines — is on the gritty side of Makati about two blocks from Manila’s most notorious red-light district, where it is common to see prostitutes soliciting business and people sleeping on sidewalks. Completion, originally scheduled for this year, is now expected in 2017. About 240 of the 260 units have been sold, said Kristina Garcia, the director for investor relations.\n“We are bringing Trump to the Philippines because we believe that Trump exemplifies the best quality of real estate anywhere in the world,” Antonio said in a 2011 video promoting the project — in which Antonio is identified as “ambassador” and Trump also appears. “It also exemplifies luxury and it exemplifies exclusivity.”\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) In the interview at the celebration in Manila on Thursday evening, Robbie Antonio said he had little doubt of his father’s priorities: He will put the Philippines’ interests above those of his company. “It is for the good of the country now,” he said.\nBut Fuchs, who helped oversee U.S. relations with the Philippines as the deputy assistant secretary of state until early this year, said he was deeply troubled by Trump’s overlapping priorities, particularly given the long list of globally significant issues in play with the Philippines. These include planned joint military exercises in the South China Sea, the fight against militant Islamic groups based in the country’s southern islands and the human rights abuses taking place.\n“What we already have is a blurring of the lines between official and business activities,” Fuchs said. “The biggest gray area may not be a President Trump himself advocating for favors for the Trump Organization. It’s the diplomats and career officers who will feel the need to perhaps not do things that will harm the Trump Organization’s interests. It is seriously disturbing.”\n— Ireland and Scotland: Big Concerns Over a Tiny Snail\nThe vertigo angustior snail is only 2 millimeters long. But it punches above its weight.\nThe endangered little snail has helped stall Trump’s plans to build a sea wall to protect the coastline along his Trump International Golf Links course on the west coast of Ireland, in County Clare.\nEnvironmentalists, as well as surfers, list a host of concerns about the proposed wall, particularly its potential impact on sand dunes. Along with the snails, a patch of the dunes near the course is protected by European Union rules. But Trump’s organization has said the golf resort development might be dead in the water without the sea wall, and many locals welcome the business and the jobs it brings.\nThe battle is likely to be decided next year in front of a national planning board, in the weeks or months after Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, several people said. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) The planning board was overhauled in the 1980s to insulate it from political meddling, and it now has the confidence of environmentalists. But there is little precedent for the Trump situation, which could involve a public hearing.\n“They can be long, they can be lively, and a lot of things could be aired,” said Sean O’Leary, the executive director of the Irish Planning Institute, which represents the majority of the country’s professional planners.\nHe noted that the national planning board had considered a development proposed by a politician before, but that was a holiday home that the Irish president wanted to build.\n“The scale is slightly different,” he said.\nLocal officials have said the Trump Organization needs to resubmit its application by the end of the year. In a statement, the Trump Organization said it was “considering all potential coastal protection options at present” and would be in contact with the local authority before Christmas. The snail, the statement said, “is thriving on the site.”\n“Its only material threat is that presented by coastal erosion,” it added.\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Certainly, Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland have remained at the fore in the president-elect’s mind, even in recent days. Shortly after his election, he urged a group of Brexit campaigners led by Nigel Farage, head of the U.K. Independence Party, to fight against wind farms in Britain. Wind farms have been a favorite target of Trump’s in both Britain and Ireland, where he has railed against proposed installations as a potential blight on the views from his resorts.\nAfter a spokeswoman for Trump initially denied that the matter had been raised with Farage’s group, Trump conceded during his interview with The Times this past week that “I might have brought it up.”\nTony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Trump had once called him because Lowes’ group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Trump’s Irish course on environmental grounds.\n“He certainly hates wind farms, that’s for sure,” Lowes said about the call.\nHis group decided against working with Trump, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall.\n“The dune system will not be able to develop naturally,” Lowes said. “It will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die.” He added, “The whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that.”\nTrump’s representatives have advanced a number of rationales for the sea wall, with the most straightforward being that they simply want to buffer the land from an continuing erosion problem. The proposal has previously attracted attention because an environmental-impact statement submitted by Trump’s team highlighted the risks of climate change and its influence on “coastal erosion rates.” That was a noteworthy claim, since Trump has called global warming a hoax perpetrated “by and for the Chinese.” (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) The Irish government has zealously courted Trump. When he visited the course in 2014, he was greeted on the airport tarmac in Shannon with a red carpet, a harpist, a violinist and a singer whose voice cut through the runway clamor.\nMalachy Clerkin of The Irish Times called it “a preposterous welcome” and “the worst kind of forelock-tugging.”\nMany locals, however, support Trump’s development. Hugh McNally, the owner of Morrissey’s Bar in Doonbeg Village, about 2 miles from the course, said the issue had been “sensationalized by the media” because of the Trump connection.\n“I’ll give you an example,” he said. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced last year that it would close a plant in nearby Clarecastle, causing the loss of more than 200 jobs. “If someone told them you’d save those jobs by building any wall, everyone would do it,” he said. “The only reason people are objecting here is because of Trump.”\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.) <strong>— </strong>The World: A Transition and a Business Plan\nTrump’s family appears to have been preparing for the transition to the Oval Office and ways to capitalize on it both in the United States and around the globe.\nIn April, even before Trump had secured the Republican nomination, his business moved to trademark the name American Idea for use in branding hotels, spas and concierge services, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It was one of more than two dozen trademark applications Trump and members of his family filed in the United States and around the world while he was running for president.\nThe applications offer a glimpse of where the Trumps may intend to focus their business endeavors. Last month, representatives of the Trump Organization in Indonesia, where Trump has been pursuing two hotel deals, filed trademark registrations for use of the Trump name in connection with hotel management. Similar filings have been made in Mexico, Canada and the European Union.\nIvanka Trump has filed at least 25 trademark registrations for her brand of clothing, cosmetics and jewelry in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Mexico since the beginning of the year, mostly recently in October. Trump’s wife, Melania, filed a U.S. trademark application for a line of jewelry in August.\nAs he prepares for the presidency, Trump has made at least one concession so far, he said in the interview with The Times.\n“In theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business,” Trump said, before later adding, “but I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that’s happening right now.”",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Janelle Nanos Globe Staff November 27, 2016\nIn mid-September, the Greater Boston Food Bank received an unexpected bonanza: a donation of 11,000 organic eggs. But there was a problem. The nonprofit can distribute only unexpired food, and the expiration date on the eggs was approaching fast.\nFortunately, the region’s biggest food bank uses Spoiler Alert , a platform that connects distributors with food-rescue organizations. Within three hours, the eggs were claimed, scrambled, and served at a Salvation Army community center in Dorchester, and used in the teaching kitchen in the center’s culinary arts training program.\nAdvertisement\nSpoiled food is a costly problem, accounting for about $218 billion in financial losses to US farms, businesses, and consumers each year, according to ReFED, a group of companies, nonprofits, and foundations that was formed last year to minimize food waste. Since its launch in 2015, Spoiler Alert’s food-matching platform has been adopted by 200 businesses and nonprofits in New England to cut down on waste and encourage donations by making them easier to track.\nThe company was created by two MIT Sloan School of Management graduates, Ricky Ashenfelter and Emily Malina, and their chief technology officer, Marty Sirkin, and has worked its way through the city’s accelerator programs, winning $50,000 from MassChallenge in 2015 and a spot in this year’s Techstars Boston cohort.\nEarlier this month, it raised a $2.5 million seed round and announced a partnership with Sysco Corp., the largest wholesale food distributor in the country. Sysco generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the year ended in July, distributing food to restaurants, hospitals, universities, and hotels in the United States, and has begun using Spoiler Alert in the Northeast to help manage food donation efforts.\nSpoiler Alert’s desktop software makes it easy for food distributors to put a bat signal-like alert up whenever they have excess food, and people registered for the service receive a text, e-mail, or in-app notification every time that such food becomes available.\n“At Daily Table I like to think of Spoiler Alert as an opportunity to further meet our mission of capturing healthy, tasty products before they make it to compost or trash,” said Ismail Samad, executive chef of the Dorchester grocery store, which sells food and prepared meals gleaned from donations. He said he relies heavily on Spoiler Alert to source the food for his store shelves.\nAdvertisement\nBut part of Spoiler Alert’s recent success can be credited to another, rather wonky aspect of its platform, which helps companies navigate the tax code. Last December, Congress passed a bill that expanded the tax breaks companies can receive for donating food, making it easier for small businesses to donate and for farmers to assess the fair market value of their inventories.\nSpoiler Alert’s software streamlines the process for donors to keep track of what they’re giving away, helping them account for the price, cost, and weight of every apple or mayonnaise jar they donate using the stock keeping unit (SKU) numbers in their inventory systems.\nIn turn, the nonprofits receiving the food are able to electronically sign off on the donations. The result is an automated list of deductions with documented receipts, making a clean and simple record for tax purposes. The company’s theory is that if they make it easier for companies to process tax paperwork, they’ll rescue more food.\n“There is more than just good will associated with food waste management or donation facilitation,” said Ashenfelter, the company’s chief executive. “There’s actually some real business value that major corporations can achieve through tax benefits and reductions in waste hauling.”\nDavid Constantine, chief executive of the health startup Kindrdfood and one of the cofounders of MassChallenge, said Spoiler Alert’s plan to position itself to work with the tax code makes it interesting for investors, as they see the opportunity for scale.\n“If you read their website, they’re a technology company, but it’s not like they created a software system that’s never been dreamed of before,” he said. “They went after a supply opportunity and linked up stakeholders and found a great way to make incentives align for tax purposes.”\nThe company’s founders are optimistic that the tax breaks for charitable contributions will remain in place under a new Trump administration, and hope that their focus on the economic benefits that corporations can obtain through donations will appeal to lawmakers of any political persuasion.\n“The bottom line has always been a very important part of how we talk about and market Spoiler Alert,” said chief product officer Emily Malina. “We want to help companies do good for their communities and talking about the cost and tax savings has always been an important part of that conversation.”\nJanelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBoston Children’s Hospital\nDoctors say MRIs of children’s brains are easily misread.\nBy Priyanka Dayal McCluskey Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nBoston Children’s Hospital is teaming up with General Electric Co. to produce software that will help doctors more accurately interpret brain scans of young patients.\nUnder a deal set to be announced Monday, Children’s and Boston-based GE’s health care division will develop the system over the next 18 months, then market it to hospitals around the world.\nAdvertisement\nThe effort is part of GE’s Health Cloud, which is launching this week and is expected, over the next three to five years, to house hundreds of different “apps” that doctors can use to sort through medical data.\nTerms of the Children’s-GE deal were not disclosed.\nMost MRIs of children’s brains are done in community hospitals, and most of those hospitals do not employ radiologists who specialize in children’s brains, said Dr. Richard Robertson, radiologist-in-chief at Children’s. As a result, doctors can misinterpret the scans — either missing a sign of trouble or diagnosing a problem when there is none.\nBrain images can help detect metabolic problems, genetic abnormalities, tumors, development issues, and more.\n“If you look at the brain, it changes pretty rapidly in the first two to three years [of life],” Robertson said. “It can be really hard to decide whether what you’re seeing is the process of normal development or if something has gone wrong.”\nAdvertisement\nWith the new software, a radiologist sitting in any hospital will be able to compare his or her patient’s brain scan with that of other patients of the same age.\n“If I’m a generalist radiologist in the middle of anywhere, USA . . . I can see what a normal 5-year-old brain should look like,” said David Hale, a senior vice president at GE Healthcare who oversees imaging software. “Or, here are three images of potential diseased brains of children that look very similar to the one you just scanned.”\nFor Children’s, the partnership with GE represents a strategy that other premier hospitals are following: leveraging their expertise into products that can highlight their brand while bringing in new revenues. The hospital also works with IBM, Apple, and startups.\nAnother local nonprofit hospital company, Partners HealthCare, which owns Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s hospitals, has tapped into the digital software market. Partners developed software to help doctors make sense of genetic data , then commercialized the program last year.\n“Digital health . . . gives us the opportunity to download our expertise into software in a way that makes it more accessible to clinicians around the globe,” said Jean Mixer, vice president of strategy and digital health at Children’s.\nThe market for medical software, especially programs that analyze large amounts of data, is growing. It has been a focus for Governor Charlie Baker and other political and business leaders in Massachusetts. The digital health market is expected to grow to $32 billion over the next decade, Baker’s office said last week, after convening a new digital health care advisory council comprised of several business leaders.\nPriyanka Dayal McCluskey can be reached at priyanka.mccluskey@ globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nAP/File\nJared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, walked through the lobby of Trump Tower in New York earlier this month.\nBy Shawn Boburg The Washington Post November 28, 2016\nJared Kushner was just an undergrad at Harvard when politicians began receiving big-dollar campaign donations bearing his name.\nIn reality, the money was sent by his father, a powerful New Jersey real estate mogul. Over the course of several years, Charles Kushner pumped half a million dollars into political campaigns, avoiding legal limits by attributing checks to family members and business associates without their knowledge. The scheme sent the elder Kushner to prison and engulfed the family in scandal.\nAdvertisement\nIt was a defining and pivotal episode for Jared Kushner, now 35, who is poised to become one of the most trusted advisers to his father-in-law, President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe donation scandal provides a glimpse of the privilege and influence that marked Kushner’s upbringing in a prominent family. But friends say it also reveals in Kushner a fundamental trait that Trump prizes and has strengthened their bond: unflinching loyalty.\nFar from seeing his father’s actions as a betrayal, the younger Kushner flew to Alabama almost every Sunday to visit his father during his 14 months behind bars. He took the helm of the family business. And he publicly insisted that his father was unfairly prosecuted.\nView Story Kushner expected to stay a power center Jared Kushner is likely to continue to wield considerable influence in the new administration.\nTrump’s son-in-law explores joining administration Presidents have wide latitude to let relatives into secret circles\n‘‘Jared is a devoted son in an almost old-world sense of respect and duty and devotion,’’ said former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey, D, who counted Charles Kushner as his biggest donor until McGreevey resigned in 2004 amid a sex scandal.\nThe same dynamic - this time between Kushner and Trump - played out on the campaign trail, when Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, publicly defended his father-in-law against claims that his rhetoric was fueling anti-Semitism and racism. And it seems likely to carry over into the White House, where Kushner is expected to play the role of informal gatekeeper and confidant to the president and may be entrusted with the enormous task of trying to broker an end to conflict in the Middle East.\nAdvertisement\nKushner married into a family that, much like his own, keeps its business in the bloodline. He and Ivanka Trump were introduced at a business lunch, and ever since they got married, they have been trusted advisers to her father.\nDuring the campaign, Kushner and the elder Trump complemented each other with contrasting styles, according to multiple people who have observed them over the past year. Trump was brash and confrontational while Kushner was soft-spoken and discreet; Trump focused his energy on traditional media and rallies while Kushner worked with digital strategists to build a data operation.\nKushner would often sit with Trump on the president-elect’s private plane, a Boeing 757 outfitted with cream leather couches, gold seat buckles and a big-screen television. He would quietly turn to Trump as they both read between stops - Trump rifling through a pile of printed articles, Kushner on his laptop or phone. They’d keep an eye on Fox News Channel, with Kushner whispering tidbits of information and the latest about the family.\nKushner carved out a portfolio of sorts on foreign policy, with particular interest in the Middle East and Israel, and helped to shape Trump’s speech in March to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a well-received address during which Trump stuck to his prepared remarks.\nRELATED: Trump’s son-in-law Kushner expected to stay a power center\nTrump told the New York Times last week that, once he is in the White House, Kushner would probably keep his role as an informal counselor and envoy to the Middle East, where Kushner already has close relationships with people close to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nSeveral Trump associates have said that Kushner will be a chief of staff in all but name, with wide-ranging - if sometimes hard-to-quantify - influence and a voice equal to incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon.\nRELATED: Harvard classmates barely recognize the Bannon of today\nLike his ascent in the family business, and perhaps even his Ivy League education, Kushner’s influence on the future president is partly a by-product of his proximity to power.\nFew families in the Northeast enjoyed more political wattage than the Kushners in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Jared Kushner’s grandparents, Holocaust survivors, had laid roots in New Jersey and started a family business in construction. Charles Kushner grew the company to encompass office buildings and thousands of condos and apartments. The Kushners gave millions to political, charitable and pro-Israel causes.\nAs a teenager, Jared Kushner became accustomed to seeing national leaders pay their respects to his father.\nIn 1997, when Kushner was just 16, then-President Bill Clinton made a stop at the corporate headquarters of the family business, lavishing praise on the Kushners during a speech. To mark the moment, the Kushners gave Clinton a shofar - a ram’s-horn musical instrument used in Jewish religious ceremonies.\nA year later, as Jared Kushner was starting to fill out college applications, his father pledged $2.5 million to Harvard, to be paid in $250,000 yearly installments, according to a book, ‘‘The Price of Admission: How America’s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges,’’ by journalist Daniel Golden. Jared’s test scores were below Ivy League standards, Golden wrote, citing an unnamed official at the yeshiva high school in northern New Jersey that Jared attended. But he had powerful people vouch for him.\nThen-Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., made a call to the Harvard admissions staff on Kushner’s behalf - at the urging of a Democratic senator from New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, who had received more than $100,000 in donations from Charles Kushner, according to the book.\nJared Kushner was admitted.\nRisa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said the suggestion that Jared Kushner’s acceptance was connected to his father’s gift to the school ‘‘is and always has been false.’’\n‘‘Jared Kushner was an honors student in high school, played on the hockey, basketball and debate teams. He graduated from Harvard with Honors,’’ she said in a statement.\nKushner’s parents, she said, have donated more than $100 million to universities, hospitals and other charitable causes, she said.\nRabbi Hirschy Zarchi, founder of Chabad House at Harvard, who met Jared his freshman year and became close to the Kushner family, said that as a student Jared was devoted to his family and his Orthodox Jewish faith and had the mature bearing of a graduate student. He made the trip home to New Jersey to celebrate the smallest family milestones and celebrations.\n‘‘His exceptional respect, devotion and love for his family always came across,’’ Zarchi said.\nThat loyalty appears to have been tested as the Kushner family became embroiled in scandal.\nBy the time Jared finished his studies at Harvard, nearly $90,000 had been donated to state and federal campaigns in his name, records show, almost entirely to Democrats. The giving spree pulled Jared into the crosshairs of the Federal Election Commission.\nJust before he began his senior year in 2002, a letter from the FEC addressed to the younger Kushner arrived at his New Jersey home, a 7,300-square-foot mansion in a wealthy suburban neighborhood. In the letter, federal regulators wrote that Jared Kushner appeared to have broken campaign-finance laws by contributing more than they allowed.\nJared Kushner, who was later cleared when the donations were found to have come from his father, declined to comment on anything related to the investigation involving his father.\nRecords also show that Kushner was among 15 people, whose names had appeared on checks for campaign contributions signed by his father, who were issued subpoenas by the FEC after initially not answering questions about donations.\nAlthough Kushner eventually cooperated with FEC investigators, it is not clear if he did so with prosecutors in the subsequent criminal investigation. In any event, the scandal does not appear to have damaged his relationship with his father.\nThat was not true of other family members, including an uncle who had been cooperating with federal prosecutors; Charles Kushner apparently did not take lightly to the betrayal, records show. He paid a prostitute $10,000 to seduce his brother-in-law in a hotel room set up with hidden cameras to record the rendezvous. He later instructed a private detective to mail the tape to his sister as a warning - he wanted it to arrive at her house shortly before a family party, records show.\nInstead, she took the tape to the FBI, leading to Kushner’s arrest.\nKushner learned of the arrest when his father called him on a July morning. Jared was on his way to an internship in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, he told New York Magazine in a 2009 interview. In the interview, he sounded more angry that the tape had been deemed illegal than he was about his father’s role in producing it.\n‘‘They’re going to arrest me today,’’ Charles Kushner told him.\n‘‘For what?’’ Jared Kushner recalled asking. ‘‘Is it because of the tape? I thought your lawyers knew about that. I thought it’s not illegal.’’\n‘‘Apparently they’re saying that it is,’’ his father said.\nCharles Kushner decided not to fight. He pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FEC, witness tampering and tax evasion stemming from $6 million in political contributions and gifts mischaracterized as business expenses. Among the allegations were that he paid for an unnamed individual’s private school tuition out of company accounts and declared them charitable contributions on his tax returns, according to court documents.\nHe was sentenced to two years in prison. His son stood by him, visiting most weekends and insisting, as he still does, that his father’s prosecution was unjust.\nIf Charles Kushner taught his son deep loyalty, he may also have taught him its flip side, revenge - at the very least modeling that behavior with his decision to target his brother-in-law.\nFor Jared Kushner, the evidence of whether he absorbed the lesson lies in his actions toward Chris Christie, the hard-charging federal prosecutor - and future governor of New Jersey, 2016 Republican presidential candidate and endorser of Donald Trump for president - who put the elder Kushner behind bars.\nA former law-enforcement source familiar with the nearly two-year criminal investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations, said Christie, a Republican, took an unusual interest in the Kushner probe. ‘‘He was very hands-on in that case,’’ said the person, who described Christie as privately ‘‘gleeful’’ at the outcome. In court filings, Christie’s office described Charles Kushner’s actions as ‘‘evil.’’\nBut the network of politicians Kushner had cultivated also whispered about another possibility: that Christie had targeted a major Democratic donor for political reasons.\n‘‘I think a lot of people would say his prosecutions were political in nature,’’ former New Jersey governor Richard Codey, a longtime Kushner ally who is now a Democratic state senator, said of Christie.\nA spokesman for Christie told The Washington Post that the 135 corruption convictions he won as U.S. attorney in New Jersey were ‘‘not because of politics, but because all the individuals he charged were guilty.’’\nYet the arrest changed Jared Kushner’s career path: He no longer wanted to be a prosecutor.\n‘‘Seeing my father’s situation, I felt what happened was obviously unjust in terms of the way they pursued him,’’ he told the Real Deal in 2014. ‘‘I just never wanted to be on the other side of that and cause pain to the families I was doing that to, whether right or wrong.’’\nInstead, Jared Kushner took the family business across the Hudson River into Manhattan with audacious real estate acquisitions, selling his family’s portfolio of apartments in New Jersey and, in 2007, buying an office tower on Fifth Avenue, about three blocks south of Trump Tower.\nHe also purchased the New York Observer, a Manhattan newspaper. Ross Barkan, a reporter there from 2013 to 2016, left the paper, he said in an interview, because the line between the Trump campaign and the paper’s editorial decisions had become ‘‘fuzzy.’’\nFor instance, Barkan said, the Observer published two stories that appeared to target Trump’s enemies at the time - one taking on New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman after he sued Trump University, and another critical of Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., during the Republican primary.\nKushner also made a business decision that would give him a toehold in the world of New Jersey politics that Christie was about to inhabit. He bought a successful political gossip website called PolitickerNJ.com that was run by an anonymous blogger. Later, when Christie was running for governor in 2009, he suggested that Kushner was using the website to damage him.\n‘‘It’s a Kushner-owned enterprise,’’ Christie said. ‘‘And I don’t think I’ll be getting Charles Kushner’s family’s vote come November.’’\nChristie became governor of New Jersey. He was an early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination this year until Trump’s remarkable ascent. Christie dropped out and supported Trump, putting him in a position to get a key role in a Trump administration. But Kushner now was in a position to influence the fate of the man who had put his father behind bars.\nSpeculation has swirled that Kushner helped convince Trump not to pick Christie to be his vice president. Friends said privately that Kushner was smart enough not to have made his argument a personal one. The residual damage from a Christie scandal that became known as Bridgegate was enough reason, they said.\nAt it turned out, the anonymous blogger whose website Kushner had acquired was at the center of the scandal. The Christie administration had recruited David Wildstein away from Kushner’s website for a job as an executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an agency that runs the region’s bridges and airports.\nWildstein and two other Christie aides were convicted this year of closing lanes to the George Washington Bridge in an act of political revenge. The mayor of a town at the foot of the bridge had not endorsed Christie, and the lane closures choked the town with crippling traffic.\nBack on Dec. 7, 2013, the day after Wildstein resigned from the Port Authority amid growing evidence that he had ordered the lane closures, Kushner got in touch with him. In an email obtained by The Post, Kushner drew a parallel between Wildstein and his father, who had also resigned as a Port Authority commissioner in 2003 as questions began to percolate about Kushner’s campaign contributions.\n‘‘Just wanted you to know that I am thinking of you and wishing the best. For what it’s worth, I thought the move you pulled was kind of badass,’’ Kushner wrote.\nHeller, the Kushner Companies spokeswoman, said this week that the message was a ‘‘poorly worded way of Jared trying to cheer up an old friend.’’\nRelated In Trump’s orbit, son-in-law Jared Kushner expected to stay a power center Jared Kushner explores joining father-in-law’s administration Presidents have wide latitude to let relatives into secret circles",

      "text": " Google+\nCarolyn Kaster/Associated Press/File\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney shook hands after their Nov. 19 meeting.\nBy Adrian Walker Globe Columnist November 28, 2016\nMitt Romney might be the very last person I thought I’d ever feel sorry for.\nHe’s smart, wealthy, and wildly successful. He came reasonably close to being elected president of the United States. Yet now he waits, hat in hand, for Donald Trump to grant him absolution, and an offer to become secretary of state. To watch him twist makes me cringe a bit.\nAdvertisement\nA week after meeting with Trump, not only has Romney not been selected, he is being subjected to thinly veiled scorn from members of Trump’s inner circle, people he probably wouldn’t have hired as managers at the MBTA.\nKellyanne Conway, Trump’s mouthpiece, went on television over the weekend to declare that Trump’s grass-roots supporters wouldn’t want Romney selected, because he went out of his way to insult their hero during the primary campaign. Given the timing, it was an extraordinary declaration.\nYet it is true that Romney made a point of torching whatever relationship he may have had with Trump. As far as I’m concerned, he did so during one of his finest moments in public life.\nView Story Conway: ‘Grass roots’ against Romney Jockeying for administration positions is common. Such open questioning of a potential appointee, particularly by a core adviser, is much rarer.\nIn a blistering speech at the University of Utah — and “blistering” is not a word often associated with our decorous former governor — he took Trump to task for a wide variety of failings, both professional and personal. He assailed him as an emotional infant and a con man. He called on him to release his tax returns, and laid out why it mattered. In the part that probably insulted Trump most deeply, he insinuated that he probably isn’t really all that rich.\nToward the end of his comments, he summed up his contempt for the man this way:\nAdvertisement\n“Here’s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.”\nNow, you might be wondering why someone with such deep disdain for the president-elect might want to be in his administration in the first place.\nI admit that when Romney launched that attack against Trump last March, I took it as a plea to be drafted as the Republican nominee in Trump’s place. Obviously, that didn’t come to pass. But my interpretation was probably too cynical.\nAs for why he now is interviewing with Trump for a job, Romney hasn’t made any public comments, so I can only speculate about his motives. First, he has always been drawn to influence and prestige, and the secretary of state has both in spades. Beyond that, I believe that Romney sincerely believes he can help a guy he considers clueless about foreign policy. And I believe he has a deep desire to serve his country.\nYes, going into the Cabinet would mean working for a guy he considers an empty suit. Yet Romney wouldn’t be the only Trump critic to come on board: Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina endorsed not one but two of Trump’s opponents, and last week she agreed to become ambassador to the United Nations. That’s politics. Hatchets get buried all the time.\nWhether our former governor would be good at the job is anyone’s guess. He is a smart, thoughtful, savvy man, but he has no foreign policy credentials to speak of. His main contender for the job is said to be former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has cultivated an image as one of the least diplomatic people alive. His main credential is having served as a leading Trump surrogate. Of the two, I know which one I’d pick to represent our country’s interests, and it’s certainly not Giuliani.\nMitt Romney has always given the appearance of a man in total control. That’s what makes his role as a supplicant so jarring. His only sin was telling the truth as he saw it.\nAdrian Walker is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at adrian.walker@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nElise Amendola/Associated Press\nThe main entrance of Massachusetts General Hospital.\nBy Liz Kowalczyk Globe Staff November 27, 2016\nFederal regulators have faulted three large Massachusetts hospitals, along with a dozen others nationwide, for failing to properly report patient deaths and injuries that may have been caused by medical devices — part of a renewed effort to detect problems before they cause widespread harm.\nMassachusetts General, Brigham and Women’s, and UMass Memorial were among 17 hospitals inspected last December by the FDA. Regulators were concerned about infections possibly linked to contaminated instruments called duodenoscopes, used to examine the small intestine, and about the spread of uterine cancer when a surgical device called a power morcellator, which cuts up tissue, is used.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, the agency disclosed the inspection reports, showing that 15 of the 17 medical centers were either late in reporting cases in which patients were harmed by various devices or failed to report at all. The FDA inspection reports also disclosed other lapses.\nDr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s center for devices and radiological health, said in an Oct. 24 blog post on the agency’s website that the problems identified at these hospitals are hardly unique and, in fact, are widespread.\nThe Food and Drug Administration, device makers, and hospitals have been criticized for failing to act quickly when it appears a device may cause a threat. The FDA depends on hospitals to help identify new safety problems with devices and to report upswings in previously recognized problems.\nView Story Right procedure, wrong patient There are at least 14 instances since 2011 in which caregivers at Mass. facilities have performed a procedure on the wrong patient.\nA list of mistaken medical procedures\nAgency inspectors found that Mass. General failed to report the deaths of two patients, one of whom suffered a heart attack in the emergency department. The FDA withheld certain details from the reports, including descriptions of the devices involved — though Mass. General executives said the agency examined cases involving duodenoscopes as well as other devices.\nMass. General executives said a monitor was involved in the emergency department patient’s death, but said they could not provide more information because of patient privacy concerns. The FDA said the hospital also failed to report a patient injury and was late in reporting the deaths of two surgery patients and an injury to another patient.\nAdvertisement\nDr. Elizabeth Mort, senior vice president of quality and safety, said Mass. General has a strong history of bringing forward device problems, but the FDA “is widening the net’’ of incidents that hospitals must report to the agency, manufacturers, or both. The FDA “may be able to draw conclusions that one institution cannot draw,’’ she said.\nHospitals are required to report within 10 days information that “reasonably suggests that a medical device has or may have caused or contributed to’’ a serious injury or death of a patient.\nOver the two-year period the FDA examined, Mass. General submitted seven mandatory reports, plus 72 voluntary reports about concerns with devices that did not involve patient harm, Mort said.\nIn cases cited by the agency, the hospital did not report them because “we didn’t necessarily think the device caused the problem,’’ Mort said. For example, a monitor did not detect that the patient had a pacemaker but it was not designed to do so, Mort said.\n“They want us to report problems even when the device worked perfectly,’’ she said. “They are ramping up surveillance. If the design could be improved, the FDA wants to know about it.’’\nThe January report from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions listed Mass. General as one of the hospitals with patient infections tied to contaminated duodenoscopes, which is apparently why the FDA inspected the hospital.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nThe Worcester campus of UMass Memorial Medical Center.\nMort said that in late 2014 and early 2015, Mass. General reported concerns about the device to the manufacturer and stopped using it. But in the end, extensive testing by the hospital was unable to tie patient infections to the instruments, despite the report’s initial conclusion.\nThe FDA faulted the Brigham for failing to report the death of one patient and for submitting four reports on patient injuries late. The patient, who died in December 2013, had undergone a procedure 18 months earlier with a power morcellator, often used during hysterectomies to shred tissue and extract it through small incisions.\nThe risk of morcellation was brought to public attention by Dr. Amy Reed. Soon after undergoing a hysterectomy at the Brigham in October 2013, follow-up tests on the removed tissue showed that she had an aggressive cancer, and that the cancerous tissue had been spread throughout her abdominal cavity during the surgery, sparking advanced cancer. She and her husband, Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, have fought an aggressive battle against morcellation and the hospital.\nBrigham spokeswoman Erin McDonough said the hospital contacted the FDA by phone in March 2014 about the patient’s death and Reed’s case but did not believe they met the criteria for mandatory reporting.\n“The device functioned as expected and was used in the way it was intended, although with unintended and tragic consequences,’’ she said in an e-mail. The FDA later issued a clarification, saying that such cases should be reported, and discouraged the use of morcellators through a safety advisory.\nThe four reports regarding injuries involved cardiac patients, McDonough said. But she said one case did not need to be reported and a second had misstated the date of the incident and was actually filed on time.\nThe FDA findings at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester included failure to report infections in patients who had undergone a procedure with a duodenoscope. Three of those patients later died, but two of the patients had complicated illnesses, the FDA report said.\nTimothy Tai for The Boston Globe\nDr. Dominic Nompleggi, chief of gastroenterology at UMass Memorial, said 14 patients developed infections. But he said the hospital was never able to find the same bacteria on the scopes, and therefore could not definitively link them to the infections. He said UMass Memorial reported the cases to Massachusetts public health officials but did not believe it also had to tell the FDA.\nHospitals use hundreds of medical devices, including imaging machines, heart testing devices, and in-vitro tests to make diagnoses; infusion pumps, ventilators, and robotics to provide treatment; and an array of implants to replace diseased joints and organs.\nChris Lavanchy, engineering director in the health devices division of ECRI Institute, a Pennsylvania-based patient safety organization, said over-reporting of incidents is also a problem. Hospitals report numerous cases in which it’s unclear if the device was related to the patient injury, making it hard for the FDA to untangle problems. Investigations become even more challenging when the injury involves the spread of cancer or infection, which can occur days or even years after the procedure.\nThe FDA did not take further action against the hospitals because it said they were all trying to improve reporting practices.\nSpokeswoman Deborah Kotz said the agency recognizes “it may not be immediately apparent to health care providers that a patient’s exposure to a device may have caused or contributed to that patient’s death.’’\n“Nevertheless, the FDA considers hospital reporting of device-related patient deaths and serious injuries to be critical to improving the safety of medical devices and improving patient care overall,’’ she said in an e-mail.\nLiz Kowalczyk can be reached at kowalczyk@globe.com .",

Trump has been using Trump Tower as his transition headquarters.\nA Google spokeswoman told The Associated Press that the company has changed the name back to its original.\nThe spokeswoman said user contributions help provide an up-to-date map, but also occasionally lead to inaccuracies.",

      "title": "'The underbelly of the internet': How content ad networks fund fake news",
      "text": "Google and Facebook have said they’re taking steps to remove fake news sites from their ad networks. But the varied and deep ad tech market means these sites will continue to have many other options for making money.\nPart of the struggle with containing fake news, which many are blaming for having undue influence on the election, is it’s hard to pinpoint. Fake news can be mean a lot of things, from misleading clickbait about celebrities to satire like The Onion. Then there are political news-focused sites like ThePoliticalInsider, WorldPoliticus and EndingtheFed that got attention during the campaigns for promoting false and provocatively written stories like the one claiming the Pope endorsed Donald Trump, all combining to form what one industry insider called “the underbelly of the Internet.”\nOutside of Google and Facebook, fake news sites have plenty of other options to make money. One popular method on these sites is tapping the competitive market for native ad widgets. Taboola, Revcontent, Adblade and Content.ad are prominently displayed on sites identified with fake news, while there are a few retargeted and programmatic ads sprinkled in. Publishers install these native ad widgets with a simple snippet of code, typically after an approval process, and when readers click on paid links in the widget, the host publisher makes money. The ads are made to appear like related-content suggestions and often promote sensational headlines and direct-marketing offers.\nAdvertisement\nThe native ad widget companies all promote themselves as being highly selective when it comes to the publishers they associate themselves with, although their process for site approval isn’t clear. Taboola lists publisher partners like USA Today, Mail Online and Business Insider, not Rightists.com or USADailyPolitics.com. Adblade touts ABC News, Yahoo and Hearst as host publishers, not TheRightists.com. Content.ad boasts Reuters, Reader’s Digest and LittleThings, not USConservativeToday.com or ConservativeState.com. At Revcontent, it’s Forbes, Newsweek and International Business Times, not ThePoliticalInsider or NationalReport.net.\nThe content-recommendation companies are known to write big guarantee checks to such name-brand publishers, then get to scale from the long-tail sites. Adblade claims 1,000-plus publishers in its network and that “Adblade does not work with long-tail sites.” Revcontent brags that it serves 250 billion content recommendations a month across a network of “tens of thousands of websites.”\nTake a site like WorldPoliticus.com , which was featured prominently in BuzzFeed’s expose on fake political news coming from Macedonia . The site, which falsely claimed the FBI was poised to indict Hillary Clinton, makes money from its article pages from an ad unit provided by Content.ad. (Representatives from Content.ad did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\nA sample Content.ad widget The networks typically do post policies for content they promote in their widgets; Revcontent says it has policies against “hate speech, violence, fake/false and misleading content.” Adblade says it doesn’t accept ads “with adult themes or anything inflammatory or hate related” or ads for “alcohol, tobacco, firearms, reproductive services, gambling.” The guidelines for publishing partners are less clear.\nBut deciding what’s fake news can be subjective, and ad tech tends to shrug and take a “who am I to decide” stance on the issue. These are not, after all, not editorial enterprises. And, truth be told, these sites attract people who are consumers many marketers want to reach.\nTaboola claims to reach 1 billion monthly unique visitors through “thousands” of sites. It prohibits false or misleading content in its widget, among other guidelines , but doesn’t publicize its publisher guidelines. Taboola has a partnership to show its ads on USAToday.com — and USATodaycom.com, a fake news site from Tblisi, Georgia , that rips off USA Today’s brand. Here’s Taboola ads on a recent fake story claiming Muslim nurses in the U.K. r efuse to wash their hands before surgeries .\nIt should be noted that Taboola is not alone in making money off USATodaycom.com. Ghostery lists several ad tech players on the site, with the above story featuring retargeting ads from Criteo. (Taboola didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story.)\nRevcontent claims it rejects 94 percent of sites that sign up for its network. But among the sites that made the cut are The PoliticalInsider and EndingtheFed, which were tied to a story about Hillary Clinton selling arms to ISIS as well as the aforementioned Pope story.\nFake story on The Political Insider and the programmatically served Bloomingdale’s ad and Revcontent engine that help monetize the site John Lemp, CEO of Revcontent, said that Revcontent has removed fake-news sites from its network, but went on at length that it doesn’t want to be in a censorship role. Asked about two so-called fake news sites, TheRightists.com and BVANews.com, that display Revcontent’s widget, he didn’t know of them but that he would ask staff to investigate. NationalReport.net is an admitted fake news site running RevContent widgets — in fact, it’s disclaimer page carries them.\n“My real fear is that the second companies like Google and Facebook and other programmatic companies become editors and not platforms is the second we have lost all hope for the freedom of the written word,” said Lemp.\nAdblade states on its site that it only approves “a small percentage of the sites that apply” and can only evaluate “those publishers that generate over 500,000 page views a month.” Among the sites that made it through that filtering was TheRightists.com, which ran a bogus story (below) saying Hillary Clinton once plugged Trump for president. (Adblade representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\nThe Rightist’s bogus story on Clinton and the Adblade ad unit that helps monetize the site Todd Sawicki, CEO of Zemanta, a programmatic platform for branded content, believes fake news sites like these will dry up as Google stops serving ads to them through its AdSense network, and their operators will move on to something else. (AppNexus on Tuesday made a similar move, cutting off Breitbart from using its ad-serving tools.)\n“AdSense was the long tail of monetization, and below that, it’s slim pickings,” he said. “The CPMs for these second- and third-tier networks are tiny. That’s why [the sites] have lots of ad slots.”\nUltimately, the advertiser and publisher are responsible for where an appears and the quality of the host site, and there’s a flight to quality by brands as they increase — and scrutinize — their digital ad spending, said Jonathan Mendez, CEO of Yieldbot, an ad-tech company that lets advertisers buy display ads by keywords.\nOr, if history is a guide, the engines will clean up their acts as Outbrain, one of the leading players, did a few years ago when it stopped spammy publishers from buying traffic through its service.\nBut other forces work in favor of sketchy sites. As ad buying has become more automated, with targeting based on audience over site environment, ads can end up in places the advertiser didn’t intend, even if they put safeguards in place. Brand advertisers buying opaque inventory could show up inadvertently on fake news sites, said a media buyer who asked to stay anonymous. Not to mention that people can’t seem to resist reading about claims or news that seem too good or outrageous to be true.\n“It is hard enough to deliver an in-view ad to an actual human while avoiding truly awful content adjacency, making fake news a lower priority for many buyers,” the buyer said. “Even if some buyers blacklist these sites from programmatic sources and ad tech firms cease doing business with them, there will always be another advertiser unaware of where their ads run and another content recommendation engine willing to take the traffic.”\nRelated",

      "title": "Why Won’t Leonard Lance Answer These 3 Simple Questions?",
      "text": "Civic innovation and crisis response at Google, running and fatherhood at home. 13 mins ago Why Won’t Leonard Lance Answer These 3 Simple Questions? As a constituent in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, I have been trying, over the past ten days, to get a clear answer about Congressman Leonard Lance’s stance on three simple questions about the incoming presidential administration: Does Leonard Lance believe it is appropriate for white supremacist and anti-Semite Steve Bannon to hold a senior position in the White House? Does Leonard Lance agree with General Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s appointee for National Security Advisor, that “fear of Muslims is rational” ? Does Leonard Lance agree with Trump’s Attorney General nominee, Jeff Sessions, that to “ grab [a woman] by the pussy” is not sexual assault ? Lance’s staff has been unable to answer these questions at all. In my first call, his Director of Constituent Services, Bobbi, was unable to do anything except transcribe my questions. In my second call, Lance’s Chief of Staff, Todd Mitchell, challenged my motives for asking these questions, questioned my competency for using the Internet, and told me I was wasting the staff’s time by calling. As a bonus question, I’ve also tried to ask: “When will Leonard Lance make a public statement on these issues, or hold a forum for his constituents to address these questions?” The Congressman’s staff has no answer for that, either. These are immensely basic questions, and they really shouldn’t be hard to answer well (the ideal answer to all three is “No”). Maybe Lance disagrees with me, which is certainly his prerogative. But Leonard Lance is a politician who won’t even make a clear statement on these issues on behalf of his constituents. Why? What I Have Learned From the Congressman’s Staff Between my conversations with Bobbi and Mitchell, a few interesting bits of detail have come through. The staff doesn’t want to answer questions from anyone who hasn’t been to one of the Congressman’s past town halls. Mitchell took me to task for why I’m suddenly asking questions about the Representative’s positions when I’ve never engaged with the Congressman before. And he’s got me dead-to-rights on that, in the 13 years I’ve lived in this district, my level of involvement in Congressional races has never gone farther than pulling the lever on Election Day. But we’ve entered a new era since Election Day 2016, an era where national politics have started to threaten basic human rights. The inalienable rights described in the Declaration of Independence, and guaranteed by the Constitution, are at risk. I never thought I’d have to ask my Congressman if he’ll uphold his oath to defend the Constitution, but we’ve never had Cabinet appointees who threaten basic freedom of religion or senior White House officials who question whether feminism is worse than cancer , so here we are, and that’s why I’m asking now. Lance’s office apparently has a secret requirement that constituents must attend a certain number of public meetings before earning the privilege to ask a question about the Congressman, though. The Congressman has no plans to hold a public meeting before the new year, because “the holidays are really busy for everyone”. I wish I had more detail to give here. This one just stuns me. We’ve just been through one of the most contentious elections of our lives, there have been nationwide protests for days, but Leonard Lance really wants to focus on Thanksgiving, on Christmas, and on getting to all the great Washington holiday parties. All of the Congressman’s stances on these topics are well-documented online, and I could find them, if only I knew how to use the Internet. Mitchell repeatedly told me that I could find out the Congressman’s stance on Bannon, Sessions, and Flynn, if only I was any good at using the Internet. He said to me, “I’ll tell you the same thing I tell my 82-year old mother, if you can’t figure out how to use the Internet, I can’t teach you.” In my first call, Bobbi told me that I could find out Lance’s position on these topics by reading the issues page on his website . We talked through each of the points addressed there, looking for a stance on women’s rights; that was when Bobbi asked me if I was a reporter, accused me of trying to “trap” her, and, indeed, stopped doing anything but transcribing my questions. In the time since the election, Lance’s only official communications to his constituents include such earth-shattering gems as “ Lance Westfield Office Hosting V.A. Claims Staff ”, and “ Lance Offices Drop-Off Locations for Service Member Holiday Greetings ”. Over on his Facebook page , Lance is focused on telemarketing scams. I’ve spent a fair bit of time trying to find any information about Lance’s stance on these appointments — on NJ news sites, on Lance’s Congressional site and his campaign site , and on his social media accounts . I’m pretty confident in my ability to search the Internet, so I’ll put my money where my mouth is: if anyone can show me that Leonard Lance had a publicly available statement that addresses my three questions, that was anywhere on the Internet before November 22, 2016, I will donate $500 to Lance’s 2018 re-election campaign. The Congressman’s past rebuke of Trump’s comments on women totally and completely addresses any concerns about Jeff Session’s nomination as Attorney General. I’m proud to have a Congressman who, during the campaign, broke party ranks and described the infamous Trump comments as “as offensive and vulgar today as they were 11 years ago” . He wasn’t courageous enough to say that the comments were disqualifying for a candidate for President, but, hey, let’s call that water under the bridge. Mitchell told me that, because the Congressman had already addressed those comments from Trump, asking about Jeff Sessions’ statements about sexual assault is looking backward, when we should be looking forward. What seems to be lost on the Congressman’s staff is that we’re at a different point now. Yes, voters selected Trump despite his original comments, that’s clear, we can and should move past it. But even Trump didn’t go so far as to say that such actions aren’t criminal. Sessions did. Does the American public deserve an Attorney General who thinks grabbing a woman by her genitals doesn’t constitute a crime? Maybe that’s what Leonard Lance thinks they deserve. Lance’s stance on anti-Semitism is addressed by the fact that he has a Jewish grandmother on his Westfield staff. This was one of the weirdest curveballs I encountered. When I asked Bobbi about Lance’s stance on anti-Semitism, she told me that she serves on the board of her temple. Mitchell was oddly compelled to tell me, repeatedly, that Bobbi is a grandmother. While Bobbi’s service to her religious community is commendable, it does nothing to address whether or not Lance will help stop the rise of hate-driven politics in the United States. By calling the Congressman’s office and asking these questions, I am wasting their time. Mitchell told me several times that I should stop calling in my attempt to get answers to these simple questions. Mitchell really really really wanted me to know that the Congressman has 750,000 other constituents, and I should stop calling, so that the staff can serve those other constituents, too. Here’s a few population statistics from about the NJ 7th that I’d encourage Lance and his staff to consider when deciding whether to engage in questions of basic civil rights: The Congressman represents about 380,000 female constituents , each of whom have an interest in the prosecution of sexual assault. (source: ballotpedia ) The Congressman represents about 140,000 non-white constituents , each of whom have an interest in how white supremacy impacts national policy. (source: also ballotpedia ) The Congressman represents somewhere between 7,500 and 22,500 Muslim constituents , each of whom have an interest in whether or not national security policy in a Trump administration will target them based on their faith (source: this report from Pew estimates that 1% of the US population is Muslim, and that NJ has 2–3 times as many Muslims per capita as the nationwide average; admittedly, this is a very rough estimate). The Congressman represents about 46,000 Jewish people , each of whom will be impacted by an anti-Semite working in the White House (source: this 2013 study , published by the Berman Jewish Databank) If the Congressman is actually committed to serving all 750,000 of his constituents, not just the white, male, native-born, Christian constituents, he would do well to stand up for the interests of these many groups who live in his district. Lance’s staff will hang up on a constituent. While I was speaking with Mitchell, after about 20 minutes, he abruptly hung up. So I guess that’s Lance’s standard for “constituent service.” Who is Leonard Lance, Really? With all this as background, I’ve done some deeper digging to understand who Lance really is, and who the people are that are running his office. Lance is a third-generation politician . He’s been in elected office since 1991, and he worked for the Governor of New Jersey for seven years before that. Since his first election to Congress in 2008, Lance has moved away from his early moderate principles to adopt more party-line stances (ex: on climate change , Lance started out as “an ally on the environment”, now he’s labeled a “Dirty Denier”). In his most recent election, Lance failed the VoteSmart.org Political Courage Test , by refusing to answer basic questions about his stances on the issues. When there was a hate crime perpetrated against Lance’s opponent in the most recent election, Mitchell, speaking on behalf of Lance, condemned the act, but, in the same breath, accused the opponent of “false race-baiting attacks.” The Takeaway: Leonard Lance is a Career Politician, not a Defender of the Constitution The Congressman’s background, taken together with the response of his staff to these basic questions, paints a picture of a Congressman raised in a political dynasty, one who has calculated how to stay under the radar, how to continue getting re-elected in a safely Republican district every couple of years, all while maximizing personal gain for himself and his staff, without ever taking a difficult stand in the service of his constituents. Lance is most likely staying quiet about Trump’s administration based on a calculation that speaking up will threaten his re-election chances in two years. Any threats to women, to Muslims, to people of color, in his constituency, appear to be secondary to preserving his elected office. And that makes Leonard Lance the most dangerous kind of elected official we could have right now. As Edmund Burke once put it: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” There are a lot of real threats to what makes American democracy so successful, and so unique in the world. People all across the country feel a deep sense of fear, a fear driven by the rhetoric and policy positions of our new president, a fear reenforced by the words and actions of the people he is bringing into his administration. Leonard Lance is on the road of a good man, willing to do nothing, allowing evil to triumph. Because it supports his personal gain. Please join me in calling on Lance ( contact info ), and all members of Congress ( how ), to make a public statement on Trump’s appointees.",

      "text": "A Google search for \"men&apos;s dress shirts\" yields a list of ads and results from the most expected brands. But if you install a new Chrome extension called DoneGood, you&apos;ll also get a lesser-known suggestion: Tuckerman, a startup that makes organic cotton shirts in a union factory in Massachusetts.\nWith any consumer search, if a more sustainable or ethically made option is available, the extension will automatically recommend it. \n\"Our overarching goal is always to make this as easy as possible, and to not require people to spend any more time or any additional effort to discover these amazing companies,\" says DoneGood CEO Cullen Schwarz.\nSchwarz and cofounder Scott Jacobson, who met while working in politics and at nonprofits in D.C., had both struggled to find companies that they wanted to support—and that didn&apos;t have business practices that contradicted what they were trying to do in their day jobs.\nAs they started to envision a tool that could help, they met with social enterprises that explained the challenge of reaching new customers. \"The companies we talked to said that our number one problem is getting people to find us in the first place,\" says Schwarz. \"These are generally small to midsize companies and they don&apos;t have the huge marketing budgets of the global corporate brands and the big-box stores. And on Google and Amazon searches, big companies tend to come up first.\"\nThe new extension tries to solve that problem while also making the process simple for customers. Since people tend to shop on Google, Amazon, and large brand sites, that&apos;s where the extension offers its suggestions.\nDoneGood uses independent certifications, from B Corps to Rainforest Alliance, to screen companies, along with independent research. \"There are all of these certifications, but they&apos;re all disparate and looking at different kinds of issues and different kinds of businesses,\" he says. \"So we start by looking at all of those certifications and bringing them together.\"\nThe companies are also selected because they make higher-quality products. \"A lot of big companies have gotten really good at cranking out a ton of cheap, low-quality stuff that breaks down quickly,\" says Schwarz. \"DoneGood companies are making unique, high-quality products that are built to last.\"\nThe company also makes an app that lets customers search for companies more directly, by choosing a product and selecting values—like \"women-owned\" or \"green.\" DoneGood piloted an early version of the app in Boston while the startup was incubated at the Harvard Innovation Lab. Both the extension and app were released nationally on November 28.",

      "text": "  Re “ Google and Facebook Use Ad Policies to Take Aim at Fake News Sites ” (Business Day, Nov. 15): It’s easy to point to a Google or a Facebook algorithm for the rise of fake news, but it’s wholly insufficient. The misinformation spread through the echo chamber of the web and social media is the symptom — not the source — of a much deeper and systemic problem. The problem is that we aren’t ever taught how to think clearly. Most people are unaware of our hard-wired cognitive biases. We aren’t trained how to spot logical fallacies in our own arguments and the arguments of others. It takes time and persistence to overcome these obstacles, and most people just don’t have the luxury or the interest to put in the effort. If we want a better democracy with more informed citizens, then we need to find a better way to provide people with the cognitive tools needed to better detect misinformation and lies. It’s not a problem that can be solved with a new algorithm.

      "text": "Company Culture How Google Uses People Analytics to Create a Great Workplace Hint: It's about the people, for the people, and by the people -- and you can translate the big ideas to your much smaller company. Image credit: Bloomberg | Getty Images Watch Now November 28, 2016 \nEver since the term \"employee engagement'' started being widely used in the 1990s , it's been hailed as the key to high productivity and retention, profit increase and better customer satisfaction. Companies took notice of the benefits and sought to turn this abstract concept into a trackable metric. Many companies began administering annual employee-satisfaction surveys. \nThese snapshots help companies check in with team members and assess how happy their employees are in the workplace. While the practice now is widespread, some thought leaders in human resources (HR) have begun questioning the annual survey's accuracy and usefulness. \nRelated: How to Make Employee Engagement a Top Priority The problem with most feedback tools. \nHow do you know the answers you’re getting are valid in terms of what you’re trying to achieve? A survey by Impact Achievement Group and HRmarketer discovered 48 percent of all respondents did not believe employee surveys provide an honest and accurate assessment, compared to 31 percent who thought surveys painted a true picture. \nSome argue that employees are more apt to answer survey questions positively -- creating a sense that everything seems fine (at least on the surface). Employees who give falsely high marks might fear retaliation or feel a general disinterest toward a survey that takes time out of their busy work day. Others might believe their answers won't make a difference. This sense of apathy is evidenced by the simple fact that many companies have trouble achieving high participation rates. \nHere's the most revealing finding from the Achievement Group/HRmarketer study: 58 percent of respondents agreed that results did not -- or only slightly -- helped managers gain a better understanding of what behaviors or practices they could change to improve. If surveys don’t yield any actionable information, will their results make any difference in how a workplace is run? This loop perpetuates the apathy problem. If employees are conditioned to believe they won't see actual changes in their work environments, what incentive do they have to fill out a satisfaction survey? \nRelated: 5 Ways to Promote Simplicity and Boost Efficiency \nA recent LinkedIn post from Forbes writer Liz Ryan had some pretty harsh words about employee-satisfaction surveys: “Employee Engagement Surveys are the business equivalent of giving the prisoners in a penitentiary a survey to complete once a year and slide through the bars of their cells. The survey process cements an unequal power relationship.” \nIs she right? Are engagement surveys an HR check-off box at the least -- and a tool for damage control at most? Do these surveys simply give employees the pretense of a voice within a company? Maybe it’s time to rethink employee-satisfaction surveys and how we administer them. How Google does it differently. \nAt Google, surveys aren't just about checking the pulse of the workplace, they’re about constantly striving to improve it. The company’s People Operations team (formerly known as HR) uses feedback to optimize different aspects of its people processes and align them with its unique work culture. As a result, the company reports an average participation rate of 90 percent. \nNearly every decision the company takes is data driven -- and that's representative of the culture in a majority engineer workforce, too. But the very nature of the HR field focuses on interpersonal relationships in the workplace. It can be difficult to assess based on pure input/output metrics alone. Productivity metrics are extremely important to gauge effectiveness, but they don't tell the whole story. \nFor this reason, Google integrates the human aspects through use of people analytics. Mixing quantitative and qualitative data enables leaders to really dig deep into the company’s inner-culture dynamics. Google has used people analytics to improve the workplace across a number of studies. A few notable examples appear below. \nRelated: The Google Tool That Helps You Make Better HR Decisions Leadership Case Study: Project Oxygen. \nThrough surveys, company leaders learned that most Googlers are averse to hierarchy. Many employees -- cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin among them -- questioned the need for a management level. They thought they simply might flatten the company structure. First, though, they engaged the company's people analytics team to determine whether having managers makes a real difference. \nIn Project Oxygen , People Operations workers analyzed managers' performance ratings and the upward feedback gathered in employee surveys. They then compared these results with productivity metrics. The outcome? At Google, great managers lead to more engaged and productive teams. \n\nThe people analytics team took the research a step further to identify which characteristics made a great manager. The team returned to comments from surveys, performance evaluations and great-manager nominations. They then conducted double-blind interviews with the company's highest- and lowest-rated managers. \nRelated: 4 Ways Your Leadership Development Is Failing Managers \nRather than prove managers unnecessary, Project Oxygen discovered mid-level leaders were essential to create conditions in which other employees could thrive. To be truly effective, though, the company had to turn away from supervisory tactics that ran counter to what Googlers need from a manager. Micromanaging was at the top of the list. \nRelated: How to Increase Accountability Without Breathing Down People's Necks \nGoogle turned Project Oxygen's findings into the company's Top 8 management behaviors and now uses the list as a guidebook to identify and train leaders from within Google's ranks. The initiative's data-based roots make it easier for managers to accept these standards and move toward meeting expectations. Teamwork case study: Project Aristotle. \nIn another study, Google sought the perfect formula for creating effective teams. Leaders looked at each team's performance metrics and then at perceptions of effectiveness itself. People analytics acknowledges that abstract terms means different things to different people. Through Project Aristotle, Google learned that executives equated effectiveness with productivity. For employees, team culture was the most important measure of effectiveness. Meanwhile, team leaders ranked ownership, vision and goals as the most important influences. \nTo capture these varied factors, the people analytics team examined qualitative surveys from the three major employee groups and compared the information to sales performances (stacked against quarterly quota). Combining human experience with hard data allowed Google to see which teams fared the best. Even more important, the results helped Google understand why certain teams succeeded. These findings formed the basis of Google's five essential factors to create a positive work environment. Translating Google's lessons to other companies. \nGoogle's process provides HR insights into employee engagement. It also creates trust between employer and employee. Googlers feel a sense of equality because they directly shape how their company is run. \nLaszlo Bock, Google's former Head of People Operations, described the strategy in a recent Harvard Business Review article. His piece listed four steps leaders can take to \"move from hunches to science\" in their own decision-making processes. Bock's strategy (1) asks employees to identify the company's most pressing people issues and (2) suggest ways to improve, (3) encourages the analytics team to share feedback company-wide and (4) finally empowers leaders to run experiments that test which data-supported theories work best. \nRelated: Leaders Earn Trust By Doing This One Thing \nIt's impossible to overstate the importance of engaging the human aspect in HR efforts. Pure performance data alone isn’t enough. Qualitative results help leaders truly understand the underlying dynamics at work in their companies. Done right, employee surveys play a crucial role. Start by asking what workers want to improve and take the next steps to move forward from there.

      "text": "A Google search for \"men&apos;s dress shirts\" yields a list of ads and results from the most expected brands. But if you install a new Chrome extension called DoneGood, you&apos;ll also get a lesser-known suggestion: Tuckerman, a startup that makes organic cotton shirts in a union factory in Massachusetts.\nWith any consumer search, if a more sustainable or ethically made option is available, the extension will automatically recommend it.\n\"Our overarching goal is always to make this as easy as possible, and to not require people to spend any more time or any additional effort to discover these amazing companies,\" says DoneGood CEO Cullen Schwarz.\nSchwarz and cofounder Scott Jacobson, who met while working in politics and at nonprofits in D.C., had both struggled to find companies that they wanted to support—and that didn&apos;t have business practices that contradicted what they were trying to do in their day jobs.\nAs they started to envision a tool that could help, they met with social enterprises that explained the challenge of reaching new customers. \"The companies we talked to said that our number one problem is getting people to find us in the first place,\" says Schwarz. \"These are generally small to midsize companies and they don&apos;t have the huge marketing budgets of the global corporate brands and the big-box stores. And on Google and Amazon searches, big companies tend to come up first.\"\nThe new extension tries to solve that problem while also making the process simple for customers. Since people tend to shop on Google, Amazon, and large brand sites, that&apos;s where the extension offers its suggestions.\nDoneGood uses independent certifications, from B Corps to Rainforest Alliance, to screen companies, along with independent research. \"There are all of these certifications, but they&apos;re all disparate and looking at different kinds of issues and different kinds of businesses,\" he says. \"So we start by looking at all of those certifications and bringing them together.\"\nThe companies are also selected because they make higher-quality products. \"A lot of big companies have gotten really good at cranking out a ton of cheap, low-quality stuff that breaks down quickly,\" says Schwarz. \"DoneGood companies are making unique, high-quality products that are built to last.\"\nThe company also makes an app that lets customers search for companies more directly, by choosing a product and selecting values—like \"women-owned\" or \"green.\" DoneGood piloted an early version of the app in Boston while the startup was incubated at the Harvard Innovation Lab. Both the extension and app were released nationally on November 28.",

      "text": " Google+\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\nBoston arborist Max Ford-Diamond worked to unpack the tree after it arrived on Boston Common on Nov. 18.\nBy Brian MacQuarrie Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nSYDNEY, Nova Scotia — Giving is always better than receiving, the kind-hearted believe, but Nova Scotia officials expect something in return for the Christmas tree they haul to Boston each year.\nThe latest gift is a 47-foot white spruce that was cut on Cape Breton Island and trucked south for Boston’s official tree-lighting ceremony Dec. 1. It’s an annual gesture of thanks for Boston’s speedy assistance after a devastating explosion in 1917 killed nearly 2,000 people in Halifax and injured 9,000 more.\nAdvertisement\nBut Nova Scotians, who have been sending a tree since 1971, also want Bostonians to remember who is behind the celebration.\n“We do believe it has significant marketing value,” said Jamie Baillie, opposition leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia. “I really have no issue with it.”\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe staff/file\nMore than 15,000 lights decorated a 60-foot Canadian balsam fir tree, Nova Scotia’s gift in 1977 to Boston.\nUntil this month, however, most Nova Scotians did not realize just how generous they have been. According to an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the province’s taxpayers footed a $179,000 (US dollars) bill for cutting, shipping, and surrounding last year’s tree with plenty of holiday pomp and circumstance.\nThe City of Boston received $30,000, WCVB-TV (Channel 5) took in $55,000 to televise the lighting, and $6,660 was spent on festivities at the Omni Parker House for the Nova Scotia delegation, which was flown to Boston and put up in hotels at a total cost of $9,600.\nAnd then there was $1,200 in travel expenses for the Halifax town crier, who flexed his vocal muscle at celebrations in Nova Scotia and Boston, according to the CBC.\nAdvertisement\n“It can sound a little high,” said Ed McHugh, who teaches business and marketing at Nova Scotia Community College in Halifax. “When you first look at this, the average Nova Scotian might have thought $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 to put a tree there.”\nBut digging into the numbers unveils a decent deal, McHugh said. The hourlong telecast by WCVB in Boston is estimated to reach more than 200,000 viewers, according to provincial officials. And the ceremony on Boston Common, scheduled for 6 to 8 p.m., is expected to attract up to 15,000 people, city officials said.\n(Perhaps struck by holiday hype, Nova Scotia’s premier, Stephen McNeil, has been telling people that 30,000 will show up.)\n“When you look at the entire scope of the thing, it’s a pretty good value for the province of Nova Scotia,” McHugh said.\nThe province’s $30,000 payment to the city covers less than half of the ceremony’s $85,000 production cost, said Ryan Woods, spokesman for the Boston Parks and Recreation Department. In exchange, Nova Scotia remains lead sponsor of the event.\n“It’s a longstanding tradition that we hope to continue for many, many years,” Woods said. “It comes from a great story, but a lot of people here don’t know the history.”\nThe Halifax explosion during World War I — caused by the collision of a French munitions ship and a Norwegian freighter — was the largest blast of man-made materials until the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima in 1945.\nMary Tulle, tourism director for Cape Breton Island, said the tree’s cost should not be a deal-breaker. She recalled how her grandmother, living three hours from Halifax, watched the dishes shake during the explosion.\n“Why do we have to stop saying thank you?” Tulle said.\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe staff/file\nWorkers installed the Christmas tree, a gift from Nova Scotia to Boston, ahead of the 1991 celebrations.\nBrian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 28, 2016\n“Subway Therapy Boston” began as a last-minute project in two subway stations this month, following a nasty election. It was a chance for passersby to put their busy lives on hold, share positive thoughts by writing them on Post-It notes, and stick them to the tiled walls for commuters to read.\nBut the concept attracted more people than Venita Subramanian had initially expected. Each of the two events that she hosted with the help of volunteers led to the walls being splashed with colorful squares of paper that broadcast inspiring mantras and Quote: s.\nAdvertisement\n“I stopped counting them after awhile,” said Subramanian. “I did not expect the response that we had.”\nNow Subramanian is bringing the project online, so more people can look to the notes for an uplifting message. Last week, she launched a website, SubwayTherapyBoston.org , where each of the roughly 2,500 Post-Its is being archived.\n“We can share it with a larger audience,” said Subramanian, who is originally from the United Arab Emirates. “The whole goal is to increase and archive as many as possible, especially the ones that we think are going to make people feel supported and inspired.”\nSubway Therapy Boston was influenced by a guerilla art project held in New York City’s subway immediately following Republican president-elect Donald J. Trump’s shocking victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nSubramanian held the first event at Park Street Station Nov. 11, with the blessing of the MBTA Transit Police. Hundreds of people showed up, and at the end of the night Subramanian collected the anonymous notes and tucked them away. She hosted a second event at the Harvard T station a few days later. Again, people showed up in droves to participate.\nAdvertisement\nSubramanian has no plans to host another gathering like it. But she has been meticulously uploading the yellow, pink, green, and blue notes to her website each night.\nThe messages, written in marker, range from emotional to quirky. One note posted online shows a stick-figure person riding on a skateboard. Beneath the drawing it says, “Keep it radical.”\nAnother Quote: s Hillary Clinton. A third praises Boston for being a city worth living in.\nSome are brief and to the point: “I vow to speak up in the name of peace and love.” Others are crammed with words, or span two sticky notes to get the message across.\nAll of them, Subramanian hopes, will soon be available to the public. And then, she said, she will move on to another, similar project.\n“It’s a simple community engagement project that can have an impact on someone’s life,” said Subramanian of Subway Therapy Boston. “At the end of the day we all have a responsibility — we need to do more inside the community. And that’s what I want people to get out of this.”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @steveannear .",

      "text": " Google+\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images/file 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Nicole Hernandez Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump threatened on Twitter Monday to undo a deal with Cuba if the island nation did not issue improvements to the agreement.\nIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 It was not immediately clear if the president-elect was referring to a specific point in the recent thaw in US-Cuba relations or if he would scuttle everything and return the countries to their Cold War-era positions.\nAdvertisement\nThe threat comes less than a week after Cuban leader Fidel Castro died at age 90 . While President Barack Obama called the death a moment for the US “to extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people,” Trump wrote on Twitter:\nFidel Castro is dead!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2016 Over the weekend, top Trump aides said the Cuban government must grant greater freedoms to its people if it wants the warmer relationship with the US to continue.\nDuring the campaign, Trump had promised to reverse President Obama’s moves aimed at normalizing US-Cuba relations, an apparent shift for the Republican from his 2015 remarks that he supported the foreign policy change.\nNicole Hernandez can be reached at nicole.hernandez@globe.com .

      "text": "Apps & Games News by John Callaham 7 seconds ago \nThe team behind Google’s popular navigation mobile app Waze like to have some fun while guiding users to their destination. Today, the Waze team announced that for a limited time, users can get their directions from the hosts of the new Amazon Prime streaming TV series, The Grand Tour. See also: The best GPS app and navigation app options for Android April 14, 2016 \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will be telling you to turn left, right or if you are getting close to your home. If you are not familiar with the trio, they are the former hosts of the BBC’s worldwide hit car driving show Top Gear. In 2015, the BBC announced it would not be bringing Clarkson back to the show after he attacked a Top Gear producer. Both Hammond and May left as well, and Amazon snatched the trio up to launch a new car-oriented show, The Grand Tour. The first two episodes of the series are live on Amazon Prime now, and new episodes will premiere every Friday. As with Top Gear, the hosts drive some amazing vehicles and get into some over-the top races and events. \nIf you want to hear them making your drive to a new destination more pleasant, you can access their voices on the Waze app by going intoÂ Settings, then Sound and then Voice Language. Finally, you pick “Clarkson, Hammond & May” from the menu selection of voices. It will be available from now until February 5. ",

      "text": "Pros and cons: Our quick verdict on Google Home Not a must-buy yet, but it will get better with more third-party support. Buy Now \nIt was only a matter of time before Google came out with something to compete with the Amazon Echo: After all, Google too has deep experience with both voice commands and search. Indeed, one of the things we like best about the new Google Home hub is how it responds to conversational inquiries -- and how Google's vast knowledge graph allow it to be genuinely helpful. What's more, the $129 device has a lower profile than the Echo, making for a more discreet design. It also has a surprisingly good speaker, and being able to just tell it what music you want to hear is a killer feature. \nWe already like it, then, but we'll like it even more when the device supports more third-party services, the way the Echo does. Right now, for instance, you can't book restaurant reservations through OpenTable or buy movie tickets on Fandango. Such features are coming eventually, though, and when the do, they device will be much more useful. Engadget Score",

      "text": "Published: Nov 28, 2016 3:19 p.m. ET Share \nAlphabet’s consumer-hardware push will add $4 billion in revenue next year and be a primary driver for stock, Morgan Stanley analyst says Reuters Jennifer Booton Reporter \nGoogle took lots of time before charging into the smartphone business, but Alphabet Inc.’s young hardware effort appears ready to become one of the prime reasons to buy the company’s stock, according to Morgan Stanley. \nSales of the Pixel line of smartphones are expected to add $4 billion to Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +1.14% GOOG, +1.19% revenue and $900 million to gross profit in fiscal 2017, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. Google is expected to sell three million Pixel smartphones in the fourth quarter and 5.5 million in fiscal 2017, according to his report. \nThat is still vastly below industry leaders. Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.15% sold nearly 212 million iPhones in its just completed fiscal year, which was actually a decrease from the year before, and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +1.64% remains the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer by sales despite taking a hit last quarter with the recall of the exploding Note 7. However, Google would manage to quickly conjure a hardware business bigger than Silicon Valley consumer-tech companies like Fitbit Inc. FIT, -1.55% and GoPro Inc. GPRO, -0.96% , neither of which has topped $2 billion in annual revenue. \nRead also: Apple nabs obscene share of smartphone profit in wake of Note 7 recall \nFor Nowak, the increase in hardware sales is most important as a potential catalyst for a stock that’s struggled to outperform broader indexes this year, despite earnings beats in the past two fiscal quarters . The goal of Pixel is to increase the amount of money Alphabet receives from Android users by enticing owners to spend as much in Google’s app store as Apple users spend through iOS. It’s all about tying together hardware and software to keep people spending money in the Google ecosystem, similar to the way Apple has recently benefited from a surge in software and services revenue through iOS, even as device sales have flattened. \n“Bigger picture: We believe the Pixel is important as Google works to provide users a more integrated and consistent Android experience,” Nowak wrote in a note issued to clients Monday. Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7: A Day in the Life (3:24) \nWhat happens when you replace your iPhone with the Android iPhone? WSJ's Joanna Stern compares the iPhone 7 and its lookalike, the Google Pixel, during a day of fun-filled adventures. Photo: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal. \nGoogle, an internet and search titan that makes the vast majority of its money from digital ads, stayed on the fringes of the electronics market as other companies—including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.86% —experimented to varying degrees with mobile devices. Amazon ultimately failed with its Fire phone , but it has since found success with its home speaker, Echo. While Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.15% built its own mobile empire by manufacturing the iPhone to run its iOS mobile operating system, Google for a long time opted to partner with third-party hardware makers such as Samsung, HTC Corp. 2498, +1.45% and LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -1.09% for Android smartphones, rather than building its own hardware. \nSee also: Apple iPhone with curved screen could come as soon as next year \nBut Google has had skin in the hardware game with efforts like the Chromecast streaming-TV dongle and defunct Google Glass, and it dove into the world of high-end consumer electronics in 2015 with the Pixel C tablet, a competitor to the iPad and Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, +0.06% Surface. It doubled down on hardware again this past October with the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, premium-tier phones that compete directly with the iPhone and Samsung‘s Galaxy line. It also unveiled the Daydream virtual-reality headset, which competes with Samsung’s Gear VR, and Google Home Speaker, a rival to Amazon’s Echo. \nNowak believes Pixel will be one of the three primary growth drivers of Google’s stock in 2017. The other catalysts are innovation in Google’s Websites business, driven by an update to Google Maps; and the company’s low price-to-earnings ratio, which is at its lowest point since July 2015 and lags behind Google’s peers. \nRead also: Why Alphabet could be more valuable than Apple \nThe hardware business is just a marginal part of Alphabet’s total top line. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is estimated to be $85.1 billion, with nearly $75 billion of that coming from Google Websites. according to FactSet. \nNowak reiterated an overweight rating and $950 12-month price target on Alphabet’s stock, implying 20% growth from Monday afternoon trading prices. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $960.59, according to a FactSet survey of more than 30 analysts. \nShares of Alphabet traded up 1.6% to $792.89 Monday afternoon. They are flat from three months ago and have risen 2.8% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 SPX, -0.43% , which is up 1.8% in the past three months and 5.6% in the past year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.24% , meanwhile, is up 7.5% in the past three months and 4% on the year. More from MarketWatch",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\n“I have a very dear sister in the Lord who sent me a picture of some writing that appeared in the sky over her home some months ago. It looked like some type of Hebrew letters. When trying to match it up with Hebrew, all we could come up with was judgment and war, but we left it alone to wait upon the Lord for further instruction.\n“Recently, she sent the picture to me again and immediately I picked up on it in my spirit. Here is what the Lord transcribed as the meaning in the sky.” — Bette Stevens\nGod is warning people all over the world that we have reached a point of no return and that it is time to repent and prepare. The question many people have is, “When?” No one knows. However, the Bible does tell us that we will know the season. Many people are hearing “VERY SOON!” in their spirit and we do know that we are in that season.\nIn the article, Bette went on to say:\nI went into a vision and as I did, I saw a hand appear and just as clearly write the words, which I am going to bring forth now. In part, it is a warning to a very influential world leader whose name I am not allowed to release yet. Here are the words interpreted into English:\n“We will meet at the battle of Armageddon.\nWe will meet at the battle of Armageddon.\nWe will meet at the battle of Armageddon.”\nThis was written three times distinctively.\nStevens goes on to warn that God specifically said:\n“Tell My people the wrath of the Lamb has come. Then I heard the voice of the Lord say, the nation of America, the church of America has polluted My name, My gospel, with debauchery, compromise, mammon, power, greed, and corruption. Have I not brought you where you are? I am the one and only true God. No one comes before Me nor after Me. My Father has given Me all power and authority over all people ,tribes, tongues, and nations.”\nHe then said, “Come and see.”\nStevens says she was awakened immediately and then taken in a vision to see the armies of both God and Satan preparing for battle.\nShe explained, “This was given to me briefly to see. Then I heard, “Bow Satan! I saw Satan hesitate with a lot of reluctance, a lot of reluctance. Then again I heard the words, “Bow Satan.” Then I saw Satan bow down and that was the end of the vision.\nShe says she was reminded once again about our spiritual birthright and our inheritance. “Do not throw it away. Do not carelessly hand it over to Satan. The Lord reminds us, we enter the kingdom as a little child, wearing garments without spots or wrinkles.”\nStevens added, “ Then He said to me three times, This is non-negotiable. This is non-negotiable. This is non-negotiable. ”\nI agree with Bette Stevens when she states that, “the hour is late and the time is now. Bible prophecy is rapidly moving forward. God is warning like never before, loud and clear. The call is going forward, don’t be found wanting. Don’t be found without your garments. Don’t let loose of your inherited birthright or your crown.”\nCHECK OUT LYN LEAHZ ON YOUTUBE AND SUBSCRIBE TODAY—CLICK HERE NOW!\nFEATURE VIDEO Above Top Secret Nuclear Expert & Former USAF Captain Reveals Shocking Information!\nWAR!

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\n“Upon awakening, the first thing I heard very clearly in my spirit was, “There is more to come!” I spent most of the morning praying over the dream, asking the Lord for interpretation, and if I was to release the dream. As I sat still in His presence, the Lord said, “ DO NOT LEAVE YOUR STATIONS !” I was then shown the following…” Diana Pulliam, Z3 News\nI believe we have reached a point of no return, spiritually, as a nation. And, I’m not the only one! In fact, I believe we reached that point sometime ago. What we are seeing now is God’s great mercy in warning us of what lies ahead. Interestingly enough, a great number of people across the United States of America and abroad have a heaviness on their hearts that ‘something’ tragic is about to happen. Weeks ago, right after the election, I too experienced a great heaviness along with the verse from the Bible about “…when they say peace and safety…” Surprisingly enough, when I posted a video about that, the responses in agreement wth the same heaviness and passage were overwhelming! I have also heard from countless people via email, social media, etc. saying the same thing. Should we be paying attention?\nJust the other day, Michael Snyder, author of The Economic Collapse Blog and End of the American Dream website also posted an article about the same thing. Here is an excerpt of what he had to say:\nMillions of Americans are expecting a new “golden age” for America under Donald Trump, but is that what they are going to get? There is always optimism when a new president is elected, but I don’t know if I have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many Trump supporters are expressing right now. Look, I voted for Donald Trump and I want him to be as successful as possible. But when Donald Trump becomes our next president on January 20th , that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear. If you listen to some people, they make it sound like America is going to experience nothing but peace, prosperity and blessing for decades to come. I would love it if that was indeed going to be the case, but unfortunately that is simply not the truth.\nWe are currently on a path that leads to national suicide, and unless we change our ways it isn’t going to matter who is in the White House.\nAnd, a couple of authors on Z3News also posted something similar. You can read their articles HERE and HERE\nOne of the authors, Quote: d below, was clearly given a prophetic warning dream by God. Here is an excerpt from that article. Surprisingly, I had JUST recorded my video (see the feature video here) and had not yet finished. I still had to edit and upload it to youtube, when I stumbled across her article with the exact same verse God had given to me.\nSaints, we must resist this deceiving spirit. The Lord is warning “THERE IS MORE TO COME,” and “DO NOT LEAVE YOUR STATIONS!”\nWe can’t allow our eyes to focus on what’s swirling around us. This is NOT a time to let up or take a break from the assignment the Lord has given to each of us. We must keep our eyes fixed straight ahead upon Jesus, and our ears in tune, listening to the directions of the Holy Spirit!\nPlease pray fervently over this word for confirmation.\nScripture References:\nI was given the following scriptures:\n1 Thessalonians 5:3, “For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them…”\n1 Timothy 4:1, “Now the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons.”\nGalatians 6:7, “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap…”\nHebrews 12: 1-3, “…let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith…”\nFEATURE VIDEO WAR!

      "text": "SHARES Getty Images Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California. \nWhile Google's new Pixel phone isn't anywhere near the iPhone, a Morgan Stanley analyst sees it adding $3.8 billion in revenue to Alphabet' s coffers in 2017. \n\"Bigger picture, we believe the Pixel is important as [Alphabet] works to provide users a more integrated and consistent Android experience aimed to improve Android user mobile search monetization,\" analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a research note. \nPixel, Google's first phone with a completely in-house design, is one of several factors setting the company up for a \"great\" 2017, Nowak wrote. In addition to selling 3 million Pixel phones in the fourth quarter of this year and 5.5 million in 2017, Google's core websites are growing faster than expected, Nowak estimates. \nPixel, Google's expanded text ads, a fourth mobile ad unit and Maps should add $6.5 billion combined to Google's total revenue in 2017, Nowak estimated. CNBC has reached out to Google for comment. \nStill, while the Pixel seems poised to improve shopping and advertising on Android, a few million phones hardly compared to the 78 million iPhones Wall Street expects Apple to sell during the December quarter, according to FactSet. Plus, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat told investors in an earnings call that holiday sales and marketing for its new hardware would add to costs going into 2017.",

Google doodle celebrates the trailblazing author of 'Little Women' 0 Up Next Buying stuff on your phone still sucks. Here's why Photo by Google \nLouisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, making today her 184th birthday. Today's Google doodle by Sophie Diao honours the writer by capturing the March sisters from Alcott's \"Little Women.\" \n\"Little Women\" is Alcott's most famous novel, loosely based on her childhood in Concord, Massachusetts. The March family was based on her own, with the strong-willed Jo a stand-in for Alcott herself. \n\"I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead,\" wrote Alcott, as Jo, in the book. \"I don't know what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.\" \nBest known for her writing, Alcott's achievements stretched far beyond her novels and short stories and astonish she did. Alcott was a tireless suffragist, feminist and abolitionist. She served as a volunteer nurse during the Civil War and her home was a station on the Underground Railroad. As a lifelong advocate for feminism and women's suffrage, she also became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts. \nShe grew up alongside other famous Americans like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau, who all share her final resting place in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Massachusetts, the burial site for some of the United States' most renowned writers and thinkers.

      "text": "Share this Story This Icon Pack is Hot: Pix It \nAs someone who is always trolling Google Play for the next “hot” icon pack, I have found one that I would like to share, catered to anyone friendly towards the new icon look you find on Pixel devices. Called Pix It , the overall feel is very circular, but there are exceptions where a portion of the icon will cross over the circular border. This design is what drew me into the pack. \nThe pack features over 4500+ icons, but the attention to each OEM’s unique set of app icons is what impresses me. For example, many icon packs don’t support apps that come preloaded on phones. Because of this, you don’t get a very uniformed look on your home screen. In Pix It, many OEM icons are support, including LG, Moto, and Samsung, bringing that uniform experience you want. \nOn top of loads of different icons, the app offers a ton of cloud-based wallpapers (a few of them are used on Pixel devices), support for Muzei, an icon request tool in case you don’t see an icon you need, as well as weekly updates to the icon repository. \nTo try out Pix It for yourself, head to Google Play, spend a $1, and it’s yours forever. \nPlay Link ($0.99) Post navigation",

      "text": "Photo by Google Louisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, making today her 184th birthday. Today's Google doodle by Sophie Diao honours the writer by capturing the March sisters from Alcott's \"Little Women.\"\n\"Little Women\" is Alcott's most famous novel, loosely based on her childhood in Concord, Massachusetts. The March family was based on her own, with the strong-willed Jo a stand-in for Alcott herself.\n\"I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead,\" wrote Alcott, as Jo, in the book. \"I don't know what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.\"\nBest known for her writing, Alcott's achievements stretched far beyond her novels and short stories and astonish she did. Alcott was a tireless suffragist, feminist and abolitionist. She served as a volunteer nurse during the Civil War and her home was a station on the Underground Railroad. As a lifelong advocate for feminism and women's suffrage, she also became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts.\nShe grew up alongside other famous Americans like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau, who all share her final resting place in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Massachusetts, the burial site for some of the United States' most renowned writers and thinkers.\n ",

      "text": " Google+\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\nDonald Trump waves as he steps out of his plane for a rally in Colorado.\nBy Michael A. Cohen November 28, 2016\nThree weeks after a tumultuous national election, the American presidency — and indeed, democracy itself — is facing one of its most serious legitimacy crises in this nation’s history.\nLet’s start with the most obvious sign of illegitimacy: The candidate with the most votes in this year’s presidential election didn’t win. And it’s not a close margin. Hillary Clinton leads by more than 2 million votes in the popular vote tally, and she may end up winning by more than 2.5 million votes, or 2 percentage points. That’s a bigger margin of victory than John F. Kennedy in 1960, Richard Nixon in 1968, Jimmy Carter in 1976, and, of course, George W. Bush in 2000, who lost the popular vote by 500,000 votes.\nAdvertisement\nI get that the Electoral College is the system we have in this country and that you have to fight an election by the rules that exist, which allowed Trump to prevail. But this also isn’t a football game. It’s democracy, and when the person who “wins” gets 2.5 million fewer votes than the person who “loses,” that brings into question whether the United States truly is a representative democracy. Clearly, a healthy plurality of Americans wanted Hillary Clinton to be their next president. This will make the second time in the last 16 years that the winner of the popular vote did not become president. That’s a crisis of political legitimacy — and yet it’s unlikely that any effort will be made to reform this anarchic system and ensure that the will of the American people is upheld.\nTo make the situation even worse, in the last 24 hours Trump has further undermined the validity of an election he won by dishonestly claiming that 3 million illegal voters cast ballots. This is one of the most direct attacks against America’s political system that we’ve ever seen from a major political figure. Even worse, it could lay the groundwork for a full-scale assault on voting rights in America.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning All of this is a problem, but a much bigger issue is at stake here — the manner in which Donald Trump won the presidency.\nFirst, there’s the issue of FBI Director Jim Comey’s letter to Congress less than two weeks before Election Day, which by all accounts shifted public opinion against Clinton and almost certainly cost her the presidency. Comey’s unprecedented actions were prejudicial toward Clinton, cast undue suspicion on her, and violated a longstanding FBI tradition of not releasing information about a criminal investigation within 60 days of an election. Further, as I wrote at the time of Comey’s letter, this isn’t just about Clinton, for if this last-minute intervention were perceived to tip the election to Trump, he would enter office under a permanent stain, and the sense among millions of Americans that the FBI put its finger on the scale to help him win. Will there be any reckoning for Comey and his reckless behavior? At this point, it certainly doesn’t appear so.\nSecond, according to US intelligence agencies, we know that the Russian government interfered in the presidential election, through hacking both the e-mails of the DNC and of Clinton’s aides, as well as the planting of fake news stories intended to help Trump. The involvement of a foreign government in successfully disrupting a US election is unprecedented, but so far, there is no indication that a Trump administration or Congress has any intention of delving more deeply into this issue. Indeed, there is little evidence that Trump and his Republican cohort are all that bothered by Moscow’s electoral intervention.\nAdvertisement\nLastly, there’s the even more disturbing fact that the president-elect has made clear he has no intention of truly disengaging himself from his vast business interests — and that he intends personally to profit from becoming president. In the month since he was elected, Trump has met with his Indian business partners, pushed a British MP to change a law in the United Kingdom that would benefit his golf course, allegedly lobbied the Argentinian president over an issue with one of his projects there , and is claiming that he doesn’t believe conflicts of interest apply to him as president. When Trump becomes president in January, he will probably be in violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prevents a president from accepting “any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state” unless Congress agrees. In short, Trump will be open to impeachment the moment he takes the oath of office.\nYet even though Trump will enter the White House under this extraordinary cloud of illegitimacy, helped along by the nation’s foremost law enforcement agency, a foreign government, and an undemocratic electoral system, he and his Republican allies in Congress are preparing to move forward with a policy agenda that may undermine decades of social and economic progress. Unless the Electoral College or Congress steps in and, at the very least, demands that Trump divest himself of his business interests, America’s crisis of political legitimacy is only going to get worse.\nMichael A.

      "text": " Google+\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\nRetired General David Petraeus spoke to media members while leaving Trump Tower on Monday.\nBy Jerry Markon and Paul Kane The Washington Post November 28, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump met Monday with retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, a possible alternative choice for secretary of state amid an escalating feud over the position between supporters of former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who will sit down with Trump on Tuesday.\nFollowing the meeting, Petraeus told media gathered at Trump Tower that he spoke with President-elect Trump for about an hour.\nAdvertisement\n“He basically walked us around the world,” Petraeus said, according to a pool report. “Showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that are out there and some of the opportunities as well. Very good conversation and we’ll see where it goes from here.”\nTrump tweeted afterwards that he “was very impressed” with Petraeus.\nJust met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 Get Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break As Trump’s senior advisers battled over who should fill what is considered the most prestigious Cabinet post, the president-elect will hold a second session with Romney along with another possible option, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., aides said Monday. Corker, who will visit Manhattan’s Trump Tower on Tuesday, chairs the Senate foreign relations committee and had suggested publicly that he was unlikely to be chosen.\nView Story Tom Price said to be Trump’s pick for health secretary An official says Donald Trump has selected the six-term Republican congressman from Georgia to be secretary of health and human services.\nMitt Romney, Donald Trump to meet Tuesday\nBut Trump is reportedly considering alternatives for Foggy Bottom as an extraordinary feud has broken out between those supporting Romney, a former Massachusetts governor considered the quintessential establishment Republican, and Giuliani, a fierce Trump backer seen by some as deserving the secretary of state post out of sheer loyalty. Romney attacked Trump in unusually harsh and personal terms during the presidential campaign.\nThe fight hit a fevered pitch over Thanksgiving weekend as Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s former campaign manager and now senior adviser to the transition team, took to the airways to attack Romney’s credentials to be the nation’s top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidants who are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence the president-elect’s decision.\nAdvertisement\nAnother Romney opponent and influential Trump backer, Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., blasted Romney on CNN’s ‘‘New Day’’ Monday as ‘‘a self-serving egomaniac who puts himself first, who has a chip on his shoulder, and thinks that he should be president of the United States.’’ Collins was among the first sitting members of Congress to endorse Trump during the campaign.\nOthers inside Trump’s orbit, particularly Vice President-elect Mike Pence, are viewed as Romney supporters, believing that he has a steady hand that would benefit Trump in the turbulent world of diplomacy, according to people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nTrump was angered at Conway’s remarks, according to a report Monday on MSNBC’s ‘‘Morning Joe.’’ Trump aides declined to comment during a conference call with reporters, saying only that the president-elect is taking his time to choose the best possible candidate. Jason Miller, a senior Trump communications adviser, said Trump is meeting with Romney again because ‘‘the two, quite frankly, haven’t spent much time together, so this gives them a little more time to do so.’’\nThe secretary of state search heated up as Trump resumed a busy schedule of transition meetings Monday at Manhattan’s Trump Tower after spending Thanksgiving weekend at his Florida estate. Among those dropping by today will be a candidate for Homeland Security secretary: Frances Townsend, a top homeland security and counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush administration. Another DHS contender - Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Tex., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee - will meet with Trump on Tuesday.\nMilwaukee Sheriff David Clarke was also spotted arriving at Trump Tower Monday afternoon, according to a pool reporter.\nPence, who will participate in the meetings, entered the Trump Tower lobby Monday morning and paused in front of the elevators amid shouted questions from reporters, saying only: ‘‘It’s going to be a busy week. Get ready. Buckle up.’’\nTrump aides continued Monday to blast a pending recount effort in Wisconsin led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein that has been joined by Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Trump had spent Sunday ridiculing Clinton’s campaign over the issue, before ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud.\n‘‘In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,’’ Trump tweeted late Sunday, one of more than 10 tweets on the recount issue.\nThat accusation - spread by conspiracy sites such as Infowars.com and discredited by fact-checking organizations - gained traction among some conservatives disappointed that Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton, though he won the all-important Electoral College.\nMiller, in the briefing, added: ‘‘I really do think it’s ridiculous that so much oxygen has been given to recount efforts when there is absolutely no chance of the election results changing. This election has been decided. It’s a conceded election.’’\nPetraeus, who has been taking a ‘‘wait and see’’ approach on joining the new administration, according to a U.S. military official who speaks with him often, has emerged as a possible alternative for secretary of state amid the battle over Romney.\nThe general is one of the most influential military officers of his generation, but ended his government career as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in November 2012 amid revelations that he had an affair with his biographer.\nPetraeus pleaded guilty in April 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information in connection with the scandal - namely sharing information with biographer Paula Broadwell - and was sentenced to probation and a $100,000 fine. He could face a tough Senate confirmation process because of that history, though he has since testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee as a foreign policy expert.\nConway over the weekend had led the remarkable rear-guard attack on Romney, arguing that he was disloyal to Trump and should not be considered to run the State Department. The remarks highlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whether Romney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment or whether a loyalist such as Giuliani should get the nod.\nRomney’s supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents - Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trump loyalists - have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt.\nThose opposed to Romney have been advocating that Trump reward Giuliani with the secretary of state position, stressing his loyalty vs. Romney’s refusal to publicly say whom he voted for in the presidential race.\n‘‘I don’t think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position,’’ Conway said on ABC’s ‘‘This Week,’’ suggesting that Romney went too far in questioning Trump’s character and intellect during the presidential race. ‘‘There was the ‘Never Trump’ movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.’’\nThe Conway offensive, which began Thursday on Twitter and continued in her three television appearances Sunday, led the echo chamber of opposition to the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich said most Trump supporters could not countenance Romney’s selection for any high-profile posting in Trump’s new administration.\n‘‘I think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority,’’ Gingrich said on Fox News.\nBut Pence is considered a Romney supporter. And the incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also has a long-standing relationship with Romney since Priebus served as Republican National Committee chairman during Romney’s unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid.\nInfighting over such a prominent position is not unusual. Four years ago, President Obama faced internal division over his choice to succeed Clinton as secretary of state, with one possibility being Susan E. Rice, who had been a longtime Obama confidant. Senate Democrats preferred their colleague John F. Kerry, and eventually Obama made Rice his national security adviser and gave Kerry the State Department.\nBut that internal Democratic feud played out in the traditional Washington manner - behind closed doors and in anonymous background Quote: s to news outlets. Today’s Republican battle has been carried out in an unusually public fashion that left some old Washington hands stunned and wondering whether this would be the new normal over the next four years.\n- - -\nThe Washington Post’s Dan Lamothe, Philip Rucker and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report.",

      "text": " Google+\nCourtesy Magic Mountain\nThe new owner of Magic Mountain hopes to have a second chairlift to the summit to ease the burden on its existsing “red chair” lift.\nBy Matt Pepin Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nCourtesy Geoff Hatheway\nGeoff Hatheway skiing a trail at the ski area he now owns.\nNote: This story originally appeared as part of the Globe’s “It’s All Downhill” skiing and snowboarding newsletter. Sign up to receive it by email here .\nGeoff Hatheway has been skiing since he was 3 years old, when his parents first clicked him in and took him and his siblings on frequent trips to southern Vermont, mostly Stratton, Bromley, and Magic Mountain.\nHe recalls a period in the 90s when Magic was closed, but when it reopened, it became a natural destination for him to bring his own family as they sought an alternative to larger, more crowded places. Day trips led to more and more involvement in racing and other skiing programs as well as the Magic community. Hatheway even spent some time as the area’s marketing director.\nAdvertisement\nOn Nov. 21, however, his role grew exponentially when he announced on YouTube that the sale of the ski area to an investment group he is leading was complete following a lengthy and complicated process. The next day, he discussed it with me in a phone interview. Here are some of his answers from our conversation:\nIt took a long time to get this done. Was it worth it?\n“It’s definitely worth it. Oh yeah. I mean, you just see the response of people that I’ve gotten over the last 24 hours, and you know what a special place this is to those people, and they have an innate trust in what were going to do with the place. This place quite frankly wouldn’t have been here this year if we didn’t get the deal done, so we don’t want to lose a great natural resource that we have here in Magic.”\nIt sounds like Magic has a unique charm.\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. “I think every area has its unique charms, and its own drawbacks, and we’ve got our drawbacks, but I think our charm outdoes our drawbacks. And we’re trying to reduce the drawbacks, quite frankly. That’s what our investor group is trying to mitigate — some of the issues that Magic has faced in the past, and those revolve around all our lifts running, and functional, and approved, and all that kind of stuff, and the other part is having enough snowmaking. People don’t even think we make snow, but we do, and we’ve made it over the years but we need to do a better job of making that snow consistently on more trails so there’s a good feeling that no matter what the weather brings, that Magic’s going to have a good variety of terrain.”\nWhat’s on the to-do list then?\n“A huge priority for us is getting this second summit lift going, which hasn’t run in two years. It’s a great old lift, but it’s been neglected. We put a lot of money into the thing and we’re getting close on it.”\nWhat do you envision your first run at your own mountain will be like for you personally?\n“It’s going to be very sweet. It’s one thing to have been here all this time and contributed on a volunteer basis, it’s another thing to be absolutely 100 percent responsible for the product that you’ve got out there. The first run is going to be mentally satisfying, physically hopefully challenging, and three, I think there will be a lot of analysis going on, because I’m skiing the product and I’m going to be getting that word out about it, so I’m going to be making sure everything is good.”\nWhat can guests expect at Magic in both the short- and long-term?\nAdvertisement\n“In the short term they’re going to get what Magic has always had, which is a really challenging and interesting ski experience on the trails, and in the glades, and just a really warm, friendly, fun community in the lodge and on the slopes. ... What we do want people to notice is that there’s going to be an improvement in the product. ... [In the long term] we’ve got really good plans for bringing back a mid-mountain lift which will make more beginner and intermediate terrain accessible to more people, but also a beginner conveyor belt, a magic carpet in a whole new area, so we’ve got some really good plans to enhance the family aspect of this mountain.”\nOpening day is scheduled for Dec. 17.\nMORE OPENING DATES: Last week’s snow and cold temperatures have paved the way for many New England ski areas to open. Wachusett, Loon, Bretton Woods, Sunday River, Cannon, Bromley, Jiminy Peak, and Sugarloaf were among the ones to open this week. Many New Hampshire areas have set projected opening dates. Here’s a list on the SkiNH website .\nTHUMBS UP: I thought Wachusett came up with a great way to give someone a spot on the first chair of the season, asking its followers to make their pitch on social media using the hashtag #wawafirstchair. The deadline was Nov. 23.\nAndrew Santoro/Wachusett\nDavid Coviello of Hubbardston, Julia Hutchinson of Milton, and Tim McCrohan of Worcester won Wachusett’s contest and were first on the lift on opening day Friday.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Meghan E. Irons Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nThe Boston NAACP Monday selected an outspoken lawyer to replace Michael Curry, who is stepping down after six years as the branch’s president.\nTanisha Sullivan, a lawyer who was the initial investigator into allegations of racial discrimination at Boston Latin School, was the only candidate seeking the post.\nAdvertisement\nAt a meeting in Roxbury, members also voted to select Lori D. Nelson, a longtime NAACP stalwart, as first vice president over former state senator Dianne Wilkerson, who was seeking to make a comeback after her release from federal prison.\nCurry, a lawyer and health care lobbyist, brought stability, relevancy, and power to the branch during his leadership at the all-volunteer organization. He played a key role in state and city redistricting, pushed for police body cameras, and helped to press a federal inquiry into racial tensions at Boston Latin. He said he plans to take a more active role in the national NAACP.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. “Now, with attorney Sullivan’s leadership, we have an opportunity to expand our influence in addressing the critical issues impacting people of color in Boston,” Curry said. “She is the right person for a time such as this.’’\nSullivan, a self-described business and legal affairs specialist, is a regional leader for the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, a private organization committed to community development, according to Curry.\nShe was the chief office of equity officer in the school department under former superintendent Carol R. Johnson and former interim superintendent John McDonough. Sullivan was out of the country Monday, Curry said, and could not be reached for comment.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2014, Curry said, Sullivan took the lead after turmoil engulfed Boston Latin Academy when dozens of teachers accused the headmaster and other administrators of lowering academic standards, penalizing those who refused to comply, and otherwise “creating fear and insecurity amongst faculty.”\nThe case, Curry said, resulted in significant changes at the school.\nSullivan was also at the school department when McDonough received the official complaint of race allegations at Boston Latin, Curry added.\nMeghan E.

      "text": " Google+\nCarolyn Kaster/AP Photo\nKellyanne Conway speaks to media as she arrives at Trump Tower.\nBy Joan Vennochi Globe Columnist November 29, 2016\nK ellyanne Conway’s thrashing of Mitt Romney was bad. Raising the possibility of prosecuting Hillary Clinton as her campaign pursues a recount — as Conway also did — is worse.\nBoth are signs that the divisive, vengeful agenda of Trump the candidate is being carried forward to a Trump White House. There’s an enemies list before the president-elect even takes the oath of office. And with Clinton, there’s a not-so-veiled threat Trump might use the power of the presidency to encourage the Justice Department to press criminal charges against his defeated rival. That’s pretty chilling.\nAdvertisement\nConway made news on the Sunday shows by joining forces with others, like Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee, who say Romney doesn’t deserve to be secretary of state because he famously trashed Trump during a speech last March. Yet where would Conway be if Trump demanded eternal loyalty from everyone who worked for him?\nCertainly not taking the bow she is now, as the campaign manager who helped guide him to victory. She got her job with Trump after first working for a super PAC that supported Ted Cruz. In that previous role, she regularly trashed Trump on cable TV during primary season.\nWhy Romney wants to rush into Trump’s crazy circus tent is a good question. But if he did, there would occasionally be one serious, sensible, and sane plutocrat in the Oval Office.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning In his March speech , Romney was tough indeed on Trump, calling him out as a bully and fraud, questioning his character and temperament, and challenging his acumen on domestic and foreign policy. In an example of one matter that comes under State Department purview, Romney said that Trump’s suggestion to let ISIS “take out” Syria’s Bashar al-Assad “has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season.” Trump, declared Romney, “tells us that he is very, very smart. I’m afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart.”\nWhatever happens with Romney, that is Trump’s call, not Conway’s. After all, Trump overlooked what she said about him as a Cruz advocate. As summarized by Media Matters last August, Conway attacked Trump for his “unpresidential” and “vulgar” language, criticized him for having “built a lot of his business on the backs of the little guy,” and mocked him for whining and complaining that the Colorado primary was rigged, after he lost it to Cruz.\nWhether or not Conway went rogue with her attack on Romney, as some now claim, it’s not good news for Republicans who might be hoping a Trump presidency could somehow unite the party. With her comments about Clinton, Conway sends an even darker message about the Trump World mindset.\nAdvertisement\nTo CNN’s Dana Bash, Conway said that Trump has been “incredibly gracious and magnanimous” about not prosecuting Clinton over her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state, “at a time when, for whatever reason, her folks are saying they will join in a recount to try to somehow undo the 70-plus electoral votes that he beat her by.”\nConway’s words come after Trump told The New York Times he did not want to “hurt” the Clintons. But he’s happy to try to silence them, by letting Conway remind them of his generosity toward them in one breath while mentioning the recount process, which was launched by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, in the next. Conway also noted that Trump wouldn’t rule out a criminal probe “if the attorney general and the Congress find evidence that would indicate that something needs to happen.”\nDon’t waste any time shooting Trump’s messenger.\nThose are Trump’s thoughts coming out of Conway’s mouth.\nJoan Vennochi can be reached at vennochi@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images/File\nRepresentative Tom Price at Trump Tower in New York earlier this month.\nBy Robert Pear New York Times November 29, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has selected Rep. Tom Price, a six-term Republican congressman from Georgia who has led opposition to the Affordable Care Act, to be secretary of health and human services, according to a transition team official.\nPrice, an orthopedic surgeon, has been a severe critic of the health law, saying it interferes with the ability of patients and doctors to make medical decisions.\nAdvertisement\nAnd he says that events have borne out his warnings.\n“Premiums have gone up, not down,” Price said recently. “Many Americans lost the health coverage they were told time and time again by the president that they could keep. Choices are fewer.”\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. An announcement of Price’s appointment is expected as soon as Tuesday, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been released.\nSome Republicans have attacked the Affordable Care Act without proposing an alternative. Price, by contrast, has introduced bills offering a detailed, comprehensive replacement plan in every Congress since 2009, when Democrats started work on the legislation.\nFrom his days as a Georgia state senator, Price, now 62, has been a voice for doctors, often aligned with the positions of the American Medical Association and the Medical Association of Georgia.\nAdvertisement\nAs secretary, Price would be responsible for a department with an annual budget of more than $1 trillion, health programs that insure more than 100 million Americans and agencies that regulate food and drugs and sponsor much of the nation’s biomedical research.",

      "text": " Google+\nEPA file photos\nKellyanne Conway (left) and Steve Bannon.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nStudents from the Harvard Kennedy School and others say they plan to protest the arrival of key members of president-elect Donald J. Trump’s team this week when they attend a two-day conference at the school’s campus following the contentious presidential election.\nAccording to the Harvard Institute of Politics, part of the Kennedy School, Kellyanne Conway, who helped to usher in a Trump presidency as the candidate’s campaign manager, and chief strategist Steve Bannon are expected to attend portions of the “Campaign for President: The Managers Look at 2016” event being held Wednesday and Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nThe event has taken place each election year since 1972, according to the school.\nBannon is listed as a “ confirmed participant ” on the institute’s website, along with dozens of reporters and other political advisers. Bannon accepted the invitation for the campaign manager event but is not on the agenda of speakers, Harvard officials said in an e-mailed statement.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Conway is scheduled to speak Thursday night. She will take the stage alongside Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager; and CNN anchor Jake Tapper at a forum called “ War Stories: Inside Campaign 2016 .” CNN will broadcast the discussion on Sunday, according to the institute’s website.\nBannon was tapped as Trump’s chief strategist in the days after the election. The appointment drew ire because of Bannon’s ties to the “alt-right” website Breitbart News, and views that have been called racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic.\nA Facebook page called “ Protest Stephen Bannon & Trump Advisors at Harvard ” is calling on students to come together for a “peaceful” gathering to decry the school’s decision to invite Bannon.\nAdvertisement\n“Trump brought racist ideologues into the mainstream. Harvard is furthering the process of normalization for racist hate,” the group’s event page says. “We do not accept hate and bigotry as normal or legitimate. Come protest.”\nThe effort comes just days after a group of students and alumni from the Harvard Business School, which Bannon attended in the 1980s , penned a letter disavowing his appointment to the White House staff. The letter, published in the New York Times , characterized Bannon as the architect of a movement that “preaches white nationalism, racism, misogyny, and hatred.”\nA second protest is tentatively planned for Thursday, when Conway appears at the forum about the election. More than 300 people have signed up in support of the protests, according to the group’s Facebook page.\n“We should voice our concerns with respect for ourselves, our classmates, our faculty, and our country,” one of the event organizers wrote.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nAP/File\nJill Stein is on track to raise twice as much for an election recount effort than she did for her own failed Green Party presidential bid.\nBy Julie Bykowicz Associated Press November 28, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Jill Stein is on track to raise twice as much for an election recount effort than she did for her own failed Green Party presidential bid.\nFueled by the social media hashtag #recount2016 and millions of dispirited Hillary Clinton voters, Stein’s recount drive had already netted $6.3 million by Monday, according to her campaign website. That’s close to the $7 million she posted as a goal and millions more than the roughly $3.5 million she raised during her entire presidential bid.\nAdvertisement\nCiting without evidence concerns about ‘‘cyber hacking,’’ Stein wants a recount in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — places that Clinton, a Democrat, thought were safely in her column. Instead, Republican Donald Trump won all three and with them the electoral votes needed to win the White House.\nStein won no states and wouldn’t directly or immediately benefit from a recount — nor would she likely be able to topple Trump. Even Clinton’s attorney Marc Elias wrote there’s ‘‘no actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology.’’\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. But Stein’s effort could help her in other ways.\nView Story Clinton campaign to participate in vote recount in Wisconsin Clinton lawyer Marc Elias said he doesn’t expect the recounts to overturn the election results.\nStein raises millions for recount requests in three key states Jill Stein eyes third fund-raising goal for recount\nBy continuing to raise money, she is building up a larger donor list that she can later turn to if she runs again. She also can try to influence policy by urging those donors to call lawmakers or contribute to other politicians. Her campaign says 137,000 people have contributed to the recount.\nA bigger supporter list can command bigger fees if Stein chooses to lease it out to other campaigns.\nAdvertisement\nLaurence Tribe, a Harvard constitutional law professor, said that although recounts are ‘‘entirely within the law, Stein’s effort is probably aimed more at ‘‘trying to gain attention and establish herself as a national player.’’\nStein said she is ‘‘proud to stand up for election integrity’’ regardless of whether it changes the outcome of the presidential race. If she raises more money than is needed for the recount itself — including multimillion-dollar attorney fees — her campaign will use the surplus for ‘‘election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform.’’\nStein has reminded supporters that they can contribute up to $2,700 for her recount drive — even if they’d already donated the maximum $2,700 to her for the general election. Any money she raises in excess of the actual recount costs could then be donated to charity or to a political party, according to Federal Election Commission rulings.\n‘‘The money can’t be used for her personal benefit, but beyond that there’s some flexibility,’’ said Bob Biersack, who worked at the FEC for three decades and is a senior fellow at the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.\nThe recount itself could be costly.\nThe Stein campaign filed its Wisconsin recount petition on Friday and aimed to file Monday in Pennsylvania. The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted Monday to proceed with a recount and will bill Stein and other interested campaigns for the costs, estimated to be around $1 million.\nTrump denounced the Stein recount effort as ‘‘ridiculous’’ and ‘‘a scam.’’\nIt’s a way for Stein ‘‘to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,’’ the president-elect said in a statement Saturday.\nYet he has seemed to undercut his own argument that the election is over by going on to question the integrity of the vote.\nTrump falsely claimed on Twitter early Sunday that he ‘‘won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally’’ and went on — again with no evidence — to claim ‘‘serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.’’\nTribe noted the irony of Trump blasting Stein’s recount effort while falsely asserting voter fraud has occurred.\n‘‘Those two statements are diametrically opposed,’’ Tribe said.\nRelated Clinton campaign to participate in vote recount in Wisconsin Stein raises millions of dollars for recount requests in three key states Jill Stein eyes third fund-raising goal for recount",

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Blanding/Globe Staff/File\nLawmakers are quietly engaged in discussions about delaying some of the deadlines in Question 4, including delaying legalization of home growing.\nBy Joshua Miller and Frank Phillips Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin said Monday that the results of the Massachusetts marijuana legalization measure passed by voters may not be certified in time for it to go into effect Dec. 15, when the drug is slated to become legal for possession and use.\nA successful ballot initiative does not officially become law until it is certified by the eight-member Governor’s Council, a Colonial-era body that meets every Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nGalvin, the state’s top election official, said the earliest that official ballot question voting tallies are likely to be presented is at the Dec. 14 meeting. “And that is a 50-50 proposition,” he said.\nIn an interview, Galvin said there is no calculated effort to delay implementation, and the law is certain to be certified by the beginning of next year.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. “All those tokers can hold their breath a little longer, but they’ll be able to exhale” by early 2017, he quipped.\nThe timing is the latest bit of news to frustrate legalization advocates. They have also expressed dismay at Beacon Hill lawmakers’ discussions about altering or delaying aspects of the measure, including possibly holding off on legal marijuana shops until mid-2018.\nOne top legalization advocate appeared miffed by Galvin’s announcement.\nAdvertisement\n“I would hope that the secretary of state errs on the positive side of that 50-50, and that he and the Governor’s Council would be able to certify given the deadline date” in the initiative, said Will Luzier, who managed the successful Question 4 campaign.\n“I’m a little surprised, honestly, by that development because I just assumed the process was going forward,” he said. Luzier, a lawyer, said he expects the more than five weeks between Election Day and Dec. 15 is enough time to formally affirm the results.\nSo why the potential delay? Galvin said the election fell later than usual in November this year, and, to await overseas and military ballots, the results could not be locked in until Nov. 18.\nSince then, his office has been working with city and town officials to confirm the results. They focused first on the presidential election tallies, which were released Monday and will probably be certified by the council this week.\n“By state statute, we were required to preference the electors,” he said, referring to the people who will meet in Boston and every other state capital on Dec. 19 to formally cast their ballots for president. “No one is trying to delay the marijuana question deliberately,” he said. “It’s just the presidency of the United States is more important than legalizing marijuana.”\nGalvin said his office has “very limited staff, dealing with a lot of numbers and a lot of details. And it has to be exact; these are the official numbers.”\nOutgoing Councilor Michael J. Albano said that he would be surprised if the legalization question is not ready for certification before Dec. 15, adding that the body meets regularly and will be ready to act when Galvin has the results.\n“We meet every week so if it’s not ready on the 30th, we’ll be there on December 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th,” he said with a chuckle.\nThe warning from Galvin came the same afternoon Luzier and other marijuana advocates met with Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg. And it came days after the Globe reported the Legislature is considering delaying the opening of marijuana shops, as well as when it would be legal for people to grow pot at home. (Once certified, an initiative petition is like any other law and the Legislature can amend it.)\nThe ballot measure, which passed with more than 1.7 million votes this month, allows possession, use, and home growing on Dec. 15 of this year, and permits stores to sell marijuana beginning Jan. 1, 2018.\nState officials, such as Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg who will oversee the new industry, have argued that to create an effective new bureaucracy that can regulate and police recreational marijuana sales requires more time than the ballot question gives them.\nThe initiative calls for the creation of a three-person Cannabis Control Commission appointed by the treasurer.\nThat group will be in charge of making and enforcing rules for marijuana shops, cultivation houses, infused product manufacturers (that make things like marijuana brownies and sodas), and testing facilities.\nBut longtime legalization advocate Richard M. Evans, who helped write the ballot initiative, said Monday that concerns about the timetable of the law are not founded in reality.\nHe said Colorado managed to implement a regulated retail marijuana market in the same amount of time that the law gives Massachusetts regulators.\nOfficials on Beacon Hill are also worried about the home cultivation provision of the law, which, starting Dec. 15, allows people to grow up to 12 marijuana plants per household.\nColorado regulators say they have struggled with people legally growing marijuana at home and then illegally diverting it to the black market in other states for a big profit. Home-grown marijuana isn’t regulated and tracked like marijuana for commercial sale is.\nBut advocates in Massachusetts say those arguments are a red herring because Colorado has different and more permissive laws related to people growing marijuana at home.\nThey say it’s important to have a home cultivation provision for medical patients who might not want to register with the state, for people who might not want to purchase their marijuana at a store, and for hobbyists.\nMarijuana has been illegal in Massachusetts for more than a century and, on Nov. 8, voters swept away the long reign of prohibition 54 percent to 46 percent, according to unofficial results.\nJoshua Miller can be reached at joshua.miller@globe.com .

      "title": "Watch Elizabeth Warren deliver remarks on 21st Century Cures bill",
      "text": " Google+\n November 28, 2016\nThe following is text of US Senator Elizabeth Warren’s full remarks on the 21st Century Cures bill, as provided by Warren’s office:\nMr. President, three weeks ago, Americans went to the polls. Voters were deeply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans should be in charge. Donald Trump is the President-elect despite losing the popular vote by more than two million people.\nBut there is one thing that Americans were not divided on. On one issue, their message was loud and clear. According to exit polls, 70% of voters said they think the American economy and the lawmakers who oversee it are owned - owned - by big companies and special interests. That’s 70% of everybody-Democrats, Republicans, Independents.\nAdvertisement\nIn the closing days of this Congress, Big Pharma has its hand out for a bunch of special giveaways and favors that are packed together in something called the 21st Century Cures bill. It’s on track to get a vote in the House this week and then get rammed through the Senate. I’ve been looking at the details.\nAnd when American voters say Congress is owned by big companies, this bill is exactly what they are talking about. Now, we face a choice. Will this Congress say that yes, we’re bought and paid for, or will we stand up and work for the American people?\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. For more than two years, Congress has been working on legislation to help advance medical innovation in the United States. Medical innovation is powerfully important, and I have spent as much time working it as any other issue during my time in the Senate.\nFrom the beginning, I have emphasized one obvious fact. Medical breakthroughs come from increasing investments in basic research. Right now, Congress is choking off investments in the NIH. Adjusted for inflation, federal spending on medical research over the past dozen years has been cut by 20%. Those cuts take the legs out from under future medical innovation in America. We can name a piece of legislation the “cures” bill, but if it doesn’t include meaningful funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, it won’t cure anything.\nThat’s why months ago Senate Democrats said any so-called “cures” legislation must have a significant investment in medical research. And that’s why Senate Republicans publicly committed to doing exactly that. But now they have reneged on that promise and let Big Pharma hijack the Cures bill. This final deal has only a tiny fig leaf of funding, for NIH and for the opioid crisis.\nAdvertisement\nAnd most of that fig leaf isn’t even real. Most of the money won’t really be there unless future Congresses passes future bills in future years to spend those dollars.\nWhy bother with a fig leaf in the Cures bill? Why pretend to give any money to NIH or opioids? Because this funding is political cover for huge giveaways to giant drug companies. There are more examples than I can count, but here are three.\nFirst giveaway - legalize fraud.\nIt is against the law for drug companies to market drugs for uses not approved by the FDA. Some drug companies find this rule annoying - after all, they could make a whole lot more money selling a headache pill as a cure for everything from hair loss to cancer. But pushing treatments without scientific evidence that they work is fraud - fraud that can hurt people. It also undercuts the development of real cures. That’s why some of the largest law enforcement actions against big drug companies in the last fifteen years have involved off-label marketing. Drug companies have paid billions in penalties.\nOne solution would be for these companies to start following the law. But they prefer Plan B - cozy up to enough people in Congress to pass this Cures bill that would shoot holes in the anti-fraud law. Make it easier for drug companies to get away with fraud.\nSecond giveaway - cover up bribery.\nRight now, the law requires drug companies to disclose the buckets of money they shower on doctors and hospitals to encourage them to prescribe certain drugs. It’s all published on a government website - you can go look up your doctor or hospital right now if you want.\nThe drug companies’ could have responded by ending kickbacks. But they’ve chosen Plan B again -cozy up to enough people in Congress to pass this Cures bill that would let drug companies keep secret any splashy junkets or gifts associated with “medical education” and make it harder for enforcement agencies to trace those bribes. Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, says he is outraged by this provision. Well, I’m with Senator Grassley on this.\nThird giveaway - hand out dangerous, special deals to Republican campaign contributors.\nAccording to news reports, a major Republican donor stands to benefit financially from selling cellular and regenerative medical therapies. If this guy had his way, he’d be able to sell them to desperate people without a final FDA determination that those therapies are effective or safe. Of course, that would be against the law. So this megadonor has poured millions of dollars into Mitch McConnell’s personal campaign coffers and into his Republican SuperPAC, and now he wants his reward. So the Cures act offers to sell government favors. It delivers a special deal so people can sell these treatments without meeting the FDA gold standards for protecting patient safety and making sure these drugs do some good.\nKeep in mind: people could die from using unproven treatments. In fact, people have already died even during carefully controlled research experiments on these types of treatments. Congress shouldn’t be in the business of selling FDA favors to the highest bidder, risking people’s lives to enrich political donors.\nLet’s be clear. What the Republicans are proposing is corrupt, and it is very, very dangerous.\nAnd there’s more. Republicans decided to hand out gifts for other special interests. The Cures Act-a bill that was supposed to be about medical innovation-has a giveaway to the gun lobby. The bill cuts Medicare funding. It raids money from the Affordable Care Act. It takes health care dollars that should have gone to Puerto Rico. It makes it harder for people with disabilities to get Medicaid services. There’s a lot of bad stuff here.\nA lot of bad stuff, but not everything is bad. Republican leaders are playing a crafty game, trying to buy off Democratic votes, one-by-one, by tacking on good, bipartisan proposals that Senators in both parties have worked on, in good faith, for years. A bipartisan mental health bill. Bipartisan provisions protecting the genetic privacy of patients. Bipartisan provisions to give some very limited funding for important priorities like our national opioid crisis and the Vice President’s Cancer Moonshot initiative. A proposal to improve foster care.\nI support most of these proposals. I’ve worked on many of them for years. I even wrote several of them myself. If this bill becomes law, there is no question it will contain some real legislative accomplishments.\nBut I cannot vote for this bill. I will fight it because I know the difference between compromise and extortion.\nCompromise is putting together common-sense health proposals supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by most of the American people, and passing them into law. Extortion is holding those exact same proposals hostage unless everyone agrees to special favors for campaign donors and giveaways to the richest drug companies in the world.\nCompromise is when Senators - Democrats and Republicans - find the way forward on issues that matter to their constituents. Extortion is telling those same senators to forget what your constituents want - nothing to deal with the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs and nothing to increase medical research. Instead, every important, common-sense, bipartisan bill on mental health, genetic privacy, opioid addiction, foster care, and anything else will die today - unless Democrats agree to make it easier for giant drug companies to commit fraud, give out kickbacks, and put patients’ lives at risk. This demand is enough to make me gag.\nScientists who invent new cures should be celebrated, along with the companies that support them. But let me be perfectly clear. While the drug industry may get a seat at the table, they do not own the table. I do not care how many armies of lawyers and lobbyists they send out. I do not care how many campaign contributions they dump into Congressional pockets. I do not care how painful they can make life for politicians who oppose them. I will not be their lackey.\nI will work for the hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors who are committed to saving lives and who are waiting for Congress to fund their work.\nI will work for the millions of families that have been touched by Alzheimer’s, diabetes, cancer, and other deadly diseases who are counting on that research.\nI will work for the 70% of voters who are sick of a Congress that is owned by big donors and giant corporations.\nRepublicans are taking over Congress. They are taking over the White House. But Republicans don’t have majority support in this country. The majority of voters supported Democratic Senate candidates over Republicans ones, and the majority supported a Democratic Presidential candidate over a Republican one.\nThe American people didn’t give Democrats majority support so we could come back to Washington and play dead. They didn’t send us here to whimper, whine, or grovel. They sent us here to say NO to efforts to sell Congress to the highest bidder. They sent us here to stand up for what’s right. Now, they are watching, waiting, and hoping - hoping we show some spine and start fighting back when Congress completely ignores the message of the American people and returns to all its same old ways.\nRepublicans will control this government - but they cannot hand over that control to big corporations unless Democrats roll over and allow them to do so.\nIt is time for Democrats - Democrats and Republicans who should be ashamed by this kind of corruption -to make it clear who exactly they work for. Does the Senate work for big pharma that hires the lobbyists and makes the campaign contributions or does the Senate work for American people who actually sent us here.",

      "text": " Google+\nTsung-Lin Wu/ Fotolia\nBy Joan Fitzgerald November 28, 2016\nA s a candidate, Donald Trump vowed he would abandon the Paris Agreement, reverse President Obama’s climate initiatives, and bring back coal. As president-elect, he’s been more circumspect, but his appointment of climate-change denier Myron Ebell to head the transition at the EPA suggests he may try to make good on these promises.\nIf he does, the country needs a counterforce. That should come in the nation’s cities, where mayors have been far less polarized and often more creative than Washington in how they address climate change. Whether by transitioning to renewable energy, supporting smart grid development, pushing energy-efficient buildings, or supporting the infrastructure for electric vehicles, cities are already at the forefront of the fight. That’s because mayors of both parties know that climate action both improves the quality of life in their cities and creates economic opportunities.\nAdvertisement\nBurlington, Vt., has become the first US city to meet all its electricity needs from renewable sources. About one-fourth of the city’s power is from a city-owned wood-burning facility. For the rest, Burlington purchases wind power and hydro and uses landfill methane.\nAfter being leveled by a tornado in 2007, Greensburg, Kan., was rebuilt under the leadership of Republican Mayor Bob Dixon, with guidance from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, as a sustainable city powered completely by renewable energy from biogas, small-scale solar, and its own wind farm. Dixon, a member of a White House task force on climate change, frequently says that sustainable urban development transcends party lines.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning San Diego is the largest city in the country to commit to going 100 percent renewable, in this case by 2035. In May, Republican Mayor Kevin Faulconer released a budget that commits $127 million to climate-change projects. Faulconer, like Dixon, does not see climate action as a partisan issue.\nCleveland, with support from the Cleveland Foundation and others, has been trying to develop offshore wind turbines on Lake Erie since 2004. After many false starts, construction is beginning on Project Icebreaker, deploying a specially designed turbine that can free itself from ice that would otherwise lock it up in the winter months. Should this six-turbine farm on Lake Erie be successful, a new wind-powered energy grid could be developed along the southern shores of all the Great Lakes.\nOnshore wind power alone could supply more than 95 percent of Ohio’s electricity demand, according to the NREL. And there’s the potential for thousands of good jobs in the manufacturing supply chain for turbines and in their maintenance. The American Wind Energy Association estimates that Ohio could reap $57 million annually in property tax revenue and $26 million in lease payments to landowners by 2030 if wind power continues to develop.\nAdvertisement\nBut maintaining this progress has been a struggle. In 2014, Governor John Kasich signed legislation freezing the state’s push toward renewable energy adoption. A second Kasich-approved law increased the distance turbines must be located from abutting properties, which stopped the construction of 11 previously approved wind farms.\nAnd the going may get tougher; Ohio is one of several states where the Koch Brothers are pushing to undo legislation promoting renewable energy over fossil fuels.\nYet there could be some common ground on some projects. Trump seems serious about a major infrastructure initiative. Investing in a smart grid would be a great start. The nation’s current electrical grid is really a patchwork of grids that cannot communicate effectively, and have reached capacity. That must change if the grid is to handle increasing amounts of renewable energy. Another crucial need is for cities to protect themselves against sea-level rise and adopt green stormwater-management approaches. That challenge looms regardless of whether you believe climate change is naturally occurring or human-made.\nRepublicans are champions of local control. More than 1,000 mayors have signed on to the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, which commits them to urging the federal government to pass greenhouse gas-reduction legislation. On climate issues, mayors of both parties will be letting Trump know both the opportunities and the stakes. He would be wise to listen.\nJoan Fitzgerald is a professor of urban and public policy at Northeastern University. She is working on her next book, “Greenovation: Urban Leadership on Climate Change .”",

      "text": " Google+\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff/File\nMillennium Tower in Boston features multimillion-dollar luxury condos.\nBy Tim Logan Globe Staff November 29, 2016\nThe epic building boom that has added thousands of luxury housing units in the Boston area may have peaked, as a report to be released Tuesday by an influential foundation suggests the region has run out of customers willing to shell out huge sums in monthly rents.\nThe Boston Foundation says the number of permits for new housing units issued in Eastern Massachusetts is expected to fall by nearly 20 percent this year, the first decline since the most recent surge of construction began in 2011.\nAdvertisement\nHousing specialists attribute the drop-off to the higher end of the housing market, where units can rent for $3,000 a month or more in and around Boston. What’s not clear, they say, is if the slowdown is a blip or a longer-term shift at a time when the addition of new units was just starting to dampen rents across the market.\nThe city of Boston itself, for example, is predicting a strong year for new housing — much of it for middle-income residents.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. “We’ve satisfied very-high-end demand, and so the number of luxury buildings is slowing down,” said Barry Bluestone, a housing economist at Northeastern University and author of the Boston Foundation report. “We haven’t seen much [building for] the middle and lower ends of the market.”\nView Story Here’s who bought the Millennium Tower’s penthouse The buyer of the most expensive condominium in Boston is a South Shore boy turned billionaire.\nBoston reaches deal with Winthrop Square developer\nBluestone and others blame high development costs, including the prices for buildable land, and tight zoning rules as reasons for the limited construction of modestly priced housing in outer Boston neighborhoods and in many suburbs.\nYet in a region with a growing population of young renters, there’s still huge demand for moderately priced housing, said Rebecca Koepnick, director of neighborhoods and housing at the Boston Foundation.\nAdvertisement\n“A slowdown would not be good for the region,” Koepnick said. “This is where the rubber hits the road. Are people willing to accept extremely high housing prices, as opposed to making some of the changes that need to be made in terms of how and where we build?”\nThe drop in permits comes as rent increases have eased. The average monthly rent for an apartment in Greater Boston was $2,335 in October, according to the data firm Axiometrics. That was up 1 percent from a year earlier, the slowest rate of growth in 2&frac12; years.\nMany real estate specialists believe the thousands of new units that have come onto the market recently have kept rent increases in check, and that without more new supply the prices will start to rise again.\nThe foundation estimates that Eastern Massachusetts municipalities will issue 11,386 housing permits in 2016. That would be down 18 percent from 2015, which was the busiest year for Boston-area builders in a decade.\nStill, this year is on track to roughly match the strong construction numbers in 2014. And, in some places, officials see a backlog of buildings that are planned but not yet permitted.\nIn Boston, where Mayor Martin J. Walsh has made adding housing a top priority, building permits so far this year are down 42 percent from last year, with 2,683 through mid-November, compared to 4,608 in all of 2015.\nBut there are more than 5,000 units approved by the city that don’t yet have permits, said Boston’s housing chief, Sheila Dillon, including several large projects in outer neighborhoods that would be aimed at middle-income customers. If those projects go forward, as she expects many will, 2016 would wind up being another banner year.\n“Large investments have already been made in those developments,” Dillon said. “I’m not worried at this point.”\nStill, Dillon acknowledged the fine line that city officials must walk. They want to keep rents in check and produce new housing that more people can afford. But too much new construction could depress rents to the point that developers stop building.\n“We’re hoping to see rents and prices moderate,” she said. “But we’re also hoping that rents and prices remain high enough to make development work.”\nAnd any broader solution to high housing costs has to stretch far beyond Boston, said Clark Ziegler, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership.\nThe state needs to add 17,000 units a year over the next two decades just to keep up with estimated population growth, he said, mostly in Greater Boston. Yet in many suburban towns, new multi-family housing — at any price — is nearly nonexistent.\n“You see a relatively small number of cities accounting for most new housing production in the state,” he said. “It’s just not sustainable.”\nThat pushes builders into a relatively small handful of places, said Jay Doherty, the chief executive of Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, which has recently built middle-income apartments in Quincy and the Alewife section of Cambridge. Or it pushes them to build for the downtown Boston luxury market. But in many suburbs and city neighborhoods, demand far outstrips supply.\n“Sites get tougher. Permits get tougher. And the cost equation gets harder,” Doherty said.\n“It all gets tougher, so it’s not surprising to see some shrinkage in [housing] production.”\nRelated Billionaire investor buys Boston’s priciest condo It’s official: Winthrop Square Garage will be turned into one of Boston’s tallest towers\nTim Logan can be reached at tim.logan@globe.com .

Sign up here .\nThere are several theories as to why Donald Trump launched a tweetstorm over the weekend rehashing the results of the election he won.\nSome have suggested that he is trying to cook up controversy to distract from something devious going on or that he just loves a good conspiracy theory. However, the reporters talking to aides close to Trump suggest something much more innocent: Trump cannot let go of the idea that a recount in certain states is delegitimizing his future presidency.\nAdvertisement\nTrump tweeted several times over the weekend about the election results. For the most part, he seems to be upset about a recount in Wisconsin and the fact that Democrat Hillary Clinton is well over 2 million votes ahead of him in the popular vote. Neither of those points change the fact that Trump will be the next president.\nBut the biggest headscratcher tweet over the weekend involved Trump’s assertion that there was widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire, Virginia, and California, despite the fact there is no evidence of that anywhere. Further, Trump’s campaign didn’t lodge complaints in those states, nor did he seek recounts.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. What this does tell us is that a Trump presidency may be a distracted one. Being president means a crisis on nearly every front, nearly every day, but Trump might be tweeting about personal slights from members of Congress or world leaders.\nIt is particularly rich, however, that Trump, who once led the birther movement, is suddenly upset about others questioning the legitimacy of his win, especially since it was such a strong win.\nRelated Trump claims, with no evidence, that ‘millions of people’ voted illegally Trump claims voter fraud in NH, provides no evidence\nJames Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com .

      "text": "The same slick screensaver that brightens up unused screens with popular Google+ photos on the Pixel , Chromecast and Google Fiber devices is now available to keep your Mac occupied as well. With the newly released Featured Photos screensaver, you can finally turn your Mac into a photography gallery featuring some of the most highly rated shots from Alphabet's oft-overlooked social network.\nAccording to Google, you'll get a different photo on every screen connected to your Mac, so your ridiculous 5k monitor setup will be more like a posh gallery than a posh desktop work environment. The app only pulls from publicly shared, high-res photos that don't feature people, so you can expect a lot of tranquil nature and soothing landscape photos. Google also helpfully includes the photographer's username so you can track them down to check out more of their work.\nIf you're on Android, Google's earlier Wallpapers app will also let you set your phone to shuffle through the same set of popular photos on the home or lock screen. And if you're a budding photographer trying to get your work in front of the thousands of screensaver users out there, you just need to follow these guidelines and then post a picture that gets a lot of +1s. If you find yourself short on Google+ friends, Google product manager Neil Inala wrote in his blog post that joining the company's Google+ Create program will also give you a leg up.",

      "text": "Google Unveils a 3-Decade Time-Lapse of the Earth\nBy Jeffrey Kluger \nIt doesn’t pay to take your eyes off the Earth for a second. Look away even briefly and who know what it will get up to?\nThat’s not how things usually seem to human beings living on the surface of the planet. The mountain that’s here today ought to be here tomorrow. The river that meanders along the boundary of your state or your nation will be meandering into the future. If you were in orbit, however, things would look very different—especially if you were in orbit for a few decades at a time. Since 1972, the Landsat satellites—a rotating fleet of four different spacecraft—have kept exactly that kind of long-term vigil, circling the Earth and scanning the surface for the incremental ways the human population is changing the only home it’s got. They’ve been aided since 2015 by the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Program and its Sentinel-2A satellite. \nIn the years all of the satellites have been flying they’ve taken millions upon millions of high-definition images, which NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have collated and assembled into something of a flip book that reveals the slow but steady alteration of our world. What the two science agencies started, the folks at Google have finished, turning the usually choppy, sometimes-hazy images into smoothly streaming videos, revealing decades of topographic changes in 10-second sweeps . (Click for source material ).\nThose brief glimpses belie the extraordinary amount of computer-engineering muscle that went into making the mini-movies possible. The Google Earth Engine team worked with more than 5.4 million discrete images taken since 1984, and gave each one individual attention . In some, cloud cover had to be scrubbed away; in others missing pixels had to be filled in. In all of the images, there were plenty of those pixels to attend to. The average high-definition TV image is made of about 300,000 individual points of light. The Google time-lapse images pack 3.95 trillion pixels into a single frame.\nIn 2013, TIME released the first round of Google time-lapse images—revealing the growing sprawl of Las Vegas, the boomtown that is Dubai, the slow death of Alaska’s Columbia glacier. This year we turn our attention elsewhere. In some of those new sites, the changes have been positive ones—the expansion of the Panama Canal, say, as the greatest engineering feat of the 20th century was updated and improved for the 21st.\nIn other places, the story is more mixed: the new Jirau Dam, spanning Brazil’s Madeira River, may be an unalloyed good for the people who will have new or improved electrical service, but it’s less good for the villages that were uprooted and the 1,400 miles of jungle that were strung with electrical cables to make the project possible. Still elsewhere the story is one of disaster—as it was in Fukushima, Japan, where a 2011 tsunami deluged a nuclear power plant, endangering millions.\nIt’s an undeniable achievement that we can keep such a close, sharp eye on our world. It will be even more to our credit, however, if that ability leads us to care more for the world too.\n \n",

      "text": "Google has rolled out a new doodle to celebrate what would have been the 184th birthday of Louisa May Alcott , the beloved U.S. author who penned the classic children’s novel, Little Women .\nAlcott, a suffragist, abolitionist and feminist as well as a writer, was born in Pennsylvania in 1832. She volunteered as a nurse during the American Civil War and was active in the women’s suffrage movement; she became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Mass.\nAs a novelist, Little Women was her first success. The book is a semi-autobiographical account of the lives of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy March, from childhood to womanhood. Written in two parts in 1880, the novel was so successful initially that it sold out and it has remained a popular children’s classic more than 100 years later.\nThe Google doodle, designed by Sophie Diao, portrays the sisters, as well as Jo’s best friend Laurie, their neighbor.\n",

      "text": "Google researchers got an eye-scanning algorithm to figure out on its own how to detect a common form of blindness, showing the potential for artificial intelligence to transform medicine remarkably soon.\nThe algorithm can look at retinal images and detect diabetic retinopathy—which affects almost a third of diabetes patients—as well as a highly trained ophthalmologist can. It makes use of the same machine-learning technique that Google uses to label millions of Web images.\nDiabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to blood vessels in the eye and results in a gradual deterioration of vision. If caught early it can be treated, but a sufferer may experience no symptoms early on, making screening vital. It is diagnosed, in part, by having an expert examine images of a patient’s retina, captured with a specialized device, for signs of bleeding and fluid leakage.\nSome form of automated detection could make the diagnosis more efficient and reliable, and could be especially useful in regions where the required expertise is scarce. “One of the most intriguing things about this machine-learning approach is that it has potential to improve the objectivity and ultimately the accuracy and quality of medical care,” says Michael Chiang , a professor of ophthalmology and a clinician at Oregon Health & Science University’s Casey Eye Institute.\nAI has had mixed success in medicine in the past. Systems that use a database of knowledge to offer advice have been shown to outperform doctors in some settings, but there has been limited uptake. Still, the power of machine learning—especially a technique known as deep learning, may make AI more common in the future (see “ 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning ”). A team at Google DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet focused entirely on AI, is doing similar work , training computers to process optical coherence tomography scans for signs of macular degeneration and other eye disease in collaboration with researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London (see “ DeepMind’s First Medical Research Gig Will Use AI to Diagnose Eye Disease ”).\nThis retinal-image research, published Tuesday, marked the first time a paper about deep learning has appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association , according to the journal’s editor-in-chief, Howard Bauchner.\nThe paper’s authors, comprised of computer scientists at Google and medical researchers from the U.S. and India, developed an algorithm to analyze retinal images. But unlike existing ophthalmology software, it was not explicitly programmed to recognize features in images that might indicate the disease. It simply looked at thousands of healthy and diseased eyes, and figured out for itself how to spot the condition.\nThe researchers created a training set of 128,000 retinal images classified by at least three ophthalmologists. After the algorithm had been trained, the researchers tested its performance on 12,000 images and found that it matched or exceeded the performance of experts in identifying the condition and grading its severity.\nThe Google researchers collaborated with scientists at the Aravind Medical Research Foundation in India, where a clinical trial involving real patients is ongoing. This project involves patients receiving a normal consultation, but their images are also fed into the deep-learning system for comparison. Lily Peng, a researcher at Google and a medical doctor who was involved with the project, says results from this trial are not yet ready for publication.\nDeep learning could be applied in many different areas of medicine that rely on image analysis, such as radiology and cardiology. But one of the biggest challenges will be to provide convincing evidence that the systems are reliable. Brendan Frey , a professor at the University of Toronto who applies deep learning to genomic data, warns that researchers will need to develop machine-learning systems that are capable of explaining how they reached a particular conclusion (see “AI’s Language Problem” ).\nPeng, of Google, says this is something her team is already working on. “We understand that explaining will be very important,” she says.\nLearn more about machine learning at EmTech Digital 2017.\nRegister now",

      "text": "print \nEric Schmidt REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach \nGoogle has now banned its infamous brain teaser interview questions. And that's probably a good thing, because if Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt had been asked them when he interviewed all those years ago, he might have been dinged some points for struggling to come up with the answer. \nSchmidt was speaking at an usual conference called \"Summit at Sea,\" in which attendees cruise together for three days on a ship in international waters, reports Quartz's Olivia Goldhill. And one of the questions Schmidt was asked was this: You’re the captain of a pirate ship and you find a chest of gold. Your crew gets to vote on how the gold is divided up. If fewer than half of the pirates agree with you, you die. How do you recommend apportioning the gold in such a way that you get a good share of the booty but still survive. \nSchmidt hemmed and hawed, asked for the question to be repeated, asked if he could ask clarifying questions and then came up with this answer: \n“Let’s do the math…if half die. No, if I die… No, if they don’t like me, I die. This is, like, a really bad question. ... It seems to me that if more than half are happy, I survive. I propose, that we give 49% of the pirates stock in internet companies, and 51% get the gold.\" \nDespite the kvetching and complaining about the question, he actually did come up with the \"correct\" answer, which is to give the pirates 51% of the gold and keep the other 49% for himself. \nHowever, we'd argue that giving away 51% is still pretty risky depending on how many people in the crew there are. If a large crowd is effectively sharing half the gold while the captain keeps half for himself, that's not exactly booty income equality and can lead to resentment. The crew may then be tempted to elect a captain that promises to make the boat great again. \nSo it says something about Schmidt's psyche that he wanted to double down and secure his life by giving the pirates stock in internet companies, too. In the Valley, it seems anyone who has access to gold has access to stock in internet companies. The life-saving questions really is: which company? Google stock? Probably save your life. Yahoo? Get the plank. \nBy the way, here are some other other brain teaser interview questions Google used to ask: How many golf balls can fit in a school bus? How many piano tuners are there in the entire world? Why are manhole covers round? How many times a day does a clock’s hands overlap? Explain the significance of \"dead beef\" ",

      "text": "Google's training AI to catch diabetic blindness before it's too late The disease is treatable but only if it is discovered in time. Share Save \nDiabetes is no joke, regardless of what Wilford Brimley memes you've seen. The disease's associated foot ulcers can lead to amputation of the limb while diabetic retinopathy (DR) can rob people of their sight. Some 415 million diabetics worldwide are at risk of this visual affliction and many of those living with it in the developing world lack sufficient health care access to treat it. That's why Google is training its deep learning AI to spot DR before it becomes a problem -- and without the help of an on-site doctor. \nSince the disease is most readily diagnosed by examining a picture of the back of the eye, the Google team has spent the past few years developing a dataset of 128,000 individual images, each examined by 3-7 ophthalmologists from a panel of 54. By marking damaged areas of the eye -- microaneurysms, hemorrhages and the like -- and then feeding that data into a machine learning system, Google managed to build a highly reliable diagnostic tool. When tested with 12,000 images, the system's diagnosis was \"on-par with that of ophthalmologists\" according to the Google Research Blog post. \nThe team hopes to expand the scope of this system to be able to diagnose the disease from more complex 3D images (those generated from Optical Coherence Tomography) in addition to the conventional 2D fundus photographs that it currently uses. The team is also looking into automating the diagnostic process to better serve patients in remote locations who might otherwise not have access to trained specialists. But first, Google will need to conduct studies using larger clinical groups and, eventually, obtain FDA approval.",

The massive update added petabytes of new data and brings it up to the current year. \nDetailing the update in a blog post, Google says updated images are sharper 'with truer colors and fewer distracting artifacts.' Earth Timelapse was introduced in 2013 and includes images recorded as early as 1984.\nBasically, Google's Earth Timelapse presents users with 33 interactive images of the entire planet, but creating those images was a feat – Google says it sifted through 3 quadrillion pixels to maximize image quality. The final product represents 25,000,000 overlapping global image tiles that users can zoom in, zoom out, play and replay to their heart's content.\nCheck it out for yourself and see how the world has changed over the past three decades.",

      "title": "We Quit Facebook and Google to Build a Children’s Book Startup",
      "text": "By Eric Bahn November 29, 2016 \nThe story of my startup, Read Your Story , begins on a warm summer evening in July 2015, when my family was having dinner over at my sister’s house in Palo Alto, California. \nWhile we were enjoying some wine, we watched our kids play in the backyard. As we were chatting, the conversation at some point turned to how much we loved storytime with our kids, since it’s an opportunity to bond and escape technology. \nLike many other parents, we were concerned about limiting “screen time” for our own children. \nThe iPhone and iPad are magnificent devices, but they are also far too convenient as tools for zoning out unruly kids when we need a moment of peace. \nMy sister Jeanette — then a marketer at Google — asked an interesting question: is it possible to make books that are more engaging than an iPad for young kids? \nWe started to brainstorm and began to share some interesting observations about young children. We consistently noticed kids get excited when they see their own name in print, and also when they see pictures of themselves. \nWhy couldn’t we merge names and pictures into storybooks? \nFrom this dinner followed several weeks of research, where my sister and I were surprised to discover that there were surprisingly few personalized children’s book companies that merged faces and names into books. \nAnd the ones that existed were poor quality. We decided that we could do better. \nAs an experiment, we committed to a short-run book test to validate market demand. \nAt the time, I was working at Facebook as a product manager and wasn’t ready to leave my job. \nWe kept this project on a slow and steady burn as a side project. Validating the Concept Through a First Run \nAfter brainstorming a few book concepts, we decided to go with an “ABC” book, since it was a straightforward and popular book format for parents. \nJeanette ran some hefty diligence through her network and was able to connect with Donna — an incredible children’s book illustrator who brought our book to life. Donna later became our third co-founder. \nThe goal for our first run wasn’t to make money, but to validate directional product/market fit. \nWe committed to making 50 books. \nWhen we were ready to launch our test in October, we had a really solid product to test with — but a terrible user experience. \nI constructed a crude SquareSpace website that featured an awful shopping experience. \nIf you wanted to buy a book, you had to: Fill out a form with your child’s details, shipping details, and your email. Give us your credit card information to make a purchase. Our team would see the order and then email the customer soliciting a photo of their child. Upon receiving the customer’s photo, our team would manually crop the face into each page of the book. Finally, the book was sent to a printer and drop-shipped to the customer. \nEach book took 3 hours to create in Photoshop. \nThere was a ton of manual drawing that was required for every page of the book — it turns out that masking artificial hair on top of a real face is quite challenging! \nAfter creating a customer’s book, we would then export a high-quality PDF and upload it to Blurb.com, a really great but expensive photo book tool. \nWe sold each book for $35 on our website, and Blurb would then charge us $45 to print and deliver. \nMost importantly, my sister and I wanted to get unbiased data that real people wanted our books. Consequently, we didn’t let any friends know about our project. We shared news of these books to lists and parent groups under aliases. \nWe also ran some light Facebook ads to drive brand awareness and a little direct response. We purposely held off on being too aggressive with marketing. \nWe wanted to see what customers would do with the books. \nFortunately, the reaction was really positive, even with the poor user experience. Our customers shared our site and told their friends, and much of our sales turned out to be organic via word of mouth. \nNo profit was made from this test run , but we were able to prove some demand for our idea. How to get 6,000 customer signups before you launch \nAfter our successful mini-run test, we decided to proceed with testing a more scalable version of our business. But first we wanted to build a customer list to further validate demand. \nEven before fingers touch code to develop your cool new business, I’m a big believer that you have to determine market validation so that you can sell your product. \nList building is one of the best levers to both validate product/market fit, as well as line up customers from day one. \nThe co-founders at Read Your Story had a strong gut-feel that our customized children’s books would be received well in the market. However, we were starting a brand from scratch. How the hell were we going to validate scalability for our business? \nFor us, we did that through Facebook ads. Step 1: Get Likes to your Facebook Page \nWe kicked things off by setting up a simple Facebook page. \nA nice logo, nice cover image, and a few cute posts. Then, we launched a Facebook ad campaign that was optimized for people to like our Page. \nI’m a former Facebook Ads product manager, and do not generally recommend optimizing for Likes \nBasically what happens when you do this is that the audience that Facebook targets focuses more on people who are ‘Like-y’. \nThat is, you’ll get people who just tend to Like everything that they see. Thus, the audience that you attract via these kinds of campaigns may not be a true signal of actual people who are interested in your product, but it is at least some rough signal. \nDidn’t matter for me though. My primary focus was a single number: 100. \nI wanted to put together a rough audience that had a general interest in my company, and aggregate 100 of these people. \nOnce I hit that number, I would then be able to run a Lookalike audience off those fans (you need a minimum of 100 fans to run Lookalike ads). Step 2: Run Better & Better Lookalikes \nLookalikes are your best friend. \nThe basic idea here is that you can upload a custom audience list to Facebook, and the Facebook algorithm will parse commonalities among those people and extrapolate thousands or up to millions of ‘similar’ people who match the profile of folks on that list. \nLookalikes is an extremely powerful tool that Facebook offers its advertisers. In my opinion, it is one of the very best ways to target high-intent customers for your business. \nSo as I was developing the ads, I was constantly re-building my Lookalikes until they got to the point where I had some awesome customers to target. \nFirst it started with running a Lookalike against fans of my Facebook Page. It was crude, but the fan signal was enough to get started. \nI started running ads against that initial fan list and sent people into a landing page to sign up for our pre-launch. In the early days, it worked out to be around $5 per sign up. \nThen, once I got to 100 people who signed up for my pre-launch via my landing page, I uploaded that list of people to Facebook as a custom audience and created another Lookalike audience from it. \nThis was a much better audience to build from (since they were fans who opted to give their email), and I began running ads against this audience. The sign up rate improved and I was paying about $2 per sign up. \nI kept this process going to run ads, get more signups, build new custom audiences, create new lookalikes — until I got to the point where signups cost me well under $1 per email and my targeting became very effective. Step 3: Don’t Ignore the Landing Page \nOptimizing for better Lookalike audiences is really important for Facebook Ads, but the cheapest way to get there is to have a stellar landing page. \nI made almost 20 permutations of our landing pages during my ad tests, and ultimately a few obvious lessons emerged that allowed me to achieve up to a 28% signup rate. A picture is worth a thousand words – Invest in good creative that tells your company story or explains your product. Big freaking sign-up field and button – Bigger the better. Keep it simple – Less on the page is better, don’t distract from people signing up. \nI made all of our landing pages using a great WYSIWYG website platform called Webflow. Drafting these pages took no time at all with this tool. \nPre-launch landing pages aren’t an area where you need to invest in real tech, even SquareSpace or Weebly is sufficient at this stage. \nNow that you have your big list, launch! \nAfter running the process described above, we built our list to about 6,000 customer sign-ups. \nIt’s been a few weeks since we’ve launched and we’ve enjoyed brisk sales, thanks in large part to the wonderful pre-launch list that we built. \nThis list is going to be a big part of our marketing efforts moving forward, and I look forward to growing it to over 100K subscribers in the coming year. \nOur method of growing our list wasn’t cheap — it cost us north of $5,000, but we are able to offset that cost now through book sales. Remember, these emails are worth a lot more than the cost of obtaining them if you can set up a funnel that converts. \nThe most important role that the pre-launch list played for our team was validating product/market fit. It was satisfying and motivating for our team to see how easy it was to gather customer emails as we were developing our product. \nWhile we were building our list and building our product, we’d also enjoy frequently receiving a customer e-mail asking about when we’d go live. The customer queries supercharged our team and made us feel accountable to ship an awesome product from day one. Where We Are Today \nWe are now a team of seven: 3 co-founders, 3 engineers, and 1 web designer. And our business is ready to scale. \nWe have built technology to allow parents to create their own books on our site, as well as invested in automation for order processing, quality assurance, printing, and delivery. I feel confident that we can fulfill thousands of orders per month easily, even with our tiny team. \nIn the past few months, my sister left Google and I left Facebook to open up more bandwidth on this project. We look forward to scaling out our business with even more titles and custom products in the coming year. More:",

      "text": "Former comms for Facebook, Google, UN, SpaceX. 9 mins ago The Minister of Magic gets a briefing on Donald Trump The Ministry of Magic, Whitehall, London Wilfred Pemberton had been Minister of Magic for six years now. Some days on the job were still dreadfully hard. After a marathon day of meetings, he was in desperate need of a drink and a nap. “I need a drink and a nap” he proclaimed to his empty, mahogany-paneled office. Lifting a glittering crystal decanter from the desk, he poured himself a generous helping of Dwarvish Firewhisky and put his feet up on the desk. He narrowly avoided a towering stack of official papers that a Voges Self-Writing Quill was diligently working its way through. He sipped his firewhisky and enjoyed the contented silence, broken only by the cracking of the logs in the enormous fireplace. Suddenly there was a loud rap at the door. The Minister sighed. “ Come .” News from the Muggle nations The enormous paneled door boomed open and a slightly disheveled man in a rumpled looking suit entered. “Evening Minister” said the man, crossing the room with a brisk stride. “I have something important for your attention.” It was Lachlan Green, the youngish Under-Secretary of Muggle Affairs. Green had previously spent several years undercover in key Muggle political and economic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. He was considered to be one of the wizarding world’s leading experts on Muggles, and the author of the definitive text on their television device ( Understanding the Muggles’ Haunted Bo x, Weasley Publishing, 2014). “Hello, Green” said Pemberton. “Bit late for you to stop by. Another war? One of those Pokemon demons to show me again? If you brought more episodes of Westworld , I can make time.” Green shook his head. “No, sir. It’s about the Muggles’ new American President.” Pemberton’s brow furrowed. “Clinton? What’s she up to? Has she moved all her stuff into the White House yet? Let’s send an elf to speed things up. The usual courtesy.” Green laughed nervously. “Sir, I know you’ve got a lot of other matters on your plate, so you probably didn’t see the owl… Donald Trump won the election.” The Minister’s mouth fell open. The crackling of logs in the fireplace suddenly seemed a lot louder. “Ridiculous!” exclaimed the Minister. He swung his legs off the table and thumped his drink down on a coaster. “I read the files on both of them. The Muggles never had a clearer choice! Were they all under a Confundus charm? Green, if this was Grindelwald’s fanatics again-” Pemberton was almost yelling now. The coaster began scuttling away with his drink, anxious to get away from the flecks of spittle flying across the table. Green cut the Minister off. “Sir, there are a bunch of reasons why Trump won, and we can get into that if you like. Looks like the only dark wizard who interfered in the election was Vladimir Putin. But I thought you’d like to know some of the things the new President is proposing.” Pemberton scowled and snatched his drink back from the fleeing coaster. “Ridiculous!” Ridiculous Green took a deep breath and launched into a recitation of points. “Trump had said he wants to build a wall across their border with Mexico. He also wants to deport several million immigrants.” Pemberton scoffed. “Unless Trump has a Deporto spell, I don’t see how he’s going to accomplish the latter. The former could be done, but why bother? Have walls ever worked for the Muggles?” Green shook his head vigorously. “It appears that President-Elect Trump doesn’t read a lot of history. I understand he spends a lot of his free time on Twitter.” “What is Twitter?” “It’s a sort of virtual room where you get messages from strangers. Their celebrities like to post things in it, and then fans re-post them. Sometimes people pick on each other there. The President-Elect seems to be particularly good at this.” The Minister had a quizzical expression on his face. “Seems like a bizarre use of time. Certainly not worth staying up late for. What else is he proposing when he’s not on Twitter?” Green consulted his notes. “He wants to normalize relations with the Russians, and proposes letting them have a free hand in Syria.” The Minister’s eyes narrowed. “Is he still proposing to defend democracy? NATO? And is he going to do anything about the refugee crisis? I have told the Muggle governments that I will give them one more year to figure out this obscenity. 65 million refugees in the world!” Green looked weary. “I am afraid not sir. He doesn’t appear to have a coherent foreign policy, and his campaign was largely based on inciting fear of immigrants, refugees and outsiders. I can’t imagine we’re going to see any useful solutions here.” The Minister sighed heavily and took a deep drink. “Ridiculous. What else?” “Um…scrapping the healthcare reforms of the current President, and cutting coverage for 22 million people.” The Minister glowered and picked his wand off the desk. “Ridiculous” he muttered, more to himself this time, as he began to fiddle with the wand. “He’s also appointed what many people believe is a white supremacist as an advisor. Oh, and he appears to already be using his position to enrich the Trump business empire.” The Minister was focusing on the wand now. Green finished off. “And…he also appears to be preparing to pull out of the Muggles’ global climate change accords. He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.” There was a flash of light. In his rage, the Minister had accidentally turned his whisky glass into a Kneazle. The half-cat/half-lion creature meowed and disappeared across the room. The Minister looked furious but determined as he stood and watched his former whisky glass retreat. “Very well then, Green. It looks like we’ll have to go save the world again.” This is our world Green looked at the Minister. “What are you proposing we do, sir?” The Minister stared into the fire. “We must do everything in our power to stand up for the values and policies that will continue to preserve peace, democracy and openness, in the face of a man who clearly places little stock in any of these things.” Green shuffled his notes nervously. “Sir, I understand you are upset about the election and I agree Trump is not the optimal leader. But why should we play a part in this struggle? Things will work out. This isn’t our fight anyway. If we just wait 4 years…” Pemberton turned to look Green intently in the face — and there was not a hint of doubt about his resolve. “My friend, too many times in history have good men and women been given the chance to confront a great danger. And each time, in spite of all the warning signs given to them, they chose to continue with their lives as normal. Because the great danger did not affect them immediately — and they hoped it would pass quickly, like a summer rainstorm. Later, they always look back and wonder why they didn’t dare to speak up or act. All my life, I have wondered what I would do if confronted with a similar situation — haven’t you? If we believe in any sense of morality, and if we believe that freedom and a good life should belong to more than just the people like us, then we must go to their defense on principle. And if we believe the challenges that face the world can only be solved by all of us working together, then we cannot retreat from the world. It would be nice if all the problems facing us today were just the stuff of fantasy. But this is the world we live in now. This is not someone else’s problem. If we’re not going to stand up for what is right, just because it is hard, then what is the point of having power or principles at all?” Across the room, the Kneazle meowed its assent.",

Dr. Google may check your eyes in the future 0 \nDr. Google could check your eyes in the future. Photo by Sergei Konkov/TASS \nDr. Google might be your next ophthalmologist. \nThe search giant said Tuesday it had trained a deep-learning algorithm to spot signs of diabetic retinopathy in patients. It does this in a manner similar to eye specialists by checking pictures of the back of the eye for signs of the disease. \nGoogle worked with a team of doctors in India and the US to create a dataset of 128,000 images and used them to train the to train a deep neural network -- computers wired like the brain -- to detect diabetic retinopathy. The results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , were on par with a panel of board-certified ophthalmologists. \nThe algorithm could help patients get in front of doctors more quickly in the future, Google said, adding that more work was necessary before it could be used widely. \n\"Automated, highly accurate screening methods have the potential to assist doctors in evaluating more patients and quickly routing those who need help to a specialist,\" Dr. Lily Peng said in a blog post. \"We hope this study will be one of many examples to come demonstrating the ability of machine learning to help solve important problems in healthcare.\" \nDiabetic retinopathy afflicts people with diabetes and can lead to blindness. It affects blood vessels in the retina and is the most common cause of vision loss among diabetics, according to the National Institutes of Health. \nThis isn't Google's first foray into eye care. In 2014, the company teamed up with Switzerland's Novartis to develop smart contact lenses . Share your voice",

The company announced today it has made some improvements to the backend that will allow it to find and take down those kinds of reviews.\nSee also: How to get a refund for apps purchased from the Google Play Store September 6, 2016 A few weeks ago, Google announced it would be going after apps who generate a lot of recorded installs through fraudulent means . Today, the company said that actual fake reviews, or reviews that have been created by people who have been paid to do so, will be identified and removed from the Play Store. Obviously, Google does not want to reveal exactly how it is making these removal decisions.\nThe company also mentioned once again that any Android apps in the Play Store must abide by its Developer Policy. That means app reviews must come from people who have actually used the app they are writing about, and that those users should not have been paid or given any other incentives to write their review. In this era where “fake news” has now become a buzzword, it’s a relief to know that Google is trying its best to keep reviews of apps in the Play Store honest.",

      "title": "Google Chrome Extension Swaps 'Alt-Right' with 'White Supremacy'",
      "text": "Screengrab via trendthetruth/Instagram BTW \nA new Google Chrome extension called “ Stop Normalizing the Alt Right ” is automatically replacing any mention of “ alt-right ” with “white supremacy.” \nWhite nationalists branded as the alt-right have risen to widespread prominence thanks to their outspoken support for President-elect Donald Trump , whose vows to deport undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims from entering the United States invigorated their quest to maintain white supremacy in the U.S. \nCreated by George Zola, an advertising professional, the goal of the Chrome extension is to stop sugar coating a term, widely used in the media during the 2016 election , that has a much deeper and more dangerous meaning. \n“I don’t want this term to be sugar coated, I want it to instantly make [people] recoil in the same way most recoil when thinking of white supremacists or white nationalists groups,” Zola told the Huffington Post . “They’re scary, dangerous, and it’s important we stop the normalization of this before it gets out of hand. History shows us how quickly these movements can spiral out of control.” \nZola's extension, launched on Nov. 17, joins the Associate Press, which on Monday warned journalists not to use “alt-right” without defining what it means because “the term may exist primarily as a public-relations device to make its supporters’ actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience.”",

      "text": "Google timelapses offer a 32-year look at Earth's history Google Earth Timelapse highlights both ever-changing nature and urban sprawl. Share Save \nAs static as it may seem, Earth is a lively planet that changes almost constantly -- and Google just offered a clever way to see that development with your own eyes. In a partnership with Time , it's introducing a dramatically improved version of Google Earth Timelapse that provides animated satellite imagery covering 32 years, going back to 1984 (4 years earlier than before). It uses the higher-resolution maps you saw in June to provide a look that's both more detailed and more seamless than before, with fewer abrupt changes in color and quality. There's also more to look at in the first place thanks to both added legacy satellite data and info from newer orbiters. \nThe resulting views help illustrate activity on Earth in a way that isn't apparent just by staring at static maps. You can see glaciers retreat in Antarctica, rivers reroute in Tibet, and tar sand mining expand in Canada. It's easy to see cities grow, too. Is this pure eye candy for most people? You bet. However, the hope is that this could also shine a light on environmental issues like climate change and urban sprawl. If you can witness humanity's long-term effect on Earth in a matter of seconds, you might be more inclined to do something about it.",

The new version’s major addition is just for the very few smartphone owners who have Android 7.1 Nougat installed, as it adds the GIF keyboard to the app.\nSee also: This is Nougat on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 1 day ago The GIF keyboard made its debut in the Android 7.1 Developer Preview a few weeks ago on Google’s Messenger app . The addition of the same keyboard in Hangouts 15.0 will apparently not work for Google Voice messages in the app, according to 9to5Google. Aside from that new feature, the only other thing about Hangouts 15.0 is the fixing of a bug from 14.0 that was showing the sender of a single person’s name twice in notifications.\n\nAgain, this update for Hangouts has apparently just started rolling out in the Google Play Store, so it may take a few days to reach all Android users. If you happen to have both this update and Android 7.1 Nougat installed, what do you think of the addition of the GIF keyboard?\nGet it at Google Play ",
