      "text": "print \nBy Julia Love \nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV.

      "text": "The days of having to enter your cable account login details into every individual TV app on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV are coming to an end — maybe. Depending on who you get your cable from. As MacRumors notes , today Apple rolled out its single sign-on feature for iOS, which lets users enter account details (for participating cable providers) just once and then be automatically signed into TV Everywhere apps. Here’s Apple’s help page that explains the feature and how to enable it. \nRight now, that list of providers is limited to the following cable and satellite companies:\nCenturyLink Prism DirecTV Dish GTA GVTC Hawaiian Telcom Hotwire MetroCast Sling TV Apple’s missing some big names here: Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter, and Optimum are all absent from the launch list. Apple expects to add more cable providers over the coming weeks and months. It’s at least got satellite pretty well covered with DirecTV, Dish, and Sling TV. (The new DirecTV Now service does not yet appear to be supported.) \nTo make matters a little more confusing, single sign-on only works for certain apps — and even then, sometimes only the iOS or Apple TV version. Here’s which ones support the feature on day one:\nAgain, there are a lot of important apps that people like missing, such as ABC, CBS, Disney, WatchESPN, HBO Go, and many others. This one’s up to the networks and their app developers to fix if they want to. No one’s being required to add single sign-on to their software; it’s strictly a convenience thing. And with those omissions, Apple acknowledges that right now you’ll still be entering login info repeatedly. Even all these months after the feature was first announced . Sigh. It’s a start, I suppose.",

Two lower courts have already ruled in Apple's favour on design-patent infringement.\n\n*Read more:* What Apple boss Tim Cook told staff after Trump's election win\n\nToday’s ruling is only the latest skirmish in a never-ending patent war between the two tech giants and no one expects it to end here. \n\nIn 2012 jurors found that 11 smartphone models made by Samsung infringed Apple’s design patents.\n\nApple argued it was entitled to the total profits on Samsung’s infringing products while Samsung said the design was only one component of complex devices and it shouldn’t have to hand over all of its profits on the phones.\n\n*Read more: *Will Samsung be able to bounce back from its Galaxy Note 7 PR disaster?\n\nThe Supreme Court said an appeals court used the wrong analysis when it ruled for Apple and its decision to focus only on the end product sold to consumers was \"too narrow\".",

A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile ... more > View Comments Print By Ken Shepherd - The Washington Times - Tuesday, December 6, 2016 \nSmartphone manufacturer Samsung scored a victory Tuesday in its ongoing battle with Apple when the U.S. Supreme Court vacated a $399 million judgment due to Apple for infringement. \nThe decision could save the South Korean company millions of dollars in damages it owes the California-based Apple stemming from a patent lawsuit, CNET.com reported . \nAt issue in the case, argued in October before the high court, was interpretation of what federal patent law means when it refers to an “article of manufacture.” \nThe court unanimously ruled that damages in patent infringement cases need not be calculated on the finished product, in this case a smartphone, but rather based on the component parts which were found to infringe on patents. \nThe case will now return to a lower court to hash out how much Samsung should pay, an amount that will likely go down in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision. \nAt least one tech industry leader has cheered the ruling. \n“This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,” Ed Black , CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said in a statement, CNET reported.

      "text": "  Apple's Support Site Now Lets Customers Schedule Repairs at Apple Authorized Providers Tuesday December 6, 2016 1:33 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple recently made a quiet update to its Apple Support site , introducing a new feature that allows customers to find and schedule repairs for iPhones, Macs, and iPads from Apple Authorized Service Providers. When troubleshooting a product, choosing \"Bring in for Repair\" after going through Apple's support prompts now brings up all repair centers near a customer, including Apple's own retail stores and retail locations where customers can get repairs from Apple Authorized Service Providers. In addition to including all nearby Apple Authorized Service Providers, the new repair site also lists availability, so customers can find the fastest repairs and get same-day service in many locations. There's even an option to book a repair right from the site. Most of the time, getting a repair appointment at an Apple Store's Genius Bar requires a wait of several days to a week, while Apple Authorized Service Providers have much more open availability. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, local Apple Stores do not have repair appointments until next week, but third-party repair shops like Best Buy, Clickaway, Mobile Kangaroo, and Computercare have appointments today or tomorrow. Apple Authorized Service Providers have been officially authorized by Apple to perform repairs on Apple devices. Both AppleCare repairs and out-of-warranty repair services are available, but many customers may not be aware of local options outside of an Apple Store. Apple's new focus on third-party service providers may provide some much-needed relief for Apple retail stores that are unable to keep up with repair requests and it will ensure customers are able to get faster service.",

      "text": "\"Ambient Air Quality\" Caused iPhone 6s Shutdown: Apple (AAPL, SSNLF) By Rakesh Sharma | December 6, 2016 — 1:27 PM EST \nApple Inc. ( AAPL ) has provided an explanation for the failure of iPhone 6s batteries. In a statement posted on its website this morning, the Cupertino company claimed that a battery component exposure to “controlled ambient air” longer than necessary was responsible for the problem. \nAs readers will recall, batteries for the company’s smartphones have been shutting down unexpectedly across the world. Apple claims that the problem affects only a small number of phones manufactured between September 2015 and October 2015 and has launched a worldwide program to replace such batteries for affected users. However, Chinese authorities have said that the problem is more widespread and affects a number of smartphone models made by the company. (See also: iPhones Shut Down Unexpectedly Due To Battery Problems ). \nIn its statement today, Apple addressed such claims. It said the shutdowns occurred “in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics.” It did not clarify the purpose or reason for its phone to take such an action. The company also said that it was adding a diagnostic capability in an iOS software update to be released next week. “This will allow us to gather information over the coming weeks which may potentially help us improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown,” it stated. (See also: iPhone Battery Bug Angers Consumers ). \nApple’s alacrity in attempting to resolve the issue and its reassurance to customers is not surprising. Given rival Samsung Electronics Ltd.’s ( SSNLF ) problems with exploding phones recently, Apple may be eager to avoid a similar dust up for its phones. That said, the company has been beset with a number security-related software flaws in relation to its phones earlier this year. Some have even blamed the company’s latest operating system update, which seems to have triggered the shutdown problem, for the issue.

      "text": " count=\"178\" data-total-count=\"178\">WASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Samsung may not have to give up $399 million in profits for copying parts of the distinctive look of Apple ’s iPhone. A federal law says that companies found liable for infringing design patents on an “article of manufacture” are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. , No. 15-777, turned on the meaning of the Quote: d phrase.\nWriting for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers — here, Samsung’s phones — and sometimes be the components found to have infringed a design patent.\nApple’s patents covered specific design elements of the iPhone, including its black rectangular front face with rounded corners and its colorful grid of 16 icons. A jury found that Samsung had infringed those patents.\n“All told,” Justice Sotomayor wrote, “Apple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung’s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.”\n Design patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in over a century.\nLast year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court that handles patent appeals, ruled that the federal law “explicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented design.”\nThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that “an award of a defendant’s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.” But it added that “those are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.”\n“We are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,” the court said.\nJustice Sotomayor’s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the whole phone or just parts of it. She said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that “the relevant ‘article of manufacture’ must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.”\n“In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “In the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.”\nThe Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration.\nJustice Sotomayor’s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. “An ‘article’ is just ‘a particular thing,’” she wrote, citing two dictionaries. “And ‘manufacture’ means ‘the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man’ and ‘the articles so made.’\n“An article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,” she concluded. “So understood, the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.”\n Patent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\n“The court basically punted,” said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. “It seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, ‘We’re not going to tell you what the right rule is.’”\nMr. Lemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney’s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated.\nCompanies that sold products with distinctive designs filed a brief supporting Apple and urging the justices to protect their investments. Technology companies filed briefs supporting Samsung, arguing that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.",

That's how you can describe Apple 's new MacBook Pro . \nThe company's decision to include only two USB-C ports (four on the more expensive Touch Bar model ) have forced users to rely on expensive and clunky dongles to connect an external hard drive, access an SD card or even charge their iPhone . \nA new accessory is looking to fix this.

Aside from an Ethernet port, the HyperDrive restores virtually all of the ports found on the previous MacBook Pro from 2015 . Photo by Hyper \nThe HyperDrive is available through a Kickstarter campaign . The hub is priced at $100, but is being offered to Kickstarter backers for $70. It works with both the 13-inch and 15-inch 2016 MacBook models, and is offered in either space gray or silver. The campaign ends on January 16, 2017. The company has said it plans to begin shipping the HyperDrive in February. \nAs always, please note that CNET's reporting on crowdfunding campaigns is not an endorsement of the project or its creators.

Photo by Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nBecoming a star means everything to your children. \nHow else are they going to make any money when robots do almost everything else? \nMoreover, being a star allows you to say anything you want to anyone you want. Just ask Kanye. \nApple believes it has now developed the perfect way for you to begin your child's ascent to movie stardom. It's called the iPhone 7 Plus. \nI know this because Cupertino has just released an ad that suggests this phone's video camera is just as good as anything they use in Hollywood. \nWe think, indeed, we're watching a movie. For some reason, the director has cast children to play Romeo and Juliet. Yes, little children, rather than the usual teeny starlets. This is art? This is the man who directed \" Bugsy Malone \"? \nIt turns out that the director is a mere parent. One of those frightfully annoying parents that hold their phones up all through the school play. For that's all this is. \nBut then the message from Apple: \"Your movies look like movies.\" More Technically Incorrect ",

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled for Samsung in its patent dispute with Apple and set aside a $400 million damages verdict for copying the look of the iPhone.\nThe justices dealt only with the question of how much the South Korean firm should pay for copying several design features of Apple's smartphone.\nA jury had found that Samsung copied several features of Apple's patented design, and a judge said the South Korean firm should pay out its \"entire profit\" from the sale of its smartphones.\nThose damages of $399 million were upheld by a federal appeals court, but they were set aside by the high court in an 8-0 decision Tuesday.\nIn a brief opinion, the justices said the design features of the smartphones, including their rectangular shape, were a \"component\" of the product, not the entire product. Therefore Samsung should be forced to pay a lesser amount for copying the look of Apple's iPhone, the court found.\nBut the high court did not decide on the proper amount. Instead, the justices sent the case back to an appeals court to decide on how much the design features contributed to the value of the iPhone.\n(c)2016 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "0 An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. Reuters/Mike Segar \nApple has released an official statement regarding the iPhone 6S battery issues that have affected a number of users. The tech giant says that the unexpected iPhone shutdowns “can occur under normal conditions” and that the main culprit of the batteries’ problems is “ambient air.” \nAfter launching an iPhone 6s battery replacement program about two weeks ago, Apple says it is done investigating the issue. The Cupertino-based company points to “controlled ambient air” as the reason why select models of the iPhone 6s have been shutting down unexpectedly. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 'Game of the Year' now available on Apple TV \n“As a result of our investigation on this, we found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs,” Apple explained in its post. \nThe iPhone maker apologised for any inconvenience the battery mishap may have caused but reiterated that it’s not a safety issue. Apple also acknowledged the handful of iPhone 6s users who have experienced untimely shutdowns despite owning handsets that fall outside of the supposedly affected models. The company seemed to downplay the shutdowns as common manifestations. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 8 update: New 4.7-inch iPhone 8 could be the iPhone SE's successor \n“A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns can occur under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,” Apple clarified. \nTo help figure things out, Apple is going to include “additional diagnostic capability” in its new iOS software update that will be made available next week. The diagnostic tool will allow Apple to gather enough information for it to improve its capacity to manage battery performance and inconvenient shutdowns. Apple added that any progress and fixes developed out of the data that will be collected shall be delivered in future software updates.",

      "title": "U.S. Supreme Court backs Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple",
      "text": "Related Content View Photo 3D-printed Samsung and Apple logos are seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina …\n\nBy Andrew Chung\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future.\nApple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement, \"We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" A representative for Samsung did not immediately comment. \nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favoring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\n\nPERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY \nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products.\n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview.\nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.\nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)",

As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.\"\nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino, its home base, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them. \nThe department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013.\nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant's existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste.\nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Dan Grebler and Alan Crosby)",

      "text": "Chesnot | Getty Images A customer checks an iPhone 6s at an Apple store. Apple 's iPhone 6S battery issue is larger than the company first thought. \nThe problem: iPhone 6S devices that shut down the phones abruptly. After announcing an exchange program last month for certain phones, Apple said Tuesday that the issue may extend beyond phones manufactured in September or October of 2015. \n\"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown,\" wrote the iPhone maker in a posting on the company's Chinese support page . Apple notes that some phones shut down \"under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,\" but that it would be releasing a software update next week to garner more information. It is also exploring a possible software fix which would be deployed in a future version of iOS. \nMore from USA Today:\nApple to replace faulty batteries on some iPhone 6S models \nTim Cook praises Watch sales amid wearable concerns \nSamsung just scores major win in patent battle with Apple \nApple declined to comment on how many phones are impacted or if the issue extended to other devices such as the iPhone 6S Plus.\n\nThe problem stems from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs. \nThose with iPhone 6S phones that they feel have been having issues can go to their local Apple Store or an authorized service provider, the small repair shops with the stickers that say they're authorized by Apple as well as retailers such as Best Buy. If it is determined that your phone is one of the affected units, the company will swap out the battery free of charge. Users can also enter their phone's serial number onto the company's support page to see if their phone is one of the bad ones. \nApple is the latest major tech company to suffer from battery issues. Samsung notably recalled and cancelled its Galaxy Note 7 phone this fall after numerous devices saw their batteries catch fire or explode. There have thus far been no reports of similar issues from the iPhone 6S.",

      "text": "  Pint-Sized Romeo and Juliet Take Center Stage in Apple’s Latest iPhone Spot Advertisement Comment \nApple launched a new spot promoting the iPhone 7, the latest in the “Practically Magic” campaign it launched back in September . \nThe 30-second “Romeo and Juliet” promotes the iPhone 7 by virtue of its video recording quality. It opens on a pair of child actors portraying Romeo and Juliet in what otherwise seems to be a fairly elaborate production. As the ad continues, though, it becomes clear that it is actually a school play and the cinematic production is in service of the line, “Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7” as a proud father documents the work of his young thespian. The premise of cinematic production given to home movies via the iPhone 7 works on paper in exemplifying the “Practically Magic” tagline, though we would like to raise an issue or two. For example, do the copywriters know how this particular dramatic work ends?? And how much fake blood can one elementary school have on hand at any given time? \nThe approach harkens back to the “Shot on an iPhone” campaign which promoted the video capabilities of the iPhone 6s, particularly the “Onions” spot which, while still an obvious exaggeration, made a more convincing case for the brand. \n“Romeo and Juliet” is something of a departure from the campaign’s captivating introductory spot, which managed to showcase its low light camera and water resistance features. It’s understandable that Apple would want to expand on the tagline by focusing on a different individual feature that has long been a selling point for the brand, though we feel like another, more family friendly play, would have made the whole thing more believable.",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nDecember 6, 2016 3:53pm \nWith Motorola bowing out of the smartwatch game for the time being and Android Wear 2.0 still not out, analysts are decrying the untimely death of the smartwatch. \nTim Cook, Apple’s CEO, however says that Apple Watch sales are “off the charts,” according to a recent interview with Reuters . \n“Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” said Cook \n“During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” \nIDC’s latest report indicates that Apple has sold 1.1 million Apple Watches in Q3 2016, down 71 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Apple released its Apple Watch Series 2 just a few months ago and while the watch was relatively well-received because it solves many of the first-generation wearable’s major issues like water resistance, battery life and improved performance, some technology critics found it underwhelming. \nApple has never released specific Apple Watch product sales. Source Reuters jay \nWhat is the reason to buy one ?most people have the first one and not wearing anymore and other like me using it and no reason to upgrade Marc Palumbo \nOne thing I have found super annoying about wearables are the vibrating notification. I end up shutting off most if not all my notifications because of it. Then at the end of the day, I end using my phone to go through everything quickly. Gewurttraminer \nThe purpose of notifications on your watch is to avoid precisely the need to always look at your phone when one pops up.I find myself looking at the watch more than my phone to get a glance. If you honestly hate notifications then what you say equally applies to any device that keeps you “connected” Marc Palumbo \nI felt like this. For myself, I see myself using wearables to check on things like I would on a phone. Check my response to @It’s Me It’s Me \nIsn’t that the point though? To only enable those notifications you would want to be able to see without pulling out your phone? Marc Palumbo \nYa, but it became annoying. I started with all, then cut it down to texts and chats. Then cut out the chats. I had texts, but at any point when I got a lot of texts in a row, I shut it down. It got progressively annoying. Marc Palumbo \nIn the past 2 days, I have read that iPhone sales are OK but not great, but Apple Watch sales are off the charts. Is it possible that whoever would have spent money on a new iPhone (early upgrade), opted to put their money on the watch instead of the iPhone to buy it at a later date? Assuming both reports are correct of course. Jon Duke \nInteresting point. Would make sence. Marc Palumbo \nAllocation of scarce resources comes to mind. Consumer behavior would tell me that if I have X amount of dollars that isn’t limitless, would require me to spend my money where it makes me happiest at the most. So if I have an iPhone 6, I can wait for the 7 or 7S and get the Watch so now I have both while still having a full functioning phone. I think the tough pill to swallow is that shareholders want constant increase in iPhone sales. But is it really a coincidence that iPhone sales decreased in growth at the time the Watch came to market. Just my theory I guess. Nothing concrete here. It’s Me \nI assume the big increase in Watch sales are original and Series One units, since these were on promotion widely across the US recently. Marc Palumbo \nI understand that, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that growth for iPhones is on the decline. This is just some assumption of mine. I don’t think this helps Apple except for selling watches. Possibly cannibalizing their iPhone sales to a degree. Jon Duke \nI mean, if I compare my LG V20 to the HP Elite x3, it’s selling like hot cakes in Canada! We all know that’s not the full story tho… ciderrules \nI bought 2 from the Apple Store. Very hard to find in stores and online is 2-3 weeks for most. \nLike the bottom of the charts? John W \nWell depending on their chart, the sales could be in the dumpster and they are just that low. Frankly without any real numbers, this is 100% free advertising on apples part. Get Updates \nSign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Categories",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nDecember 6, 2016 12:13pm \nLate last month Apple relatively quietly launched a recall program for a number of iPhone 6s models that have been shutting down for seemingly no reason. \nNow, via a press release, the company says it has uncovered the cause of the problem, stating that the issue stems from “ambient air” making its way into the iPhone 6s’ battery compartment. \n“We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It’s important to note, this is not a safety issue.” \nUnsurprisingly, Apple is emphasizing that the problem is not a safety issue, which makes sense given the disaster that became the Note 7’s exploding and overheating power source. What is unclear is exactly how many devices are affected by the issue. For Apple’s part, the company say it’s only “small number.” \nIf you own an iPhone 6s that’s suffering from random shut down issues, Apple has released a tool that searches the phone’s serial number in order to tell you if it’s included in this particular recall. \nApple also recently launched a $189 CAD repair program for iPhone 6s Plus devices suffering from “touch disease ,” an issue where the phone’s screen becomes unresponsive. Source Apple Jon Duke \nAt this point, I think they are playing the “let’s see how ridiculous we can get with our fans” game to test how far they can go. Jason \nthat’s what pokemon go is doing It’s Me \nHow so? They’ve identified a the problem, isolated which devices used the problem batteries and provided a fix. Doesn’t sound ridiculous. Jon Duke \nI was just making fun of the “air broke it” argument. I understand the explanation, it just sounds ridiculous when you look from the outside of the tech world. If I explain this to my mom, she’ll laugh. gman4444 \nNo Apple fan here but a lot of components are made in vacuums and different air conditions. Oxygen can cause oxidization of several materials and moisture can can lithium to oxidize very quickly. It seems like it could be a legitimate QC issue. h2oflyer \nWe’re all breathing ambient air. And then of course there’s regular air that may or not be “controlled “. \nIt looks like Apple is a bit jealous of all the hardware recall attention that Samsung is getting and wanted in on the publicity. Of course they’re doing the right thing.",

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Tuesday Dec 6, 2016 at 11:56 AM SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. About Us",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) The Associated Press The Associated Press \nIn this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) \nUpdated at 9:47 a.m. \nWASHINGTON • The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \nSamsung had been seeking to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance. \nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by $382 million. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.",

Or at least “losing less” column. \nOn Tuesday the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Samsung in the company’s fight over $399 million awarded to Apple as damages related to the company infringing on the iPhone’s design. The $399 million figure comes from the profits of 11 Samsung smartphone models a lower court ruled copied Apple’s design features, including the use of a grid of icons. \nAccording to federal law, a company that illegally uses a patented design is liable “to the extent of his total profit.” Samsung appealed this decision, stating Apple should only be entitled to profits derived from the components in Samsung’s devices that infringed on Apple’s patents, not the profits derived from the whole phone. \nIn a unanimous 8-0 ruling, the court agreed that Samsung should not be held liable for the total profits of the 11 devices in question. The case has been sent back to the lower courts to reassess the damages Samsung owes Apple.",

      "text": "Apple says iPhone 6s battery failures are caused by ‘ambient air’ exposure Apple says iPhone 6s battery failures are caused by ‘ambient air’ exposure By Ryan Whitwam   2:15 pm Comment \nRegardless of whether or not you like the iPhone, you have to admit Apple’s hardware has always been impeccably well designed. Its phones feel extremely high-quality, but the last few years have been marred by several high-profile hardware defects. First was “ touch disease ,” which Apple refused to acknowledge for ages, and now there’s the unexpected shutdown issue. The company has started a recall program for the shutdown problem, and it has a vague explanation of the cause: The affected batteries were exposed to air. \nReports of battery issues with the iPhone 6s started popping up in recent months, but these aren’t the same sort of issues Samsung saw with the Note 7. The iPhone 6s doesn’t explode, it just sort of turns itself off unexpectedly when there’s significant charge still left. There are various reasons a phone might shut down, such as to protect the hardware from damage. This seemed to be completely random, though. It took time for Apple to recognize the issue and offer customers some alternative other than paying for a costly repair. \nApple recently launched a recall program for the iPhone 6s that allows those affected to have their phone battery replaced free of charge. It also posted a very basic explanation of the issue on its Chinese website. Apparently one of the battery components used in phones manufactured during October 2015 was exposed to “controlled ambient air” longer than is should have been. I suppose that means it was left out in the open for too long? Maybe we’re dealing with some sort of oxidation of a part. At any rate, this causes the battery to age faster than normal, which leads to unexpected shutdowns. \nThere’s a web page on Apple’s US site that lets you check if your iPhone 6s is part of the affected batch. This is important because only the phones manufactured during this window are eligible for the free battery replacement. Alas, some owners with phones manufactured after October 2015 are also seeing unexpected shutdowns. Apple even admits this at the end of the press release. \nSo, what about those poor souls stuck with non-covered devices that shut down unexpectedly? For now, they’re out of luck. Apple is planning to investigate the issue further with the aid of an upcoming OTA update for iOS 10. The new software will send telemetry back to Apple with the aim of working out if these shutdown issues are related to the controlled ambient air thing. If Apple can find a software fix, it will issue one. Otherwise, there might be another recall if indeed this is found to be Apple’s fault. Tagged In",

(Photo: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney)\nApple's iPhone 6S battery issue is larger than the company first thought.\nThe problem: iPhone 6S devices that shut down the phones abruptly. After announcing an exchange program last month for certain phones, Apple said Tuesday that the issue may extend beyond phones manufactured in September or October of 2015.\nUSA TODAY\nApple to replace faulty batteries on some iPhone 6S models\n\"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown,\" wrote the iPhone maker in a posting on the company's Chinese support page . Apple notes that some phones shut down \"under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,\" but that it would be releasing a software update next week to garner more information. It is also exploring a possible software fix which would be deployed in a future version of iOS.\nThe company stresses that the issue poses no safety risk to users.\nApple declined to comment on how many phones are impacted or if the issue extended to other devices such as the iPhone 6S Plus.\nThe problem stems from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs.\nThose with iPhone 6S phones that they feel have been having issues can go to their local Apple Store or an authorized service provider, the small repair shops with the stickers that say they're authorized by Apple as well as retailers such as Best Buy. If it is determined that your phone is one of the affected units, the company will swap out the battery free of charge. Users can also enter their phone's serial number onto the company's support page to see if their phone is one of the bad ones.\nUSA TODAY\nTim Cook praises Watch sales amid wearable concerns\nApple is the latest major tech company to suffer from battery issues. Samsung notably recalled and cancelled its Galaxy Note 7 phone this fall after numerous devices saw their batteries catch fire or explode. There have thus far been no reports of similar issues from the iPhone 6S.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n2352 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/2gOLICe",

      "text": "matsuyuki/Flickr Well, that was odd. On Monday, the U.S. government suddenly pressed pause in its encryption battle with Apple—a case that stands to make or break a precedent for building a government \"back door\" into secure technologies. FBI lawyers requested that a court hearing originally scheduled for today be postponed until after April 5. The reason? An unknown \"outside party demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking [San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan] Farook’s iPhone\" that would \"eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple.\" \nRELATED ARTICLES Facial Recognition? There's an App for That, and U.S. Law Enforcement Has Been Helping Private Companies Use It Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 12.06.16 \nYou Don’t Have to Be British to Be Extremely Worried About U.K.’s New Surveillance Law Scott Shackford | 11.30.16 \nThe United Kingdom Authorizes Broad Mass Surveillance on Its Citizens Scott Shackford | 11.28.16 \nMORE ARTICLES BY Andrea O'Sullivan The Future of Free Speech on Social Media Looks Grim 12.06.16 8:30 am \nA Tech Agenda for the Trump Administration 11.15.16 7:00 am \nSay 'Hi' to the NSA in Your Next Email 10.11.16 8:00 am \nPrivacy Security Cybersecurity Cellphones Apple FBI San Bernardino Shooting Terrorism On Wednesday, it was revealed that Israeli mobile forensic software provider Cellebrite was likely the firm enlisted to help the FBI unlock Farook’s iPhone. According to Reuters , the firm is split into two companies: one that provides forensic systems to law enforcement and intelligence agencies like the FBI and another that provides technology for mobile retailers. If the FBI’s version of events is correct, Cellebrite contacted the FBI \" out of the blue \" just before the agency was heading into a difficult court case. Talk about good luck.\nUntil now, the FBI has been pushing for Apple engineers to purposefully break certain iPhone security features so federal agents can access data on Farook's phone. Virtually all of Silicon Valley stands with Apple, viewing the order to build a \"back door\" for government access as a major threat to strong cybersecurity and a worrying overreach of state power. But the FBI has argued that all this clucking about \"network security, encryption, back doors, and privacy\" is a mere \"diversion\" from the just cause of prosecuting terrorists. \nFBI's Legal Reasoning Is Shaky \nThe FBI's initial legal argument for conscripting apple's engineers was based on a broad interpretation of the All Writs Act of 1789 (AWA). That centuries-old law says U.S. courts may issue all legal orders \"necessary and appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\" Traditionally, the AWA has allowed courts to facilitate lawful legal procedures when the precise means needed was not on the books. Subsequent legal interpretations forbid the government from using the AWA to compel an entity \"far removed\" from a situation to act or compelling actions that pose an \"unreasonable burden\" or \"adversely affect\" a party's \"basic interests.\"\nApple responded that the AWA is nowhere near as expansive as the FBI would like it to be. Besides, the FBI's demands are expressly prohibited under the AWA anyway, as complying would cause Apple to suffer \"unreasonable burdens\" that would \"adversely affect its basic interests.\" What's more, the AWA is superseded by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). This 1994 law explicitly prohibits law enforcement from compelling companies to \"decrypt, or ensure the government’s ability to decrypt, any communication unless… the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the information\" (i.e. the private key) or for the government to \"dictate to providers or electronic communications services… any specific equipment design or software configuration.\"\nOn March 10, the FBI fired back. While Apple portrays the AWA as \"dusty and forgotten,\" the feds feel that the old girl is \"a vital part of our legal system that is regularly invoked in a variety of contexts.\" And as Apple is one of the largest and most cash-rich companies in the world, it shouldn't be a big deal to comply with the government’s modest request.\nLast week, Apple’s attorneys filed its response to the FBI response . In it, Apple asserted that \"the Founders would be appalled\" by the FBI's use of the All Writs Act \"an all-powerful magic wand.\"\nFurthermore, Apple takes strong objection to the FBI’s claim that it only seeks access to one specific device rather than a precedent for future cases. The filing points to comments by FBI Director Comey at his recent congressional testimony that this case \" will be instructive for other courts \"—suggesting that the agency did indeed expect a beneficial precedent.\nSo Much for That Precedent \nBut Monday’s shock announcement made all of this legal sparring irrelevant—at least for now.\nThroughout this entire brouhaha, many have speculated that the FBI was not solely interested in the data that might be on Farook’s work iPhone. After all, Farook did not even go through the trouble of attempting to destroy this phone , which was issued to him through his work and possibly monitored by his employer—how important could info on it be? Yet as a means for law enforcement to establish a legal precedent to get around secure encryption, this situation is ripe for opportunity. \nOf course, should precedent to be established in the opposite direction—should the courts side with Apple’s arguably more comprehensive case against the government—the FBI would have one less means by which to access secure technologies. The agency would have to slink back to Congress, empty-handed, and re-start the ignoble process of pushing an unpopular statute through an already-gridlocked body. \nThis is not to say that the legal fight ends here. After all, the order was only stayed, not terminated. If this cracker-jack hack of the FBI's falls short, the FBI may very well revisit the issue after its April 5 status report.\nAdditionally, it’s important to keep in mind that while the fight between Apple and the FBI over the San Bernardino shooter’s phone is the most high-profile, it is hardly the only such case. Apple alone is fighting at least 12 similar orders to break secure technologies for law enforcement. The San Bernardino case just happens to be the most emotionally compelling of these because of its ties to terrorism. The vast majority of the government’s other issues with encrypted data— few though they may be —deal with investigations regarding the wildly unpopular War on Drugs .\nVulnerabilities and Vigilance \nNot much is known about the FBI's new \"method for unlocking Farook’s iPhone.\" Perhaps it's employing methods proposed by a handful of technologists to get around the iPhone's security without conscripting Apple engineers as hacker slaves. \nAnother possibility is that the FBI will execute one of the federal government’s cache of \" zero day vulnerabilities \" to crack the iPhone. Zero days are software bugs that are unknown to all but the discoverer. Ideally, such vulnerabilities would be quickly reported to relevant parties so that bugs get patched and all of us can enjoy a more secure computing environment. But zero days are frequently employed by nation states and malicious hackers to exploit their monopolies on security vulnerability.\nTechnologists will be watching very closely to determine whether and to what extent the FBI may be engaging in this dangerous zero-day trade.\nThe FBI, for its part, says that it is \"cautiously optimistic\" about this serendipitous new method to access data from Farook’s infamous iPhone without conscripting Apple. We should all be cautiously vigilant about the FBI’s next move in its war against secure technologies.\nPhoto Credit: matsuyuki/Flickr",

      "text": "Apple will release an iOS update to help resolve the growing number of iPhone 6s battery shutdowns The issue that's causing iPhone 6s batteries to unexpectedly shutdown is bigger than originally anticipated. Staff Writer, Macworld | Dec 6, 2016 2:40 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nThe number of people affected by iPhone 6s battery issues is growing to the point that Apple is now looking into a software fix. \nApple admitted on its Chinese support website this week that “customers outside of the affected range” are also experiencing unexpected shutdowns due to a faulty battery on their iPhone 6s. This means that Apple has spotted similar problems with devices that were manufactured outside the original September and October 2015 timeframe. \nTo address the issue, Apple started offering free replacement batteries to the affected customers. But as the problem continues to appear on more devices, Apple is preparing a diagnostic tool to gather more information and figure out if it can be resolved with a forthcoming iOS update. \nApple’s Chinese website now includes the following information: \n“We are including additional diagnostic capability in an iOS software update which will be available next week. This will allow us to gather information over the coming weeks which may potentially help us improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown. If such improvements can be made, they will be delivered in future software updates.” \nThe diagnostic tool will presumably come in the form of iOS 10.2 next week. Apple has said that the issue stems from some batteries being overexposed to “controlled ambient air” during manufacturing. \nThe impact on you: Apple has instated a battery replacement program for affected iPhone 6s devices. If you are affected by unexpected battery shutdowns, you will need to make an appointment at your local Apple store to verify that your iPhone 6s is eligible for the free battery replacement. An Apple store employee will also check for a broken screen, scratches, or dents that would require additional repairs not covered by the replacement program. \nIn most cases, the replacement battery will have to be ordered and might take up to seven days to arrive. In the meantime, you’ll be instructed to do an iPhone backup and to turn off Find My iPhone. Once your replacement battery has arrived, you will need to drop-off your iPhone 6s at the Apple store. Then, it will take anywhere from one or two hours for the battery to be replaced. \nAccording to the work authorization receipt, a battery replacement kit is valued at $79, but it is free for customers who qualify for the program. You can check here to see if your iPhone 6s might be eligible for a free battery replacement.   Related:",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nSamsung isn’t the only company to have experienced battery-related issues recently — Apple is also dealing with its fair share of troubles, and last month issued a recall program for certain iPhone 6S models that were shutting down unexpectedly due to rapidly decreasing battery life. The reason for the battery issues? According to Apple , it’s that the batteries were exposed to air. Yep, air is apparently the culprit. \nThat doesn’t mean that there was a hole in your phone — Apple says the batteries were exposed to “controlled ambient air,” which basically means that while the batteries were being assembled, they were exposed to a little more air than they should have been. Because of that, the batteries degraded faster than they usually would. Apple is quick to note that the problem does not result in a safety issue. \nMore: iPhone shots too dark? This phone case has built-in LEDs for smartphone photography \nIn other words. the issue seems to be a pretty mundane manufacturing flaw. And it makes sense that Apple would want to highlight the fact that there’s no safety issue — no manufacturer would want to be compared to Samsung at this point. \nIt’s still not exactly clear how many phones were affected, and Apple has only referred to a “very small number” of devices. Apple also says that a few customers outside the “affected range” of devices are experiencing issues with their phone, but the company hasn’t said why or what it might do about it. It did, however, say that it would include “additional diagnostic capability in an iOS software update” set to be released sometime next week. \nIf you’re unsure if you’re in the group of people affected by the issue, Apple has released a diagnostic tool to help you check. If you are in that group, Apple will send a replacement phone to your nearest Apple Store. Also watch:",

      "text": "Apple, Most FANGs Rated Top Tech Investment Picks Facebook is among an investment bank's top internet picks. (iStockphoto) Reprints \nCredit Suisse made Facebook ( FB ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) its top internet picks, with Apple ( AAPL ) its top pick in tech hardware. \nCredit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote that Facebook will be able to drive long-term revenue growth without a material lift in ad loads. \nJu said near-term growth drivers include Instagram and premium video, and that Wall Street models on Facebook \"are too conservative and underestimate the long-term monetization potential of upcoming new products.\" \nHe also wrote in his research note that estimates on Facebook do not contemplate contributions from WhatsApp and Messenger, among other products. \nJu has an outperform rating on Facebook stock, and price target of 170. \nFacebook stock was down a fraction to 117.31 at the close on the stock market today . IBD'S TAKE: All four stocks are off highs set in October and are trading below their 50-day moving average , which is a bearish sign. Apple continues to shape a flat base with a potential entry at 118.79. For a deeper look at Apple and the other, check out IBD Stock Checkup . \nOn Google-owner Alphabet, Ju said drivers of the stock include the narrowing of monetization gap between desktop and mobile. He also expects increased revenue contributions from Google's non-search businesses YouTube and Google Play. \nJu has an outperform rating and price target of 1,120 on Alphabet. \nAlphabet stock was down a fraction to close at 776.18 Tuesday. \nOn Amazon, Ju said factors that present upside potential to the stock include an increase in free cash flow as spending on Amazon Web Services is starting to level off, as well as improving e-commerce profitability. \nJu has an outperform rating on Amazon and price target of 1000. \nAmazon stock was up a fraction to 764.72. \nApple was rated the top pick in the tech hardware sector by Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha. \nHe cited multiple growth drivers for Apple's stock, including a greater adoption of the Apple operating system ecosystem and the company's commitment to cash distributions. \n\"Additionally, the market may underestimate the gross profit contribution from Apple Services, but more importantly its growth potential and the annuity-type business it drives in terms of retention and replacement across the business,\" he wrote in his research note. \nGarcha set a price target on Apple of 150. \nApple stock was up a fraction to 109.95. \nAll four stocks, however, are trading below their 50-day moving averages, a key support line, having fallen after the surprise win for President-elect Trump, who has backed some not-so tech-friendly initiatives, though some of his ideas would be tech-friendly.

      "text": "8-0 not even close Can’t Fix Stupid \nHere’s a case where Dems and Republicansl judges were fully united. Apple lawsuits bringing people together. Andrew English \nWell I am surprised Blackberry doesn’t sue Apple over the same thing since they have been smartphone before Apple even had the idea. 🙂 thereasoner \nThat would have required BlackBerry executives to be the kind of unethical businessman Apple executives are by applying for these ridiculous patents in the first place. \nThe bullying of an entire industry and deceiving the consumers by abusing both the court and patent systems with false IP claims is a game invented by Apple . That anyone was allowed to claim ownership over rounded corners etc in the first place was the real crime here ! Ali F. \nWebOs could also sue them for “Cards”. It’s Me \nTo be clear, the court didn’t throw out the verdict that Samsung is guilty of willful infringement. They said they cannot determine whether the penalty Samsung needs to pay for their infringement should be calculated on a per component basis or on the the whole phone. Samsung is still guilty of infringement, but how much they need to pay will go back before the Appeals court. \nAbsent adequate briefing by the parties, this Court declines to resolve whether the relevant article of manufacture for each design patent at issue here is the smartphone or a particular smartphone component. Doing so is not necessary to resolve the question presented, and the Federal Circuit may address any remaining issues on remand Smanny \nApple filed lawsuits in other countries as well. However they were all thrown out from those other countries. All except the US, which has the most lawyers per capita compared to all the other countries around the globe. Not to mention people can go after you if you drop a crumb in from of them. They even go after you if the coffee is too hot. It’s just ridiculous. When Apple went after Samsung for saying that they were copying their iPhone, it was ridiculous especially when you went on the phone itself. That is where the similarities ended. Back then Android and iOS were totally different. Like Apples and Oranges. So how it got to court is beyond me. It’s Me \nTo correct that misinformation, yes Apple did file in other countries, no they were all thrown out. Some Apple won, some they lost and some they lost on appeal. Samsung did the same. In the end, Apple and Samsung agreed to drop all lawsuits except in the US. thereasoner \nSpeaking of misinformation, Apple had no significant victories outside the United States, NONE ! That and they basically left European courts behind both because of the lack of significant wins and because the British judge in their last case over there humiliated Apple by not only tossing out their case but by also forcing Apple to take out full page ads in national print declaring that Samsung does not copy valid intellectual property! \nAfter that Apple left Europe with their tail between their legs. Serves them right too, that’s what they deserved for abusing European courts with false IP claims for so many years ! It’s Me \nWhat misinformation? The lack of weasel words like “significant” so you could slip in absolutes like “none”? Nice use of qualifiers. \nAs I said, they won some, lost some and lost some on appeal. No information. thereasoner \nNo weasel words just facts. The best they could do in Europe was force a design change on the Galaxy tablet and only in Germany where much stricter design patent law is enforced. The only significant victory, over a billion $s at one point, of any kind for Apple against Samsung took place in a small lower level court in Apples own backyard of Cupertino and even that one has been slowly falling apart at the seams through various appeals! \nHow do you get “win some lose some” over the colossal failure that has been Apples patent claims outside of the United States much less the failures to uphold so called wins at home? It’s Me \nOutside of the US, they have won some and lost some and lost some on appeal. That’s fact. Not sure why such a simple concept is so difficult for you. thereasoner \nWhat do you think they have “won” exactly? Just curious because other than the manipulation of consumers they have accomplished nothing. It’s Me \nThey won in Germany as you mentioned, later over turned by a British judge that almost immediately went to work for Samsung’s law firm. They won in South Korean, when Samsung sued them and they counter sued. They lost in Japan when Samsung sued them. They won in the Netherlands , then lost on appeal, then won, then lost. They won an injunction in OZ, which was then overturned but the case was dropped by both before it went t court. Samsung sued them in France and Italy, trying to avoid the German courts, but again, both agreed to drop it. The US judgement was the largest because that was the biggest claim made because that’s where Apple is based and where their patent originate. \nWon some, lost some, lost some on appeal. Then they both settled. Notably, it was often Samsung that was bringing the lawsuits to begin with. ciderrules \nSamsung has had countless lawsuits against Apple also thrown out. Or do you like to cherry pick the cases you talk about? FlamesFan89 \nSamsung is guilty of infringing on patents that shouldn’t exist in the first place. It’s Me \nNot even the Supreme Court went with that position. FlamesFan89 \nI didn’t say that they did. \nCommon sense does though. Common sense has been screaming it from day one. The USPTO just happens to be wearing hearing protection (which may or may not have an Apple logo on it). It’s Me \nIf only they was a (or a plethora of) avenues to challenge the validity of patents and a company with enough money to hire and army of lawyers to present such a common sense argument. Certainly someone could be found that agrees with such common sense… FlamesFan89 \nSo are you implying that Samsung hasn’t challenged the validity of the patents? Because I’m pretty sure they have. \nBut all that aside, Apple likely wins the argument based on some inane technicality. \nCommon sense, and law, often disagree in the most egregious of ways. Just because a patent isn’t thrown out, even upon challenge, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t defy common sense. \nOr do you honestly believe that it makes sense for there to be a patent on a rectangle with rounded corners? It’s Me \nClearly Samsung has challenged it. Just yet to find a court or office to agree to such common sense regardless of such massive efforts to do just that. Maybe that’s just because all US courts and patents officers are corrupt. \nDesign and ornamental patents are a grey area. Always have been. FlamesFan89 \n“Design and ornamental patents are a grey area. Always have been.” \nExactly, which is why they defy common sense. It’s Me \nAnd yet they have a long history of being supported around the world and for good reason. Knockoffs often, even usually, mimic the physical form from an ornamental perspective for a reason. Because it works. Same reason Pepsi can’t use coke’s bottle shape. FlamesFan89 \nThere is a pretty ridiculously big difference between Coke’s very distinctive, unique, bottle shape, and a rectangle with rounded corners which is strikingly similar to nearly every other electronic device on the planet at the time the patent was awarded, such as TVs, monitors, handheld devices, calculators, you name it. \nAgain, I’m not saying that common sense dictates that design patents shouldn’t exist. I’m saying that common sense dictates that design patents shouldn’t exist for ridiculously common, basic shapes, that are used all over the place, including in the industry the patent would apply, you know, like a rectangle with rounded corners. It’s Me \nExcept that “rectangle with rounded corners” is an intentional oversimplification and you know it. There are other qualifications, thought admittedly how broadly any qualification is judged is subjective. Ironically, Apple’s own design patent specifically cites precious Samsung design patents for “rectangles with rounded corners” of slightly different angles and lines and ratios. FlamesFan89 \npull your head out of your posterior. You know the patent is BS, and is an outstanding example of how flawed the patent system is. It’s Me \nNope. I know that’s your opinion. And I know that all design patent are subjective by their nature so everyone will have an opinion. \nI do suspect that if anyone bothered to knockoff one of Samsung similar design patents you might not feel as strongly about them defending theirs. FlamesFan89 \nIf you ask me, Samsung sucks. I’m not in favour of them having a design patent on a vague basic shape. If they have one, I’d think it should get thrown out too. It’s Me \nThey have lots. One presumes they filed them in order to protect those shapes. Perhaps they aren’t challenging Apple’s with as much effort as it appears, since it might just bite them later. FlamesFan89 \nYou let me know when they are seeking millions or billions for them, and I’ll chastise them for it too. It’s Me \nSomeone has to copy them first. FlamesFan89 \nwhy would anyone want to copy Samsung? It’s Me",

      "text": "share Apple's TV single sign-on feature goes live in the US You no longer need to log in to every last service provider on your Apple TV or iOS device. Save Reuters/Jonathan Alcorn \nApple just made your TV watching much easier... if you subscribe to the right services, that is. After dropping some hints in November, Apple has activated its promised single sign-on feature for Apple TV and iOS users in the US, but only for a handful of offerings. DirecTV, Dish and cord-cutter service Sling TV are the highlights among providers. Only some channel-specific apps can use SSO as well: A&E, Bravo, NBC, Syfy and USA are among the choices, and the option isn't always available on both Apple TV and iOS gear. \nHow well the feature works will rely heavily on app creators. There are some glaring omissions in the selection right now (HBO, anyone?). The situation might improve sooner than you think, however. Single sign-on might see greater adoption now that you don't need a beta operating system to try it, and there will be a stronger incentive to use it once Apple's unifying TV app is available. If support is rough around the edges right now, it might be a very different story in the months ahead.",

      "text": "By SAM HANANEL\nAssociated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.\nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices.\nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.\nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.\nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.\nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.\nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.\nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.\nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\"\nA Samsung spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.\nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs.\n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "In an 8-0 decision, the US Supreme Court sided against Apple in its design patent fight with Samsung . The move wipes out any of the remaining damages that Infinite Loop would hope to gain from the legal dispute — at this point, $399 million — and sends the case down to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to further determine legal precedence.\nThe five-year-old case revolves around Samsung’s 2010 and 2011 smartphones being sold in the open market and Apple’s claim that the chaebol infringed upon several patented design elements of the iPhone.\nJustice Sonya Sotomayor, writing the Court’s opinion, stated that in lower court decisions, judges favored Apple on the basis that Samsung infringed upon individual design patents. As each individual component of the phone cannot be bought by a consumer, damages on each charge were awarded on the total profits Samsung made per offending phone it sold.\nSotomayor remands the opinion and broadly defines an “article of manufacture” in part as to be both a thing (read: smartphone) that is made available to consumers and a component that is made for that product. Getting damages for the latter tends to be trickier as, in this case, Apple would need to show that, say, Samsung’s 16-button home screen interface that allegedly infringed on Apple’s patented interface directly helped the Korean company profit and, if so, how much of that profit is attributable to that element.\nThe issue was raised of determining a legal test for what constitutes an article of manufacture and a component of such a thing — that task now is with the Federal Circuit. Depending on how the test is construed, Samsung may still be liable for some damages up to $399 million.\nSamsung was found liable by the Federal Circuit for $120 million in damages over the infringement of other patents such as “slide to unlock.”\nThe post SCOTUS favors Samsung against Apple in design patent suit, case continues appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "on Tuesday December 06, 2016 @06:20PM from the air-exposure dept. Last month, Apple announced a repair program for a \"small number\" of iPhone 6s phones that suffer from faulty batteries. The phones that were affected by this fault were manufactured between September and October 2015. Two weeks later, Apple now says the fault was caused by overexposure to \"controlled ambient air .\" Ars Technica reports: The same press release -- issued only in China so far, but available in English if you scroll down -- says that some owners of later iPhone 6S models are also reporting problems with unexpected shutdowns. Apple isn't replacing those batteries just yet, but the company says that an iOS update \"available next week\" will add \"additional diagnostic capability\" that will allow Apple to better track down and diagnose the causes of these shutdowns. It \"may potentially help [Apple] improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown,\" as well. Those improvements will be included in future iOS updates. Apple says that the battery problem \"is not a safety issue,\" an important thing to note given the way the Galaxy Note 7 blew up in Samsung's face. The software update that Apple mentions in the release is almost certainly iOS 10.2, which is currently in its sixth beta build. The update will be the first major bug-fix release since October's iOS 10.1, and it also includes a handful of other changes like new and redesigned emoji, the TV app that Apple demoed at its last product event, and other features.",

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File)   (1) Washington • The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. Cupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. VIDEOS TOP JOBS At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. But the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Samsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. In a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" A Samsung spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. On the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"",

      "text": "Samsung wins key Supreme Court ruling in patent dispute with Apple But the battle is far from over on Dec 6, 2016, 5:00 PM TechSpot \nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of Samsung in its long-running legal dispute with Apple for infringing on the design of the iPhone. The case is far from over, however, as the high court deferred back to lower courts to have the original award for damages reexamined. \nAs The Wall Street Journal recounts , jurors in 2012 found that 11 smartphone models from Samsung infringed on various Apple design patents. The South Korean electronics giant was ordered to pay a $399 million award to Apple as a result but Samsung – and many others in the tech community – disagreed with how that sum was calculated. \nApple and various supporters including Crocs Inc., Tiffany & Co. and Adidas AG argued that it was entitled to all of the profits generated by Samsung’s infringing devices. Samsung, meanwhile, felt it shouldn’t have to hand over all profits from those devices seeing as just a small portion of the overall complex device was found to be infringing. \nWriting on behalf of the unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the holder of a design patent isn’t always entitled to the total profits on an infringed device sold to consumers. In the case of a multi-component device like a smartphone, a patent holder sometimes may only be entitled to the profits attributed to a specific component (in this case, the screen and case design of the 11 phones) of said infringing device. \nRather than apply its ruling to the case, the high court instead said a lower court should figure that out.

      "text": "Share \nToday marks a new turn in the seemingly unending patent war between Apple and Samsung. The Supreme Court sided with Samsung , ruling 8-0 to overturn an appeals court ruling from 2015. The court heard arguments in the case back in October — the first time the Supreme Court had addressed this type of patent dispute in over 120 years . \nIt all started back in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, alleging that several features of Samsung’s smartphones — like its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features — were taken from proprietary Apple technology. \nSamsung argued that it shouldn’t have had to turn over the whole of its smartphone profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents. They noted that elements that may have infringed on the iPhone’s design patents contributed only a small portion to the design of the overall smartphone product. \n“A smartphone contains thousands of parts, many of which are functional rather than ornamental,” Samsung argued in court documents from February. “The law of the smartphone cannot follow reflexively from the law of the spoon.” \nA Samsung spokesperson wrote in a statement, “For decades, we have invested heavily in developing revolutionary innovations in the mobile industry and beyond. We are confident that our products do not infringe on Apple’s design patents, and we will continue to take appropriate measures to protect our products and our intellectual property.” \nThe Supreme Court decision effectively means that patent infringement for any one element of a product design should be enforced differently from the infringement of an entire design. This gives Samsung an opportunity to try to reclaim $399 million of the $548 million it paid out to Apple back in December 2015. Back in 2012, Samsung was initially ordered to pay nearly $1 billion — but the fees were cut back to the $548 million figure through a series of additional court cases. \nThe case will now reportedly return to lower courts for further proceedings to address remaining issues.",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple’s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.

      "text": "In a unanimous ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court held that Samsung will not have to pay $400 million to Apple after adapting aspects of the iPhone’s design into their own product, a decision many in the tech industry deemed a win for innovation.\nA federal law mandates that any company found liable for violating a design patent on an “article of manufacture” must give its total profits to the patent’s owner. In this case, which began in 2012, Apple alleged that Samsung had infringed upon specific design elements of the iPhone to create its own smartphone, namely the black, rectangular build with round corners and 16 colorful icons on the front screen.\nA jury found that Samsung’s design had infringed on that patent, and the circuit court upheld the ruling in Apple’s favor last year, awarding the entire $399 million Samsung made in profits from the phone to Apple. The case launched a debate about design patents in the modern era and the importance of design in addition to functions and capabilities.\nRecommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know While Apple and its supporters had argued that Samsung’s similar design would weaken protections of new creations, Samsung and its proponents said the laws would stifle innovation.\n40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know In its ruling last year, the appeals court noted that \"an award of a defendant’s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world,\" but that \"those are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\"\nThe court added, \"We are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it.\"\nBut the Supreme Court disagreed .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court, saying that such “articles of manufacture” can be defined in two ways: the entire product marketed to consumers, like the phones, or just pieces of the product that infringe on the patent, like its design. In ruling that the “article of manufacture” is always the entire product and not its components, the lower court made a judgment in error, the nation’s highest court found.\n“In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “In the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.”\nThe case was the first design patent issue presented to the court in more than a century, and many had come to believe that design patents as applied to an entire product were out of touch with modern innovation. They argued that the penalties, such as the nearly $400 million one levied against Samsung, could be disproportionate to the offense and make companies wary of innovation overlap.\nWhile the court failed to determine whether the whole phone or parts of it constituted the “article of manufacture,” its ruling did overturn a large swath of patent law.\n\"No longer can a patent holder get all of the profits from the sales of a product infringing a design patent,\" said Case Collard, an intellectual property partner at Dorsey & Whitney, reported USA Today. \"Instead, they may recover the profits attributable to the infringing feature.\"\nThe Supreme Court remanded the case to the appeals court to determine the size of the penalty Samsung should pay.",

      "text": "By Brent Kendall\nSupreme Court says lower court should recalculate patent-infringement penalty\nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled a lower court should reconsider how much money Samsung Electronics Co. owes rival Apple Inc. for infringing patents on the iPhone's design.\nSamsung (005930.SE) has been challenging a $399 million award to Apple (AAPL) after jurors in 2012 found that 11 smartphone models from the South Korean electronics giant infringed Apple's design patents.\nThe high court agreed to hear the case to clarify how courts should compute monetary damages for design-patent infringement. Apple argued it was entitled to the total profits on Samsung's infringing products. Samsung argued that it shouldn't have to hand over all of its profits on the phones because the design was only one component of those complex devices.\nThe Supreme Court said an appeals court used the wrong analysis when it ruled for Apple. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for a unanimous court, said the holder of a design patent isn't always entitled to the total profits on an infringing product sold to consumers. In multicomponent products, sometimes a patent holder will only be entitled to the infringer's total profits on the specific component that infringed the patent, she said. The justices said a lower court should sort out that issue.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-lower-court-should-reconsider-what-samsung-owes-apple-1481038167).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump's message sparks anger in China (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-message-sparks-anger-in-china-1480989202?mod=mktw).\nDonald Trump shuffles the idealogical deck (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-shuffles-the-ideological-deck-1480955194?mod=mktw).\n-Brent Kendall ;\n 1739ET\n ",

      "title": "Apple's sky-high prices for its MacBooks have me taking a second look at Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 - CNET",
      "text": "Up Next Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple \nFor the past six months I've been in the market for a new laptop, and like a lot of people, I put off making a purchase until Apple unveiled its redesigned MacBook Pros, which were officially introduced in late October and shipped last month. \nFor those who missed the release, the new MacBook Pros come in entry-level and premium versions. Both are slimmed-down versions of their predecessors -- essentially a MacBook Pro in a MacBook Air chassis with USB-C ports instead of standard USB -- but the premium model has an integrated Touch Bar OLED strip that takes the place of the old-school function keys at the top of the keyboard. \nCNET editor Dan Ackerman gave that MacBook Pro with Touch Bar a 4.5-star rating, calling it a \"Second-screen dream machine\" and thanks to that \"smart, useful Touch Bar,\" the premium model was well worth splurging on over the standard streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro . \nApple's Touch Bar is a nice touch, but it'll cost you. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET \nIt's a great machine. I've played around with it. I've touched the Touch Bar. I've looked at this laptop longingly, open and closed. There's only one problem: It starts at $1,800 for the 13-inch model and $2,400 for the 15-inch model, which includes a step-up Core i7 processor and more RAM (16GB) in its base model. It's also worth mentioning that the new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, sans Touch Bar, starts at $1,500 -- or $200 more than last year's MacBook Pro. \nThese high prices and some heated debate online over the utility of the Touch Bar may have raised some eyebrows, but Apple managed to put up record sales number during the launch windows. \n\"We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,\" Phil Schiller, Apple SVP, told The Independent , a UK publication, on November 2. \nNot surprising, considering that months of rumors of a pending MacBook Pro redesign left plenty of folks -- like me -- holding off on their MacBook purchases. Demand was sky-high. \n(Apple did not respond to CNET's request for follow-up comment on the MacBook Pro's pricing or demand.) \nSelect models of the Surface Pro 4 are frequently on sale. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET \nWhile I was tempted to bite, I didn't. I felt that if I was going to get a new MacBook Pro, I might as well get the one with the Touch Bar because if I got the standard one I thought there'd always be a little part of me that would wish I'd paid a few hundred bucks more and gotten the extra touch strip. Once you're $1,500 in the hole, you might as well go to $1,800, my reasoning went. \nBut then I thought, \"$1,800 is a lot of money, do I really need to spend that much on a laptop?\" I'm not a graphic designer. Sure, I might do a little editing of family videos, but on the whole, I'm not doing anything that would tax most current laptops -- why not get a lightweight Windows tablet PC with a full touch screen interface that costs significantly less? After all, I'm kind of in the market for an iPad, but with prices for iPads also being high, I haven't bothered to buy a new one (I use an iPad Air that was given to my wife as a gift and still works fine). So, why not combine two purchases into one? \nThen came Black Friday . Best Buy was selling the entry-level Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core m3 plus a keyboard for $600. By comparison, Apple's beautifully designed m3-powered 12-inch MacBook , which I also had my eye on, starts at $1,300. \nApple's super-svelte 12-inch MacBook is powered by an Intel Core m3 chip and starts at $1,300. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET \nI haven't tried the entry-level version of the Surface Pro 4, but I have tried step-up models with Core i5 and Core i7 chips. I like the Type keyboard cover well enough, although my one gripe is that the integrated touchpad isn't nearly as good as the MacBook's (using a wireless mouse or Surface Pen for navigation is my preference). I may be slightly more partial to Mac OS X, but I'm also a little bored with it, and have never had anything against Windows 10 , so it's all good. \nAm I open to another tablet PC or lightweight convertible PC (a laptop that converts into a tablet)? Microsoft's Surface Book , for example, or something from Lenovo or HP? Sure, but for the moment I've zeroed in on the Surface Pro 4. It's a mature product, on its fourth iteration with presumably a fifth-generation model coming next year, and there are deals to be had on it. \nAs part of its 12 Days of Deals sale, on Thursday, December 8, Microsoft will have the entry-level m3-powered Pro 4 on sale for $649 (with a sleeve but no a keyboard cover) and on Friday, December 16, it's offering a $200 discount on select Pro 4 models, with a free Type Cover thrown in. And I wouldn't be surprised to see post-holiday sales on select Surface Book Pro 4 models. \nI'm not sure that \" Apple just handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom ,\" as my colleague Sean Hollister wrote shortly after Apple first unveiled the new MacBook Pros. But those high prices on MacBooks have certainly opened the door to folks to look elsewhere for a more-affordable lightweight laptop that has the added appeal of doubling as a tablet. \nIf Microsoft could improve its Windows app store -- and by improve, I mean offer a wider range of cheap apps to compete with Apple's huge selection of iOS apps -- it'd be a no-brainer. However, as it stands, depending on the deal you can get, it may be a jump worth making. Share your voice",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple’s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale.\nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.\nApple described its conduct as “an oversight in paperwork” that didn’t affect its health and safety standards.",

      "text": "IDC says Apple Watch sales are tanking, but Apple CEO Tim Cook says that’s not so. In fact, he says Apple Watch sales are going strong and the company is on track for a record quarter. Apple Watch sales might be tanking, or maybe not \nYesterday, IDC released a report saying Apple Watch sales are down more than 70% year-over-year. The research firm estimated Apple sold 3.9 million smartwatches during its third quarter last year, and this year that number dropped to 1.1 million. \nMr. Cook responded to the IDC report telling Reuters, \nSales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch. \nThat doesn’t fit with IDC’s numbers, which isn’t too surprising considering Apple doesn’t share Apple Watch sales figures. Instead, Apple is pulling a page from Amazon’s book—the company never says how many Kindle ebook readers it sells—and keeping the sales numbers secret. \nAmazon hasn’t ever offered concrete sales numbers for its Kindle ebook reader line and instead shows slick charts with climbing bars. The implication is that Kindle sales are higher each quarter without any numbers or real basis for comparison. \nThat leaves IDC and other analysis firms to cobble together their own systems for estimating Apple Watch sales. The numbers they come up with are compiled from a variety of sources such as shopper surveys and retailer data, painting a partial picture of Apple’s sales without an easy way to verify their conclusions. \nWhile analysis firms don’t have an easy way to verify their conclusions, they also don’t have a way to verify Mr. Cook’s statement. In essence, we’re left having to accept what he said as fact, or assume he’s covering up weak quarterly sales. \nIf Apple Watch sales really are tanking we’ll eventually know when suppliers report multiple quarters where the company cuts parts orders, or if it’s quietly dropped from the product lineup. \nIDC is also looking at sales from the quarter before Apple Watch Series 2 was shipping, so it’s possible their numbers are right and Apple’s record breaking proclamation is true, too. Apple Watch buyers holding out for the Series 2 launch may have pushed sales numbers down ahead of the new models, then bumped them back up after the rollout. \nMr. Cook hinted that sales are just fine adding, “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.” \nStill, that doesn’t give us anything more than the idea that sales are better than they were. Without a basis for comparison, there isn’t any way of knowing if Mr. Cook is talking about thousands of watches, or millions. \nApple made it clear before the original Apple Watch shipped nearly two years ago that the sales numbers wouldn’t be broken out. That hasn’t changed with the Apple Watch Series 2 launch this year, and it won’t likely change any time soon. Share this:",

      "title": "Amazon Go: a Retail Store with No Checkout Lines (Kind of Like Apple)",
      "text": "| Analysis \nAmazon has taken a page from Apple’s book and maybe one-upped it, or at least brought it closer to home. The company announced Amazon Go , a combination retail store and app that allows you to walk in, scan a code, and walk out without doing going through any form of checkout line. \nApple’s been doing something similar for years at its Apple retail locations (formerly Apple Stores). You can walk in, photograph a product with your Apple Store app, charge a credit card attached to your iTunes account, and leave. Amazon Go \nAmazon’s approach is both a little more hamfisted and more expansive at the same time. According to the video below and the Amazon Go webpage, you gain entrance to the store by scanning a QR code you produce using the Amazon Go app. \nWhile you’re there, Amazon tracks you and everything you put in your bag using cameras, sensors, and machine learning. Once you leave, you’re charged for the things you take. No checkout. No fuss. \nThe company said Amazon Go stores will feature, “ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options made fresh every day by our on-site chefs and favorite local kitchens and bakeries.” There will also be staples such as, “bread and milk to artisan cheeses and locally made chocolates.” Hipsters take note. The Future \nSelf-checkout stands were a natural evolution of grocery stores and other retail establishments. As the machines become cheaper and more reliable, they will eventually cost a fraction of what paying a human costs. \nAmazon’s approach goes a step beyond that, and it’s the kind of step Amazon is ideally suited to take. The company’s cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning expertise, and logistical skills give Amazon a huge leg up on pushing such boundaries.

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \n“Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7.” That’s the tag line to Apple’s newest commercial, iPhone 7 – Romeo and Juliet . It features a performance from Shakespeare’s play of the same name with children in the starring role. The piece looks like a movie at first, but then you see the kids on a stage and a proud parent filming his daughter (Juliet) with his iPhone 7. It’s touching, It’s cute. I suspect it will tug all the right strings for parents with younger kids. I also think it’s a powerful message that paints a solid picture of how good iPhone 7’s camera is without it being a ‘splainy commercial.",

      "text": " Google+\nKim Hong-Ji/REUTERS/file\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 (left) and Apple’s iPhone 5 are pictured in Seoul in 2013.\nBy Sam Hananel Associated Press December 06, 2016\nWASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.\nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices.\nAdvertisement\nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.\nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay ‘‘total profit.’’ Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.\nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.\nAdvertisement\nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look.",

      "text": "var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); CUPERTINO — Apple has agreed to pay $450,000 as part of a settlement with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, which alleged it found hazardous waste violations at two electronic waste shredding facilities that the tech firm operated without initially informing the state.\nApple suggested Tuesday that the violations were due to an oversight in filing the proper paperwork and that its safety standards at both plants had never put the public at risk. But the department claimed the tech firm had violated the state’s health and safety codes.\n“Compliance with the hazardous waste law is fundamental in protecting the health of workers and communities as well as the environment,” said Keith Kihara, chief of DTSC’s enforcement division, in a statement. “We are encouraged by the settlement and that Apple is working with us to take the necessary steps to comply with California’s hazardous waste law.”\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple processed 1.1 million pounds of electronic waste at a Cupertino facility on Tantau Avenue without DTSC’s knowledge. The company closed the facility in January 2013 and moved its operations to a facility in Sunnyvale, where workers processed 803,518 pounds of electronic waste before Apple informed the state of the plant’s existence, according to a complaint filed on behalf of the agency.\nAfter the DTSC inspected the Sunnyvale facility in June 2013, it discovered that Apple produced a fine dust that also was vacuumed from the floors and then shipped to a recycling facility in Roseville. The department tested the dust and waste collected from the floors and found it contained hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles.\nThe recycling plant in Roseville isn’t authorized to handle hazardous waste, but the plant didn’t know the waste was hazardous because Apple didn’t properly label the shipments.\nDTSC also found out, after reviewing Apple’s record, that the tech firm had opened and closed an electronic waste plant in Cupertino without letting the state know, and had processed similar electronic waste there.\nThe agency claimed that Apple not only failed to submit the proper paperwork for both facilities, but that it was disposing and transporting hazardous waste in a way that ran afoul of the state’s health and safety codes. Apple also didn’t label or mark used oil containers as hazardous waste.\nOn Tuesday, an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the whole issue arose over an “oversight in filing paperwork” when it closed its recycling facility in Cupertino to expand to a larger site.",

      "text": "Apple's new ad touts the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus' camera credentials. It depicts how these devices can take cinema-quality videos to capture precious family milestones. ( Apple | YouTube ) Advertisement \nTo take advantage of the holiday season, tech companies are pulling all the stops to market their devices. Apple, for example, opted to poach some ideas from Shakespeare and proceeded on tapping Romeo and Juliet to advertise the iPhone 7 and its camera technology. Romeo And Juliet \nThe 30-second promotional video depicted two children playing Romeo and Julie t. It started with a scene set in a breathtaking location. A girl is running toward a palace and then the scene shifted to an indoor shot that has vaulted ceiling for its backdrop. \nEverything was quite movie-like and that is what Apple wanted the viewer to feel. \nIn truth, the clip was about a children's play being captured by a father. At the end of the video, it was revealed that there was no fancy mise-en-scène since the children were actually acting on a stage with no real palace or soaring domes that established the cinematic credentials of the first shots. \nBut the idea has been conveyed: if you want to preserve your family's best moments in cinema-quality videos, iPhone 7 has you covered. \nLet us take a look at iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' camera technologies if they could really walk the talk. iPhone Camera Specs \nBoth iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus sports optical 12-megapixel sensors. The Plus variant has a second sensor that is capable of wide-angle and telephoto features. Both devices also have new image signal processors, optical image stabilization, and wide color gamut. \nThese collectively led to improved performance in comparison with previous models. As has been implied in the ad, they also underpin the iPhone 7 Plus ' studio-like camera capabilities. Apple Holiday Ad And The iPhone's Future \nThe Romeo and Juliet advertisement follows the latest holiday ad from Apple called Frankie's Holiday . This ad is longer and is headlined by Frankenstein in a heartwarming story that explores the theme, \"open your heart to everyone.\" The video also focuses more on the iPhone, which is a slight departure from previous Apple holiday ads that tend to promote all of its devices . \nIt seems that Apple is really pushing its smartphones harder this year and beyond. Analysts believe that 2017 could be a very good and record-setting year for the company based on reports that Apple is preparing a huge upgrade cycle that could possibly include as much as 150 million units. \nThe upcoming iPhone 8 is rumored to be rocking a premium OLED display and a completely redesigned form factor.

      "text": "Samsung \nIt's been a rough year for Samsung, but the Supreme Court just gave the company a big early Christmas present... or at the very least, they decided to deny one to Apple. Reuters reports that the highest court decided in unanimous 8-0 decision that the $399 million in damages sought by Apple in the years-old iPhone design patent case was too much, siding with Samsung's appeal which said that copying only certain elements of the iPhone design patent didn't entitle Apple to all profits made from an infringing phone. \nIn fact all of that money and more has already been paid to Apple - the South Korean manufacturer made a $548 million payment in December of last year as a result of the original case, decided in favor of Apple way back in 2012. (Yes, we've been talking about this design patent lawsuit for over four years now - the original round of lawsuits in over a dozen countries began in 2011.) Samsung appealed the specific amount on the basis of \"article of manufacture,\" successfully arguing that the entire phone (and the revenue and profit made from its sale) couldn't be held as damaging when only part of its design infringed on the patent. The Supreme Court Justices did not go so far as to give a definition or test for the article of manufacture, leaving that lengthy and detailed process to the federal appeals court, where the lawsuit will now return. You can read the full decision by Justice Sotomayor here (PDF link). \nSamsung has successfully chopped the initial $1.05 billion damage ruling in half over the last few years. And now... who knows. At least a portion of that $399 million figure does belong to Apple - Samsung's guilt in the case was established years ago - but exactly how much might take another year, or two, or three, to determine. If you're a fan of endless litigation arguments and ridiculously minute examinations of patent documents, you'll be happy to know that this case isn't going away any time soon. Source:",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Related content",

      "text": "Pin it Share SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. The agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. California's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. Regulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. Apple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. The complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. Regulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. Settling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Reblog",
