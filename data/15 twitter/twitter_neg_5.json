NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and/or using this Photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. Mandatory Copyright Notice: Copyright 2014 NBAE (Photo by Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images) \nThe Clippers are off to a 10-1 start this season and are crushing opponents by an average of 16.6 points per game. They've led by 40 points in two different contests, and can confidently say they're the league's best team 11 games in.\nDoc Rivers, of course, wants no part of that label, considering how the Clippers have suffered earlier-than-expected playoff exits four years straight. But he and Paul Pierce do believe those past failures are what's fueling L.A.'s extremely strong start.\n\"You get tired of losing,\" Rivers said, via ESPN . \"The whole second-round [playoff ceiling the franchise has yet to break through] ... I don't think our guys care about that, they just want to win. At some point guys just get tired of losing. I think our guys are at that point.\" \nMore from FoxSports Heat look to end skid as they host Bucks on Thursday Colin's 8 Favorite NBA Players for the 2016-17 NBA Season | THE HERD Wolves Fastbreak: Disturbing trend continues for Minnesota Hawks LIVE To Go: Atlanta holds off shorthanded Heat \"This team has a lot of built-up frustration,\" Pierce said. \"They have first-round losses, second-round losses. ... This looks like built-up frustration over here.\" \nThe Clippers have made it to the second round of the postseason three out of the past five years, and never further in their franchise history. It's a long season, and a lot can go wrong -- just ask Blake Griffin about that. But if L.A. can keep it together, it looks as though the Clippers will have a real shot at contending for a title, which is something very few pundits predicted before the season began.",

NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. Mandatory Copyright Notice: Copyright 2016 NBAE (Photo by Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images) \nNot much should bother Portland Trail Blazers swingman Allen Crabbe these days. The fourth-year guard signed a four-year, $75 million deal over the summer despite coming off a season in which he averaged just 10.3 points, which was a career high.\nBut just because Crabbe's making $18.5 million this season doesn't mean he's immune from some heckling. And he got a heaping helping of it earlier this seasons in Memphis.\nA Grizzlies fan decided to take shots at Crabbe's hairdo -- a style that looks pretty similar to New York Giants star Odell Beckham's blonde look.\nMore from FoxSports Hot Air: There's only 1 Devin Booker, but many lookalikes Heat look to end skid as they host Bucks on Thursday Sounding Off: Is 'Vinsanity' back in business?

While it’s no longer the game-changer we once thought it’d be, these scannable codes still have utility. Snapchat, for example, used them to add other users without having to search. A simple scan and you were now following Carrot Top, or you know, someone else. \nStarting today, Twitter has QR codes that work the same way Snapchat’s do. Well, for some users anyway. \nTo create the code, just go to your profile and click Settings. You should be met with a menu that now includes QR Code. If so, just click it and create your own. From here it’s as simple as taking a screenshot and sharing it on other social media platforms, in email, or even printing it on a business card. \nThe QR creator also has a QR reader so you can scan other Twitter users’s codes. To access it, just QR scanner button under the code. Press it again to get back to the QR creator. \nUnfortunately, it’s not available to all users just yet, but stay patient; it’s coming.",

      "text": "Share Tweet \n(Reuters) - Twitter has suspended several accounts linked to the alt-right movement, a loosely organized group that embraces far-right ideologies including white nationalism, USA Today reported. \nThe accounts suspended by Twitter, which has been criticized for not stopping abusive behavior on its platform, include that of Richard Spencer, who has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the United States, the newspaper reported on Wednesday. (http://usat.ly/2fXyXDo) \nThe alt-right movement came to the fore during the U.S. presidential campaign, especially after Republican nominee Donald Trump added Steve Bannon to his campaign team. \nBannon, who has since been named Trump's chief White House strategist, formerly headed Breitbart News, a website and voice for the alt-right movement. \n\"I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt-right,\" Spencer, who has a verified Twitter account, said in a YouTube video entitled \"Knight of the Long Knives\" responding to the suspension. \nThe move by the microblogging service, which did not immediately respond for requests for comment, followed its announcement on Tuesday that it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying. \nUSA Today said the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit organization that tracks what it sees as hate groups and other extremists, had asked Twitter to remove more than 100 accounts of white supremacists who violated Twitter's terms of service. \nOthers whose accounts have been suspended include Pax Dickinson, founder of alt-right site Wesearchr; an alt-right internet personality who goes by the fake name Ricky Vaughn; and blogger Paul Town, who describes himself as \"the leading thoughtleader of alt-right,\" CNN reported.

(File) \nTwitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent purge. Twitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment, adding that it will take action against repeat offenders. \nWatch What Else Is Making News \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, says his personal Twitter account, as well as the accounts for the institute and his magazine, were all suspended this week without notification. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended. Spencer, who is credited with popularizing the term “alt-right,” says he didn’t tweet anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He calls the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints.",

      "text": "Twitter adds QR codes for some reason When clicking the follow button feels too hard share Twitter today introduced QR codes into its apps for iOS and Android, because not having QR codes was Twitter’s biggest existential threat as a business and the main reason that no one ever followed anyone on the service. Before now, to follow someone on Twitter you had to click a giant button that said “Follow” at the top of their profile. Ugh, no thanks! Now, following someone is as easy as navigating to your profile, tapping the gear icon, tapping “QR code,” tapping the blue button to open the scanner, and scanning your friend’s QR code, assuming they have also navigated to their own profile and excavated the QR code and physically handed their device to you. On Android, the QR code appears both in the menu you find by clicking the ellipsis (...) in your profile, and in the slide-out menu on the left under night mode. On iOS, the scanner only appears in the profile. If you manage to find your QR code, you can share it using your phone’s share sheet. QR codes, whose visual aesthetic some have compared to robot vomit, are a popular way to add friends on Snapchat, and an unpopular way to add friends on Facebook Messenger. As of today, they are also on Twitter. For more previews of coming Twitter features, follow their head of product development .",

      "text": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts Associated Press Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Credit: The Associated Press FILE - This Friday, Oct. 18, 2013, file photo, shows a Twitter app on an iPhone screen in New York. Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent purge, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. Twitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment, adding that it will take action against repeat offenders.(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) comments NEW YORK — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence.\nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet.\nThe alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\"\nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist.\nTHE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED\nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification.\nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term \"alt-right,\" says he has never called for violence and hasn't tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints.\nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly.\n\"This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,\" he said. \"Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it's also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber.\n\"Twitter is not just some website. It's a public space and we have to treat it that way.\"\nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn't given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur.\nDickinson says he's appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter a day. Spencer says he doesn't plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology.\nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday.\nBACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT\nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it's especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals.\nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform.\nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos.\n___\nFollow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler .

Twitter has banned the accounts of several alt-right and white nationalist users. (AFP/Getty Images) David Pierson and Paresh Dave launched 10 years ago innocently enough with co-founder Jack Dorsey tweeting about having lunch and grabbing tea after yoga.\nBack then, there was no certainty the micro-blogging platform he designed would become anything more than an outlet for sharing daily minutiae. But with its core principle that little was too trivial, or too outrageous, to tweet, Twitter grew over the years into a vibrant and at times abrasive hub for news, ideas and opinions — a town square for the digital age. \nNow, in the aftermath of a bitterly divisive presidential campaign that has given license for hate groups and white nationalists to tout their ideas more openly, Twitter appears to be having second thoughts. \nLong criticized for allowing bullies, terrorists and bigots to run rampant to the detriment of its own bottom line, Twitter made a surprising move Tuesday by banning a slew of accounts belonging to white nationalists and leaders of the alt-right movement — which holds that traditional conservatives don't sufficiently protect the interests of white people. \nThe San Francisco company declined to comment or identify which accounts were banned, but sent The Times a statement reiterating its policies restricting hateful conduct that targets people “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.” \nAmong recently banned Twitter users are Richard Spencer, head of the alt-right think tank National Policy Institute, and other alt-right leaders, including Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers, according to news reports. \nA source familiar with the situation who declined to be named commenting on a private matter shared with The Times several of the offending tweets, among the least vulgar of which read: \"You are a genocidal, sub-human.” It continued: “and feminism is cancer, you diseased whore.\" \nSocial media apps have become a free-speech battleground over the last five years with the companies behind them struggling   rein in the very thing that makes them so appealing — the ability to speak freely, and in some cases anonymously, to anyone who also has an account, including celebrities, world leaders and complete strangers. \nThe anything-goes approach can benefit the firms. Moderating content takes time and money and is seen as a potential risk to user growth. By largely staying out of the fray, companies also minimize the risk of wading into legal battles over libel or defamation. \nBut with a massive backlash over harassment they are starting to walk this back. Policies continue to evolve as critics assail rules as stringent or too soft. Mothers decry takedowns of their breast-feeding photos under anti-nudity policies. And U.S. officials complain not enough is being done to rid social media of terrorists, who others might describe as religious activists. \nWhat’s clear is the apps are powerful and that they retain significant policing control. With nearly 1.8 billion users on Facebook and more than 300 million each on Twitter and Snapchat, the services give anyone the chance to instantly spread a message to millions of people without the need for special equipment or relationships. \nTo keep their platforms havens for discussions, the companies maintain broad discretion to kill users’ accounts whenever they choose. For example, Twitter’s contract with users give it the right to “suspend or terminate” an account “at any time for any or no reason.” \nIn an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Spencer denied he violated Twitter’s user agreement and called his ban a crackdown on free speech. \n“It's been a five-year run for me on Twitter,” Spencer said. “It's over. It was the main way I spoke out. They need to issue some kind of apology and make it clear they are not going to crack down on viewpoints. Are they going to now ban Donald Trump's account?” \nSpencer said he did not engage in harassment, which he conceded alt-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulous was guilty of when he was banned from Twitter in July for sending a string of tweets attacking “Saturday Night Live” actress Leslie Jones. As a result, Spencer believes his 1st Amendment rights — which ensure freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly and petition — are being violated by Twitter. \nThe 1st Amendment prevents the government from enacting laws that violate free speech.It does not apply to companies — even ones like Twitter that have come to serve as virtual town halls where anything seems to go. Many an employee has been fired for sending an offensive tweet. \n“They don’t have any obligation to have anyone use their technology they don’t want,” said Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project. “We honor the 1st Amendment as an idea. Only the government is allowed to restrict free speech.” \nBeirich’s group reported the account of Spencer and others for promoting white nationalist ideas and using Twitter to organize events for “hate groups,” according to Keegan Hankes, managing data intelligence analyst at the center. \nHankes pointed to Twitter posts like Spencer's from the day of this year's Super Bowl: \"The criminally insane Africans from my geographic region shall defeat those from your metropolitan area!\" \nFree speech advocates said it was wrong for white nationalists to argue their rights had been violated. They say their discriminatory words work to chill the rights of others. \n“If your speech is so hostile or threatening or distressing to me that I go silent, then my freedom of expression has been impinged upon,” said Susan Benesch, adjunct associate professor at American University and director of the Dangerous Speech Project. “Even in the U.S., where we have the most speech protective law, some acts of speech are illegal. Nobody has suggested that to fulfill freedom of expression every act of speech has to be allowed. It doesn’t mean you can post absolutely anything. Everyone is figuring out how to draw the lines.”   \nTimes staff writer Jaweed Kaleem contributed to this article. \nFollow me @dhpierson and @peard33 on Twitter",

Post to Facebook Twitter's alt-right purge could backfire Banning accounts curbs free speech and could empower white nationalists, critics say.  //usat.ly/2fyctKN   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Twitter's alt-right purge could backfire Jessica Guynn , USA TODAY 7:40 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 Twitter's mass purge of alt-right accounts could backfire by amplifying hate speech, critics warn. (Photo: Yasuyoshi Chiba, AFP/Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Twitter's move to ban alt-right accounts on the heels of a bitterly divisive election has drawn the company into a heated debate over who gets to speak freely on its platform. \nCritics warn the mass ban could backfire. Rather than silencing the alt right, Twitter risks amplifying the message from white nationalists and other fringe groups. \nWhen reached by phone, Matthew Heimbach was practically ebullient about Twitter's purge of alt-right accounts. In 2015, Heimbach founded the Traditionalist Worker Party, a political party of white separatists who want different homelands inside the U.S. for whites and blacks. Twitter suspends alt-right accounts \n\"The more the system tries to make the ideas of nationalism taboo, the more people are going to be interested and seek them out,\" he said. \"It's helping us propagate our message every time they try very clumsily to shut us down.\" \nFor years, Twitter billed itself as the \"free speech wing of the free speech party.\" \nBut it's been under growing public pressure over its failure to stop hate speech, including the targeting of actress Leslie Jones by racists. The alt right gained prominence during the presidential election for using social media to spread its ideology through racist viral memes and anonymous attacks on users from pro-Donald Trump accounts . \nOn Tuesday Twitter banned the accounts of prominent members of the alt-right . The move put the social media service in the dicey position of deciding what is acceptable speech and what is not. \nTwitter's head of safety, Del Harvey, told USA TODAY this week that Twitter is drawing a hard line between free speech and \"behavior that is intended to silence others.\" The first target: the alt-right movement, a loosely organized group that includes individuals who dream of a white \"ethno-state.\" \nHeimbach's account was not suspended but he says he was warned by Twitter on Wednesday that some of his tweets violated the company's terms of service and was told to delete them. \nWhite nationalists leveled allegations of one-sided censorship against Twitter on Wednesday. The lack of transparency into why Twitter suspended the accounts in question, such as that of alt-right leader Richard Spencer, fueled perception in some quarters that Twitter is arbitrarily stifling speech. \nSpencer, who coined the term alt right in 2010, says he was tossed from Twitter for his political views — he wants to segregate the United States by racial groups — not for harassing Twitter users. \nIn a statement, Twitter said: \"The Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies.\" Twitter says it's cracking down on hate speech \nAs a private company, Twitter has no obligation to provide a forum for white nationalist views and is subject only to non-discrimination laws, said George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center. \n\"The First Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights that protects the individual from government. It doesn't protect the individual from private companies. A company is free to do really whatever it wants,\" Freeman said. \"There really are no speech rights accorded to the public that uses the private company. Twitter is perfectly within its legal rights.\" \nNick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com, a libertarian website, says he believes Twitter blundered in shutting down alt-right accounts. \nInstead of restricting speech and denying the alt right a platform, Twitter should give individual users greater power to regulate what they see and don't see on the service, he said. \n\"Why cede any kind of magical powers to the stupidity of the alt right? Let them say what they want to say in public and be rebuffed or be ignored,\" Gillespie said. \"You are not helping to combat it by walling it off and saying it's so repugnant that individual users can't block them if they want, can't mute them or engage them if they want.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Twitter is buckling down on hate speech on the platform, a move marked by updates to its abuse policy and, seemingly, by its removal of several accounts aligned with the alt-right.\nA Twitter account described as \"America's premier source for race-realist thought\" Source: Twitter USA Today reported on Wednesday that Twitter had suspended the account of Richard Spencer, a leading voice of the alt-right movement , which is rooted in white supremacist, misogynistic and authoritarian ideologies.\n\"I am alive physically, but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt-right,\" Spencer says in a YouTube video .\nSpencer's verified account was removed on Wednesday alongside accounts for his think tank, National Policy Institute, his online magazine, Radix Journal, and a book publishing company Spencer runs, Washington Summit Publishers.\n\"What this leads me to believe is that there was some kind of coordinated effort to just wipe out alt-right Twitter,\" Spencer says in the video. \"I think Twitter, and I'm sure Facebook too and some others, I think they are deeply triggered by Trump's election. ... Social media did help elect Trump. This is a clear sign that we have power.\"\n\"This is corporate Stalinism,\" Spencer told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Tuesday. \"Twitter is trying to airbrush the alt-right out of existence. They're clearly afraid. They will fail!\"\nThe accounts of other alt right Twitter users — Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers — were also suspended, according to the Washington Post .\n\"The Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies,\" a Twitter representative said when reached for comment on the recent suspensions.\nThis isn't Twitter's first removal of an account associated with the alt-right movement — it permanently banned Milo Yiannopoulous from the site in July after he spearheaded a racist and misogynistic trolling spree against actress Leslie Jones.\n\"We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter. We agree,\" Twitter said in a statement to BuzzFeed following the ban. \"We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders.\"\nBut Wednesday's purge of several alt-right accounts didn't clear out all of the movement's talking heads on Twitter. For example, Matthew Heimbach , who is outspoken about his alt-right views and the \" fresh face of fascism ,\" is still active — and verified.\nHeimbach is an outspoken white nationalist on Twitter Source: Twitter Hateful conduct is a violation of Twitter's policy , which states users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\nIf Twitter users aligned with the alt-right violate the hateful conduct policy, Twitter may ask the user to remove the tweet or suspend their account altogether, depending on the severity.\nSignal boost required. Via verified status @twitter are giving respectability to openly pro-genocide Nazis. https://t.co/xWaBIyIzsC\nIf this policy leads to the mass suspension of alt-right users, it seems they already have in mind other places to go. As Spencer notes in the video, Gab , a free speech platform, could be next. Or as IllumaSpiracist notes on reddit , a mass flock to VOAT, an aggregated news service and social network with voting similar to Reddit, is also an option.",

      "text": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts | 38   Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts Richard Spencer TIM GOESSMAN,New York Times White nationalist Richard Spencer, seen here in a June 24, 2016, file photo, was among a number of prominent alt-right figures to have his Twitter account suspended this week. By Bree Fowler NEW YORK — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. Twitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the Internet. The alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" Related: The movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. THE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think-tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. Spencer, who is credited with popularizing the term \"alt-right,\" says he has never called for violence and hasn't tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a co-ordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. While he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \"This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,\" he said. \"Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it's also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber.\" \"Twitter is not just some website. It's a public space and we have to treat it that way.\" Pax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn't given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. Dickinson says he's appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter. Spencer says he doesn't plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. The Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. BACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT Online harassment has long been a problem for the Internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it's especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. Actress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. Twitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. \nThe Associated Press",

      "text": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts BREE FOWLER, The Associated Press Published: November 16, 2016, 2:03 pm Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \nThe alt-right, short for “alternative right,” is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It’s often associated with far right efforts to preserve “white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend “Western values.” \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right’s platform, joined Donald Trump’s campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \nTHE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term “alt-right,” says he has never called for violence and hasn’t tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n“This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,” he said. “Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it’s also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n“Twitter is not just some website. It’s a public space and we have to treat it that way.” \nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn’t given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \nDickinson says he’s appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter a day. Spencer says he doesn’t plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. \nBACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT \nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it’s especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. \n___ \nFollow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler .

      "text": "NEWS ANALYSIS: Three major internet services, Twitter, Facebook and Google, say they're taking steps block to silence activities and comments that some find objectionable. But when does that become censorship? Before I started the write this column today, I spent a few minutes with my favorite news site, The Onion . In the Science and Technology section of that humor newspaper, the headline “Horrible Facebook Algorithm Accident Results In Exposure To New Ideas,” stood out. It seemed appropriate to this week’s announcement that Facebook would start banning what it describes as \"fake news.\" The reason it seemed appropriate is that Facebook, along with Google, has announced a variety of measures to cut back on fake news, without any real definition of what they consider fake. Meanwhile, Twitter has announced that it's cancelling the accounts of users that the service thinks are followers of “Alt-Right” ideology. But like Facebook and Google, Twitter does not define how it decides which users fit that description. These actions raise a number of questions that the managers of the sites really need to answer. The first question is what exactly constitutes fake news? If it’s that is a news post that has inaccuracies, then it could mean that Facebook and Google are taking action against every news source on the Internet, if only because they all have errors at one time or another. Most sites correct those errors, but does making a mistake mean you’re a fake news site?Perhaps not, since one presumes that the goal of most objective news sites is to tell the truth, even if there are errors from time to time.So what about obviously fake news sites such as The Onion, which revels in its role as a purveyor of fake news and in the process takes satire to new highs? But should it be banned because it’s fake news? After all, satire has a long and honored place in publishing. Satires has had an important role in public discourse since kings kept court jesters to help courtiers develop a sense of humor. But what about stories being planted that say things such as Pope Francis is endorsing Donald Trump? Is this really fake news? Are people really that gullible? And if they are, could a fake story like that really influence a U.S. election? Over at Twitter the problem with unwelcome speech is one that’s more related to online harassment and hate speech. This problem recently surfaced when comedienne Leslie Jones of Saturday Night Live suffered a barrage of really awful attacks on Twitter at the hand of one Milo Yiannopoulos, who also happens to be an editor of Breitbart News, a right-wing news site whose CEO at the time was Steve Bannon, now on the Trump transition team. You see the problem. It’s one thing to protect legitimate news outlets from people or groups that don't want to shut them down for telling the truth without fear or favor. But what happens when the people who work at certain purported news outlets aren’t presenting news, but rather hate? The problem is already becoming murky. Page 1 of 2",

      "text": "(Getty Images) Kate Upton is ranting on Twitter about Justin Verlander losing the 2016 Cy Young Award. The American League honor went to Rick Porcello , despite the Detroit Tigers pitcher receiving more first-place votes from the Baseball Writers Association of America.\n“Hey @MLB I thought I was the only person allowed to f*ck @JustinVerlander?! What 2 writers didn’t have him on their ballot?” Upton angrily asked in a series of tweets. “He had the majority of 1st place votes and 2 writers didn’t have him on their ballots?!! can you pick more out of touch people to vote? @MLB.”\nUpton then incorrectly stated that Porcello of the Boston Red Sox didn’t receive “any 1st place votes,” and even told him, “You didn’t win. #ByeFelicia @MLB keep up with the times and fire those writers.” The model went on to exchange a few tweets with critics, calling one an “idiot,” and suggesting the two sports journalists in Tampa Bay who didn’t vote for Verlander were “paid off.”\nOne person who did agree with Upton was Verlander’s sibling, Ben, who posted, “Are you kidding me? Most first place votes and doesn’t win? #SaltyYoungerBrother Explain this..” Accompanying the message was a chart showing the pitcher’s stats compared to Porcello and other starters. He even tweeted directly to the MLB’s Tampa Bay journalist, “Hey, @wwchastain, please explain to me why you didn’t vote for my brother. Thanks.”\n“That wasn’t a rhetorical question either. @wwchastain I want an answer. From you and your other twitterless Tampa Bay buddy,” Ben, also a baseball player, went on. “You probably voted for Harambe in the election @wwchastain.” For his part, Verlander himself hasn’t commented on social media.",

      "text": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts Associated Press 8:28 PM, Nov 16, 2016 2 hours ago Share Article Richard Drew Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Previous Next NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. Twitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. The alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" The movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. THE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. Spencer, who is credited with popularizing the term \"alt-right,\" says he has never called for violence and hasn't tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. While he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \"This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,\" he said. \"Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it's also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \"Twitter is not just some website. It's a public space and we have to treat it that way.\" Pax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn't given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. Dickinson says he's appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter. Spencer says he doesn't plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. The Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. Paul Town was also banned, although he said in an email to The Associated Press that his Twitter feed is a \"combination of satire and performance art\" that has been misconstrued as alt-right. BACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT Online harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it's especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. Actress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. Twitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "In its ongoing effort to shut down the free speech of selected groups, Twitter has suspended several accounts associated with the controversial alt-right—a mixed-bag movement that has racist components.\nTwitter, of course, is free to limit speech however it wants and according to its own policies. It’s a private company, and like it or not, First Amendment rights don’t apply to privately owned businesses. While your speech is protected in the public sphere—meaning the government can’t punish you for speaking your mind—it’s not protected when you step into the realm of private entities. Twitter is king of its own kingdom, and it can ban anyone it wants.\nSuch corporate power has often been criticized by people who advocate that First Amendment rights be guaranteed by the government in private places. Lewis Maltby, author of “Can They Do That?”, says there’s something “profoundly disturbing, almost schizophrenic, about our approach to human rights.”\nWe have fought wars, millions of us have served in the military, and several hundred thousand Americans have died, defending our country and protecting our freedom of speech and other rights. Yet we have created a legal system that leaves those rights in the wastebasket when we go to work.\nMaltby goes on to say that this needs to change.\nOver two hundred years ago, Americans decided that they were no longer going to allow the government to violate their human rights. That decision was a milestone in human history. It is time to make another historic decision: our employers must respect our rights as well.\nWith Twitter unfairly targeting conservatives and members of the “alt-right” while ignoring leftist social justice warriors, many might be tempted to join Maltby and others in their efforts to expand government power into the private sphere in the name of free speech.\nThis, however, would be a mistake. It would be a grave threat to freedom to allow the government (a means of force) to dictate to private entities. We have enough of that already with countless regulations. We need less of it, not more.\nNo one is forcing anyone to be on Twitter. Having a Twitter account is not a human right that needs to be protected. There are also other platforms one can use on the Internet to communicate your immediate thoughts and promote your work. If Twitter is going to act like corporate Stalinists, as Richard Spencer said, then those who don’t like it should leave and join Milo Yiannopoulos’s campaign to beat Twitter in the thunderdome of culture and the markets.\nYiannopoulos was slapped with a lifetime ban from Twitter for criticizing actress Leslie Jones and purportedly organizing a campaign of hate against her, something he denies. Spencer, who hasn’t tweeted anything that could be labeled “hate speech,” was simply suspended for his leadership role in the alt-right.\nTwitter’s liberal bias is more than apparent in who it decides to ban from the site. Some say it’s not a bias at all, but merely a business decision because it’s seeing its value sink and has been unable to sell to corporations like Disney due to the “hate speech” so rampant on Twitter. While that might certainly be a motivation, it’s still being inequitable in how it has gone about “cleaning up” the platform.\nIf Twitter were truly concerned about purging hate from its ranks, it would make a clean sweep of extremist groups like Black Lives Matter and Muslim extremists who are using social media to spread real hate. I would even add that some elements of the LGBT and pro-abortion communities are also guilty of using hate speech to shut down those who disagree with them. I’ve experienced this first hand.\nThe concern I have about Twitter has less to do with a private company limiting free speech, and more to do with who it is limiting and for what purpose. Now that the Democratic Party has lost political power nationally and locally, liberals aren’t going to just give up. There’s no crying UNCLE from the Left. When they’re down, they fight even harder, using every weapon in their arsenal. And manipulating the power of private entities to impact public policy is one of the weapons they often use.\nOne prime example is House Bill 2 in North Carolina—also called the Bathroom Bill--in which the state made it clear that people are to use public bathrooms according to their biological sex, not according to how they identify themselves at any given moment. With a Republican legislature and governor, liberals who howled that this was discrimination had no political recourse.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/11/16/how-the-right-should-respond-to-twitters-alt-right-purge/\n ",

      "text": "bctwitter Share this article \nRecently, the news that Twitter will be shutting down the 2014 fad app, Vine, struck the media. With other more popular apps, such as Instagram, Twitter realized that it is wasting money on Vine. I have always loved watching these hilarious six-second videos, even when the app went out of style. The world may have moved on, but these Vines will live forever: \n*Disclaimer: this was one of the hardest tasks to only choose 10. \n\nThe puppy who overcomes his fear of lava to get to his human. \n\n2. The infamous “who is she” vine. \n\n3. The ingenious and hilarious stunt pulled in class. \n\n4. The dynamic duo of Trench and Maple. \n\n5. The guy who is really feeling his music. \n\n6. The army of ducks. \n\n7. The little girl that confuses a flock of birds for chickens. \n\n8. The little boy that thinks that Lesbian is a nationality. \n\n9. The sad end to a great beginning. \n\n10. The rare ghost sighting. \n\nAlso, anything by Nick Colletti is my favorite.

      "text": "While it’s unlikely to be the key strategic move that secures Twitter millions of new, much-needed followers, the app’s developers clearly see the humble QR code as a necessary addition in its ongoing quest to build the perfect social media service.\nThat’s right, folks, Twitter is getting its own Snapchat-like QR codes – complete with a profile pic in the center – to help you promote your own account and make it even easier to start following other users. Twitter’s Brittany Forks announced the new feature on Wednesday:\nhella pumped to announce the launch of QR codes on twitter! they work like snap codes!!\nfind yours: profile > gear > QR code pic.twitter.com/lvAr97bHj6\n— brittany (@brittanyforks) November 16, 2016\nCurrently rolling out for iOS and Android, iPhone users can grab their unique code by tapping the gear icon in the app and selecting “QR code” from the drop-down list. With your code on the screen, simply tap the arrow top right to bring up more options, including “save photo” as a first step to replacing your current Twitter profile shot, “tweet photo” to send it to your followers, or “share” via another service such as a messaging app or email.\nWhen you tap the QR code button on the drop-down list, you’ll also see a “QR scanner” button on the screen, which with a single tap opens your camera so you can scan another user’s code. When you do that, that user’s profile will appear on the display and you’ll be asked to confirm that you want to follow them.\nOn Android, you can find the functionality via the slide-out menu on the left side of the display or by tapping on the ellipsis top right on your profile page.\nOnce you have your own Twitter QR code, you can stick it anywhere you like, including not only on your Twitter page but also on business cards or other physical documents if you so wish.\nRelated: Snapchat confidentially files for IPO that could value it at $25 billion\nThis latest move is one of many that Twitter hopes will help to boost user growth for the struggling microblogging service. It currently has 317 million monthly active users, though its rate of growth no longer comes close to that enjoyed by rival social media services such as Instagram and Snapchat.\nThe company has been grappling with a slew of issues in recent times, including how to deal with abuse on the network, a troubling problem that has driven a number of current users away while deterring new ones from joining. This week it rolled out a “muted words” filter as part of ongoing measures to protect users from abusive tweets.\nTwitter has finally gotten around to launching its ‘Highlights’ feature for iOS Twitter has finally made it possible to post longer tweets New Twitter alert feature means you’ll never miss a live-stream again",

      "title": "Twitter tries to crack down on hate speech by suspending a number of accounts",
      "text": "Twitter tries to crack down on hate speech by suspending a number of accounts By Tess Owen and Elspeth Reeve on Nov 16, 2016 Twitter suspended a handful of accounts belonging to prominent alt-right leaders and outlets Tuesday evening, including that of Richard Spencer, a leading voice in the movement. The Southern Poverty Law Center has called the alt-right “a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‘white identity’ is under attack by multicultural forces using ‘political correctness’ and ‘social justice’ to undermine white people and ‘their’ civilization.” And the center has cited Spencer specifically, calling him “a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.”\nThe apparent crackdown on alt-right users coincides with the social media company’s announcement that users can now hide certain keywords, phrases, and even conversations as a way to shield themselves from hate speech and abuse.\n“The Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse,” a spokesperson for Twitter wrote in a statement regarding the suspensions. “We will take action on accounts violating those policies.”\nIn addition to suspending Spencer’s verified profile, Twitter also cut off his white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute — which dedicates itself to the “heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States, and around the world” — and Spencer’s online magazine, Radix Journal.\nOther suspensions include Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn, and John Rivers, according to USA Today, reporting that a Twitter spokesperson said, “We don’t comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons.”\nTwitter has suspended Vaughn, who uses a pseudonym, multiple times before, most recently in early October. Since his suspension Tuesday, Vaughn has been posting on Gab.ai, a site that’s like a blend of Twitter and Reddit and launched in August. Gab notes free speech as its core principle, and its users are mostly alt-right.\n“Twitter has just done Gab a MASSIVE FAVOR,” Vaughn posted Tuesday night. “ I hope that Milo, Chuck, Pax, and Richard are able to pursue a class action lawsuit against Twitter.”\n“Milo” likely refers to Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart reporter, whom Twitter permanently suspended in July after a wave of racist abuse on Ghostbusters remake star Leslie Jones.\nAnother suspended user, Dickinson, was forced to resign as chief technology officer of Business Insider in September 2013 after a history of offensive tweets about women and minorities came to light. Then in February, he complained about being “harassed” by Twitter.\n“Twitter is making me and my followers paranoid and very fearful of being suspended or shadowbanned,” Dickinson wrote . “It’s really affecting some of us emotionally.”\nDickinson’s WeSearchr account, however, is still up on Twitter. WeSearchr allows users to post a “bounty” for projects that blur the line between journalism and harassment. A project titled “ Let’s Open Up Megyn Kelly’s Divorce Records ” is seeking $5,000.\nMeanwhile, alt-right supporters have taken to other online venues to express anger over the suspensions. One user on the alt-right subreddit wrote about the suspensions under the subject line, “Confirmation that Shitter is biased against conservatives and against us and that they won’t allow us to use their platform. Watch Facebook and Reddit ban us next.”\nSome also suggested switching to Gab.\nTwitters users, both supportive of the alt-right and otherwise, expressed concern over the bans.\nPax Dickinson and Richard Spencer have been banned from Twitter.

      "text": "Femi Adesanya 16 mins ago \nTwitter has finally rolled out new anti-troll measures to combat the growing issue of abuse and harassment on the social network. \nMany celebrities have quit the network over concerns of cyberbullying, stumping Twitter’s ability to grow its active users. Twitter said in a statement on Tuesday, “Because Twitter happens in public and in real-time, we’ve had some challenges keeping up with and curbing abusive conduct. We took a step back to reset and take a new approach, find and focus on the most critical needs, and rapidly improve,” \nA new and expanded ‘mute’ function has now been introduced allowing users block out words and phrases from their timelines. Users can also mute whole conversations. Recommended for you",

      "text": "Blogs Twitter rolls out tool to curb online abuse, bullying \nTwitter says that the platform is \"open to everyone and every opinion\" while noting that it has seen \"a growing trend of people taking advantage of that openness and using Twitter to be abusive to others.\" (AFP Photo) AFP November 16, 2016 Washington - \nTwitter on Tuesday began rolling out a new weapon in the fight against harassment by \"trolls\" whose often anonymous vitriol can make the messaging service an unwelcoming place. \nThe move comes as online social networks struggle to balance free speech with intimidation and aggression that make many fearful of speaking freely. \n\"The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we've seen across the internet has risen sharply over the past few years,\" Twitter said in a statement. \n\"These behaviors inhibit people from participating on Twitter, or anywhere.\" \nTwitter is expanding a \"mute\" feature that enables users to block accounts sending inappropriate messages. \nTwitter will let users eliminate, or mute, notifications based on keywords, phrases or entire conversations they are not interested in seeing, according to the San Francisco-based company. \n\"This is a feature we've heard many of you ask for, and we're going to keep listening to make it better and more comprehensive over time,\" it said. \nTwitter policy already prohibits hate spewed based on race, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation. \n- Bearing witness - \nMeasures announced on Tuesday included providing a more direct way for people to report abusive behavior, even if they are a witness to it and not the target. \n\"This will improve our ability to process these reports, which helps reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter,\" the service said. \nTwitter support staff have been retrained on its policies, including sessions to help understand comments in cultural and historic context, according to the company. \nInternal processes have been tuned to deal more effectively with reports of abusive behavior, with a goal of being faster and more transparent in handling situations, Twitter said. \nReasoning for the move included making Twitter a more welcoming platform, ideally ramping up the number of users and the amount of time they spend engaged on the platform. \n\"Abusive conduct removes the chance to see and share all perspectives around an issue, which we believe is critical to moving us all forward,\" Twitter said. \n\"In the worst cases, this type of conduct threatens human dignity, which we should all stand together to protect.\" \nThe moves come after a series of complaints and high-profile instances of abuse on the social network. \nIn July, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter after what she said was a stream of abuse fueled by comments from an editor at the conservative news site Breitbart. \n- Instagram as well - \nThe challenge of making Twitter a safe online venue for open and insightful discourse is believed to be among the reasons the company failed to find a suitor when it courted potential buyers this year. \nTwitter said that it has seen a growing trend in people taking advantage of the openness of the service to abuse others. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" its statement said. \n\"Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" \nTwitter's expanded mute feature appeared similar to a tool that Facebook-owned Instagram added in September. \nThe popular photo and video-sharing service began letting users tackle online abuse by creating lists of words that would automatically make comments hidden from sight. \n\"All different types of people -- from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more -- call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind,\" Instagram co-founder and chief executive Kevin Systrom said in a blog post at the time. \n\"To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment.\" \nInstagram also lets users swipe to delete comments, report abusive posted remarks and even have accounts blocked.

      "text": "  Twitter bans white supremacist accounts  39 PM Share Your Email \nTwitter accounts of white supremacy advocates who cheered Donald Trump's election victory were mute on Wednesday, suspended as the social network battles hateful vitriol spewed by \"trolls.\" \nTerminated Twitter accounts included that of Richard Spencer, a leader in an 'alt-right' white nationalist movement in the US, and accounts associated with his magazine and \"think tank.\" \n\"I think Twitter, Facebook and others are deeply triggered by this election and that social media helped elect Trump,\" Spencer said in a video posted on YouTube. \nSpencer compared the account suspensions to Adolf Hitler in 1934 wiping out opposition to his Nazi Party to consolidate power in Germany in what is referred to in history as the Night of the Long Knives. \n\"Basically, my entire digital presence on Twitter has been suspended,\" he said in the video. \n\"It is corporate Stalinism; there is a great purge going on.\" \nIn response to an AFP inquiry, Twitter referred to its rules prohibiting \"violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct,\" and its promise to take action on accounts violating those policies. \n- Bully bane - \nThe account suspensions came after Twitter on Tuesday began rolling out a new weapon in the fight against harassment by \"trolls\" whose often abusive onslaughts can make the messaging service an unwelcoming place. \nOnline social networks have been struggling to balance free speech with intimidation and aggression that make many fearful of speaking freely. \nTwitter in February suspended more than 125,000 accounts, most of them linked to the Islamic State group, as part of increased efforts to eradicate \"terrorist content\" on the popular messaging platform. \n\"The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we've seen across the internet has risen sharply over the past few years,\" Twitter said as it announced an expanded \"mute\" feature that enables users to block accounts sending inappropriate messages. \nTwitter will let users eliminate, or mute, notifications based on keywords, phrases or entire conversations they are not interested in seeing, according to the San Francisco-based company. \n- Inciting harm - \nTwitter already prohibits hate speech based on race, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation. \nIn its response to AFP, Twitter pointed out a section of its policy stating that it does not allow accounts \"whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others.\" \nMeasures announced on Tuesday included providing a more direct way for people to report abusive behavior, even if they are a witness to it and not the target. \nTwitter support staff have been retrained on its policies and internal processes have been tuned to deal more effectively with reports of abusive behavior, with a goal of being faster and more transparent in handling situations, Twitter said. \nReasoning included making Twitter a more welcoming platform, ideally ramping up the number of users and the amount of time they spend engaged on the platform. \nThe moves come after a series of complaints and high-profile instances of abuse on the social network. \nIn July, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter after what she said was a stream of abuse fueled by comments from an editor at the conservative news site Breitbart. \nTwitter said that it has seen a growing trend in people taking advantage of the openness of the service to abuse others. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" its statement said. \n\"Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" AFP",

      "text": "Chicago News 11/16/2016, 09:23pm Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts \nTwitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. | AFP/Getty Images file photo Bree Fowler | AP Technology Writer Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter Sign-Up \nNEW YORK — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nTwitter declined to comment but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promised to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \nThe alt-right, short for “alternative right,” is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It’s often associated with far-right efforts to preserve “white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend “Western values.” \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right’s platform, joined Donald Trump’s campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \nTHE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term “alt-right,” says he has never called for violence and hasn’t tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n“This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,” he said. “Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it’s also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n“Twitter is not just some website,” he said. “It’s a public space and we have to treat it that way.” \nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn’t given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \nDickinson says he has appealed the suspension but has yet to hear back from Twitter. Spencer says he doesn’t plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. Paul Town was also banned, although he said in an email to The Associated Press that his Twitter feed is a “combination of satire and performance art” that has been misconstrued as alt-right. \nBACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT \nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it’s especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos.

      "text": "Trump voter flies into a rage at Starbucks (Twitter) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory \nA Donald Trump flew into a racist tantrum when his Starbucks order took longer than he believed it should have. \nThe man was caught on video hurling insults at employees and customers at a coffee shop near the University of Miami campus, reported the Miami New-Times . \nHe started hurling Trump’s name at black employees, who he accused of “anti-white discrimination” because his coffee was delayed, witnesses said. \nRelated: Trump-loving coffee shop owner insists he is not racist after threatening to hang black ‘monkeys’ \nAnother customer called the man an “assh*le,” and he replied “f*ck you, b*tch”— and that’s when Jorge de Cárdenas began recording. \nHis video captured the man, who has not been identified, calling a black employee “trash” and demanding a refund. \n“I voted for Trump! Trump!” the man said. “You lost, now give me my money back.” \nThe man demands the black employee’s name and continues insulting her, and another customer asks him to be more respectful or leave. \nThe Trump supporter then turns his fury on the other customer, and he threatened to punch the other man before storming out of the coffee shop. \nCárdenas said he didn’t understand why the Trump supporter was so angry. \n“The funny thing, besides just the concept of ‘anti-white discrimination,’ is just yelling ‘Trump!’ for no reason,” Cárdenas said. “Like dude, you won.” #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 About the Author",

      "text": "AP November 17, 2016, 9:09 AM Kate Upton lashes out on Twitter over Justin Verlander losing Cy Young Award \nModel Kate Upton poses at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles Oct. 29, 2016. Reuters/Danny Moloshok Model makes a splash in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue \nAs for Justin Verlander, well, fuming supermodel Kate Upton brought the heat for her fiance. \nRotation mates for five seasons in Detroit, the three right-handers topped the Cy Young Award talk Wednesday: Scherzer easily won the NL prize, Porcello edged out Verlander for the AL honor. \n“That’s just the weird thing about these,” said Scherzer, who ruled the majors with 284 strikeouts and topped the NL with 20 wins for Washington. “It’s the voting.” \nPorcello led baseball with 22 wins for Boston, and had a 3.15 ERA. \nPorcello won despite getting just eight of the 30 first-place votes from members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America - this was the first time the AL Cy winner didn’t get the most firsts. \nVerlander went 16-9 with a 2.40 ERA while leading the AL in strikeouts and other categories. He got 14 first-place votes, but didn’t draw as much support across the board - he was left off two ballots, too. \nOverall, Porcello won 137-132 in the second-closest vote since 1970 (Verlander lost by four points to David Price in 2012). \nVoters list their five picks in order. A first-place vote is worth seven points, four for second, three for third, two for fourth and one for fifth. Verlander needed to pick up five more points to match Porcello. \nUpton fired off three tweets, one of them rather saucy , telling Porcello “you didn’t win.” He had the majority of 1st place votes and 2 writers didn't have him on their ballots?!! can you pick more out of touch people to vote? @MLB — Kate Upton (@KateUpton) November 16, 2016 Sorry Rick but you didn't get any 1st place votes? you didn't win. #ByeFelicia @MLB keep up with the times and fire those writers — Kate Upton (@KateUpton) November 16, 2016 \nAsked whether he was bothered by the brouhaha, Porcello simply said, “No, I honestly don’t care.” \n“I’m not the one who made the decision,” he said on a conference call. \nPorcello got a $100,000 bonus for winning the Cy. Verlander, who won the 2011 award, would’ve gotten $500,000 for this win. \nPorcello bounced back from going 9-15 in his first season with the Red Sox, finishing 22-4 for the AL East champs. \nHe shared this last win of 2016 with those who “never wavered” in their support, admitting, “It was hard not to start bawling and crying.” \nCleveland’s Corey Kluber was third and got three first-place votes. Baltimore reliever Zach Britton, who went 47 for 47 on save chances with a 0.54 ERA, had five first-place votes and was fourth. \nScherzer breezed, drawing 25 first-place votes to beat out Chicago Cubs teammates Jon Lester and Kyle Hendricks. \nScherzer became the sixth pitcher to earn the Cy Young in both leagues. After earning the AL honor in 2013 with the Tigers, Scherzer joined Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, Gaylord Perry and Roy Halladay as winners in both leagues. \nThis award, Scherzer said, meant even more than the first one. \n“It just verifies everything I try to achieve,” he said. \nScherzer posted a record-tying 20-strikeout performance for the NL East champion Nationals, a year after he threw two no-hitters in his first season with Washington. \n“I want to find a way to be better,” he said. \nScherzer is the first pitcher from a Washington franchise to win a Cy Young. The award was first presented in 1956. \nDodgers ace Clayton Kershaw got three first-place votes and finished fifth. Jose Fernandez, the Miami star killed in a boating accident in September, was seventh. \nThe final major postseason awards will be presented Thursday when the MVP honors are announced. \nCubs slugger Kris Bryant, Washington’s Daniel Murphy and newly presented Rookie of the Year Corey Seager of the Dodgers are up for the NL award. Mike Trout of the Angels, Mookie Betts of the Red Sox and Jose Altuve of the Astros are the AL contestants. © 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "By Alexandria Hein \nPublished November 17, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Free To Breathe staff members participate in #FlipToBreathe to help spread awareness and raise money for lung cancer.  (Free to Breathe) \nLung cancer results in more deaths each year than breast, prostate and colon cancers combined, yet these cancers receive an average of nearly six times more in research funding per life lost, according to lung cancer research and advocacy nonprofit Free To Breathe. With more than 224,000 people diagnosed with the disease each year, organizers at Free to Breathe are working furiously to help spread awareness and raise money for more treatments to help improve survival rates.\nFor Lung Cancer Awareness Month, the organization has put together the #FlipToBreathe campaign , where participants are encouraged to flim themselves “flipping out” by literally flipping over objects to vent their frustration over the deadly disease. It’s a social media-based project that has reached more than 260,000 people across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and HealthUnlocked, with more than $300 raised since it started on Nov. 1.\nSean Lizama, 36, shared his #FlipToBreathe video on Facebook on Oct. 30 to honor his 61-year-old father who died this summer. Lizama said his father, who was his best friend, was a smoker but had quit the habit almost 20 years ago.\n“He was diagnosed in the early part of 2013, and he was given six months to a year [to live],” Lizama told FoxNews.com. “He lasted about three and a half years, and it caught up to him just recently beginning of this summer. It was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced.”\nLizama’s video has more than 2,000 views, and features Lizama holding informational posters about lung cancer before he heads to a folding table set up with footballs, bottles and plates that he then lips over.\n“I just want people to understand that this is a very horrible thing and the fact that it’s so seriously underfunded, nobody talks about it, it’s not getting the attention and it makes it even worse,” he said. “I want people to know what my dad went through, how he fought to save my life while fighting for his.”\nMore on this...

Twitter is falling in love with Marc Gasol's strut 0 Share: \nMarc Gasol is channeling his inner Conor McGregor with this walk. Photo by Screenshot via CBS Sports \nIf you're going to walk one way this morning, make like Marc Gasol. \nThe NBA star's boastful strut was the top trending topic on Twitter on Thursday morning, while Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\" was making waves across Facebook. \nSocial Cues is our guide on what's trending across Facebook and Twitter. Here's what people are talking about on social media this Thursday: \nMarc Gasol : He walked the walk. After dropping a three-pointer to put the Memphis Grizzlies in the lead against the Los Angeles Clippers , Gasol strutted on the court in a glorious gloat . The center might have taken inspiration from UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor's strut from his fight at Madison Square Garden or from the walk's originator, the WWE's Vince McMahon . Either way, the celebratory stroll earned him a spot as a top trending topic, with more than 18,400 tweets about it. \nDuck Dynasty : The dynasty is dead. A&E's hit show \" Duck Dynasty \" is being cancelled after this season, with the finale airing April 12 after a five-year run for the series. Members of the family are now thanking their fans on Twitter . From the trending tweets by Thursday morning, though, it seems the show will not be missed. There are a lot of \"finally\" posts floating around after the announcement. \nSanders to Trump : Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has a warning for the president-elect. During a Q&A at George Washington University, Sanders demanded Trump be held accountable for his promises to build up the working class and vowed to fight against Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric , The Hill reported. There are more than 10,000 tweets about Sanders' remarks, some criticizing him still for throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton after his loss in the Democratic primary. \nEnter Sandman : Jimmy Fallon helped the world find out what Metallica's classic would sound like if it was played on children's instruments. With a little help from The Roots, the rock legends played a rendition of \"Enter Sandman\" on toys on Wednesday night's \"Tonight Show.\" The video has been viewed more than 20 million times on Facebook , trending with more than 120,000 people talking about the clip. It was also trending on Twitter with more than 8,800 tweets about it. \nTidal : Add Prince's music label to one of Jay Z's 99 problems. Celebrity gossip site TMZ reported that NPG Records, the music icon's record label, is suing Tidal for streaming Prince's songs. The lawsuit claims that Prince only allowed Tidal to stream \"Hit N Run: Phase 1,\" his final album, before his death in April, not the Purple One's entire discography, according to the report. More than 34,000 people are talking about the lawsuit and the streaming service on Facebook . \nBe sure to check out Social Cues' weekly roundup called T.GIF.

Joshua Putnam is putting forth the new bill to let teachers volunteer to carry weapons.\n“It would incorporate mostly live shooter scenarios. So then teachers are familiar with how to approach that gunman on campus, how to interact with getting children away from... danger situations and how to confront that until law enforcement arrives,” said Putnam.\nOHIO SCHOOL DISTRICT WEIGHS ARMING TEACHERS TO PROTECT KIDS \nPutnam’s goal with the new legislation is to prevent any future school shootings throughout South Carolina. If it takes effect, it would make the state one of more than a dozen to allow teachers to carry on school grounds.\nRock Hill, S.C. teacher Judy O’Neal says having teachers carry is one way to keep children safe.\n“I’m very comfortable with guns and I think there are people who can handle a gun in a school situation,” O’Neal said.\nREMOTE IDAHO SCHOOL BUYS GUNS TO ENHANCE SAFETY \nO’Neal, who grew up in a home with guns, knows the dangers of having a weapon and believes teachers with proper training would improve safety in schools. Still, she said it would take plenty of preparation.\n“I believe it will take a lot of planning and a lot of scrutinizing before it just hops on to campus,” O’Neal said.\nBut Dr. Jacqueline Persinski, another teacher in South Carolina, is against legislation arming teachers.\nInsideGov | Graphiq Persinski said in a statement to Fox News: “I am against having teachers carrying weapons on school campus. I fear something tragic is more likely to occur by having the weapon on campus and it getting into the wrong hands.”\nShe instead believes school resource officers (SRO) responsible for security and crime prevention in schools are adequate enough to handle potential school shootings.\n“Our police officers are trained by profession to handle hostile situations, and teachers are not,\" Persinski said. “If a situation were to occur, I believe our SRO and police are well-trained and fully capable of managing it effectively and efficiently. Teachers are trained to protect students in lockdown procedures and will protect the students until police arrive. Using weapons is completely different. “\nBernadette Hampton, a former math teacher and president of the South Carolina Education Association, also feels using weapons can have an adverse affect.\n“I think this is opening doors for risk,” Hampton said. “As a math teacher, I feel that it would escalate and provide more opportunity for potential fatal or potential situations that would not occur [otherwise].”\nHampton called for “preventative measures” and said teachers should focus more on teaching students. “Teachers are trained to teach and to instill the love of learning within students and we have school resource officers that are trained to provide security and protection at the schools.”\nPutnam stated that most schools, especially in rural South Carolina, do not have resource officers. Putnam feels that having one in each school is ideal, but for now arming teachers may be the quickest and cheapest solution.\n“It would cost the state of South Carolina $83 million to hire enough resource officers to have one in every single school,\" Putnam said. \"With all the challenges we face in the state, from road funding, to teacher shortages, to teacher pay, to highway patrol funding, trying to find $83 million in the state budget is quite difficult. But we do believe it’s a worthwhile goal. I think we need to work towards eventually having a school resource officer in every single school in South Carolina.\"\nFrom a local law enforcement perspective, Jared Bruder, a member of the South Carolina Sherriffs’ Association, understands the desire to keep kids safe.\n“We aren’t anti-teachers carrying,” Bruder said. “We just want to make sure that when that person is carrying, that they are properly trained and properly educated to do the right thing.”\nPutnam says the new bill covers training requirements, which would be designed and implemented by local law enforcement.\n“The state law enforcement division would have to develop materials and a training class that would be offered free of charge... It would be similar to a [concealed weapons permit] test and training, but it would incorporate mostly live shooter scenarios.” \nTeachers would volunteer and be approved by the principal and the school district. Once the teachers completed training and got certified by the State Law Enforcement Division, they would be allowed to carry a concealed weapon on their person at all times. They also would receive a stipend to help cover any wages lost during training.\n“We know it would require more training, maybe going to the shooting range to make sure they are proficient on their marksmanship. So, we are OK with doing a stipend every single month to compensate for that time.”\nStudents and other teachers would not know which teachers are carrying. Only the principal and certain members of the school board would have that information.\n“They would have to sign a log at the office of the school allowing the principal and the administrators to know that they’re carrying that day,” Putnam said.\nThe lawmaker told Fox News he hoped to complete the bill and submit it for review by December. If it is approved in January, it may take up to a year and a half to go into effect.\n\nTerace Garnier is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Columbia, South Carolina.

To which, he responds by listing just a few of his accomplishments: 9-time All-Star, NCAA championship winner and 3-time Olympic gold medalist. \nFinally, he ends the conversation with the question that says everything he needs to about people who probably really do say things like his window of time on achieving greatness is running out: \"You guys spend a lot of time commenting on the internet?\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fA0Cf0 Most Popular",

      "text": "Feature Twitter backs up anti-harassment talk with action Twitter's finally taking some action to stop online harassment and abuse, but that's not sitting well with everyone. CIO | Nov 17, 2016 5:24 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Leading women in technology: LinkedIn's Erica Lockheimer \nWell, here's a tiny bit of good news: Twitter's finally introducing some tools to stop harassment and abuse and is retraining its front-line customer service personnel to increase understanding of cultural issues so that they have historical and cultural context into how and why certain language or actions constitute abuse. \nAdvertisingAge.com reports that : \n\"… users will be able to mute seeing certain words in their notifications, such as racial slurs and curse words -- an update that was in the works for many months. People can also block whole conversations. The change may help lessen the ability of abusers to reach their victims, decreasing their motivation to do it. For anyone who spots language that violates the company's policy, there's a new option to report 'hateful conduct' in addition to abuse and harassment. Meanwhile, Twitter is retraining everyone who has the potential to review user complaints to increase understanding of cultural issues,\" according to the article. \nThis is a great step, albeit years late; one particularly weak defense cited in the AdAge article is that Twitter's engineers \"in the past saw other challenges as higher priorities. \nThat's the definition of privilege. Assuming that because an issue doesn't impact you that it's not a problem for anyone else, either. I'm nevertheless glad to see Twitter's finally introducing tools to help users address the issue, but it remains to be seen if it'll be enough. \nCheck out this great rundown of exactly how to use the new tools in the event an abusive or harassing Tweet appears; you need to mute a conversation, or if someone in your feed is in danger or contemplating self-harm. \nOf course, not everyone's pleased. One of the first actions Twitter took after implementing the new tools was to suspend the account of Richard Spencer and others associated with the 'Alt-Right.' \nThe L.A. Times reports that \"Twitter suspended many more accounts associated with the alt-right, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as 'a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that \"white identity\" is under attack by multicultural forces using \"political correctness\" and \"social justice\" to undermine white people and 'their' civilization.' \n…Twitter also suspended the accounts of the Virginia-based National Policy Institute, an alt-right, white nationalist think tank of which Spencer is president, and of the Radix Journal, a magazine run by Spencer.\" \nYou won't find me crying any tears over this - all I have to say is, \"Keep it up, Twitter.\" To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook , LinkedIn or Twitter .

      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment The Associated Press Published: November 15, 2016, 11:52 am Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this July 27, 2016, file photo, the Twitter symbol appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a “mute” function that lets people mute accounts they don’t want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don’t want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won’t see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn’t mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits “specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,” this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It’s been tricky, to say the least. \n“We don’t expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,” Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . “No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.” Share this: ",

You didn't win.\" Sorry Rick but you didn't get any 1st place votes? you didn't win. #ByeFelicia @MLB keep up with the times and fire those writers — Kate Upton (@KateUpton) November 16, 2016 \nAdding a jab at Major League Baseball saying to, \"Keep up with the times and fire those writers.\" \nIn another tweet, she asks the league if they could find people who are more out of touch. He had the majority of 1st place votes and 2 writers didn't have him on their ballots?!! can you pick more out of touch people to vote? @MLB — Kate Upton (@KateUpton) November 16, 2016 \nCopyright 2016 WNEM (Meredith Corporation).

      "text": "Twitter 1 0 \nOutside the United Kingdom, the HMC or the HM Revenue and Customs might not mean a lot, but for UK users it is a important thing that gives them access to their HMRC account. Now, a Windows 10 app has launched exclusively for UK users. \nThe HMRC app is brand new and focused to give people living in the UK full access to their HMRC account. It still has its initial bugs, but the ability to see taxable income estimates & pate income tax estimates can be very useful. HMRC App Features \nWith the HMRC app for Windows 10, users in the UK can get a number of features at a click away. They can check to see their next tax credit payment date, view their personal tax account, track forms sent to the HMRC, and read the latest messages and news. \nThis type of app is ideal for UK users, and is part of a greater tech future from the HMRC in their release notes. The transparency of giving UK residents access to information with the latest technology at their fingertips. Account Needed But Setup Is Easy \nResidents in the UK to use the HMRC app will need to have an HMRC account to log in, and view their income statements. If they don’t have one, they are able to sign up for one in the app, and that makes it much easier than ever. \nBugs again have been fixed in the app, and the HMRC is working to improve the app’s tax calculator according to the release notes as well. They have removed it with the current release on the Windows Store, but they have it online on their www.gov.uk/hmrc site. \nIf you’re in the UK and utilize the HMRC this app is for you. Try it out and let us know your thoughts. \n us/store/p/hmrc/9wzdncrdkb9r?tduid=(bb48e60e6044dfe264ef3c458110b4c0)(213688)(2795219)()()",

Lloyd \n\nBernie Sanders had teased supporters via email, \"This is something you'll want to watch\"—referring to his Wednesday night speech and book talk with columnist E.J. Dionne at George Washington University. Less predictably, Sanders tore into the Democratic National Committee with a fire he'd held back while supporting the Clinton campaign—concluding, in conversation with Dionne, that the Democratic party should not \"anoint\" candidates.\n\n\"To say the very least, the DNC was not a neutral force in the campaign,\" Sanders told Dionne and an adoring crowd. His campaign, he added, was up against too great an opposition: battling not just the Republicans, but the Democrats too. As a result of DNC's active preference for Hillary Clinton, a bias which Wikileaks' publication of hacked emails made known, \"We had to take on virtually the entire Democratic establishment.\"\nRead the full story at WeeklyStandard.com→",

      "title": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts",
      "text": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts BREE FOWLER Associated Press 0 \nNEW YORK – Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \nThe alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. THE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is based part-time in Whitefish and is credited with popularizing the term \"alt-right,\" says he has never called for violence and hasn't tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n\"This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,\" he said. \"Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it's also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n\"Twitter is not just some website. It's a public space and we have to treat it that way.\" \nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn't given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \nDickinson says he's appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter a day. Spencer says he doesn't plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. BACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT \nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it's especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos.

      "text": "The fundamental change that might actually solve Twitter's harassment problem It’s internal, has nothing to do with filtering, and it’s huge. share Photo by Bethany Clarke/Getty Images Twitter has long been criticized for its frequently slow (or in the worst cases, nonexistent) response to the many users who’ve experienced harassment and abuse on social media network. At times, the company has insisted it’s doing everything it can to fix the problem, but in practice, the results have been inconsistent at best . But a recent development in Twitter’s anti-harassment efforts may be a huge step in the right direction. On November 15, the service announced a new round of major changes to its harassment policies, while introducing new tools to help users report instances of harassment and abuse. The changes include two key new functions: muting entire conversation threads and specifying reported tweets as hate speech. Twitter’s blog post about the changes noted that allowing users to specifically identify hate speech when reporting abuse “will improve our ability to process these reports, which helps reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter.” With this statement, it seems that Twitter is directly addressing the common accusation that it places too much onus on victims of abuse and harassment to take action, and then not taking their complaints as seriously as they should. If you’ve ever spent time attempting to report hate speech to Twitter, you may justifiably be skeptical about whether the site will actually enforce its new guidelines. In my experience, almost every tweet I’ve reported — often due to violent, gendered language — has been ruled inoffensive by Twitter’s abuse team. In the rare instance that Twitter has taken action, it has only required the reported user to delete the offensive tweets, essentially delivering a slap on the wrist. But I’m hopeful that this might change, not only because of Twitter’s expanded abuse reporting functionality, but because targets of hate speech can actually report it as such. And I’m especially optimistic regarding one particularly illuminating statement in Twitter’s blog post: The site says that it has “retrained all of our support teams on our policies, including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct.” In other words, it seems Twitter is teaching its support staff to think about more than whether individual words are offensive or not. “Cultural and historical contextualization” allows for a larger picture to unfold, one in which repeated patterns of behavior from specific Twitter users can be assessed and analyzed. Twitter also promised that it will be implementing “an ongoing refresher program” to help its employees understand and stay up to date on how harassment spreads. This could be easier said than done: As BuzzFeed pointed out in response to Twitter’s announcement, trolls on the site are evolving their language to dodge crackdowns on hate speech. For example, Operation Google was a recent attempt by members of 4chan’s alt-right haven /pol/ to substitute the names of social media platforms for actual racial slurs, in order to avoid censorship. Then there are low-level insults like “cuck” — a relatively new, shortened form of “cuckold” popularized by the alt-right. “Cuck” doesn’t exactly fall under the category of hate speech, until you dig deeper and realize that many members of the alt-right have imbued it with meaning derived from white supremacy. And hate speech itself comes in all forms; for example, it’s not as if Twitter users can block or filter the use of parentheses when they’re used as they were in a recent wave of anti-Semitic alt-right hate on the platform. Still, all of this is a hopeful step forward. There’s no real systematic way for most social media platforms to contextualize larger patterns of harassment and hate speech. But it seems Twitter may have finally realized that if it truly wants to make its users feel safer, it must work harder to understand why they feel threatened in the first place.

It was tweeted from an account with the handle \"@NEW_ORDER_1488\". \nTwitter had suspended several accounts linked to the alt-right movement, USA Today reported on Wednesday. \nThe company, which has also been under criticism for not doing enough to thwart cyber bullying, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade some features to curb abusive behavior. \nTwitter's advertising policy prevents advertisers from promoting certain sensitive topics including hate speech or discrimination against race, ethnicity, color, religion and sexual orientation. \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) - Reuters",

Posted 18 Nov 2016 03:55 Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and CEO of Twitter, speaks during an interview November 19, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files A \nREUTERS: Twitter's Chief Executive Jack Dorsey apologised on Thursday after the microblogging service let through an ad promoting a white supremacist group. \n\"We made a mistake here and we apologise. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed,\" Dorsey tweeted. http://bit.ly/2f4MLcV \nThe ad titled \"'New Article: The United States Was Founded as a White People's Republic' on NEW ORDER website\" showed eight white children in a field. It was tweeted from an account with the handle \"@NEW_ORDER_1488\". \nTwitter had suspended several accounts linked to the alt-right movement, USA Today reported on Wednesday. \nThe company, which has also been under criticism for not doing enough to thwart cyber bullying, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade some features to curb abusive behaviour. \nTwitter's advertising policy prevents advertisers from promoting certain sensitive topics including hate speech or discrimination against race, ethnicity, colour, religion and sexual orientation. \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) - Reuters",

      "text": "Twitter CEO apologizes for white supremacy ad Twitter's crackdown on hate speech isn't turning out to be easy. CEO Jack Dorsey apologized Thursday after the microblogging site hosted an ad that promoted a white supremacy group earlier this week. \nSEE ALSO: Alt-right accounts suspended after Twitter anti-troll announcement \nThe promoted tweet, spotted by Twitter user Ariana Lenarsky Tuesday and surfaced by Motherboard Wednesday, linked to an article titled \"The United States Was Founded as a White People's Republic\" on the website of the New Order, a Neo-Nazi group. It was paid for by the account @New_Order_1488. \n\nIt apparently took three days for Dorsey (the man who has two full-time CEO roles and whose chief operating officer of his struggling company is stepping down) to apologize. But the account was suspended and the ad was removed within an hour of being live, according to a Twitter spokesperson. \nTwitter's ad policy \"prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally,\" as listed on its website . \n\nThe promoted tweet featuring an image of eight white children on a farm apparently seemed innocuous. Twitter's system does have tools to recognize visuals and texts that could be in violation of its policy, such as a swastika or a racial slur, but the account's altered image of a swastika as its profile picture was not flagged. Neither were the terms #WhiteAmerica and New Order, a known Neo-Nazi group.\n\nWhile Twitter does forbid such content, this ad — like others in the past — was able to make it on the site since much of its advertising system is automated. \n\"We've identified where our process broke down and are making immediate changes to prevent this from happening in the future,\" a Twitter spokesperson said. \"Specifically, we're going to be adding more keywords and image recognition parameters to more quickly flag this type of content for review.\"\n",

Both those brands will be in the Media silo. \nVerizon is in the process of buying Yahoo for $4.6 billion. Share this: ",

      "title": "7 Houseplants That Thrive Near West-Facing Windows",
      "text": "By Marianne Lipanovich \nPublished November 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print  (Crisp Architects) \n (Nanette Wong) \n (DHV Architects) \nPrevious Next For most indoor plants, the light from a west-facing window is a welcome compromise between the bright but usually weaker light from an east-facing window and the direct and often very bright light let in through a south-facing window. As a result, plants that like a little more light but can’t handle hot direct sun are happiest with this exposure. It’s often a good location for flowering houseplants as well as ones with variegated or even nongreen foliage, as it tends to intensify foliage color.\nA west-facing window is also a good spot for many plants that do well with either an eastern or southern exposure, so feel free to experiment with including them. Those preferring an eastern exposure may need to be placed away from the window or shielded by a light curtain, while those preferring a southern exposure may need to move closer to the light. Either way, you’ll have plenty of options to fill your space.\nBasic care . Most of the plants that thrive in west-facing windows are not that fussy about their growing conditions. They like light, of course, but otherwise they generally do well with standard home humidity levels and temperatures, though they prefer to be kept out of drafts and safeguarded against extreme temperatures. Some prefer to be kept evenly moist; others can dry out between waterings.\nRelated: Give Your Indoor Garden a Good Soak in a New Sink \nFeed them while they are growing, generally from spring through fall. If using a liquid fertilizer, use one-quarter strength every week or half-strength every two weeks.\nLight needs . West-facing windows get direct sun at the end of the afternoon when it is brightest — a plus for flowering plants, especially — but also when it can be the hottest. If plants are getting too much sun or heat, especially if they also receive light from other windows, they can develop scorched leaves and show signs of spindly growth. If that’s the case, move the plant out of the direct sun or provide filtered light during the hottest part of the day. Plants may also need to be moved away from the hotter spots during the summer and returned in winter when the sunlight is weaker.\nIf the plant is not growing and thriving, it may not be receiving enough light, especially if the light coming in is filtered by buildings and trees. If so, move the plant closer to the window to increase the light it receives.\n1. Coleus \n( Plectranthus scutellarioides )\nStandout foliage. A western exposure can bring out the best in many popular houseplants that are grown for their unusual foliage. If you’re looking for a houseplant with unexpectedly bright velvety foliage in shades ranging from green to yellow, orange, red, maroon and purple, coleus is a good plant to start with. Its brightly colored leaves stand out in any space, and it’s relatively easy to grow.\nKeep the soil evenly moist, but don’t let the plant stand in water. Fertilize every two weeks from spring through fall with half-strength fertilizer, and cut back in winter. Bright, or even direct, sunlight will intensify the leaf colors, but if it gets sunlight that is too intense, leaf tips can scorch. It’s happy with average indoor temperatures and humidity levels, though it does like it a bit cooler when it isn’t growing. It also can form flowers, but that’s fairly rare indoors.\nMore: Other plants with intriguing foliage include bloodleaf ( Iresine herbstii ), croton ( Codiaeum variegatum ), false aralia ( Schefflera elegantissima ), pleomele ( Dracaena reflexa ), Veitch’s screwpine ( Pandanus veitchii ) and tiplant ( Cordyline fruticosa) , a source of leaves for hula skirts when grown outdoors.\nCaution: Croton, pleomele and tiplant are toxic if ingested.\n2. Geranium \n( Pelargonium spp.)\nFlowering favorite . One advantage of the bright light of a west-facing window is that flowering houseplants are often happiest there. This includes that longtime indoor favorite, the geranium. Before dismissing this as “your grandmother’s houseplant,” consider the advantage: lots of blooms in a wide range of colors, bright foliage, easy maintenance, an option for a hanging basket and the ability to blend in with different decorating styles.\nTo keep a geranium happy, water thoroughly and let it drain completely, then let it dry out a bit before watering again. In winter, water it slightly less, but don’t let the roots get completely dry. Feed with a half-strength fertilizer every two weeks or a quarter-strength fertilizer every week from spring through fall. Deadhead regularly and pinch back the stems to keep the plant well-shaped.\nMore: Other favorite flowering houseplants that thrive in west-facing windows include azalea ( Rhododendron indica ), cape jasmine ( Gardenia jasminoides ), hibiscus ( Hibiscus spp.), New Guinea impatiens ( Impatiens hybrids), Persian violet ( Exacum affine ) and shamrock ( Oxalis spp.).\nCaution: Geranium, azalea, cape jasmine, hibiscus and shamrock are toxic if ingested.\n3. Aloe Vera \n( Aloe barbadensis )\nSucculent sun lover . Aloe vera is probably best-known for its healing sap, but it also is a fine choice as a houseplant. Its strappy leaves look at home in almost any setting, but it particularly shines in contemporary or rustic spaces. It’s also easy to grow and can handle some neglect.\nFor the best results, plant it in a well-draining cactus mix and provide regular water from spring through fall, letting the pot drain thoroughly after you water and allowing the mix to dry out to about a half-inch from the top before watering again. Cut back on water almost completely in winter, watering sparingly about once a month.\nAn aloe is fine with regular home temperatures and humidity levels, but keep it out of drafts and chilly spots; the leaves are mostly water, so they will freeze if it’s too cold. If the leaves get too pale, provide more light. You can start new plants from the plantlets that form.\nMore: Although aloe is an excellent succulent choice to get started, you may also want to consider easy-to-grow jade plant ( Crassula ovata ) or spineless yucca ( Yucca elephantipes ), which require similar care. Another option is to start a small indoor cactus garden, as many of these also love the bright afternoon sun a west-facing window provides.\nCaution : Aloe, jade plant and yucca are toxic if ingested.\n4. Air Plants \n( Tillandsia spp.)\nNo soil necessary. Many of the bromeliads commonly sold as houseplants are good choices for a west-facing window. The fact that one of these, tillandsia, is often sold as an “air plant” is probably a contributing factor to its growing popularity. Although it doesn’t subsist only on air, it doesn’t need soil and therefore can be shown off in a small dish garden, attached to a piece of wood that hangs on a wall or sits on a table, or used as the focal point in a terrarium hanging in a window.\nAlthough a tillandsia may not need soil, it will need some care, which includes providing sufficient moisture. Several times a week, water the grasslike leaves lightly until they are barely moist, then let them dry out completely (use a mister if you want). Fertilize with a quarter-strength fertilizer twice a month when watering, as these plants absorb nutrients through their leaves. Provide good air circulation. If your plant develops brown tips, the humidity level may be too low.\nA tillandsia can handle direct sun in winter but will probably need more filtered light in summer. It also can handle indoor temperatures up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) and needs the higher temperatures to bloom.\nMore: Other popular bromeliads include blushing bromeliad ( Neoregelia carolinae ), earth star ( Cryptanthus spp.), queen’s tears ( Billbergia nutans ) and vase, or urn, plant ( Aechmea spp.).\n5. Bird-of-Paradise \n( Strelitzia reginae )\nIndoor tree. One of the most attention-getting indoor “trees” is the bird-of-paradise, with its broad leaves and tropical appeal. Give it plenty of room to grow since it can reach 6 feet tall.\nThe bird-of-paradise is happiest indoors with the bright light a west-facing window provides, though you may need to provide a bit of a screen in the form of a light curtain if the direct sun it receives is very bright. Water thoroughly, but let it dry out between waterings and allow it to get almost dry in winter. You’ll need to water more often if it’s in an exceptionally bright location. Fertilize with a half-strength fertilizer twice a month in spring and fall.\nMore: Bird-of-paradise may be the most dramatic, but there are other options to fill a large space in a west-facing location, including avocado ( Persea americana ), dwarf citrus ( Citrus spp.), butterfly palm ( Chrysalidocarpus lutescens ), jaggery palm ( Caryota urens ) and sago palm ( Cycas revoluta ).\nCaution: Bird-of-paradise, butterfly palm, jaggery palm and sago palm are toxic if ingested.\n6. Holiday Cactuses \nSeasonal stars . Long-lasting bright blooms in shades of white, pink, red, orange and lavender are one of the bonuses of growing what collectively can be called the holiday cactuses: Christmas cactus ( Schlumbergera bridgesii ), Thanksgiving cactus ( S. truncata ) and Easter cactus ( Rhipsalidopsis gaertneri or Hatiora gaertneri ). The common name refers to the time of year they bloom, and while there are some minor differences between them, overall they require much the same care.\nThese cactuses need rich soil that’s kept evenly moist. Fertilize weekly with about one-quarter strength fertilizer from spring through summer while the plant is growing, then cut back when it’s blooming. They don’t want to be in the direct sun, but they do appreciate the light from a west-facing window and are mostly fine with normal temperatures after they bloom.\nBloom is triggered by shorter days and a drop in temperatures at night once they start to form buds, usually around October or November. Put them in a spot where they’ll get 12 hours of darkness to stimulate bloom. You should also cut back on watering at this time. It will take the Easter cactus longer to bloom.\nMore: If you’re looking for other holiday plants for a west-facing window, consider amaryllis ( Hippeastrum hybrids) and poinsettia ( Euphorbia pulcherrima ) for the winter holidays, chrysanthemum ( Chrysanthemum spp.) for Thanksgiving, and lily ( Lilium spp.) and primrose ( Primula spp.) as indoor nods to spring.\nCaution: Amaryllis, poinsettia, chrysanthemum, lily and primrose are toxic if ingested.\n7. English Ivy \n( Hedera helix )\nTrailing form. There’s a reason English ivy is a tried-and-true indoor houseplant, especially at home in a hanging basket. It grows quickly, sending cascades of green or variegated foliage downward, but it can also be trained to climb. It can handle differing humidity and light levels, and it doesn’t require special care.\nKeep the soil evenly moist and fertilize weekly with a quarter-strength fertilizer. It likes bright light, but keep it out of direct sun in summer. Prune or pinch to keep its shape.\nMore: Other choices for a hanging basket include spiderwort ( Tradescantia spp.)and geranium ( Pelargonium spp.).\nCaution: English ivy, spiderwort and geranium are toxic if ingested.",

      "text": "By Laura Gaskill \nPublished November 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print  (Kenneth Mitchell Architect, LLC) \n (SuzAnn Kletzien Design) \n (Bay Area Contracting, Inc.) \nPrevious Next From keeping books you haven’t read (and probably never will) to hanging on to the mountains of art and school papers your child brings home, it’s often the little decisions we make about what to keep (and where it goes) that have the biggest impact on how much clutter we accumulate. But by examining your thought process and putting a few strategies in place, you can outsmart these five common clutter traps .\n1. Keeping Every Book You Buy, Whether You Like It or Not \nThe thought process: I just can’t get into this book, but everyone says it’s really good, so I guess I should keep it — you know, in case I decide to give it another try someday.\nThe right call: We all have different tastes, and it’s perfectly OK to not love a book that others have raved about. If you didn’t really enjoy a book, or couldn’t get into it, it’s better to give it away or sell it. Plus, by putting it back into circulation, you can give someone else who might actually love it the chance to read it.\nThe strategy: Keep a bag designated for collecting books to bring to the used-book store or Goodwill, and whenever you finish (or don’t finish, as the case may be) a book you’re not wild about, place it in the bag. When the bag is full, bring it out to your car so it’s ready to drop off when you get a chance — and save that precious space for a book you will actually treasure.\n2. Keeping Everything Your Child Has Ever Made \nThe thought process: My child made this, therefore it’s really important and I should keep it.\nThe right call: It’s true that if you’re a parent, some of your most treasured possessions are likely to be things your children have made. But that doesn’t mean every single item they bring home must be preserved forever! A funny thing happens when we keep things for a long time: They become harder to let go of. So it’s much easier to be choosy about what to save in the first place than it is to pare back later on.\nThe strategy: One good strategy is to choose a single container for your child’s artwork and school papers. The space limit can help make you choosier about what to keep. Use a bulletin board, art clips or fridge magnets to temporarily display your child’s work first, and then pick the “keepers” from this selection.\n3. Pretending You’ll Have More Time Later to Put Stuff Away \nThe thought process: I’ll just leave this here for now.\nThe right call: Does the item in question have a place where it clearly belongs? If so, take the extra few seconds to put it there. Dumping things in the wrong place will only make more work for you later, when you eventually gather the energy to tidy things up.\nThe strategy: Try the 10-second trick: Unless you live in a truly enormous home, there’s a good chance you can put just about anything in its place in 10 seconds. Practice telling yourself it will take only 10 seconds to put the item away, and then count as you complete the task. Ten seconds is nothing!\nRELATED: Keep a Clock Close By to Time Your Tasks \nAnd if you consistently dump the item in question in the same spot, consider making a place for it there with a hook, shelf or basket.\n4. Avoiding Paperwork Until It Threatens to Take Over the House \nThe thought process: I don’t feel like dealing with what’s on this paper, so I’ll just toss it in the pile.\nThe right call: Having a central place to put all incoming mail and paperwork is a wonderful idea. But when it’s time to sort that pile, it’s important to sort the whole thing . Whether it’s a bill, an event invite or information from your child’s school, taking the extra step to handle it — file it, add it to your calendar, recycle it — will keep your paper pile under control and ensure you don’t miss anything important, such as a bill that’s due or the school play.\nThe strategy: If you find yourself putting off sorting and filing paperwork indefinitely, that’s a good sign it’s time to reassess your filing system. To file quickly and easily, be sure your files have simple, clear labels for categories that make sense to you, and that they’re located in an accessible spot. You may even want to consider relocating some of your most frequently used files to a drawer near the entry (or wherever you keep incoming paper).\nRELATED: Your Guide to Organizing and Declutter the Whole House \n5. Overstuffing Your Cupboards With Extras, ‘Just in Case’ \nThe thought process: These extras might come in handy, so I’ll just stash them in the back of the cupboard.\nThe right call: A certain amount of extra supplies (extra TP, a set of extra towels for guests) is truly helpful. But past a certain point, “extra” just means clutter. Use the physical limits of your storage area as a guide to let you know when you are keeping too much stuff. If it fits easily in the space you have available and you will truly use it, keep it. If not, give it away.\nThe strategy: Think one in, one out. Whenever you buy something new, whether it’s towels or running shoes, peek into your closets and cupboards and see if you can remove something similar.",

      "text": "If you checked Twitter’s trending topics last night (Nov. 16), you may have noticed that Ginuwine had the internet going crazy. Basically, all of Twitter wanted to jump on the R&B singer’s saddle and ride his “Pony.”\nThough that’s a reference to his signature song, Pony (1996), I’m really not joking. The 46-year-old’s alleged nudes have hit the net and Twitter seemed quite impressed. Memes, jokes, and praise catapulted “Ginuwine” to not only a trending topic in the US, but also briefly worldwide.\nI'm here thinking #ginuwine trending because of a new song or sum. Y'all doneee surprised me. ? pic.twitter.com/vU6uIu3pJh \n— Nashany (@xonashany) November 17, 2016 \n\ngod was putting ginuwine together like pic.twitter.com/ngYKT2R8LN \n— chicken thot pie (@such_A_frknlady) November 17, 2016 \n\nOk #Ginuwine that saddle you was talking about.

Though he doesn’t confirm the leaked pics are his dick pics, he does definitely puts someone he shouldn’t have trusted on blast.\nEverybody keep talking about pics and all SO WHAT!!! We all trust people at times that we shouldn't won't say names as of now!!! Stay tuned\n— ELGIN (@Ginuwine) November 17, 2016 \n\nI’m also curious to what he means by “stay tuned.” Are more pics to come?\nIn any case, he attempted to shift the focus with the following tweets.\nSome times you play poker and then drop them cards when you know you will win I will wait but if you in Vegas come on out Saturday hardrock\n— ELGIN (@Ginuwine) November 17, 2016 \n\nBack to what matters most to me MY KIDS ttyt people it's on\n— ELGIN (@Ginuwine) November 17, 2016 \n\nGinuwine recently divorced his wife, singer Sole. The two were married for 11 years and separated in 2014. Their divorce was finalized in 2015. So, again, the R&B star was “just a bachelor looking for a partner” (another “Pony” reference). It’s quite possible the ladies’ man has slipped into some DMs and shared a few private pics.\nWhat’s interesting is that the alleged nudes were actually leaked on Tumblr back in August but was reported and taken down. However, nothing disappears on the internet and the pics could be found with a search.\nBut Given that the thirst was so real on Twitter last night, you can also check out the alleged dick pics for yourself.

      "text": "Published November 17, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nThis is a rush transcript from \"Your World,\" November 17, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. \nNEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right, a big day of news certainly for team Trump, a lot of the notable figures in and out of the Trump Tower.\nWith us now is Sean Spicer, of course, the key communications guy at the Republican National Committee, joining us, I believe, from Trump Tower.\nSean, how are you?\nSEAN SPICER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: I'm doing great, Neil. Thanks for having me.\nCAVUTO: First off on these Romney meeting rumors, first, is that true?\nThey're going to meet, Donald Trump with Mitt Romney this weekend in New Jersey?\nSPICER: That's correct, tomorrow morning -- excuse me, Saturday morning.\nCAVUTO: OK, in Basking Ridge, I guess.\nSPICER: Bedminster.\nCAVUTO: Bedminster. I apologize.\nNow, will he be offered, that, is Governor Romney, a post in the Trump administration?\nSPICER: I think most of these meetings that the president-elect has had over the last 48 hours and will continue to have are opportunities for some of these people who are frankly the best and brightest, accomplished leaders in government and business and such, to share their views and beliefs and opinions with the president-elect and then for him to get to know them a little bit better or talk to them about some options for his administration.\nBut in 99 percent of the cases, it is an opportunity just to have an open and frank discussion about the ideas and opinions and suggestions they have about how to implement a Trump agenda.\nCAVUTO: I see. So, these reports that maybe the media are pouncing on that he could be a future secretary of state, that is, Governor Romney, in a Trump administration, too soon to tell?\nSPICER: Well, ultimately, every one of these decisions is going to be the president-elect's to make.\nBut I would say that anything -- anyone who is suggesting that any decision has been made about any particular Cabinet, until he himself says it, it's way premature.\nCAVUTO: I hear you. Do you think it would be awkward?\nSPICER: Well, no.\nI mean, look, here is the thing. I think that one of the things that people have got to start realizing about Donald Trump is his commitment to enacting an agenda that's going to change Washington, shake things up, is what is at the core of him right now.\nHe is going to bring the best and the brightest, people who share that vision that he has articulated over the course of the campaign to make sure people come into government and are committed to making change.\nHe proposed yesterday a five-year lobbying ban for people who leave government. His goal is that you should be coming into a Trump administration to serve the American people and make this country better, not trying to server yourself.\nSo he is instituting a five-year ban on people becoming lobbyists after you serve in a Trump administration, and to take it one step further, a lifetime ban on anyone ever registering lobby on behalf of a foreign government. So, when he talked about bringing in real change, he is starting right off the bat.\nCAVUTO: It's impressive in this, this idea that he wanted only die-hard loyalists or those who had been backing him a long, long time ago to be in his inner circle, he has proven that wrong.\nHe has met with Nikki Haley, he has met with Ted Cruz, and again this weekend meeting with Mitt Romney, none of whom were very big fans of his. So, yet, they meet with him.\n(CROSSTALK)\nCAVUTO: And Chris Christie, who was the earliest to back him -- just hear me out -- Chris Christie, the earliest to back him and risked a lot of his own political skin to do so, now, he seems to be lucky if he were the doorman at the Trump Tower at this point. What's going on?\nSPICER: Well, look, first of all, Chris Christie is a valued member of this team.\nCAVUTO: Is he still on the team?\n(CROSSTALK)\nSPICER: Absolutely. He's the vice chair of the transition.\nBut the reality is, is that Donald Trump isn't looking at this as who backed me or who is a Republican or who is a Democrat. He is looking at who is the best. Who is going to help get...\n(CROSSTALK)\nCAVUTO: Does he not see Chris Christie as the best anymore, when he bumped him down and got rid of his people?\nSPICER: No, no.\nLook, at the end of the day, he brought in the vice president-elect, somebody who has got 12 years of experience in Washington, D.C., and the leadership of the House of Representatives, an experienced governor and the leader of -- and the new vice president to say come in and take over the team. There's a ton of precedent for that.\nChris Christie is still a valued member of this team. But the reality is, he understood that we needed to get things done. We needed to do it right.\nHe wanted his vice president to come in and lead that effort. He understood how well he was respected and known in Washington.\n(CROSSTALK)\nCAVUTO: But what I heard about the Christie thing, though, Sean, is that part of it was that Christie was giving a lot of lobbyists' names and a lot of lobbyists, period, who were in the group. And Trump recoiled at that.\nHis son-in-law -- I don't know if this is true -- recoiled at that.\nI don't know what the truth is. But, bottom line, they are out. It seems like Christie has been downgraded. And all these other people who were critical of him -- and it says volumes about Trump, I think, if it shows that he is not looking blindly to loyalists here. But I'm getting a different vibe.\nSPICER: Well, he is not -- look, he looks at it like, are you going to get the job done? That's what he wants. He knows Mike Pence is going to do that. The rest of the team here is 100 percent committed to doing that.\nThat's why he went out of his way to say I'm going to have most forward- thinking lobbyist ban that anyone in Washington has ever seen. You are coming into government to serve the American people, not server yourself.\nI'm going to make sure that people can't come in and lobby a foreign government because they have made connections through my administration.\nSo, at the end of the day, what this really is about is him showing that I campaigned and I made a promise to the American people that I was going to bring change to Washington. I was going to shake things up. I was going to advocate for every single American coast to coast who feels like their government hasn't heard them or listened to them.\nAnd he is showing it day after day that he is keeping his word and he is getting things done.\nCAVUTO: So, Sean, what did you think when Rand Paul, senator from Kentucky, former presidential candidate, said if Rudy Giuliani were up for secretary of state, or, for that matter, John Bolton, secretary, he couldn't support either, that they're too -- they're wild cards? What did you make of that?\nSPICER: Well, I would just caution everybody, until Mr. Trump himself announces a nominee for a particular position, then it's not happening.\nSo, to speculate on who would be good or who would be bad before Mr. Trump talks about them is a little premature. But what I will say is, if you look at the caliber and quality of the people that come in and out of this tower the last 48 hours, and that he is scheduled to meet with in the next couple of days, it's pretty remarkable, Fred Smith, Eva Moskowitz, General Flynn, General Keane.\nThe list goes up and down of people who have been unbelievably successful in government, in business, in education. It's just phenomenal. And the quality of people that from the top is amazing. The number of people that are from the top is amazing.\nAnd the number of people that want to be part of the Trump administration, we took almost 50,000 resumes in the past few days of people that want to do this.\nCAVUTO: Wow.\nSPICER: There's an infectious atmosphere occurring right now, where people who really want to see things happen, who want to see change occur, who want to make this country better are flocking to Trump Tower, who are submitting their resume to the Web site because they want to see it done.\nAnd they know Donald Trump knows how to make it happen.\nCAVUTO: Well, it must be a who's-who crowd. You were there, all right?\nSo, thank you very much, my friend. Thank you very much for coming.\nSPICER: Thanks, Neil.\nCAVUTO: All right.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Claudie Haigneré, 59, reportedly had to “be restrained” after yelling the eerie caution prior to falling into a coma from an overdose of sleeping pills. \nA shocking video claims France’s first female astronaut screamed “Earth must be warned!” before she attempted suicide. \nClaudie Haigneré, 59, reportedly had to “be restrained” after yelling the eerie caution prior to falling into a coma from an overdose of sleeping pills. \nA six-minute YouTube conspiracy film by UFOmania has resurfaced this week examining her story. It has been viewed nearly a million times. \nIn 1993, esteemed scientist Claudie was a backup crew member for the 1993 Mir Altaïr mission, which included her future husband, Jean-Pierre Haigneré. \nShe made it to the Mir space station in 1996 as part of the Russian-French Cassiopée mission, and in 2001 became the first European woman to visit the International Space Station. \nThe asteroid 135268 Haigneré is named after Claudie and her husband. \nAfter retiring from space work, Claudie entered French politics and worked as minister delegate for research and new technologies from 2002 to 2004 and minister delegate for European affairs from 2004 to 2005. \nBut, despite her efforts, budgets for scientific research were cut. \nAfter leaving politics, she worked in a biology lab at the Pasteur Institute. \nAfter retiring from space work, Claudie entered French politics and worked as minister delegate for research and new technologies from 2002 to 2004 and minister delegate for European affairs from 2004 to 2005. \nBut, despite her efforts, budgets for scientific research were cut. \nAfter leaving politics, she worked in a biology lab at the Pasteur Institute. \nThat’s where the story gets strange. \nIn December 2008, it was widely reported that Claudie had to be rushed to a hospital after allegedly taking an overdose of sleeping pills. \nIt was reported that she was found conscious but had to be restrained while screaming, “Earth must be warned!” before lapsing into a coma. \nClaudie blamed the incident on “burnout syndrome” and is now the director of the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie — the largest science museum in Europe. \nHowever, alien enthusiasts believe she was trying to warn the Earth about life in outer space. \nThe YouTube video, which is narrated by a robot voice, is a conspiracy that blends fact and fiction. \nClaudie did attempt suicide in 2008, but the rest appears to be made up and continuously reappears on conspiracy forums, such as David Icke’s website. \nThe video says: “She had to be forcefully restrained after screaming ‘Earth must be warned!’ \n“More ominously, her laboratory where she worked at the forefront of human/alien DNA research was destroyed by fire.” \nThe video uses quotes from real reports by news agency AFP, but they’re taken out of context, with additional information. \nThere is no such thing as “human/alien DNA research” because we have never encountered any aliens. \nClaudie’s story often pops up when something happens to a prominent UFO expert. \nThe mysterious death of conspiracy theorist Max Spiers in October may have triggered the latest interest. \nSpiers was found dead on a sofa at a friend’s house in Poland days after warning his mother to “investigate” if anything happened to him. Friends also claim he had vomited a black liquid before his death.",

      "text": "Twitter's Jack Dorsey: \"Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate.\"\nPhoto by Getty Images Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has apologized for a neo-Nazi ad that appeared on the site.\nDorsey tweeted Thursday that Twitter's automated system let a promoted tweet from a white supremacist group slip through. The ad has since been removed, and the group's account suspended.\n\"We made a mistake here and we apologize,\" Dorsey said.\nDorsey included a link to a Wednesday story on Motherboard that featured a screenshot of the ad and that noted it had appeared just after Twitter announced new measures to combat hate speech.\nTwitter's ad gaffe follows a company crackdown on accounts associated with the alt-right movement , a fringe conservative movement that's linked to white supremacy. On Wednesday, the social network suspended the accounts of high-profile alt-right leaders, including Richard Spencer, who runs the National Policy Institute, a white-nationalist think tank.\nOn Tuesday, Twitter said it's introducing new tools that allow users to block abusive content . Its community guidelines also prohibit hateful and abusive behavior .\nTwitter isn't the only social network that's been plagued by hate speech. Facebook has had similar problems. To combat the issue, Facebook has a subcontractor army of \"several thousand people\" overseas that evaluates flagged content, according to a report Thursday by NPR . Those contractors are encouraged to move fast, with workers sometimes making decisions on content every 10 seconds, the report said.\nReached by CNET, a Facebook spokeswoman declined to say how big the overseas team is or to share any other information about the subcontractors' process for evaluating flagged content.\nThe episode on Thursday follows other criticisms tech giants have gotten about what they're showing on their sites and how.\nFacebook and Google have been embroiled in a fake-news controversy that some people have suggested affected the outcome of the US presidential election . President Barack Obama said on Thursday the spread of false information on social media is a threat to democracy .\nFirst published November 17, 11:52 a.m. PT.\nUpdate, 3:27 p.m.: Adds context about Facebook's issues with hate speech.",

      "text": "Noonan: What to Tell Your Children About Trump   Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print AP File \nWe are the world’s oldest democracy, we are good people, and we’ve been through shocks before. By Peggy Noonan, The Wall Street Journal \nEight points and two anecdotes as we continue to digest this astounding election. \nYou don’t know a tree is hollow until you push hard against it and it falls. The establishments of both parties did not know, a year ago, that they were hollow trees. They thought themselves strong because they always had been, and people think what has been true will continue. Then suddenly the tree is pushed and falls. To me that is the symbol, the image of 2016: the hollowed trees and how easily they fell. \nElection night 2016 was not like 1980. That year produced an outcome fully within the political norms: a former two-term governor won the presidency. This year’s outcome went beyond all previous norms. Twenty-sixteen was like nothing in our lifetimes. In the future people will say, “Where were you that election night?” the way they do for other epochal moments. \nMuch of the mainstream, legacy media continues its self-disgrace. Having failed to kill Donald Trump’s candidacy they will now aim at his transition. Soon they will try to kill his presidency. Any journalists who are judicious toward Trump, who treat him fairly or even as a human being, are now accused of “normalizing” him. This is a manipulation: It is a way of warning your colleagues to approach the president-elect with the proper hostility or be scorned. None of this will do our country any good. \nThe left is in enraged mourning. A better way forward would be: reflect, absorb, gather your strength as the opposition, constructively oppose. Lose the hissing rancor. Use that energy to rebuild your party. \nRight now 60 million people are very happy, and hopeful. They haven’t taken to the streets in elation, so we can’t see them. They haven’t broken car windows in their joy. Respect their happiness. \nThis is my fear: The question we ask after every national election is, “Can we come together?” The question this year is more, “Do we even want to come together?” Have the two nations within our nation reached a point of permanent estrangement? If the cultural left eases up and the economic right loosens up, maybe things can be soothed.",

      "text": "7 worst failed rescues on 'Gilligan’s Island' Published November 17, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nThere were scores of guest stars who all managed to get on and off “Gilligan’s Island” with ease, yet the group from the S.S. Minnow never quite managed to tag along. Here are the hapless gang's saddest failed escape attempts. \n(Professor, we blame you the most, because you were the smartest.) 1. Castaways make a movie \nAP \nThe group finds a sunken ship filled with movie equipment, but rather than oh, say, try and repair the boat and sail away on it, they make a movie to inspire someone to rescue them. They manage to get this movie to someone on the mainland, but it wins them a Cannes Film Festival award instead of a rescue. \nWe blame the French. 2. Mad scientist mishaps \nAP \nA mad scientist visits the island… twice! In two episodes a mad scientist named Dr. Boris Balinkoff managed to get himself on and off the island, in one case with the castaways in tow. He is, of course, evil and only interested in experimenting on the shipwrecked group. Either way, this guy made it off the isle two times when a group of seven people couldn’t seem to figure out how to escape once. \nAnd he was insane! 3. Ginger's twin \nAP \nEva Grubb (played by Tina Louise) gets a makeover from her strikingly similar friend Ginger. Once Ginger rids Eva of her glasses and drab attire, she makes her way back to Hollywood…alone, to steal Ginger’s movie roles. 4. True love conquers…nothing? \nAP \nA pretty socialite (Zsa Zsa Gabor) comes to the island, looking for a place to build a swanky resort. She falls for the Professor, and though she promises to rescue the castaways, she can’t find her way back to their elusive island. Was she even really trying? Guess she wasn’t that in love with the Professor after all. 5. The Mosquitoes buzz off \nAP \nA fictional band as big as The Beatles called The Mosquitoes arrived on the island for some rest and relaxation, going totally undetected by media outlets and their hoards of adoring fans. The castaways try to make their time on the island a living hell so they'll want to leave, which they do - but without the annoying castaways. Because they were so annoying! Of course! 6. Mars mistakes \nAP \nA NASA satellite headed for Mars accidentally lands on the castaway’s island, and the group tries to use its nifty camera to get in touch with someone on the mainland. But, somehow, Gilligan gets everyone covered in feathers (yes, feathers) just as the camera captures their image and they are mistaken for strange alien chickens. Yes, alien chickens. 7. A famous producer \nAP \nA well-known producer named Harold Hecuba (Phil Silvers) lands on the island. The castaways produce a musical version of Hamlet to impress him so he will take them back to Hollywood with him. They fail to impress him. He leaves without them. \n“Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.” \nThat's from Hamlet. Describes \"Gilligan's Island\" pretty well.",

(Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images) On Tuesday morning, Twitter published a blog post outlining new steps aimed at curbing the spike in abusive tweets and Twitter accounts that have plagued the site in recent years, particularly during an election cycle that produced a surge in white supremacist and so-called alt-right accounts.\nTwitter has been criticized for taking a passive stance on the issue. But the new steps announced Tuesday, combined with the site’s move to suspend several accounts of high-profile alt-right users, seemed to mark a step toward greater censorship of the extremist accounts.\nTwitter’s plan to limit abusive and hateful content includes an updated policy that allows users to report such content even if it targets other users. It also plans to expand the “mute” feature — which allows users to remove an account’s tweets from their timeline without blocking the account — to include keywords, phrases and conversations.\nBut, as Twitter acknowledged on its blog, the new steps will not “suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.” In fact, about 12 hours after Twitter published the announcement, Los-Angeles based writer and musician Ariana Lenarsky posted a screenshot of an ad on her timeline promoted by the now-suspended account @NEW_ORDER_1488, which represents a neo-Nazi website called The New Order.\nThe ad links to an article on The New Order’s website titled “The United States Was Founded as a White People’s Republic,” followed by the hashtag #WhiteAmerica. The website’s homepage, adorned at the top by a Nazi swastika, advocates for a “rebirth of racial idealism and reverence for the eternal laws of Nature.” The article promoted in the Twitter ad has been deleted from the website.\n[ Twitter introduces a mute button for trolls as it struggles to fight online abuse ]\nThe promotion violated Twitter’s ad policy , which “prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the mistake and apologized in a tweet Thursday. He said Twitter’s “automated system” allowed the ad to go through, notifying users the ad has been “fixed.”\nWe made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm\n— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 17, 2016\nTwitter could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe social media company has searched for options to combat its declining stock prices and sluggish user growth, but investors, including Disney, have expressed skepticism that has been linked to Twitter’s lenient approach to abuse and harassment.\nLenarsky responded to Dorsey’s apology on Thursday, calling for people to continue holding Twitter accountable for filtering its promotions.\nAcknowledgement from @jack & @twitter is great, but it really isn't over. We must continue to hold feet to the fire on this stuff (Nazis).\n— Ariana Lenarsky (@aardvarsk) November 17, 2016\nMore from Morning Mix\nWhy a Minn. mom is suing her transgender teen and the clinic that gave her hormones\nSeveral World War II warships mysteriously disappear from watery grave at the site of Battle of Java Sea",

Fuck you.” \nThe second: “I fucking hate black people and their inconsiderate asses for voting for Clinton. Fuck you.” \nThe first was found not to be in “violation of Twitter’s Rules regarding abusive behavior,” while the second resulted in the user’s account being banned.

      "text": "Earlier this week, Twitter announced that it was temporarily banning several accounts linked to so-called “alt-right” white supremacist groups, because they had violated the company’s hateful conduct policy.\nProgressives applauded Twitter’s stance, but some are now calling on Twitter users to do away with the term “alt-right” altogether. They argue that it obscures the truth about what the group believes. By legitimizing and sanitizing bigotry, the argument goes, the term “alt-right” could become a powerful recruiting tool. Among the critics is a man who knows a thing or two about buzzwords: William Gibson, author of the influential cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, who coined the term “cyberspace” in 1982.\nOn Nov. 16, he tweeted:\nDon't use \"alt-right\". It's an increasingly effective branding move for authoritarian white supremacists. Each time we use it, we help them\n— William Gibson (@GreatDismal) November 16, 2016 \nOthers have made the same appeal:\nBy the way. This would be a good time to remind you to stop helping white supremacists hide behind the \"alt-right\" moniker. They're racists.\n— Boney Hurdle (@eclecticbrotha) November 14, 2016 \nAnother thing media organizations can do is stop using \"alt-right,\" a name white supremacists gave themselves to hide who they really are.\n— Jesse Berney (@jesseberney) November 12, 2016 \nGlad Twitter suspended white supremacist accounts. Now can we stop calling white supremacists simple \"alt-right\"? https://t.co/vNozWNEL00 \n— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) November 17, 2016 \nSome have noted that “alt-right” is perilously close to the term “alt-rock,” which lends the movement the cool factor of a 1990s grunge band.\nAs journalists have pointed out , the meaning of the term “alt-right” is nebulous and ever-changing. It first started circulating in 2008, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, when it was popularized by Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank. Members of the alternative group began to find each other, mostly in fringe online chat groups, following the decline of the paleoconservative movement, which Reason calls, “a wing of the right that had spent the ’80s and ’90s arguing that the conservative mainstream was too globalist and too egalitarian.”\nIronically, it was a late-August speech by presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that sent thousands of Americans to Google, searching for the label’s definition. Clinton had brought attention to her opponent Donald Trump’s many links to the radical alt-right, chief among them his then-new campaign manager Steve Bannon, who is considered a spokesman for the movement. This week president-elect Trump named Bannon , also the head of the far-right Breitbart News, his “chief strategist and senior counselor.”\nThat appointment has once again exalted the term “alt-right” in the news. Some progressives see Bannon’s arrival at the White House as a threat to democracy itself, and lawmakers and political groups are lobbying to have him removed.\nStill, the values that define the movement remain hazy. The ideology is “often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve ‘white identity,’ oppose multiculturalism, and defend ‘Western values,'” according to the Associated Press. Some members choose to call themselves “Europeanists” or “white nationalists,” rather than racists or anti-semites, and some believe races should live separately, according to The Economist . The alt-right “thinks that calling a podcast ‘The Daily Shoah’ is striking a bold blow for freedom of speech and against political correctness” and sees misogyny “as a bold rebellion against the prevailing culture,” the magazine has said.\nBannon, perhaps strategically, has left things vague . “Look, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,” he said. “Are there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that’s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.”\nMainstream conservatives have their own gripes about the term. Calling neo-nazis “the alt-right,” for instance, creates the impression that they are a valid option under the “right” umbrella. “To call this collection of largely anonymous malcontents members of a ‘conservative’ movement is simply fallacious,” argues Noah Rothman of Commentary , adding that there is little the alt-right wants to conserve about America.\nA Change.org user in Los Angeles has started a small petition calling for the boycott of media outlets that refer to the racist group as “alt-right.” For now, however, the term is a placeholder, without a good substitute in sight.",

      "text": "Twitter runs neo-Nazi ad hours after outlining steps to limit abuse, apologizes for mistake Twitter EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP/Getty Images Jasper Scherer The Washington Post \nOn Tuesday morning, Twitter published a blog post outlining new steps aimed at curbing the spike in abusive tweets and Twitter accounts that have plagued the site in recent years, particularly during an election cycle that produced a surge in white supremacist and so-called alt-right accounts. \nTwitter has been criticized for taking a passive stance on the issue. But the new steps announced Tuesday, combined with the site's move to suspend several accounts of high-profile alt-right users, seemed to mark a step toward greater censorship of the extremist accounts. \nTwitter's plan to limit abusive and hateful content includes an updated policy that allows users to report such content even if it targets other users. It also plans to expand the \"mute\" feature - which allows users to remove an account's tweets from their timeline without blocking the account - to include keywords, phrases and conversations. \nBut, as Twitter acknowledged on its blog, the new steps will not \"suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.\" In fact, about 12 hours after Twitter published the announcement, Los-Angeles based writer and musician Ariana Lenarsky posted a screenshot of an ad on her timeline promoted by the now-suspended account @NEW_ORDER_1488, which represents a neo-Nazi website called The New Order. \nThe ad links to an article on The New Order's website titled \"The United States Was Founded as a White People's Republic,\" followed by the hashtag #WhiteAmerica. The website's homepage, adorned at the top by a Nazi swastika, advocates for a \"rebirth of racial idealism and reverence for the eternal laws of Nature.\" The article promoted in the Twitter ad has been deleted from the website. \nThe promotion violated Twitter's ad policy, which \"prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the mistake and apologized in a tweet Thursday. He said Twitter's \"automated system\" allowed the ad to go through, notifying users the ad has been \"fixed,\" tweeting: We made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm \nTwitter could not be immediately reached for comment. \nThe social media company has searched for options to combat its declining stock prices and sluggish user growth, but investors, including Disney, have expressed skepticism that has been linked to Twitter's lenient approach to abuse and harassment. \nLenarsky responded to Dorsey's apology on Thursday, calling for people to continue holding Twitter accountable for filtering its promotions, tweeting: Acknowledgement from @jack & @twitter is great, but it really isn't over. We must continue to hold feet to the fire on this stuff (Nazis).",

      "text": "Zero Hedge November 18, 2016 \nDays after Twitter unleashed a purge of so-called “alt-right” accounts , deleting users without explanation, many speculated that this would lead to an angry backlash in which conservative pundits using Twitter would voluntarily leave the struggling social network in protest over Twitter’s suddenly rampant, and dubious, censorship. \nOvernight, this was confirmed when actor and prominent conservative commentator James Woods tweeted that “Since @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll” \nHe also changed his bio to say “ Twitter has now sadly abdicated its position as a sole beacon of free speech. Voltaire’s famous dictum has been quietly buried by these left wing savages .” Since @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll pic.twitter.com/bismJDb3wh \n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 18, 2016 \nAs we warned earlier this week, while Twitter has every right to block and delete any users it chooses – even if one may question its preference to focus on right-wing, conservative accounts even as Islamic State “terrorist” accounts continue to proliferate within Twitter – the big risk for the company, whose growth rate has already peaked resulting in its share price plunging and leading to numerous rotations at the corner office and mass layoffs, is pushing away as much as half of its audience. \nMeanwhile, we are confident that in the aftermath of Woods’ boycott, many more vocal conservatives will follow suit, leading to even greater user-retention headaches for Jack Dorsey – whose tactics to allegedly become a liberal echo chamber have been criticized by both the left and right – and an even lower TWTR stock price.

(Photo: Charlie Nye / The Star) Buy Photo \nESPN anchor and Indiana University graduate Sage Steele wrote a lengthy Facebook post Thursday on embracing diversity within the black community. Reactions to that post came quickly on a different social media platform. \n\"Instead of praising or uplifting each other,\" Steele wrote on Facebook, \"way too many people of color choose to tear down, mock and spew hatred at other blacks who feel differently, think differently, or make decisions that are different from theirs. That, my friends, is hypocrisy at its best.\" Post by sage.steele . \nSteele's post comes after Miko Grimes, the wife of Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback Brent Grimes, criticized Steele on Twitter following the ESPN anchor's tweet to Bucs wide receiver Mike Evans after he knelt during the national anthem. Steele, who grew up in a military family , took exception.

      "text": "Twitter suspends several accounts over hate speech, threats of violence Thursday Nov 17, 2016 at 6:29 AM Nov 17, 2016 at 6:29 AM \nThe Associated Press \nNEW YORK — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promised to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \nThe alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \nTHE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term \"alt-right,\" says he has never called for violence and hasn't tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n\"This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,\" he said. \"Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it's also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n\"Twitter is not just some website. It's a public space and we have to treat it that way.\" \nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn't given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \nDickinson says he's appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter. Spencer says he doesn't plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. Paul Town was also banned, although he said in an email to The Associated Press that his Twitter feed is a \"combination of satire and performance art\" that has been misconstrued as alt-right. \nBACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT \nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it's especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos.",

      "text": "Earlier this week, Twitter shuttered the accounts apparently belonging to white supremacy, Neo-Nazi, and alt-right members. This has led white supremacists to protest against this perceived crackdown by Twitter. Photo by edisona (Pixabay) Creating “fake black accounts” to protest \nTo protest, white supremacists are now reportedly planning to create “fake black accounts.” For this purpose, Andrew Anglin of the Neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer called for a misinformation campaign, asking readers to create fake accounts on the platform, reports The Next Web. \nIn a blog post, Anglin says, “When you have time, create a fake black person account. Just go on black Twitter and see what they look like, copy that model. Start filling it with rap videos and booty-shaking or whatever else these blacks post. Read through their posts to get an idea of how they post. You need to be able to post in a manner which is indistinguishable from normal black tweeters.” \nSuch a move is likely for the purpose of widening the racial divide in the country. To do this, the group will use troll accounts that will presumably bear a lot of resemblance to the racially-driven stereotypes of black people than African Americans themselves, notes TNW. \nThe incident is really sad, but expecting proper dialogue or a discussion with a site featuring headlines like “Dumb Old Jew Bitch Barbara Boxer Introduces Bill to End Electoral College?” or “Jesse Jackson Says Pardon Hillary, She Dindu Nuffin Muffuguh,” is actually too much, says TNW. \nAnglin claims that the group currently has more than 1,000 fake accounts. Though that’s not much, the pace at which his post is spreading on white supremacy and other alt-right websites is noticeable. Twitter CEO apologizes for a white supremacist ad \nAn ad promoting a white supremacist group created a huge uproar on Twitter recently, spurring an apology from CEO Jack Dorsey on Thursday. \n“We made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed,” he tweeted. \nThe ad showed eight white children in a field and had the title “’New Article: The United States Was Founded as a White People’s Republic’ on NEW ORDER website.” It was tweeted from an account with the handle “@NEW_ORDER_1488.” \nOn Thursday, Twitter shares closed down 0.43% at $18.55. Year to date, the stock is down almost 20%, while in the last year, it is down more than 26%.",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print HP Elite x3 with display (HP) \nThe HP Elite x3 is an ambitious attempt to turn a smartphone into a desktop PC. Does it work? \nI’ve been using the HP Elite x3 smartphone on and off for the last month or so. Here’s the short version of the review: the phone is a rock-solid, gorgeous design that’s fast and topped with a giant 6-inch display. The desktop part of the package isn’t an outright replacement for your laptop or desktop PC but, then again, it’s not meant to be a full-out PC. \nWho and what is it meant for? \nMy take is it’s for hyper-mobile business types who prefer to – or must – spend most of their time on a handheld mobile device but want the latitude to have access to full-blown Windows or company applications. Of course, a typical consumer isn’t prohibited from getting the x3, but HP says that’s not who it’s designed for. (Though it is sold through the Microsoft Store, both online and physical stores.) \nThe phone \nHP has designed a gorgeous phone with a 5.96-inch OLED display sporting an attractive matte black backside (not unlike the iPhone 7 Plus standard black model), Qualcomm’s latest 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a dual SIM tray. \nOther notable features are a rear 16 megapixel camera and 8 megapixel front camera. And you can unlock the x3 with an integrated iris scanner and fingerprint reader. \nWhile I haven’t used it as standalone phone extensively, I was able to activate it at an AT&T store and it provides a strong LTE signal with performance no worse or better than my Verizon iPhone 7 Plus. \nIS SAMSUNG'S LOSS A WIN FOR APPLE AND GOOGLE PHONES? \nThe 16MP camera is okay, but it falls short of the iPhone 7’s camera. Battery life, however, is nothing short of amazing. HP rates web-based battery life at 14 hours. I’ve gotten through two days of fairly constant use without recharging. \nBut the most remarkable thing about the x3 isn’t the phone itself but what it can do when plugged into the dock. \nWait, it’s a handheld laptop, er, desktop PC? \nI’ve spent almost all of my time with x3 plugged into the dock and hooked up to my external Dell display and an HP wireless keyboard and mouse. I’ve never used a smartphone as desktop PC but, yes, it does work. The x3’s Qualcomm 820 processor running Windows 10 Mobile is fast but, needless to say, not as fast as a conventional 2016 Windows laptop running desktop Windows 10. And the x3 doesn’t multitask like a PC running Windows 10. \nTHE REVIEWS ARE IN: GOOGLE'S PIXEL PHONE TAKES ON THE IPHONE 7 \nYou can run a stripped-down version of Microsoft Office that comes with Windows 10 Mobile. But it's important to note that Microsoft has, in effect, stopped promoting Windows 10 Mobile as a consumer platform. So, there are relatively few popular third-party apps (and there were never many to begin with). \nBut beyond the Windows 10 Mobile desktop, HP provides a second option called HP Workspace. HP says it gives “employees immediate access to your company's curated application catalog,”-- in other words, you can access your company’s apps as you would on a standard Windows laptop. For me, it provides access to full-blown Office 365 (Word, Excel et al) and popular applications like the Google Chrome browser, which is not available on Windows 10 Mobile. \nFITBIT UPDATES FITNESS TRACKERS, AND SAMSUNG DEBUTS GEAR S3 WATCH \nHP Workspace is a powerful addition and, I’m guessing, would be a key reason for a business – large or small – to consider the x3. The downside is that HP Workspace is occasionally unresponsive. That said, it’s not really designed, in my opinion, as a full-time environment but as a quick way to access full desktop and/or company apps for, let’s say an hour or two, then log off. In that respect, it succeeds. \nThe x3 with dock (which has both a traditional USB and new USB-C port and a DisplayPort connector) sells for $999 at the Microsoft Store, while HP lists the phone itself as $799 on its website as of mid-November. HP is also slated to bring out an Ultrabook laptop shell that works with the x3 as a dock (it looks like a thin-and-light laptop with a keyboard and display but only houses a battery). When I spoke to HP several weeks ago, they told me that they were still trying to fix some bugs with the laptop dock. HP Workspace starts at $49 per month for 40 hours of access. Advertisement",

      "text": "2016 6 hours ago \nEarlier this week, Twitter announced that it was temporarily banning several accounts linked to so-called “alt-right” white supremacist groups, because they had violated the company’s hateful conduct policy. \nProgressives applauded Twitter’s stance, but some are now calling on Twitter users to do away with the term “alt-right” altogether. They argue that it obscures the truth about what the group believes. By legitimizing and sanitizing bigotry, the argument goes, the term “alt-right” could become a powerful recruiting tool. Among the critics is a man who knows a thing or two about buzzwords: William Gibson, author of the influential cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, who coined the term “cyberspace” in 1982. \nOn Nov. 16, he tweeted: Don't use \"alt-right\". It's an increasingly effective branding move for authoritarian white supremacists. Each time we use it, we help them \n— William Gibson (@GreatDismal) November 16, 2016 \nOthers have made the same appeal: By the way. This would be a good time to remind you to stop helping white supremacists hide behind the \"alt-right\" moniker. They're racists. \n— Boney Hurdle (@eclecticbrotha) November 14, 2016 Another thing media organizations can do is stop using \"alt-right,\" a name white supremacists gave themselves to hide who they really are. \n— Jesse Berney (@jesseberney) November 12, 2016 Glad Twitter suspended white supremacist accounts. Now can we stop calling white supremacists simple \"alt-right\"? https://t.co/vNozWNEL00 \n— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) November 17, 2016 \nSome have noted that “alt-right” is perilously close to the term “alt-rock,” which lends the movement the cool factor of a 1990s grunge band. \nAs journalists have pointed out , the meaning of the term “alt-right” is nebulous and ever-changing. It first started circulating in 2008, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, when it was popularized by Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank. Members of the alternative group began to find each other, mostly in fringe online chat groups, following the decline of the paleoconservative movement, which Reason calls, “a wing of the right that had spent the ’80s and ’90s arguing that the conservative mainstream was too globalist and too egalitarian.” \nIronically, it was a late-August speech by presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that sent thousands of Americans to Google, searching for the label’s definition. Clinton had brought attention to her opponent Donald Trump’s many links to the radical alt-right, chief among them his then-new campaign manager Steve Bannon, who is considered a spokesman for the movement. This week president-elect Trump named Bannon , also the head of the far-right Breitbart News, his “chief strategist and senior counselor.” \nThat appointment has once again exalted the term “alt-right” in the news. Some progressives see Bannon’s arrival at the White House as a threat to democracy itself, and lawmakers and political groups are lobbying to have him removed. \nStill, the values that define the movement remain hazy. The ideology is “often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve ‘white identity,’ oppose multiculturalism, and defend ‘Western values,'” according to the Associated Press. Some members choose to call themselves “Europeanists” or “white nationalists,” rather than racists or anti-semites, and some believe races should live separately, according to The Economist . The alt-right “thinks that calling a podcast ‘The Daily Shoah’ is striking a bold blow for freedom of speech and against political correctness” and sees misogyny “as a bold rebellion against the prevailing culture,” the magazine has said. \nBannon, perhaps strategically, has left things vague . “Look, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,” he said in Mother Jones. “Are there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that’s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.” \nMainstream conservatives have their own gripes about the term. Calling neo-nazis “the alt-right,” for instance, creates the impression that they are a valid option under the “right” umbrella. “To call this collection of largely anonymous malcontents members of a ‘conservative’ movement is simply fallacious,” argues Noah Rothman of Commentary , adding that there is little the alt-right wants to conserve about America. \nA Change.org user in Los Angeles has started a small petition calling for the boycott of media outlets that refer to the racist group as “alt-right.” For now, however, the term is a placeholder, with no good substitute in sight.

      "text": "Published November 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print REUTERS/Stephen Lam \nBy Howard Kurtz  \nPublished November 18, 2016  | FoxNews.com \n\nHow on earth did fake news become so popular?\nI don’t mean the major media stories that some of you find unfair or exaggerated. I’m talking about made-up-stuff being merchandized for clicks and profits. And since such fare spreads like wildfire on Facebook, the social network is under fire for not curbing the crap.\nA Buzzfeed analysis found that the 20 top-performing bogus election stories did better on Facebook than the 20 top-performing stories from such legitimate sites as the New York Times, Washington Post, NBC and Huffington Post.\nThe legit stuff drew 7,367,000 shares, reactions and comments, while the fictional material drew 8,711,000 shares, reactions and comments.\n“Of the 20 top-performing false election stories identified in the analysis, all but three were overtly pro-Donald Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton. Two of the biggest false hits were a story claiming Clinton sold weapons to ISIS and a hoax claiming the pope endorsed Trump, which the site removed after publication of this article. The only viral false stories during the final three months that were arguably against Trump’s interests were a false quote from Mike Pence about Michelle Obama, a false report that Ireland was accepting American ‘refugees’ fleeing Trump, and a hoax claiming RuPaul said he was groped by Trump.”\nThe study found just one uber-popular story from a ultra-partisan left-wing site, which claimed that Ireland was accepting anti-Trump “refugees” from the United States.\nFacebook, while using a broader measurement than Buzzfeed, admits it has a problem. And after Google announced this week that it would try to purge such material, Facebook began banning such sites from using its advertising network, trying to starve them financially by removing the profit motive.\nEven President Obama got into the act yesterday, offering a 7-minute exposition at a news conference in Berlin on the dangers of fake news:\n“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not. And particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in sound bites and snippets off their phones, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,\" he said. \"Then democracy will break down.”\nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

Since @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll pic.twitter.com/bismJDb3wh \n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 18, 2016 \nThe Hollywood star exited the social media company following its announced intention of removing alleged extreme accounts in an ‘alt-right’ purge. \nAn active Twitter user since 2009, Woods’ account boasted over 483 thousand followers. His highly critical tweets of President Obama and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton were cheered by his fans and made liberals’ heads explode. \n“Twitter has now sadly abdicated its position as a sole beacon of free speech. Voltaire’s famous dictum has been quietly buried by these left wing savages,” his Twitter page reads. \nTwitter users were sad to see him go and wondered if the same censorship would ever befall leftist liberals. \n  @RealJamesWoods @twitter if you mean it I will miss you you certainly helped the election cycle be funny and entertaining.wishing you well!",

In this Nov. 2, 2016, file photo, Republican Louisiana Senate candidate, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, waits for the start of a debate for Louisiana candidates for the U.S. Senate, at Dillard University in New Orleans. (AP Photo/Gerald ... more > By Kelly Riddell - The Washington Times - Friday, November 18,   \nDavid Duke is a racist Klan leader who doesn’t deserve a voice in American politics. \nWhy the media — and Twitter — still give him a national platform boggles my mind. \nWell, it doesn’t really. \nThe press hates President-elect Donald Trump and loves to use Mr. Duke as foil to keep up the narrative that Mr. Trump is a racist, nativist, xenophobe, who doesn’t deserve to be president. Never mind his campaign has repeatedly denounced Mr. Duke’s support. \nLet’s keep Mr. Duke in the mainstream! \nABC News Politics tweeted: “Former KKK leader David Duke praises Trump cabinet picks Bannon, Flynn, Sessions, as ‘great.’“ \nIt then linked to Mr. Duke’s tweets, which I’m not going to detail. Look them up if you want to. I’m not going give him more free publicity. \nDave Weigel, a political reporter for The Washington Post, retweeted a post that said: “David Duke loves these appointments. Says it all, really.” \nComedy Central’s The Daily Show’s digital manager tweeted: “The David Duke approved President and Cabinet.” \nGreg Sargent, a liberal columnist at The Post, retweeted: “Bannon: Jews suck. Flynn: Muslims suck. Sessions: Blacks suck. David Duke: You guys rule. Press: ‘Critics say Trump’s hiring racists.’“ \nCNBC reporter Ari Levy wrote: “It’s 2016. And David Duke is happy.” \nAnd that’s just a small sampling. \nEnough already. Can we please stop highlighting everything Mr. Duke says, as if it’s somehow signifies something about Mr. Trump? \nProbably not. It’s the mainstream media after all. No wonder why public trust in that institution is at an all-time low.",

      "text": "By Amanda Wicks \nMacklemore did more than share a lengthy letter via Twitter following Donald Trump’s victory, he headed straight for the studio to record a song promoting tolerance and humanity.\nRelated: Macklemore Performs Harrowing ‘Drug Dealer’ on ‘Tonight Show’ \nMacklemore released “Wednesday Morning” today (November 18th). The stand alone single is aptly named for the “day after” the 2016 presidential election, which took place on Tuesday, November 8th. The somber song begins with stark piano chords before Macklemore comes in, heavily auto-tuned, and repeats some of the sentiments he shared on Twitter last week.\n“Imagine trying to keep your head/ While your daughter sleeps in bed/ And when she wakes up will the world be the same?/ Will my girl be afraid? In the home of the brave,” he melodically raps.\nMoving away from his own personal perspective, Macklemore opens up about what needs to happen next. “Humanity is a privilege, we can’t give in/ When they build walls, we’ll build bridges/ This is resistance, we’re resilient/ When they spread hate, we shine brilliant, march by the millions,” he raps, adding that the country will need to tackle prison overcrowding and the potential Muslim registry Trump has proposed in order to survive.\nListen to “Wednesday Morning” below.\n\n",

      "text": "On Tuesday morning, Twitter published a blog post outlining new steps aimed at curbing the spike in abusive tweets and Twitter accounts that have plagued the site in recent years, particularly during an election cycle that produced a surge in white supremacist and so-called alt-right accounts.\nTwitter has been criticized for taking a passive stance on the issue. But the new steps announced Tuesday, combined with the site's move to suspend several accounts of high-profile alt-right users, seemed to mark a step toward greater censorship of the extremist accounts.\nTwitter's plan to limit abusive and hateful content includes an updated policy that allows users to report such content even if it targets other users. It also plans to expand the \"mute\" feature - which allows users to remove an account's tweets from their timeline without blocking the account - to include keywords, phrases and conversations.\nBut, as Twitter acknowledged on its blog, the new steps will not \"suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.\" In fact, about 12 hours after Twitter published the announcement, Los-Angeles based writer and musician Ariana Lenarsky posted a screenshot of an ad on her timeline promoted by the now-suspended account @NEW_ORDER_1488, which represents a neo-Nazi website called The New Order.\nThe ad links to an article on The New Order's website titled \"The United States Was Founded as a White People's Republic,\" followed by the hashtag #WhiteAmerica. The website's homepage, adorned at the top by a Nazi swastika, advocates for a \"rebirth of racial idealism and reverence for the eternal laws of Nature.\" The article promoted in the Twitter ad has been deleted from the website.\nThe promotion violated Twitter's ad policy, which \"prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the mistake and apologized in a tweet Thursday. He said Twitter's \"automated system\" allowed the ad to go through, notifying users the ad has been \"fixed,\" tweeting: We made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm\nTwitter could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe social media company has searched for options to combat its declining stock prices and sluggish user growth, but investors, including Disney, have expressed skepticism that has been linked to Twitter's lenient approach to abuse and harassment.\nLenarsky responded to Dorsey's apology on Thursday, calling for people to continue holding Twitter accountable for filtering its promotions, tweeting: Acknowledgement from @jack & @twitter is great, but it really isn't over. We must continue to hold feet to the fire on this stuff (Nazis).\nPrivacy Policy Twitter, Inc.",

      "text": "Published November 18, 2016 New York Post Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print   \nDesigner Sophie Theallet isn’t a fan of President-elect  Donald Trump  and has announced she’s refusing to dress the next first lady,  Melania Trump .\n“As one who celebrates and strives for diversity, individual freedom, and respect for all lifestyles, I will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next First Lady,” Theallet  wrote in an open letter  she posted to Twitter on Thursday. “The rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by her husband’s presidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by.”\nTheallet, 52, is a French-born designer who grew to prominence by dressing current first lady  Michelle Obama  on a number of occasions.\n“As an immigrant in this country, I have been blessed with the opportunity to pursue my dreams in the USA,” she added. “Dressing the First Lady Michelle Obama for the past 8 years has been a highlight and an honor. She has contributed to having our name recognized and respected worldwide.”\nIn addition to eliminating herself from the potential list of designers who may dress Trump during her tenure, Theallet is calling on all designers to join the boycott. “Integrity is our only true currency,” she wrote.\nTrump’s fashion choices this election season have garnered much attention. She famously wore a $1,100 hot pink  Gucci p---y-bow silk top  to the second presidential debate. On election night, she wore an all-white off-the-shoulder Ralph Lauren jumpsuit.\nThis article originally appeared in Page Six.",

      "text": "By Amanda Wicks \nMacklemore did more than  share a lengthy letter via Twitter  following Donald Trump’s victory, he headed straight for the studio to record a song promoting tolerance and humanity.\nRelated:  Macklemore Performs Harrowing ‘Drug Dealer’ on ‘Tonight Show’ \nMacklemore released “Wednesday Morning” today (November 18th). The stand alone single is aptly named for the “day after” the 2016 presidential election, which took place on Tuesday, November 8th. The somber song begins with stark piano chords before Macklemore comes in, heavily auto-tuned, and repeats some of the sentiments he shared on Twitter last week.\n“Imagine trying to keep your head/ While your daughter sleeps in bed/ And when she wakes up will the world be the same?/ Will my girl be afraid? In the home of the brave,” he melodically raps.\nMoving away from his own personal perspective, Macklemore opens up about what needs to happen next. “Humanity is a privilege, we can’t give in/ When they build walls, we’ll build bridges/ This is resistance, we’re resilient/ When they spread hate, we shine brilliant, march by the millions,” he raps, adding that the country will need to tackle prison overcrowding and the potential Muslim registry Trump has proposed in order to survive.\nListen to “Wednesday Morning” below.\n\n",

Post to Facebook Twitter accused of political bias in right-wing crackdown Conservatives say Twitter has a double standard checking bad behavior.  //usat.ly/2fDQKB1   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Twitter accused of political bias in right-wing crackdown Jessica Guynn , USA TODAY 3:02   Conservatives say Twitter has a double standard when it comes to enforcing behavior that crosses the line on the service. (Photo: Leon Neal, AFP/Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Ariana Rowlands, a 20-year-old college student from Southern California, is half Mexican and half Welsh, a child of immigrants raised on telenovelas and burritos. She's also a fervent conservative who regularly airs her political views on Twitter. \n\"So proud of my Hispanic Heritage and so proud to support @realDonaldTrump for President!!\" she tweeted in September under a hashtag celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. Soon after, she began receiving personal attacks and death threats, she says. \nRowlands reported the abuse but she says Twitter did nothing. And, she says, it wasn't the first time Twitter ignored concerns for her safety that she and her Twitter followers expressed and even reported to police. \n\"I want to stress that it's not like we're crying victim or anything like that,\" Rowlands said in an interview. \"It's just that we're pointing out the double standard.\" \nRampant abuse on Twitter is in the spotlight coming off a bitterly divisive election season that turned the social media service into a political battleground. When it comes to policing behavior from warring sides that crosses the line, conservatives say Twitter is guilty of left-wing favoritism. The rash of recent suspensions of high-profile alt-right accounts is more evidence of that favoritism, they say. \n\"The commonality of these groups that are being targeted is their politics, and you don't see it on the other side as much,\" D.C. McAllister, a columnist for conservative news service PJ Media and The Federalist , said in an interview. \n\"There are Twitter accounts on the left that are suspended, but it's not en masse like it is here.\" #LiberalPrivilege is playing victim but disowning me from the Hispanic community & sending death threats because Im Hispanic & support Trump pic.twitter.com/pSv1oM7ydC — Ariana Rowlands♛ (@IamQueenAri) October 13, 2016 \nWhether Twitter has taken a more aggressive stance with some users over its harassment policies is hard to prove: Twitter gives few details, if any, when it suspends accounts, and some observers say the fault lies more in its failure to rein in abuse regardless of the political tilt. \nBut the perception that it has a double standard runs strong. Twitter's suspension of alt-right leader Richard Spencer contributed to the suspicion that Twitter is arbitrarily stifling conservative speech. Spencer, who coined the term alt right in 2010, says he was tossed from Twitter for his political views — he wants to segregate the United States by racial groups — not for harassing Twitter users. He was suspended alongside the accounts of other white nationalists . Twitter CEO apologizes for white supremacist ad \nConservatives say their ouster fits a pattern of liberal bias. \nIn July when Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones was subjected to racist and sexist taunts led by Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey intervened and yanked Yiannopoulos from the service. \nYet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper Talib Kweli and his followers when they attacked black Breitbart reporter Jerome Hudson with racial slurs. When Breitbart contributor Kassy Dillon complained about a Twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, Twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot Dillon in the head. \nTwitter refused to comment directly on the allegation that it ignores abuse hurled at conservatives. \"The Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies,\" the company said in an emailed statement. \nLong before the contentious election, Twitter was under growing pressure to cut off the gushing fire hose of hate and harassment that targeted people. \nUsers don't have to reveal their real names on Twitter and that anonymity emboldens them to attack women, people of color, Muslims, gays and other groups, even threaten rape and death. The alt right, a loose-knit group that embraces white nationalism among other things, gained prominence during the presidential campaign for using social media to spread its ideology through viral memes and anonymous attacks on users from pro-Donald Trump accounts . 'Massive rise' in hate speech on Twitter during presidential election \nThe Anti-Defamation League documented a dramatic rise in anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists who covered the Republican presidential candidate. After the election, the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published a list of more than 50 Twitter users who had expressed fear about the outcome of the election, urging its readers to \"punish\" them with a barrage of tweets that would drive them to suicide. \n\"While we have taken steps over the years to try to combat abuse and harassment, we haven't moved as quickly as we would have liked or we haven't always done as much as we would have liked because we have tried to make sure we are not making decisions that have unintended, negative consequences and ramifications,\" Del Harvey, Twitter's head of safety, recently told USA TODAY. \nAs a private platform, Twitter is not required to treat all users equally. Harvey says Twitter is drawing a hard line between free speech and \"behavior that is intended to silence others.\" \nBut conservatives say they see public shows of support for liberals and their causes, such as gay rights and racial justice, yet Twitter turns a deaf ear when left-wing activists target them. \n\"When liberals complain, Jack Dorsey is on their side. He sees their point of view. He cares about their feelings,\" said Rowlands, who is president of the UC Irvine College Republicans, a group that had a run-in with campus administrators when it hosted an event with Yiannopoulos and then invited him back for another. \n\"But because I am a conservative, it seems like Twitter doesn't actually care,\" she said. \"They selectively choose when they want to follow their own rules.\" Twitter says it's cracking down on hate speech \nTwitter isn't alone in facing allegations of political bias from the right. Earlier this year, Facebook was accused of intentionally suppressing conservative news from appearing on Trending Topics, its listing of the most popular news stories on Facebook. Facebook denied the charge. \nJames Grimmelmann, a Cornell law professor who studies social networks, says he does not believe Twitter's lapses are politically motivated. Complaints are just as common on the left as they are on the right, he said. \n\"Twitter is terrible at listening to anybody about harassment,\" he said. \"The rare exceptions are those who organize media campaigns and get enough attention to catch Jack's ear. That is a very small number of people compared with the amount of harassment that gets reported to Twitter.\" \nIn the tense aftermath of the election, Twitter may be even less effective at cracking down on abusive behavior anywhere on the political spectrum, said Syracuse University communications professor Jennifer Grygiel, who studies social media. \n\"Everyone is blowing up their phones,\" Grygiel said. \"The Twitter moderation queue must be off the hook.\" Twitter suspends alt-right accounts \nMcAllister sees it differently. She believes Twitter moderators are demonstrating their political bias when deciding which complaints to take seriously. She also says conservatives are less likely than what she labels \"social justice warriors\" on the left to complain about abuse. If Twitter was simply \"incompetent,\" she said, suspensions and other penalties would be \"a lot more random.\" \n\"They are a private company and they can do what they want,\" she said. But, \"people have their biases and it comes through in their work.\" \n\"We are always telling people to check their privilege. They need to check their biases,\" McAllister said. \"What we are asking from Twitter is fairness.\" 21 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "By Gregg Jarrett \nPublished November 18, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Jan. 28, 1986: President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office after a televised address to the nation about the space shuttle Challenger explosion.  (AP) \n“You’re fired!” \nWhen you think about it, Ronald Reagan was Trump-ish  before  Donald Trump.  Reagan sent a stern message to air traffic controllers at the outset of his presidency in 1981:  if you break the law, I will fire you. \nThey did… and he did.\nReagan’s decision to terminate 11,345 controllers who were engaged in an illegal strike was a stunning act of presidential authority and managerial leadership.  It set the tone for a presidency that would refuse to tolerate lawlessness.  No excuses.  No political whining.\nWhen he takes office in January 2017, President Trump may face a similar defining moment.  Will he allow big city mayors to defy federal law by protecting illegal immigrants in their so-called “sanctuary cities”?\nTrump can’t fire them.  But he can take away their federal money.  In some cases, he could prosecute them or other city officials should they continue to flaunt and obstruct the law. \nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel all but dared Mr. Trump to do so when he declared, “Chicago will always be a sanctuary city.”  So did Mayors in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Seattle.   \nPresident-elect Trump has vowed to deport millions of illegal immigrants.  If cities and counties across America refuse to abide by the law, if they refuse to comply with requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the new president may decide it is high time to do what President Reagan did.  That is, take aggressive legal action against them.\nWhat Is A “Sanctuary City”? \nMore than 300 cities and counties have sanctuary policies.  For some, it is simply a political statement.  They have taken no real action to give sanctuary to people who are there illegally. \nBut other cities like San Francisco actively protect illegal immigrants.  They refuse to turn over people who committed low-level crimes to federal agents for deportation.  And when ICE asks for a “hold” on a prisoner, the city ignores it.  Often they walk free.\nThat is what led to the tragic shooting death of Kate Steinle in July of last year.   Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez of Mexico was in the U.S. illegally.  He had 7 felony convictions and was deported 5 times.  He kept slipping back through our border, seeking refuge in the safe haven of San Francisco.\nSanchez was in the custody of the San Francisco Sheriff on drug charges when ICE issued a detainer for him requesting that he be held until the feds could pick him up.  Instead of handing him over, the Sheriff followed the city’s sanctuary policy by ignoring immigration authorities.  He opened the jail doors setting the prisoner free.  Sanchez then shot Steinle to death as she was walking with her father on a San Francisco pier. \nSteinle’s death ignited opposition to sanctuary cities.  During the campaign, Mr. Trump cited her case specifically as he vowed to end the practice of giving sanctuary to criminals who are here illegally.\nGiving Sanctuary Is Against The Law \nPresident Obama has refused to take action against cities like San Francisco that shield illegal immigrants even after arrests or criminal convictions.  He has deliberately ignored existing federal law.  The Illegal Immigration Reform Act of 1996 requires states and municipalities to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration requests:\n      “A state or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict… sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”  (8 U.S. Code, section 1373) \nThat same law allows President Obama to withhold federal financial support from those cities that continue to thwart the law.  Yet, he has taken no action.  If he had, perhaps Kate Steinle would be alive today.        \nEven Mr. Obama’s own Justice Department seems aghast at the President’s refusal to enforce the law.  The DOJ’s Inspector General issued a report concluding that the policies and practices of sanctuary jurisdictions violate federal law and they are, therefore, ineligible for federal funds.  The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives primacy to federal law over contrary state or local laws. Does any of that matter to President Obama?  Clearly not.     \nPresident-elect Trump has promised to take a different course, vowing to withhold federal dollars from cities that protect people who are here illegally.  What would that mean?  For a large metropolitan area such as San Francisco, it could lose a billion dollars in federal money which supports transportation (buses and trains), welfare payments, food stamps, roads and bridges, housing, law enforcement, Medicaid, and public safety projects. \nPoliticians love to take public stands on their idealistic principles, however misguided they may be.  Until, of course, you hit them in the wallet.  When faced with budgetary catastrophes like the loss of $ 1 billion dollars, they often exhibit a sudden change of heart.  Funny how that works.  \nProsecute City Officials \nIf the carrot and stick approach fails to force city officials to abide by the law, perhaps President Trump should begin charging people with crimes.  He can do so under another federal statute which makes it a felony to shield someone who is here illegally:\n      “Any person who, knowing that an alien has come to the U.S. in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection such alien in any place, including any building… shall be imprisoned not more than 5 years.”  (8 U.S. Code, section 1324)    \nFive years behind bars might give city officials pause to rethink their sanctuary philosophy.  But there’s an added punishment written in the law: if someone dies because a city official decided not to comply with federal law, as in the Steinle case, the maximum penalty is life behind bars.  I’m pretty sure that’ll get the attention of some sheriffs, police chiefs and mayors. \nWhether President Trump and his Department of Justice will decide to criminally prosecute city officials who thumb their noses at federal law is unknown.  How many innocent victims like Kate Steinle have to die before people realize that most laws exist for a reason –to protect citizens.    \nI have a feeling that Ronald Reagan might have done it.  Maybe President Trump will channel his inner-Reagan and make the right decision. \nIf he doesn’t, how can he call himself the “law and order\" president?\n\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.",

(AP Photo/Thein Zaw) \nA Burmese man pleaded guilty Friday to killing three children in front of their families over two days in a horrific display of ancient superstition.\nGIRL, 4, DECAPITATED IN INDIAN RITUAL SACRIFICE  \n\"I did it because I lost control of my mind at that time as the dark spirit took over me,” Tun Naing told the court in Twante, a village south of the major city of Yangon.\nAfter telling the parents that their children were possessed, Naing punched and kicked a 3-year-old boy and two girls, ages 8 months and 2 years, to death during an exorcism ritual Oct. 18, police said, and then hid the bodies.\nWOMAN FORCED TO UNDERGO EXORCISM TO 'CURE' HER DEPRESSION \nAn uncle of the boy said the villagers were given “blessed” water and were not in a right state of mind as they stood in a circle with Naing reciting incantations.\n“Because of what he did, everyone was out of their mind,” the uncle told  AFP .\nGERMANY: 5 SKOREANS ON TRIAL OVER WOMAN'S EXORCISM DEATH \nTwo days later, Naing severely wounded a 4-year-old girl in a nearby village in another ritual, prompting local people to call for his arrest, The Associated Press reported.\nSuperstition and belief in spirits is common in Burma alongside the dominant Buddhist religion. Analysts said the former military dictator Ne Win wrecked the economy in the late 1980s when he decided to change the currency to align with his lucky numbers.\nNaing could face the death sentence for the killings. It wasn't immediately clear when his trial would resume.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) \nActor and producer James Woods has decided to quit Twitter, citing censorship concerns.\n“Since @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll” he tweeted Friday.\nThe actor, who joined Twitter in September 2009, has 484,000 followers.\nTWITTER SUSPENDS SEVERAL ACCOUNTS IN ALT-RIGHT 'PURGE' \nWoods’ tweet included the image of a USA Today article on Twitter’s decision to suspend a number of prominent accounts associated with the so-called “alt-right” movement. \nSince @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll pic.twitter.com/bismJDb3wh \n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 18, 2016 Twitter suspended the accounts earlier this week, stating that the company's policies forbid violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct.\nThe alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a term applied to a mostly unaffiliated group of individuals and organizations who reject mainstream conservatism. Critics of the alt-right accuse the movement of promoting “white identity,” opposing multiculturalism and racist views as part of its effort to defend “Western values.”\nTWITTER TRIES TO ADDRESS HATE SPEECH ISSUE WITH\nNEW USER TOOLS \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification.\nThe alt-right movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by some to be a key proponent of the alt-right, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as White House chief strategist.\nTwitter this week also launched new user tools designed to curb hate speech.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text": "On Tuesday morning, Twitter published a blog post outlining new steps aimed at curbing the spike in abusive tweets and Twitter accounts that have plagued the site in recent years, particularly during an election cycle that produced a surge in white supremacist and so-called alt-right accounts.\nTwitter has been criticized for taking a passive stance on the issue. But the new steps announced Tuesday, combined with the site's move to suspend several accounts of high-profile alt-right users, seemed to mark a step toward greater censorship of the extremist accounts.\nTwitter's plan to limit abusive and hateful content includes an updated policy that allows users to report such content even if it targets other users. It also plans to expand the \"mute\" feature - which allows users to remove an account's tweets from their timeline without blocking the account - to include keywords, phrases and conversations.\nBut, as Twitter acknowledged on its blog, the new steps will not \"suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.\" In fact, about 12 hours after Twitter published the announcement, Los-Angeles based writer and musician Ariana Lenarsky posted a screenshot of an ad on her timeline promoted by the now-suspended account @NEW_ORDER_1488, which represents a neo-Nazi website called The New Order.\nThe ad links to an article on The New Order's website titled \"The United States Was Founded as a White People's Republic,\" followed by the hashtag #WhiteAmerica. The website's homepage, adorned at the top by a Nazi swastika, advocates for a \"rebirth of racial idealism and reverence for the eternal laws of Nature.\" The article promoted in the Twitter ad has been deleted from the website.\nThe promotion violated Twitter's ad policy, which \"prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the mistake and apologized in a tweet Thursday. He said Twitter's \"automated system\" allowed the ad to go through, notifying users the ad has been \"fixed,\" tweeting: We made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm\nTwitter could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe social media company has searched for options to combat its declining stock prices and sluggish user growth, but investors, including Disney, have expressed skepticism that has been linked to Twitter's lenient approach to abuse and harassment.\nLenarsky responded to Dorsey's apology on Thursday, calling for people to continue holding Twitter accountable for filtering its promotions, tweeting: Acknowledgement from @jack & @twitter is great, but it really isn't over. We must continue to hold feet to the fire on this stuff (Nazis).\n Twitter, Inc.",

      "text": "Spammers compromised Twitter accounts for @PlayStation and others A number of popular Twitter accounts suddenly wanted to help you add more followers. Share Save \nIf you noticed something odd on Twitter tonight, you weren't alone. Around 1AM ET, accounts like @PlayStation, @Viacom, @XboxSupport, @NTSB, @TheNewYorker, @TheNextWeb, the Red Cross (@ICRC) and @Money started aggressively pushing ways to help you obtain more followers for free. Most of the tweets have been scrubbed, however, a look at Tweetdeck revealed they were all posted via Twitter Counter ( @thecounter ). \nIt's unclear exactly what happened, however, reached by email, Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten said the company is looking into the situation. According to its website, Twitter Counter \"provides statistics of Twitter usage and tracks over 14 million users...and sells featured spots on its website to people who want to gain more followers.\" If it was hacked, the problem only appears to have hit accounts linked to the tool, so your account is probably safe. Still, as always, now is a good time to reset your password, and double check any apps or services linked to your social media accounts -- if they get compromised, you do too.",

Yet they identify themselves as part of the so-called alt-right — and have just been wronged, in a move that ought to bother even those who loathe everything they represent. \nThis week, Twitter suspended their accounts, on the claim that they violated the platform’s terms of service, which aim to ban violent threats, outright harassment and inciting “harm toward others” on the basis of race, gender and other categories. \nEven by the most elastic reading of these terms, Spencer does not appear to qualify. He simply espouses a philosophy that many, including this editorial page, find odious: He hates the concept of “equality” because he believes European culture is inherently superior; and he’s called for a “white homeland”; and he happens to enthusiastically support Donald Trump. \nSame goes for the others on the blacklist: They are ideologues, not victimizers. \nTwitter is a private company. Which is to say, this is not a First Amendment question. \nStill, the platform, and Facebook, have become the closest thing the internet has to public squares, which is why those who run the company must be increasingly careful about expelling those whose sole offense is swimming, even obnoxiously, against the tide.

      "title": "Twitter runs neo-Nazi ad hours after outlining steps to limit abuse, apologizes for mistake",
      "text": "On Tuesday morning, Twitter published a blog post outlining new steps aimed at curbing the spike in abusive tweets and Twitter accounts that have plagued the site in recent years, particularly during an election cycle that produced a surge in white supremacist and so-called alt-right accounts.\nTwitter has been criticized for taking a passive stance on the issue. But the new steps announced Tuesday, combined with the site's move to suspend several accounts of high-profile alt-right users, seemed to mark a step toward greater censorship of the extremist accounts.\nTwitter's plan to limit abusive and hateful content includes an updated policy that allows users to report such content even if it targets other users. It also plans to expand the \"mute\" feature - which allows users to remove an account's tweets from their timeline without blocking the account - to include keywords, phrases and conversations.\nBut, as Twitter acknowledged on its blog, the new steps will not \"suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.\" In fact, about 12 hours after Twitter published the announcement, Los-Angeles based writer and musician Ariana Lenarsky posted a screenshot of an ad on her timeline promoted by the now-suspended account @NEW_ORDER_1488, which represents a neo-Nazi website called The New Order.\nThe ad links to an article on The New Order's website titled \"The United States Was Founded as a White People's Republic,\" followed by the hashtag #WhiteAmerica. The website's homepage, adorned at the top by a Nazi swastika, advocates for a \"rebirth of racial idealism and reverence for the eternal laws of Nature.\" The article promoted in the Twitter ad has been deleted from the website.\nThe promotion violated Twitter's ad policy, which \"prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the mistake and apologized in a tweet Thursday. He said Twitter's \"automated system\" allowed the ad to go through, notifying users the ad has been \"fixed,\" tweeting: We made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm\nTwitter could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe social media company has searched for options to combat its declining stock prices and sluggish user growth, but investors, including Disney, have expressed skepticism that has been linked to Twitter's lenient approach to abuse and harassment.\nLenarsky responded to Dorsey's apology on Thursday, calling for people to continue holding Twitter accountable for filtering its promotions, tweeting: Acknowledgement from @jack & @twitter is great, but it really isn't over. We must continue to hold feet to the fire on this stuff (Nazis).\n Twitter, Inc.",

      "text": "Twitter took another step Tuesday in its long fight against trolls, announcing that it will give users a mute feature to weed out harassing words and phrases from their notifications.\nThe company plans to roll out the feature more broadly over time, Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Adding it to notifications was a priority based on the feedback from Twitter users.\n\"We've heard from users that this [notifications] is an area where people don't feel as though they have as much control on Twitter,\" Harvey said. \"You're not searching for this content, but it's still something that's coming in to your Twitter experience.\"\nWith the new feature, Twitter users will be able to compile their own list of words, phrases and emoji that they don't want to see pop up in their notifications from the network.\nThe feature is similar to one Instagram rolled out earlier this year that let users block comments that contained certain phrases. Twitter's move comes after an election cycle that saw, among other incidents, a prominent anti-Semitic movement on the network - it has been repeatedly criticized for not moving quickly enough to combat harassment on its site.\nHarvey, who has been at Twitter for eight years, said she knows that some users are frustrated with the pace at which it's addressing harassment issues. \"We haven't always moved as quickly as we would like or done as much as we would like,\" she said, adding that the company is trying to make sure that it has tools to shut down harassment on the site without crossing the line into limiting speech. \"We have tried to be thoughtful, to make sure we don't have unintended and negative consequences,\" Harvey said.\nTwitter has struggled for years with striking the right balance between protecting open expression on the network and protecting victims of harassment, often fielding heavy criticism for erring too far on the side of free speech. Harvey acknowledged that there were plenty of prime examples of Twitter's shortcomings when it came to policing harassment on the network during this year's election.\nThe addition of the mute feature wasn't driven by the dialogue around the election itself, Harvey said, but it did underscore for Twitter how much further it still has to go. Harvey said that Twitter has also made some changes to the way that users can report harassment on the site to better reflect its policies.\nLast year, Twitter explicitly banned \"hateful conduct\" - which prohibits the promotion of violence and direct attacks or threats to others on the basis of race, ethnicity and a number of other attributes. The social network has now updated the language it uses in its harassment reporting tool to reflect that policy and inform users that they can report others for that kind of behavior. Twitter has also made it easier for bystanders to report abuse - so person B can report that person C is harassing person A.\nFinally, Harvey said, Twitter is continually training its staff across the globe to recognize more forms of abuse. Twitter staff members review each report of abuse to determine whether it violates the company's policies. It's common to see Twitter users posting incredulous screenshots of notices from Twitter's abuse team rejecting abuse reports, even when they clearly violate Twitter's rules.\nThose oversights are upsetting, she acknowledged, and often happen because a reviewer doesn't have the cultural context to understand why something may be offensive or abusive. Something that's obviously offensive to an American may not be so obvious to a person born in India, and vice versa, she explained.\nSo, in addition to an ongoing training course on how to recognize abusive behavior, Harvey said, Twitter has put together a training program on the historical and cultural context around particular types of harassment - types of anti-Semitism, for example. She said Twitter will also focus more closely on keeping its staff up to date with the evolving language of hate on its network.\n Twitter, Inc.",

      "text": "News   \nEDMONDS — In an era of Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter, when social media seems to have supplanted conversation, it was a day dedicated to the simple, intensive act of listening. \nAbout 800 people filled the Edmonds Center for the Arts Friday at the second annual TEDxSnoIsleLibraries event. With this year’s theme of “Transformations,” 17 speakers shared stories of hurt, hope and — as measured by standing ovations from the audience — inspiration. \nThe day began with Seattle hip hop artist Xola Malik , singing “I Fall, I Rise.” \nRadhika Dalal, a senior at Kamiak High School in Mukilteo, was one of two area high school students to speak. Joining an international Facebook group of 400 writers is just an example of how technology “allows us to know what’s going on around the world instantly,” she said. \nIt allows the millennial generation “to be globally conscious,” Dalal said. \nA survey found that more than half of millennials would take a pay cut to find a job that matches their values, she said. “Success is not just a paycheck but making a difference.” \nSriharshita “Harshu” Musunuri, a junior at Everett’s Henry M. Jackson High school, spoke on the interconnectedness of knowledge, as illuminated in the work of the artist Leonardo da Vinci . It enabled him to build a bridge between the arts and sciences, she said. \nOne example of how that could be applied would be a classroom where students are allowed to study the history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa while learning about the physics that keeps it from falling down, she said. \nJeff Lynass , who teaches at Lake Stevens’ Cavelero Mid High School, told of how students locally and internationally are joining VEX Robotics teams. There are now some 20,000 such teams around the world, he said. \nLake Stevens students often dedicate four hours a week to their projects, Lynass said. They come in before and after school, and only locking the doors to the engineering lab will keep them away. \nOne of the most emotional presentations came from Karla Hawley, a music therapist for the Snohomish County Music Project . She told of her sexual abuse, which began at age 6. \nAt age 7 she said she yelled “No,” and slapped the face of the man who was trying to assault her. “What you are doing is wrong and you know it, ” she remembers telling him. “Don’t touch me again.” \nEven so, the abuse continued for years, until she was 19, she said. One day she sat down at the piano and began playing a song. That allowed her to begin expressing her feelings for all she had been through. \nDesperation and despair began to fade, she said. “My song had saved me. I could now be alive and safely express myself in the music. Suicide was no longer the option. \n“We don’t have to endure life-long suffering,” Hawley said. “May music be with you always.” \nPeople who couldn’t attend Friday’s event could still watch in groups. There were 17 public viewing sites, including 13 libraries in Snohomish and Island counties as well as the Snohomish County PUD auditorium, at Everett and Edmonds community colleges, and the University of Washington Bothell. \nThe event was livestreamed, so people could watch the conference on smartphones, tablets or computers. Some 1,400 people were viewing the event online, in 140 cities and 19 countries, said Julie Titone, a Sno-Isle Libraries spokeswoman. \nSharon Gray made the four-and-a-half hour journey from Twisp to be at Friday’s event. She said one of the messages she heard from speaker Seconde Nimenya was what she could do to combat the nation’s current divisiveness. \nLori Hittle, of Arlington, came to the event both to listen to speakers and as a volunteer for First Washington , an organization that promotes student participation in robotics. \nLynnwood High School’s Royal Robotic team had one of its projects on display in an annex to the arts center called The Idea Lab. \nThe Everett School District now has 30 robotic teams, Hittle said, growing from just one in 2008. \nMarcia Albert, of Arlington, a social worker, said that when she and her peers work with clients on motivation, they sometimes use videotaped TEDx talks in those sessions. With a TEDx session so close, they wanted to attend. \nCole Cordell, a student at Shoreline Community College, said he came because he’s always been interested in TED talks. “It’s always been a plus for me,” he said. “I really enjoy it.” \nSharon Salyer: 425-339-3486; salyer@heraldnet.com.",
