      "text": "Amazon Wants To Open 2,000 Grocery Stores Apparently  16 PST \nIt has often been rumored that Amazon wants to start a chain of grocery stores and yesterday the company confirmed its vision for the grocery store of the future. The first store has already been set up in the company’s hometown of Seattle but it’s only open to Amazon employees right now. The store features no checkout lines or cash counters, it relies on some sophisticated technology to enable customers to quite literally grab and go. According to a report, Amazon wants to open a chain of more than 2,000 grocery stores. \nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon’s retail plans include setting up 2,000 retail stores across the United States. The stores will be a mix of the Amazon Go cashless stores it announced yesterday as well as convenience stores in different formats. \nThe cashless stores will let customers just walk out with the products they want to buy. It tracks the items that they take off the shelves and sophisticated technology which includes artificial intelligence and computer vision works in the background to automatically charge their purchase to their Amazon account once they step out of the store. \nAdditional retail plans are said to include a massive discount chain and prototypes of drive-thrus that might actually be unveiled in the near future. The discount chains might see Amazon opening stores spanning up to 40,000 feet that will stock a wide variety of products. \nAmazon hasn’t confirmed its future retail plans as yet but its announcement of Amazon Go shows that it’s serious about this space and is going to do a lot more to challenge the existing players in this market. \nFiled in General .

      "text": "\nNEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines.\nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app.\nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren’t charged.\nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits.\nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.\nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts.\nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours.\n“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge said.\nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago.",

The drought conditions we've seen as the place of the country particular California which of course would hurt. The tree crop out there and then you take into account the Pacific northwest where we get so many of our trees from in this country anyway there's over the past several years we've seen two million fewer. Trees planted over the past couple years so and a lot of people are getting out of the tree farming business anyway so you put all that into account we just have fewer trees out there and that could.

Learn more Never miss a story from Film School Rejects Get updates Get updates Blocked Unblock Follow Following I like movies, tv shows, and cats pretty much more than anything else in the world. Follow me on Twitter @ericabahrenburg 7 mins ago Amazon Quells a Revolution by Cancelling Good Girls Revolt Another good show is gone too soon. Same, ladies. Same L ooks like Amazon was not ready for the revolution Good Girls Revolt was looking to lead. Earlier this week, Deadline reported that the streaming service Amazon will not be moving forward with a second season of Good Girls Revolt . The series was inspired by Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and followed a group of young female researchers in 1969 battling newsroom sexism while working at the fictional News of the Week. The announcement was met with outcries and admissions of defeat from the cast and crew who compared the cancellation to Hillary Clinton’s recent loss in the presidential election. Series creator, Dana Calvo, tweeted “So grateful we got to tell the story. We won the popular vote. Thank you.” One of the stars, Genevieve Angelson followed suit with another election reference saying that “Your roars of support elevated me from the darkest election in history and I’ll never stop fighting back for us.” The show aired for one season that garnered generally positive reviews and had pretty good viewership numbers. So what gives? Why the cancellation, Amazon? It seems like a rather hasty decision given that the first season only premiered on October 28th. However, even in that short amount of time, data showed that about 80% of the people who watched the pilot continued to the end of the last episode. Streaming networks draw in much of their audiences because of the leniency with which their shows can be watched. Viewers can tune in at their leisure and build up a loyal following, but Amazon cancelling Good Girls Revolt so quickly says the exact opposite: viewers need to watch ASAP. The show also attracted a highly specific audience, which is important for a streaming network with only so much original content. According to Deadline, Good Girls Revolt had the second highest amount of female viewers for an Amazon original at around 67% (second to Man in the High Castle which boasts about an 80% for the demographic). Calvo said in an interview with BuzzFeed news that “based on data provided to us from Sony, Symphony Advanced Media reported our show was a hit… We had twice Transparent ’s audience.” But even with all the positives going its way, Amazon Studios head Roy Price was reportedly not a fan of the show and did not see it becoming the major awards player he had hoped it would be. Perhaps another reason Amazon nixed it is so that they can focus more on attracting bigger names behind and in front of the camera. Woody Allen’s first television show premiered on the streaming service earlier this year, but don’t expect a second season from him though because he is never doing television again . A few weeks ago, Amazon paid about $70 million for an eight episode series from Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner and another $160 million for two eight episode seasons for a David O. Russell drama starring Julianne Moore and Robert de Niro. Fans of Good Girls Revolt should not lose all hope though. Sources close to Sony TV, whose TriStar Television division produced the series, is working on getting the rights of the show back from Amazon so that they can shop it around to other networks. If it worked for The Mindy Project , Nashville , Arrested Development , and Gilmore Girls , who says it will not work for the ass kicking, patriarchy smashing women of Good Girls Revolt ?",

      "text": "  Amazon Offering 14-Day Sling TV Trial, Double that of Sling Itself Want to try Sling TV? Try it for two weeks instead of one by Abdel Ibrahim December 6, 2016 \nInterested in cutting the cord? Amazon is offering a 14-Day Sling TV trial for free, double the normal 7 day trial that Sling itself offers. \nSling TV is one of the three major cord-cutting services that has been made available to Apple TV owners in the past few months. The service allows users to watch popular channels such as ESPN, AMC, TNT, CNN and TBS on their phones, tablets, and, of course, their televisions via set-top boxes without having to pay installation fees or commit to a yearly contract. \nIt’s also considered, by many, to be the best tv streaming deal out there with plans starting at just $20 bucks a month, $15 lower than both Sony’s Playstation Vue and AT&T’s DirecTV Now starter plans. Of course, Sling offers fewer channels at that price, but for many people, those channels are enough. \nEither way, if you’re someone who’s on the fence about cutting the cord and you simply want to give Sling TV a shot, getting 14 days instead of 7 days to play around with the service is obviously a no-brainer.",

      "text": " 17 AM EST StormProof Launches “Unbreakable” Travel Umbrella on Amazon \nSummary: Compact and windproof, StormProof’s new travel umbrella is claimed to be indestructible, even in strong wind. This windproof umbrella is now for sale on Amazon at https://goo.gl/YhI3Gr . But for the holidays is now offer a coupon so that you can get the umbrella at 54% off ! Enter promo code : AJ82C38A at checkout. \nStormProof Umbrellas has recently announced the launch of their new travel umbrella on Amazon.com . The latest launch by the company is a windproof portable umbrella that is deemed to be unbreakable even in the strongest wind. The umbrella has a one-hand operation, thanks to its automatic open and close function, and is made from the highly durable 190T Pongee fabric. Even though this portable umbrella by StormProof is small enough to fit in a purse, tote, pocket or glove compartment of a car when telescoped, it opens to an expansive diameter of 38 inches, which is wide enough to keep a person and whatever he or she is carrying completely dry. \n“If you've ever had to throw an umbrella in the trash because it blew inside out on a windy day and broke, then we know you'll appreciate the ‘Unbreakable’ construction of our StormProof umbrella, because it means that you will stay dry and safe,” states Chris Johnston, founder of StormProof Umbrellas. “Our umbrella opens and closes automatically at the touch of a button, because we know you don't want to be struggling when it suddenly pours down and you're busy carrying your shopping.” \nThe Indestructible Umbrella \nAccording to quality tests done by TUV Rheinland, a global certification provider, the StormProof “unbreakable” umbrella can withstand winds up to 90mph. Due to the umbrella’s unique construction, it is highly robust and guarantees complete protection to its owner. Made with black-coated metal shaft and frame, the umbrella has 8 fiberglass ribs that provide it with exceptional flexibility to return to its original position without breaking. \nStormProof umbrella’s canopy opens to a generous 38-inch diameter of the heavy-duty and endurable cover of 190T Pongee fabric, which is a soft-woven cloth made especially for high performance umbrellas and other waterproof equipment. Despite its expansive covering, the umbrella weighs only 13 ounces and measures 11.4 x 2.4 x 1.1 inches when folded, making it perfect for being carried around even in small purses and bags. The umbrella’s automatic open and close at the touch of a button provides a one-hand function that is not only convenient but also eliminates the need for fumbling with the umbrella in the case of a sudden downpour. \nAbout the Company \nStormProof Umbrellas was established in 2016 in New Orleans, USA. The concept and design of an unbreakable umbrella that would serve hundreds of thousands of people all around the globe was conceived by Christopher Johnston, who is the founder of the company. The team at StormProof Umbrellas believes in the manufacturing of high quality gear and the extension of exceptional customer service to all its clients. \nStormProof’s “unbreakable” umbrella can be found on Amazon at https://goo.gl/YhI3Gr for a limited period introductory price of $19.99.

      "title": "Amazon Go Convenience Store Eliminates Lines And Checkout: Grab What You Need And Just Go [Video]",
      "text": "Amazon just introduced a futuristic, high-tech convenience store called Amazon Go, which eliminates lines, registers and checkout altogether. Intrigued? Here's how it works. ( Amazon | YouTube ) Advertisement \nAmazon just unveiled the convenience store of the future, with no lines and no checkout: meet Amazon Go. \nThe 1,800-square-foot supermarket gives a glimpse into how Amazon plans to revolutionize physical retail with a high-tech convenience store and an app. How It Works \nAmazon Go eliminates checkout lines, but that doesn't mean that shoppers won't have to pay for the items they get. Instead, Amazon Go is designed with a power combo of sensors, computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence to make things easier for customers, allowing shoppers to just grab the products they need and walk out. According to Amazon, its new convenience store uses the same types of technology as self-driving cars. \nCustomers will use the Amazon Go app to enter the futuristic store, and the app will automatically add the items they get into a digital shopping cart. Upon walking out of the convenience store, Amazon Go will charge their account and send a receipt for their purchases within the app. This means no more waiting in line at the register, which should significantly reduce the time it takes to do grocery shopping. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart,\" Amazon explains . \"When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" What Will Amazon Go Sell? \nThe futuristic grocery store will sell regular grocery essentials such as milk, bread, as well as ready-made food, snacks, sweets, artisan cheeses and more. This should neatly complement Amazon 's online shopping services such as Prime Pantry , Amazon Groceries & Gourmet Food , Amazon Fresh and more. \nAt 1,800 square feet, Amazon Go will clearly not be as large as other supermarkets out there, but it banks on convenience rather than a large assortment of all kinds of items — at least for now. Amazon says its convenience store is \"conveniently compact\" so that customers can walk in and out and get what they need without wasting too much time grocery shopping. When And Where \nFor now, Amazon Go is still experimental, and it's currently running a closed beta. The store is located in Seattle at 2131 7th Avenue, on the corner of Blanchard Street and 7th Avenue, and is open only to Amazon employees for now. Amazon Go is set to open to the public early next year. Interested customers can sign up to receive more information when Amazon Go is ready to open its doors to everyone. \nIf all goes right, Amazon plans to build as many as 2,000 such futuristic stores across the United States in the next decade. \nShould the beta turn out to be successful, Amazon Go could be a true game-changer for how we do our shopping in physical stores. Check out the video below to get a better idea of how it would work. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

      "text": "Also today: EU may crack down on social media providers over hate speech issue, and technology is changing how we communicate - but is that a good thing? More Subscribe on YouTube\nSkip the checkout line, forever\nAmazon is giving us what may be a peek at the future of retail. And no, we don’t mean barking at your Amazon Echo to re-order those carmel-apple oreos that you just ran out of. We mean the future of physically going shopping , where you go to a store to an actual store and actually buy things in real life.\nWell that’s the idea behind the Go retail concept by Amazon, which looks to be a regular grocery store with a very high tech twist . There are no cashiers, and no checkout lines. When you go into the Go store, you activate the Amazon Go shopping app, pick out your stuff, and then head for the exit. Amazon says they are using a combination of sensors, A.I. deep learning and even some tech lifted from autonomous cars to keep track of what you buy while in the store.\nDone shopping? Amazon will total up your purchases, charge your account and email your receipt for easy tracking, all before you even get to your self-driving car. Amazon says the first Go store opens in Seattle next year, and if things go well, expect at least 2,000 more Go stores to pop up in the very near future.\nMakes Whack-A-Mole look easy\nFollowing an enormously contentious election cycle in the United States and a refugee crisis in Europe, the influence of social media on popular opinion is becoming an ever-more powerful influence, and the EU is saying social media providers are failing to curb hate speech on their platforms. In response, some EU officials say they are eying legislation that would force companies to monitor and remove posts that violate hate speech protocols.\nFacebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft all signed onto a voluntary “Code of conduct” to stamp out hate speech earlier this year, but the EU is saying that, basically, it’s not working . The biggest complaint is the amount of time it takes to review complaints and remove posts, with YouTube garnering praise for their speed, but… that’s about it.\nEU ministers will meet this Thursday to review progress – or the lack thereof – and ponder the next steps to stopping online hate-mongering. One spokesman said that if the major players can’t show a lot more progress in the coming months, new rules could be introduced that will force quicker action.\nMaybe the Egyptians had it right all along\nWhen you see emojis and know exactly what they say, then congratulations, you’re fluent in a new kind of language. You may think of emojis as just something fun to tack onto your text messages, but in reality, they’re a language all their own, and they’re part of the way we are changing the way we read, write and communicate.\nTechnology has enabled us to communicate with just about anyone, anywhere in seconds, and emojis, emoticons, phrase bits, chat, hashtags, texting, leet, netspeak, acronyms, and, heck, even the caps lock key are all changing – and speeding up – how we talk to each other.\nDigital Trends editor Jeff Van Camp has put together a comprehensive look at the rapidly shifting topic of language and communication , in a piece that’s part of our DT-10 series on the recent past – and quickly approaching future of communication and technology. Many people say the art of correspondence is gone, but is it really? Or has it just changed with the times, as communication systems have always done?\nGet the rest of the today’s tech news at Digital Trends,com and check out our Facebook page and YouTube channel for the rest of our daily communications.\nTech is upending the ways we write, speak, and even think Twitter tries to address hate speech issue with new user tools German lawsuit holds Zuckerberg responsible for hate speech on Facebook",

      "text": "Heat street ^ | Dec 6, 16 | Mathew Hughes \nPosted on 12/06/2016 8:56:13 AM PST by jcon40 \nTheres a term used to describe people who walk into a store, help themselves to a sandwich or a cupcake, and then promptly walk out: Shoplifters. But maybe not for much longer. Amazon just lifted the lid on its new Amazon Go technology, which looks to fundamentally transform the retail world. \nHeres how it works. You enter a store using Amazons propriety technology and flash your personal QR code to a reader. Then, you just pick up what you want and walk out. No dealing with infuriating self-checkout machines or cashiers. The money is automatically taken from a nominated credit or debit card. Its the ultimate in grab-and-go retail convenience. \nAmazon Go is powered by a combination of computer vision, sensors and machine learning, packaged up into something the company calls Just Walk Out technology. (Excerpt) Read more at heatst.com ...",

      "text": "BI Intelligence \n\nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAt its AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon announced a pair of joint initiatives with Intel centered on offering developers the tools to build Alexa-powered devices, according to  Engadget .\nAs Alexa's capabilities continue to expand, the AI-powered voice assistant is becoming a major monetization asset for Amazon, and this latest news means that Alexa could expand beyond its traditional commercial profile. Here's more on the initiatives:\nIntel developed a reference design for a smart speaker product that uses Alexa voice controls. This is meant to incentivize companies to manufacture their own devices using Alexa's AI voice capabilities and Intel's hardware platform. The design will be made available to other companies starting early in 2017. Intel expanded Alexa voice controls to its Smart Home Hub. This essentially means that the company is helping developers build smart home devices that can be controlled through voice commands.  For Intel, this continues the company's expansion into the smart home and the IoT more broadly, as it seeks to mitigate the slowing of its traditional PC business. The chipmaker earlier this year  formed  a partnership with Microsoft and Samsung to help those companies' smart home devices work together as seamlessly as possible. Additionally, the microprocessor company unveiled  a series of new chips for the IoT that could have uses within the smart home. It also continues to see  steady growth  in its overall IoT business, which its smart home business is a part of.\nBut for Amazon, this means that it could be expanding Alexa's opportunities to earn revenue for the company. Thus far, Prime  voice ordering  has been the only major source of revenue from the Alexa voice assistant. But Amazon could be seeking to expand the footprint of the assistant in order to enhance its ability to generate revenue.\nIn the future, Amazon could seek to further monetize Alexa by licensing its capabilities to hardware manufacturers and designers, following the model of this agreement with Intel. Overall, it's Alexa's position as a facilitator of further transactions within the Amazon ecosystem that primarily makes the voice assistant a strong platform for monetization.\nIt remains to be seen if this project will help the U.S. smart home market truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption.\nThere are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home.\nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers.\nHere are some key takeaways from the report: \nSmart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the \"chasm\" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. \"Closed ecosystems\" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point.

      "text": "The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAt its AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon announced a pair of joint initiatives with Intel centered on offering developers the tools to build Alexa-powered devices, according to Engadget . \nAs Alexa's capabilities continue to expand, the AI-powered voice assistant is becoming a major monetization asset for Amazon, and this latest news means that Alexa could expand beyond its traditional commercial profile. Here's more on the initiatives: Intel developed a reference design for a smart speaker product that uses Alexa voice controls. This is meant to incentivize companies to manufacture their own devices using Alexa's AI voice capabilities and Intel's hardware platform. The design will be made available to other companies starting early in 2017. Intel expanded Alexa voice controls to its Smart Home Hub. This essentially means that the company is helping developers build smart home devices that can be controlled through voice commands. \nFor Intel, this continues the company's expansion into the smart home and the IoT more broadly, as it seeks to mitigate the slowing of its traditional PC business. The chipmaker earlier this year formed a partnership with Microsoft and Samsung to help those companies' smart home devices work together as seamlessly as possible. Additionally, the microprocessor company unveiled a series of new chips for the IoT that could have uses within the smart home. It also continues to see steady growth in its overall IoT business, which its smart home business is a part of. \nBut for Amazon, this means that it could be expanding Alexa's opportunities to earn revenue for the company. Thus far, Prime voice ordering has been the only major source of revenue from the Alexa voice assistant. But Amazon could be seeking to expand the footprint of the assistant in order to enhance its ability to generate revenue. \nIn the future, Amazon could seek to further monetize Alexa by licensing its capabilities to hardware manufacturers and designers, following the model of this agreement with Intel. Overall, it's Alexa's position as a facilitator of further transactions within the Amazon ecosystem that primarily makes the voice assistant a strong platform for monetization. \nIt remains to be seen if this project will help the U.S. smart home market truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. \nThere are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the \"chasm\" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. \"Closed ecosystems\" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point. \nIn full, the report: Analyzes the demand of US consumers, based off of survey results Forecasts out smart home device growth until 2020 Determines the current leaders in the market Explains how the connected home ecosystem works Examines how Apple and Google will play a major role in the development of the smart home Some of the companies mentioned in this report include Apple, Google, Nest, August, ADT, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Lowe's, and Honeywell. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "  \nAmazon.com unveiled technology that will let shoppers grab groceries without having to scan and pay for them — in one stroke eliminating the checkout line. \nThe company is testing the new system at what it’s calling an Amazon Go store in Seattle, which will open to the public early next year. Customers will be able to scan their phones at the entrance using a new Amazon Go mobile app. Then the technology will track what items they pick up or even return to the shelves and add them to a virtual shopping cart in real time, according a video Amazon posted on YouTube . Once the customers exit the store, they’ll be charged on their Amazon account automatically. \nThe concept store and automated checkout mark Amazon’s latest attempt to upend the grocery business. The company operates AmazonFresh, a delivery service active in 16 U.S. markets including Dallas-Fort Worth, where it launched in October . \nAmazon has since started opening pickup centers where shoppers can fetch their web purchases. Perhaps recognizing that many people remain reluctant to purchase fresh food online, sight unseen, the company is now testing what looks a lot like a convenience store. \n“Most people still have two requirements,” said Forrester analyst Brendan Witcher. “One is, ‘I want something today, I don’t want to wait.’ Number two is ‘I want to touch and feel the product before I commit to it.”’ \nSo if the Amazon Go concept works, will the company build small grocery stores in cities all over the country? Amazon isn’t saying. But some analysts envision a combination pickup center, fulfillment warehouse and small grocery store. After all, Amazon is already building urban warehouses, including a 50,000-square-foot facility in midtown Manhattan, that handle same-day deliveries to local customers. \nThe Amazon Go store is part of a broader retail strategy. Another format the company is considering is a larger shop that also has a curbside pick-up component, according to The Wall Street Journal . If this concept pans out, Amazon could potentially open 2,000 locations, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That’s similar to an option being developed for customers to pick up items at Prime Now fulfillment centers. \nAs Amazon expands into brick-and-mortar locations, traditional retailers are expanding their e-commerce options. Wal-Mart, Kroger and CVS are among the retailers that have launched services in North Texas where shopper can order items online and pick them up curbside at stores without leaving their cars. And Tom Thumb and Albertsons launched a home delivery service. \nThis article includes material from Star-Telegram archives. Related content",

      "text": "Amazon's  ( AMZN )  latest experiment with changing shopping as we know it is Amazon Go, a supermarket that will allow customers to checkout without waiting in lines, and Jim Cramer calls the idea \"huge.\" He thinks with so many retailers selling the same things, Amazon will be able to grab more market share by offering a service that focuses on convenience and saving time. Several media outlets have criticized Amazon Go because it might eliminate millions of jobs. Amazon Go is being tested in Seattle.",

      "text": "A just-delivered Amazon box is seen on a counter in Golden, Colorado Thomson Reuters\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Makers of the Snuggie blanket and other products sold mainly on TV have sued Amazon.com Inc , accusing the Internet retailer of trademark infringement for letting an \"astronomical\" number of counterfeit products to be sold through its website.\nThe lawsuit was filed on Monday night by Allstar Marketing Group LLC, Ideavillage Products Corp and Ontel Products Corp, which respectively sell such products as the Snuggie, Copper Fit compression sleeves and Magic Tracks toy racetracks through so-called \"As Seen on TV\" advertising.\nIt was filed three weeks after Seattle-based Amazon filed two of its own lawsuits in a Washington state court, targeting vendors it said were selling counterfeit goods on its website.\nAmazon did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.\nAllstar, Ideavillage and Ontel said they have lost profits because Amazon has let its product display pages be \"hijacked\" by counterfeiters, which offer impossibly low prices and confuse consumers into thinking their products are the real thing.\nThe plaintiffs said counterfeiters from China, Japan, Thailand and other countries are taking a \"free ride\" on their reputation and goodwill, while many consumers leave bad reviews about fake products on the hijacked pages.\n\"Amazon has taken no action to prevent the sale of such counterfeit products despite having the knowledge, opportunity and means to do so,\" the plaintiffs said.\nThe lawsuit also accuses Amazon of copyright infringement, and violating New York state false advertising and unfair competition laws.\nIt seeks to recoup unspecified sums in the millions of dollars, including lost profits and punitive damages. The plaintiff's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.\nAllstar is based in Hawthorne, New York; Ideavillage in Wayne, New Jersey and Ontel in Fairfield, New Jersey.\nAmazon's anti-counterfeiting policy says that \"customers trust that they can always buy with confidence on Amazon.com,\" and that counterfeiters can have their selling privileges revoked and inventory destroyed without reimbursement.\nIn July, the German shoemaker Birkenstock Orthopadie GmbH decided to stop selling on Amazon because of counterfeiters.\nThe case is Allstar Marketing Group LLC et al v Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-09376.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "December 6, 2016 AT 12:38 PM \n  12:38 pm The Amazon logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, on Sept. 19, 2013. (AP Photo/Michel Spingler) \nNEW YORK—Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines. \nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app. \nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren’t charged. \nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits. \nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours. \n“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge said. \nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago. Editor’s Picks",

      "text": "Amazon Is Creating Convenience Stores Where There's No Checking Out [Video] 5 hours ago share \nAmazon just created a convenience store that works differently than any other store EVER. When you walk in, you scan your phone. Then, when you pick up items off the shelves, they're automatically added to your bill, which you can check on an app. When you're done shopping, you just leave, and you're automatically charged for everything you bought. There's no checking out . . . you just walk out. So how do they know what you're taking off the shelves and putting in your bag? Amazon says it's a combination of, quote, \"computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.\" And yes, our Amazon computer overlords can also detect when you put something BACK on the shelf and decide not to buy it after all, so you won't get charged. They're testing their first store right now with their employees, and they're going to open the first one for the public in Seattle sometime early next year. October 28thFavorite Foods:Any veggies, pizza and even though I'm a vegetarian, every once in a while, I order the biggest slab of prime rib on the menu (medium rare)Things I Hate:Rude people, uncomfortable shoes and wet lettuce (I'm a big salad person and if the lettuce hasn't been properly dried, it makes the dressing watered down and the entire salad gets soggy..GROSS!)Favorite Bars:I don't have a favorite, but I do enjoy a good dive bar. Pool tables and dart boards are always a plus, oh- and the music should never be too loud unless there's a live band or it's a bar with a dance floor. I mean, seriously, why should we have to listen to some crappy old song blaring over the speakers when all I really want to do is hear the the conversation at the table. Then again I do wear headphones everyday for work, so my hearing is probably less then fabulous.Favorite Country Artists:Gary Allan. I saw him before I was working in country music, so I didn't really want to go. Turns out the people who dragged me in ended up wanting to leave early, but I was loving the music so much, I stayed at the concert by myself. It was awesome! Also, I'd like to add Brad Paisley and Sugarland to the list...LOVE THEM!Something You Might Not Know About Me:Growing up in International Falls, MN, my family actually lived on an island in the summer. It's true. There was no TV, which is why I fell in love with radio, I listened non-stop. We had to take a boat across the lake everytime we wanted to go into town. It was a great way to spend the summers, that is, until I started caring about what my hair looked like- all summer I sported the \"wind blown\" look! To this day I can make a bonnet/wind protector helmet out of any camouflage coat, pants or vest you can throw at me.Confession:I'm a speed walker. For anyone who doesn't know what that REALLY is, you're probably saying \"so what\"? But for those who've witnessed how truly idiotic it looks, let's just say, \"you know what I'm talking about\". I get laughed at and taunted on a daily basis. Contact ",

      "text": "Amazon’s Twitch game-livestreaming division acquired voice chat firm Curse back in August. Now Curse is launching a major update for its voice-over-internet-protocol app with video calls and screen sharing.\nThese features have been the most requested by streamers, according to Twitch. Earlier at TwitchCon 2016 in September, the company said that users would be able to synchronize their Twitch and Curse accounts to get extra perks.\nCurse is now bringing the features to its platform so that users can have the best VOIP experience possible.\nCurse’s video calls let users chat with up to four others face-to-face within the app, which makes the streaming of gaming sessions with friends more interactive and fun. Users can also share their screen and give others in the call a glimpse at what they’re looking at.\nAbove: Curse has enabled video calls with up to four friends.\nImage Credit: Curse/Twitch Curse said it has also made its app more secure. Video calls and screen sharing will be facilitated with a client-to-server connection versus peer-to-peer connections. The latter often exposes users to security vulnerability. This means streamers can interact with their subscribers in a safe environment without fear of their internet protocol addresses being compromised. (Discord, a rival voice app, also has this feature).\nAfter a video call, feedback and suggestions can be submitted within the app or on Twitter. There is also a Curse server where users can reach out directly to Curse’s development team and a knowledge base packed full of helpful information.\n",

I already own this and like it quite a bit for what it is. a 10 person $4,000 unit it is not, but it's well worth $300.. this is a closeout price. \n\nBuy the replacement filters on eBay and use trisodium phosphate (but not the TSP substitute they sell at most stores.. watch the package carefully) to clean filters to extend the filter life.\n\nThere's no way you're putting 6 adults in it. 4 is pushing it IMO.\n\nIt hovers between $400-420 during the summer, $350 at the end of summer is a good deal, $300 is a steal!\n",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines.\nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app.\nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren’t charged.\nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits.\nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.\nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts.\nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours.\n“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge said.\nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago.",

The Segway miniPRO is the next evolutionary step of two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporters. Segway and Ninebot utilized decades of combined industry knowledge to create smarter software, stronger hardware, and safer features. The miniPRO’s precision sensors automatically react to the rider’s movements and maintain stability over a variety of indoor and outdoor terrains. The knee control bar provides innovative steering precision that allows you to maneuver more effectively than two-wheel hover boards. \nThe Segway miniPRO is the first personal transporter, before any hoverboard, to become UL 2272 Certified for the highest standards of electrical and fire safety requirements established by Underwriter Laboratories. Not only does it come with the highest fire and electric safety certification, but it also integrates with the Ninebot & Segway phone app to give you access to a wide array of premium features and functions. From the app, you can remote control the miniPRO without riding it, view dashboard performance, customize lighting on the unit, and enable a tamper-proof security alarm.",

      "text": "Amazon Takes Cloud on the Road News Analysis Tweet Amazon Web Services has an Achilles' heel: hybrid cloud. Competitors Microsoft and IBM are light years behind AWS in market share, but Microsoft and IBM have long histories working with enterprises in on-premises computing, with relationships going back decades. Amazon has its public cloud, and that's all, leaving it in the odd position of being both a market leader and a newcomer. \nAmazon Web Services Inc. is looking to change that with its announcement last week of new Greengrass software and Snowball hardware , designed to get AWS cloud capabilities out of the data center and onto the customer premises. \nGreengrass is designed to run on the network edge, on an emerging generation of Internet of Things connected devices that need to store data and perform computations locally, rather than sending information to a remote data center and wait for the compute to be performed and results returned over the Internet. \nThe software puts a \"mini AWS\" -- a select set of AWS capabilities -- inside connected devices, Amazon says. It runs on \"almost any device with a general-purpose CPU that runs Ubuntu or Amazon Linux, and supports ARM and x86 architectures.\" It runs Amazon's Lambda service, which orchestrates workloads on virtual machines, and can run tasks locally, keep device data in sync, and communicate with other devices, as well as connect to the AWS cloud. \nGreengrass already has users. As we reported earlier today, Technicolor (Euronext Paris: TCH; NYSE: TCH) is integrating Greengrass into its set-top boxes, gateways and tablets, to monitor connection quality and automatically troubleshoot problems. And NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is using Greengrass on an educational robot to demonstrate programming and test its robots. (See Technicolor Brings AWS Home to Gateways .) \nAmazon made another hybrid cloud effort earlier this month, partnering with VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW) to allow enterprises to run VMware workloads -- a popular platform for on-premises computing -- on AWS. That will allow enterprises to run the same applications on premises that they do in the AWS public cloud, and shift workloads between the two as needed. (See Enemies No More: Amazon & VMware Partner on Cloud .) \nAmazon introduced its own device to run Greengrass -- the AWS Snowball Edge, which Amazon describes as a \"data transfer appliance\" -- a more businesslike way of saying it's a truck , which is what it is. It has a storage capacity of up to 100TB, and can transfer data to and from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), cluster with other Snowball Edge devices to form an on-premises storage pool, and run Lambda to process and analyze data. \nInfrastructure manufacturers including Intel, Qualcomm, Annapurna and Labs are integrating Greengrass into their platforms, and Amazon is also making the software available for download. \nPhilips is using Snowball Edge to extend its HealthSuite connected health device ecosystem, and the Hatfield Marine Science Center is using Snowball Edge for oceanic and coastal research. \nAmazon faces competition in appliances for hybrid cloud and edge computing. Startup Vapor IO is building self-contained miniaturized data centers, including racks, cooling and management software, in a cylinder nine feet wide and nine feet tall. And startup CloudZero provides general-purpose compute devices that are deployed on-premises but managed over the cloud. (See Vapor IO Builds Wee Data Centers .) \nAmazon announced Greengrass and Snowball Edge at its AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas last week. \nAlso at the conference, the cloud provider introduced three new cloud AI services: Lex, a version of its Alexa technology, to allow developers to build conversational user experiences for the web, mobile and connected device apps; Polly, which \"transforms text into lifelike speech, enabling apps to talk with 47 lifelike voices in 24 languages,\" and Rekognition, for image recognition, Amazon says. \nWant to know more about the cloud? Visit Light Reading Enterprise Cloud . \nAI is a hot area of competition for cloud providers; it's advanced technology that's difficult for enterprises to implement on their own, but cloud providers look to make it simple. Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) and Amazon all announced new AI and machine learning technologies earlier this month. (See Hypercloud Guys Make Big AI Push .) \nAmazon also used the conference to tout a couple of customer wins. Amazon announced that Matson, a Pacific Ocean shipping carrier, closed all four of its on-premises data centers and migrated to AWS cloud. \nAnd Amazon said that Workday, which provides enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, will use AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure for customer production workloads. Capital One Financial Corp. said it also plans to use AWS as its primary cloud infrastructure provider, migrating core applications to AWS over the next five years. \n— Mitch Wagner,",

      "text": "Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana There's a reason Google and Amazon make a high-end speaker with a voice assistant that can control your home. You can buy a few of them and place one in every room. You can speak to the device at any time, because it’s always listening to you. (On the Google Home speaker, you can disable the microphone using a button on the back.) There’s no screen, no batteries to recharge, no driver updates, and no confusion. You say “Alexa” or “OK, Google” and you’re in. For some strange reason, rumors rumbled recently about Microsoft getting in on the game, but they plan to make a Home Hub that works within Cortana on your Windows 10 computer . It makes sense on one level -- Cortana becomes a one-stop voice assistant for dictating a memo, setting reminders, and turning on the lights in your home. There are quite a few problems with this approach, though. One is that people don’t use their laptop or desktop in the same places where they might want to control their lights or set the thermostat. Sure, in the living room on a couch, but few of us have a laptop running in every room. A laptop microphone won’t pick up across the room (usually). More importantly, a laptop is for productive work, gaming, maybe research and media streaming -- we don’t use them continually throughout the day. I always lose the lid on my Chromebook when I’m done. I move onto other things. Just as important, the market has already decided that speakers work better. The Google Home plays music with a rich and loud bass; it is worth using as a speaker only. Every song I’ve played sounds as a good or better than many of the other portable speakers I’ve tested. Kudos to both Amazon and Google for emphasizing music streaming quality. On a laptop, we listen on earbuds or headphones, we connect up to a secondary speaker or even a home receiver, but few of us play music on a laptop directly, although that works much better on the recent Apple MacBook laptops. It’s not a primary music listening device in the home (or the office). It lacks the immediacy, the audio power, and the quality we normally want for a new album by the Boxer Rebellion or an audiobook. I might talk to my laptop once in awhile -- Cortana is great for setting reminders -- but I don’t think of that voice-acted assistant as something I’d use all day. Part of the issue is the size. The Home speaker sits comfortably on a nightstand, on a kitchen counter (even with pots and pans everywhere) or on my desk. It has a sleek modern look. A laptop or a desktop? Not as much. What Microsoft needs to make is a Surface speaker. The device should cost about $100 and work with Cortana. Bonus if you can also tap into Microsoft Word and dictate a document, control the lights, your home heating, the garage door openers, and several other connected home devices. The speaker should sound outstanding , something you’d place in every room. It would be a nirvana state for anyone who already uses Outlook and Office, because the speaker could also read incoming emails out loud, allow you to place a Skype call, and listen to the Groove music service. Will it happen? I’m not sure if Microsoft wants to take on giants like Amazon and Google in the consumer space, but they might try anyway. The Surface speaker could bridge the gap between home life and work life in a way that other products have not attempted. Here’s hoping they decide to turn the Home Hub into a product that fits modern life. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?  ",

      "title": "Best Balsamic Vinegar of Modena Christmas Sale on Amazon",
      "text": "December 06, 2016 at 10:11 AM EST Best Balsamic Vinegar of Modena Christmas Sale on Amazon \nBattery of Barrels to Age Balsamic Vinegar \nSpecial holiday promotion of barrel-aged balsamic vinegar from Italy with distinctive gift packaging from Gourmet Living. As a special Christmas gift, consider buying more than one and save an additional 20% off the discounted price. — Sheila May GREENWICH, CT, UNITED STATES, December 6, 2016 / EINPresswire.com / -- Gourmet Living announced today a special Christmas sale of balsamic vinegar of Modena . This holiday sales promotion is featured on Amazon.com and allows buyers to purchase its gift-packaged balsamic vinegar for $34.50 - well below the retail price of $42.50. This barrel-aged balsamic vinegar of Modena, Italy has been certified IGP by the Italian Growers Consortium. This authentic vinegar contains no additives or preservatives and is bottled by the producer to provide consumers with a genuine product. \"We have decided to significantly reduce the price of Goccia d'Oro, our best-selling balsamic vinegar, to allow consumers to taste the difference of a premium aged vinegar, \" says Sheila May of Gourmet Living. \"Shipped with an attractive gift box, this balsamic vinegar makes a wonderful Christmas gift or stocking-stuffer for friends and family alike.\" Goccia d'Oro is a premium grade balsamic vinegar with a density level of 1.33. Most commercial balsamic vinegars rarely have a density level above 1.04 and pour like diluted vinegar rather than a dense syrup that attests to its aging and taste concentration. This award-winning balsamic vinegar comes with an attractive display box and wax seal and makes a great gift for cooks and gourmands seeking a high-quality balsamic vinegar. When it comes to taste, everybody seems to have their own preferences. Nevertheless, balsamic vinegar tends to be a viscous syrup with a somewhat sweetish edge to balance the acidity. Many commercial and low priced brands that call themselves balsamic vinegar tend to be watery and may contain additives which are prohibited by the Consortium. A few drops of this special vinegar is all that is required to create a dish that tastes as if it were created by an Italian chef. Goccia d'Oro is made from pressed Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes in Modena, Italy, and then aged in oak, chestnut and cherry barrels. One may purchase Gourmet Living's Goccia d'Oro on Amazon.com . Free shipping is available to Amazon Prime members. If one is looking for gifts, consider buying more that one at a further discount of 20%.\nSheila May",

When customers pick up items from the shelf, the items are automatically added to their virtual shopping cart in the app. PHOTOS: Stars — They're Just Like Us! \nIt works for indecisive shoppers, too. If customers change their mind about an item, they can just put it back on the shelf. The charge will be deducted from their cart. \nOnce patrons have everything they need, they simply exit the store. When they leave, Amazon’s technology adds up their purchases and charges it to their Amazon account. A receipt is instantly sent via the app. \nAmazon Go is currently being tested by the company’s employees at the Seattle location near Amazon’s offices, but it will fully open to the public in early 2017. PHOTOS: Celebrities Stuffing Their Faces \nA source tells The Wall Street Journal that Amazon will soon open two more Seattle-area grocery stores in the next few weeks, but these locations will be drive-thru only. According to the source, the retail giant is hoping to open more than 2,000 grocery stores across the country depending on the success of the test locations. \n  Add a Comment  ",

      "title": "Amazon Wants To Become The World’s Largest Grocery Chain",
      "text": "December 06, 2016 at 11:46 AM EST Amazon Wants To Become The World’s Largest Grocery Chain \nAmazon.com, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) has plans to open over 2,000 grocery stores, according to a Wall Street Journal report. \nYesterday, the Seattle-based company announced the first of its brick and mortar locations , dubbed Amazon Go. The futuristic store allows shoppers to simply take what they like and leave, skipping the checkout process entirely. Using a combination of advanced imaging, machine learning, and other technical processes, the store automatically scans the items a shopper leaves with and bills them accordingly. \nApparently, Amazon Go is only the beginning of the company’s plans. It has a couple more store concepts in the works as well, according to the WSJ : \nTwo of the other store formats Amazon is considering are bigger than the convenience-style Go store, according to people familiar with the matter. In November, Amazon’s technology team approved a proposal to open large, multifunction stores with curbside pickup capability, clearing the way to start hiring and planning, according to one of the people. \nTwo drive-through prototype locations, which don’t offer an in-store shopping option, are also slated to open within the next few weeks in Seattle, the people said. \nThe Verge has some more color on just how big Amazon’s plans might be: \nThis is all part of Amazon’s grand plan to become the logistics backbone of retail, both online and offline. More brick-and-mortar locations make it easier for the company to conduct grocery delivery through its Amazon Fresh brand. And as more customers begin turning to Amazon for groceries and everyday supplies, the lower Amazon can bring its prices as it scales upward and purchases inventory in larger amounts. The deeper these layers intertwine, the more likely a consumer is to subscribe to Amazon Prime, which will surely begin incorporating offline benefits to complement its free shipping and video freebies. \nClearly, the company is intent on continuing to reinvent the retail model at every level imaginable. These new physical locations will allow it the reach to deliver not just groceries, but many other goods as well, with same-day delivery times that no competitor will be able to match. \nAmazon shares rose $6.69 (+0.88%) to $766.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 13.43%. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content. You can find full ETF Daily News articles on (www.etfdailynews.com) Related Stocks:",

      "text": "Top Story: PayPal and Amazon phishing scams spreading now By Francis Navarro, Komando.com \n'Tis the season to be jolly and the holiday shopping rush has begun. For sure, with the influx of holiday promotions, online receipts, shipping data and tracking information, your email inbox is probably inundated with messages from retail outlets, online and brick-and-mortar stores alike. \nThese holiday emails can get overwhelming and of course, the ever opportunistic scammers will, once again, try and slip a quick email scam on unsuspecting shoppers. We even warned you about how scammers will try and fool you with various techniques like misspellings and typosquatting . \nBut still, email phishing scams remain the most widespread method for stealing customer information. Popular phishing campaigns include favorite online shopping destinations like Amazon and payment service PayPal and they typically skyrocket during the holiday season . \nSo before you make that list, better check your emails twice. \nHere are two spreading phishing scams we have personally spotted lately: Amazon Order Phishing Scam \nBeware if your inbox has a purported email from Amazon with this subject line: \"Your Amazon.com order cannot be shipped.\" That email is most likely a phishing attempt. \nThe email contains this message: Hello, There was a problem processing your order. You will not be able to access your account or place orders with us until we confirm your information. Click here to confirm your account. We ask that you not open new accounts as any order you place may be delayed. For more details, read our Amazon Prime Terms & Conditions. \nUnsuspecting recipients who click on the provided link for \"account confirmation\" will be directed to a fake but convincing \"Amazon\" webpage where they are asked to re-enter their names, address and credit card information. \nThe whole thing is a sham, of course, and if you enter your information and click \"Save & Continue,\" it is game over, the scammers will now have everything they need. To keep your suspicion down, they will even redirect you to the real Amazon website when the phishing process is complete.",

      "text": "A mazon has made convenience king, offering shopping from your workplace, armchair, or even while commuting with a single click and delivery to your door, perhaps within the hour. Now it is trialling a queue-less, cashier-less grocery store . Sensors will track which items customers pick up and bill their account as they walk out. The benefit to those in a rush is obvious – but it means another lost opportunity for social contact, in the queue with fellow shoppers, with cashiers or the staff overseeing erratic self-checkouts. Such connections, fleeting as they are, can be life-saving for the chronically lonely and good for others too, reminding us that polite interaction matters as much as getting what we want this second. About a million older people go a month without speaking to a friend, neighbour or relative , and loneliness is linked to mental and physical health problems , imposing a broader social and economic strain. Researchers at the University of Hertfordshire this month suggested introducing checkout “slow lanes” for older people who may feel isolated. Amazon’s approach may make better business sense by appealing to our impatience, but it comes at a human cost.",

      "text": "Amazon One flies over Seafair 2016 (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) A group of pilots that fly Amazon’s Prime Air delivery jets will land in Seattle Wednesday to protest short-staffing and what they say are sub-standard working conditions at the airlines contracting with the online retail giant.\nThe pilots will protest outside Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, but they say they are not actually protesting the company itself. They will instead call on Amazon to use its leverage to encourage airlines to hire more pilots and provide better conditions. The pilots are from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings subsidiaries Atlas Air and Southern Air , and they plan to simultaneously protest at shipping company DHL’s headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\nGeekWire reached out to New York-based Atlas Air Worldwide, but we have not received a response.\nAtlas Air Worldwide as well as Ohio-based Air Transport Services Group have been flying packages for Amazon for months. Amazon in August debuted a Boeing 767-300 painted with the company’s Prime Air branding , the first jet to be leased from and operated by Atlas Air.\nBy the end of 2018 , each of the companies expects to be operating 20 leased 767 jets for Amazon deliveries. Amazon also holds options to buy stakes in both ATSG and Atlas Air.\nEarlier this year, pilots from Atlas Air, Southern Air and other carriers that work with Amazon and DHL voted to strike if necessary. They say they are paid less, work longer hours and have less rest between flights than pilots who fly for other carriers like UPS or FedEx. The pilots say their carriers have refused to negotiate a new contract, causing pilots to leave for greener pastures.\nWednesday’s planned protests follow a pilot walkout in November that had the potential to create some turbulence for Amazon’s holiday delivery operations. About 250 pilots from ABX Air, which is owned by ATSG, walked off the job, causing about 75 flights to be grounded, the pilot group said.\nATSG filed a court order after pilots walked off the job last month, and a judge then ordered the pilots to return to work , ruling that the disputes over scheduling and staffing constituted a minor issue that should be worked out through labor negotiations.",

      "title": "Amazon will open high-tech grocery stores with no checkout line",
      "text": "Amazon will open high-tech grocery stores with no checkout line by Chuck Bednar \nE-commerce giant Amazon.com officially entered the brick-and-mortar world on Monday as it unveiled a cashier-less grocery store in the company’s hometown of Seattle, and reports indicate that the 1,800-square-foot location is only the first part of a much larger plan. \nDubbed Amazon Go, the new convenience shop allows customers to walk in, take the items they want to buy, charge it to their existing Amazon account, and walk out of the store, according to The Verge . Individuals use an app when they enter the store, and an array of cameras and sensors keep track of the items they take with them when they leave, eliminating the need for checking out. The company recently released a video detailing how the project should work:\nAmazon Go will stock typical convenience store items such as snacks, drinks, milk and bread, as well as pre-made food products, and a report from The Wall Street Journal suggests that it is one of at least 2,000 such grocery shops that the online retailer hopes to open throughout the US. \nIn fact, the Journal indicates that Amazon is considering two additional store formats in addition to the convenience outlet. Sources familiar with the website’s plans told the newspaper that their tech team approved a proposal to open several large, multifunction stores featuring curbside pickup in November, as well as two drive-through only locations scheduled to open in a few weeks. Reports: retailer to build thousands of brick-and-mortar stores \nIf the test locations perform well, Amazon plans to ultimately open more than 2,000 of its brick-and-mortar grocery stores, challenging prominent grocer Kroger, which according to the Journal runs approximately 2,800 stores in 35 different states. The stores offering curbside service would be designed to challenge similar centers run by Target and Walmart, The Verge added. \nThe retail convenience shops and grocery stores are “part of their secret sauce in terms of all of the different ways in which they can engage the customer in bringing the product to them,” Bill Bishop of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click , told the Journal Monday. “Everyone is looking at grocery because of frequency. Frequency guarantees that you have density.” \nWhile an Amazon spokeswoman declined the Journal’s and The Verge’s requests for comment, reports indicate that the drive-through prototypes are currently under construction in the Seattle area. As for the larger, chain-style stores, they would be between 30,000 and 40,000 square feet in size and would allow customers to use touch screens to order in store, then use curbside service to pick up their purchases at a later time. Said orders could also be placed online. \nThe current Seattle-based Amazon Go location is currently open only to Amazon employees, but is expected to open to the general public early next year. The soon-to-open drive-through centers are currently under construction in the suburban Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, and individuals close to the project have told the Journal that they will open within the next few weeks. \n“The third concept, the newly approved multi-format store, combines in-store shopping with curbside pickups,” the newspaper noted, again citing its unnamed sources. “It will likely adopt a 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot floor plans and spartan stocking style... offering a limited fresh selection in store and more via touch-screen orders for delivery later. Stores in this format, which are smaller than traditional US grocery stores, could start appearing late next year.”",

      "text": "John Brownlee 12.06.16 2:16 PM \nAmazon created its empire by making online shopping easy. Now, it's trying to do the same thing in the real world. It has just opened a grocery store in Seattle with no checkout line and no cashiers. Instead, you walk in, grab what you want, and walk out. Amazon automatically knows who you are and what you took, so once you leave, your Amazon account is automatically billed. \nSo how does it work? Hey, no one knows, and Amazon won't really say . Also, right now, only Amazon employees can shop there: even the press isn't being let in. (Amazon says Go will be open to everyone starting early next year). All we know is that it requires a special Amazon Go smartphone app, and that the House of Bezos is using some combination of machine learning, computer vision, and sensors to keep track of the items that customers pick up. \nSpeculatively, though, it appears to work like this. When you scan your Amazon Go app at the turnstiles, it logs you in via NFC, the technology Apple Pay uses to let you pay with your smartphone. This initial scan essentially gives Amazon permission to track you and bill you for what you take from the shelves. From there, Amazon starts tracking your face with ubiquitous video cams throughout the store, essentially tying your physical identity to your Amazon account. From there, it uses computer vision to detect which sections of the store you visit and where you take your products from. When you walk through the turnstiles again, it recognizes your face, logs you out, and bills your Amazon credit card. \nEven if this isn't exactly the way the technology works, the effect is the same: it means that when you shop at an Amazon Go store, you'll be under constant video surveillance, with AIs poring over your every move to analyze how you shop. Considering the fact that Instagram and other networks will already target you with ads for Amazon items you literally looked at once, the world's largest e-retailer will soon be able to gather just as much data on how you shop in meatspace as it does online. \nIs the convenience of walking into a store and not having to deal with a clerk worth giving Amazon that level of scrutiny into your meatspace consumer habits? Possibly not, but when Amazon in its video says it has spent the past four years asking what shopping would look like if you could just walk in, grab what you want, and go, that's what the company really means: it has spent four years figuring out how to start tracking you in the real world as effectively as it does online. \nIf that makes you uncomfortable? Keep waiting in line.  ",

      "text": "Apple Watch deals, starting at $269.99 highlight Day 3 (Tuesday, Dec. 6) of Amazon’s 12 Days of Deals. The 38mm model with a stainless steel case and black sport band has a regular price of $349.99.\n\nAlso on offer is Apple Watch 42mm , with a stainless steel case and classic black buckle, for $359.99, compared to the regular price of $449.95. Both are refurbished first-generation models and run on watchOS 2, not the latest version watchOS 3.\nAmazon’s 12 Days Of Deals Amazon’s 12 Days of Deals, which kicked off on Dec. 4, is a play on the Christmas carol, “The 12 days of Christmas.” The theme for Day 3 (Tuesday, Dec. 6) is Brunch Friends, focusing on home and kitchen.\nMicrosoft is running a similar campaign online and in its stores. It opened Dec. 5.\nOther interesting deals on Amazon include an unlocked ASUS ZenFone Zoom with 64GB memory for $199.00 (Reg. $399.00); the Lenovo Yoga 260 i5 laptop with 8GB RAM and 265GB storage for $798.99 (Reg. $999.99); and a Samsung 29″ ultra-wide curved screen LED monitor for $399.99 (Reg. $599.99)\nDay 4 on Dec. 7 will focus on future technology.\nApple launched the smartwatch in April 2015, and updated it with the Series 2 in September 2016. The watch has received mixed reviews while sales have not been up to expectations. However, as watch-specific apps emerge it is expected to gain in popularity.\nApple Watch offers such features as watch, Apple Pay and fitness tracking that are notably wrist-friendly apps. It also lets users exchange quick messages, or driving instructions.\nSmartwatches date back to at least 1994 when Timex unveiled the Datalink with wireless facility. However, smartwatches as we know them emerged notably in 2013 with the launch of Pebble after a Kickstarter funding campaign.\nIn recent years, Android Wear from Google and Samsung’s Taizen-based smartwatches have also hit the market.\nFor the first time, the worldwide smartwatch market suffered a decline in 2016 – dipping by nearly a third in the second quarter.\nAccording to data from the International Data Corporation, smartwatch vendors shipped 3.5 million units in the second quarter of 2016, down from 5.1 million a year ago. The decline continued in the third quarter with 2.7 million units shipped versus 5.6 million in the third quarter of 2015.\nApple holds the top spot with over a million shipments.\nThe post Amazon 12 Days Of Deals: Great Prices For Apple Watch And Samsung Curved LED Monitor appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "A 44-year-old man named Dean Smith purchased a mattress from Amazon and arrived home to see the delivery van driving off after he missed the delivery time. The man was said to have gone after the van and asked the men to re-deliver the mattress, however, they refused, stating that the purchase had been logged as a missed delivery and would have to be returned to the warehouse.\n\nMr. Smith had gotten upset and seized the key of the van. He refused to give them back even after a female police officer came and asked him to return the key to the driver. The police officer eventually relented and asked the Amazon drivers to deliver the mattress to the shopper. Smith said the officer threatened to arrest him, but he was prepared to go down fighting.\n\n\nAfter his purchase was released to him, the shopper was pleased with the result of his action, stating that he was fighting for the common people. \nThis post first appeared on Linda Ikeji's Blog.

      "title": "Impinj Could Ride Amazon’s ‘Go’ Retail Design, Says RBC - Tech Trader Daily - Barrons.com",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Impinj ( PI ), the Internet of Things company that went public public on July 21st, could be a beneficiary of the “ Amazon Go ” retail concept that Amazon.com ( AMZN ) unveiled yesterday morning, according to RBC Capital ’s Mitch Steves , if Amazon ends up going with the company’s sensors and software.\nSteves, who has an Outperform rating, and a $37 target, for Impinj stock, thinks Amazon is one of a number of “upside drivers” for Impinj, others being deals with airlines and healthcare companies.\nAmazon yesterday unveiled a system whereby a customer enters a retail location and as they pick things off the shelf, items are automatically detected by a smartphone app and debited from the customer’s Amazon payment source, apparently relying heavily on wireless sensors in the goods on the shelf.\nWrites Steves, it seems likely Impinj is behind this effort, though there’s been no confirmation from either party:\nAmazon revealed its first convenience store yesterday and is currently private beta testing in Seattle with Amazon Go (smartphone enabled grocery stores). Importantly, Impinj is working with Amazon in its small set of retail stores and we think the Company may be involved in the Amazon Go initiative as well (no confirmation from either party at this time). This would act as a logical extension of the Impinj product line as the chips could be used as the inventory Management tracker (when lifting a new item the system recognizes a picked up sale allowing for seamless walk-out the door checkout). Finally, while the ~2,000 retail stores would be a large tailwind for companies involved in the tracking devices, we think the material upside would come from Amazon warehouses. \nImpinj shares today are up $1.31, or almost 5%, at $28.79.",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

TeraDeep, a developer of accelerated deep learning applications for the cloud and on-premise Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) appliances, announced today that it plans to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) F1 instances to bring high-performance, low-power video analytics to AWS cloud customers. The low-latency, power-efficient TeraDeep Amazon Machine Image (AMI) relies on Amazon EC2 F1's FPGA-optimized architecture. \"TeraDeep has developed FPGA-based accelerator technology to substantially reduce the time and cost for complex video processing,\" said Didier Lacroix , CEO of TeraDeep. \"Massive amounts of video footage are captured on camera systems and streamed every second. Accurate, automated, and low-latency video processing is critical so users can be alerted and respond to events immediately.\" \"As a growing startup, we found that the capital expenditure and lead time for developing and deploying FPGA technology on-premises is time-intensive and is the major reason there aren't more FPGA startups today,\" added Lacroix. \"Amazon FPGA Images (AFI) and Amazon EC2 F1 Instances have dramatically reduced the time and cost to deploy our technology, eliminating the large up-front expense and slashing time-to-market for custom FPGA cards from months or years to just days.\" About TeraDeep TeraDeep is a pioneer in the development of specialized neural networks and acceleration technology for deep learning. The company develops and markets high-performance, low-power deep learning solutions for the cloud as well as on-premise AI Appliances. Its complete solutions offer a creative combination of specialized hardware designed for purpose-trained networks, available through a robust set of APIs.

      "text": "0 \nImagine going to the grocery store, filling your cart and leaving without paying. And now imagine, that it would be completely acceptable. \nOf course, you would have to pay eventually – you always have to pay eventually – but the online retail giant, Amazon is well under way of making supermarket middlemen a thing of the past. Nancy Pelosi called on to apologize for disturbing ‘racist’ remarks about Ben Carson \nAmazon’s Seattle-based grocery store is already testing the concept where shoppers use an app on their phones that tracks what they take on and off the shelves, the New York Post reported. You simply fill and go and the receipt is then e-mailed to you upon your departure. \nThe 1,800 square-foot Amazon Go store is currently only open to the retail giant’s employees as it works out the kinks, but there are big plans to go mainstream and let the public in next year. \nNo lines, no cashiers, no baggers… no problem? \n“It’ll be a big job-killer,” Britt Beamer president of America’s Research Group told the Post. “It’ll eliminate the cashier, it’ll get rid of the baggers, it’ll eliminate the stock clerks. This could be big.” \nBeamer estimates Amazon’s plan to open 2,000 brick and mortar stores across the country will wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery store staff. \nCurrently, Kroger Co., holds the title as the grocery store king and operates 2,800 stores, according to the Post. \nAmazon aims to “save a lot on labor costs” Neil Saunders, managing director of the research firm Conlumino said. \nSaunders called checkout lines “the most inefficient parts of the store experience” and eliminating them would “make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.” \nAmazon calls it “just walk out technology” but didn’t offer the Post ideas on how it plans to battle shoplifting. \nAmazon’s latest venture follows similar projects that replace humans with automation and robots. From warehouse robots to delivery drones, no doubt Amazon will be pushing driverless trucks to deliver goods to its checker-less stores. Tweet \nLawmakers are wary of the toll these new grocery stores can have on the labor force. \n“We have to make sure this technology not only enables better productivity, but doesn’t disqualify millions of Americans from good, solid jobs,” Sen. Jack Reed D-RI, warned. White House: ‘embittered’ World War II veterans should get over Pearl Harbor \nAnd Barack Obama addressed the issue in 2015. “There are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers,” he told NBC News . \n“You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM, you don’t go to a bank teller, or you go to the airport and you’re using a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate,” Obama said. \nAnd now you’ll likely see it and your local market.",

      "text": "Some Pressing Questions about Amazon's New Checkout-less Store and the Future of Shopping \nWho will I make awkward small talk with if there's no cashier? Most Popular By R. Eric Thomas Dec 6, 2016 Yesterday, Amazon revealed plans for Amazon Go, a grocery store with no checkout counter. Using sophicated technology, they're introducing a casual, online shopping experience inside of an actual brick and mortar building (or, like steel and glass, or up-cycled plastic bottles. This is Seattle, so you know it's going to be a whole thing.) The idea is simple: you scan yourself in, take whatever you want and when you leave it's charged to your Amazon account. They call it \"Just Walk Out\" shopping. I don't know about you, but where I come from \"Just Walk Out shopping\" is called \"shoplifting.\" Oh, this crazy modern world. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below This is clearly an idea from the Carmen Sandiego School of Business. \"Excuse me, what are you doing with that handful of Tiffany bracelets?\" \"Oh, I'm practicing 'Just Walk out shopping!' Tata darling. Tell the Rockapella I send my love.\" GIF Anyway, this is a very excited development in the future of commerce, but you have to admit this automated, semi-sentient grocery store arrives a little too close to the finale of Westworld for my liking. I'm just saying, if I bump into Evan Rachel Wood while reaching for the Chobani, I'm out ! I'm out, y'all. I'm dropping my 6 packages of Oreos and lighting out for the territory. I don't care that Oreos are buy-one-get-one. I'm out. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below If I bump into Thandie Newton's character from Westworld I think I will also take off with a quickness, but not before gushing about how I'm literally obsessed with her and I would totally like to be her friend except for I made a promise to myself to not befriend anymore murderous robot masterminds in 2017. GIF It's important to have goals. If I bump into Westworld 's Rodrigo Santoro at the Amazon store I'll spend 20 minutes complaining about how Laura Linney chose her brother over him in Love, Actually and how I am still not okay with that. GIF The holidays are hard for all of us. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In any case, it's also possible that this market won't turn into a dystopian nightmare (but enough about Love, Actually. ) There are still some pressing questions about how it will work. First of all, will this new grocery store have samples? Most of the reason I go grocery shopping is to eat little chunks of chicken on toothpicks. This is a very important part of the shopping process. GIF Most Popular Is there a way to automate this as well? I would like an app called SamplesPlease that just sent me little cubes of cheese and that one hummus that I always think I'll like more than I actually do. Also, with no cashiers to checkout my groceries, who will I engage in awkward small talk with? And who will compliment my purchases? You think I buy Chinese Five Spice to not have someone say \"Wow! What are you going to do with that?\" No, I do not. GIF And with no cashier, who will be impressed by how much money I've saved with my couponing? If you get $300 worth of groceries for $12.78 and no one is there to see it, does it really count? Are there other people working at this store? Like employees? Or is it all Rosie from T he Jetsons ? This is important because I need to know for whom I can do my daily lunch time vaudeville called \"What do I want? What's good? Do you have any recommendations?\" Will a robot feign interest in what I'm buying to eat? What about if I'm eating my feelings? GIF Perhaps the most important question, however, is without checkout lines, how will we feel morally superior to people who bring 17 items into the 15 item or less line? This is a cornerstone of our society. GIF This new store is super exciting, but there will never be a technological advancement that can offer the passive-aggressive satisfaction of very obviously counting someone else's groceries, sighing elaborately, and then going back to looking at your phone.

      "text": "Photo via Amazon (CC-BY) You can't beat the price if you need one to get started with. \nWhen you move into your first apartment, the list of essentials is daunting. It doesn't help when you look at the price tag on half the items, like knives and cookware. \"But I'm just a poor college student!\" you say. \nT-Fal's cookware is already ideal for small budgets, but select items are up to 30 percent off today. \nGet the black 14-piece set gets you everything you need for $40.59, which is the best deal one could hope for. It even comes with basic cooking tools like spoons and spatulas! \nYou can also score a set of three fry pans for $14.99 today. If you don't have that much room to spare, there are a few singles on sale too, like the solo saute pan . \nIn short, go ahead and furnish your entire kitchen for less than $100 today. You can save up for the Calphalon later, if you really want it, but in the meantime this will keep you fed and happy for a long time.",

More than 30,000 attendees descended on the Venetian in Las Vegas last week to hear a flurry of product and partnership moves from the world's leading public cloud provider. \nAWS used the event to unveil a number of virtual machine instances designed to drive specialized workloads, increase efficiency and add flexibility to empower a broader set of use cases. It also demonstrated new services that enable artificial intelligence, serverless computing and tighter security. If that wasn't enough, a large-scale data migration product was showcased (on the back of a big rig.) \nHere are 10 companies that displayed their cloud-powering wares, plus a few other interesting sights that were found on the re:Invent pavilion floor.

      "text": "December 06, 2016 at 14:06 PM EST Impinj Could Ride Amazon’s ‘Go’ Retail Design, Says RBC Impinj ( PI ), the Internet of Things company that went public public on July 21st, could be a beneficiary of the “ Amazon Go ” retail concept that Amazon.com ( AMZN ) unveiled yesterday morning, according to RBC Capital ’s Mitch Steves , if Amazon ends up going with the company’s sensors and software. Steves, who has an Outperform rating, and a $37 target, for Impinj stock, thinks Amazon is one of a number of “upside drivers” for Impinj, others being deals with airlines and healthcare companies. Amazon yesterday unveiled a system whereby a customer enters a retail location and as they pick things off the shelf, items are automatically detected by a smartphone app and debited from the customer’s Amazon payment source, apparently relying heavily on wireless sensors in the goods on the shelf. Writes Steves, it seems likely Impinj is behind this effort, though there’s been no confirmation from either party:",

      "text": "Amazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line Elizabeth Weise , USATODAY , WVEC 6:35 AM. EST December 06, 2016 Amazon announced its Amazon Go \"just walk out\" store on Dec. 5, 2016. (Photo: Amazon) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nSAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line. \nCustomers tap their cell phones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app. \nThe service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart. \nThe Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\" \nWhen the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account. \nAmazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131 - 7th Avenue near Amazon's offices, but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said. \nThe technology \"is amazing,\" said Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles. \nHe's even more intrigued by the multiple images of \"meal kits\" show in Amazon's video. These \"everything you need to cook a quick, high-quality dinner\" kits have become popular but the economics of delivering them has meant they're difficult to make economically viable. Stores such as Amazon Go may provide a sweet spot for them. \n\"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store) they have done a great job of merchandising and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect,\" Amazon go could be a venue where they could succeed, said Lempert. ",

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire ",
