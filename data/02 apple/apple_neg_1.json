      "text": "Pinterest \nSure, the Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may be so vulnerable to scratches that Apple has a warning on its product page recommending users to use a case with the device , but it’s still one of the most popular iPhone colour ever. In fact, it’s doing so well that rumours are saying that the Cupertino company is planning to introduce a Jet White colour option. \nThe report comes from Japanese tech blog, Macotakara . Judging by the colour’s name, the Jet White should be similar to the Jet Black, with high gloss finish. Don’t get your hopes up too high though, this doesn’t sound like something Apple would do. The only time the Cupertino company introduced a new colour several months after the initial launch was for the iPhone 4, where the white version was delayed due to manufacturing difficulties; even back then the white iPhone 4 was introduced during the launch event. \nMacotakara has a decent track record when it comes to Apple products, however, when it comes to this rumour, even the tech blog seems sceptical, saying that this information has “low credibility” and that “this information may be unreliable”.",

      "text": "After multiple rumours pointing out to both a Space Black and a Deep Blue colour options with this year’s iPhone 7, Apple have finally launched its new iPhone in a new black (matte) and Jet Black options. But as a new rumour points out, the tech giant may have left behind a special Pure White or Jet White option to be released just in time for the holiday season.\nAccording to Japanese blog Macotakara , Apple could break its tradition and launch a special finish Pure White iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models just in time for the holiday season. The new comes from source that is reportedly one of the suppliers for the new model. Still then, do take this information with a pinch of salt.\n\nThe new finish would obviously be special and according to the leaked image by the blog, it looks like white version of the shiny Jet Black finish. Customers should expect fine scratch marks on this one as well!\nThe new option would simply expand the life of the iPhone 7’s shelf life and should keep the hype alive long enough till the tenth anniversary iPhone devices arrive next year.\nWhile it is not tradition for Apple to launch new colour options after the first launch, this year things may be a bit different. This seems more like a well-calculated move for the coming quarter as the Apple’s last quarterly earnings showed a 5.2 percent decline for iPhone sales compared to Q3 last year.\nThe post Apple iPhone 7 in Jet White may arrive just in time for winter appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "What's new in iOS 10.2? Apple releases second beta with new TV app Submitted by Marshall Walker on November 7, 2016 - 4:20pm \nOne week after releasing the original iOS 10.2 beta to the general public, Apple has released the second beta to developers. The updated beta includes Apple's new TV app, which was originally announced at the iPhone-maker's October 27 Mac event. Apple claims the TV app is going to “completely change\" how iOS and Apple TV users watch television. \nThe app works as a sort of TV guide that helps users locate their favorite television shows and movies across Apple devices and different platforms. The app supports other Apple services, such as Siri Live Tune-In and Single Sign-On, which will be included in the tvOS 10.1 update when it is officially released later this year. \nThe TV app allows users to easily access media they have purchased through iTunes and previously watched on other services. Users can also search trending TV shows and movies, find live events, and discover new content in the Store section. Tapping any television show or movie will automatically take a user to the appropriate app to watch that video. \nThe TV app is expected to roll out sometime in December. \niOS 10.2 also includes several new features, including three new iPhone 7 wallpapers, a new Video widget, new Preserve Camera Settings sliders, over 100 new emojis, redesigned emojis, a new 'Press and Hold to Speak’ option, a new Celebration screen effect and a new ‘Show Star Ratings’ option under Music Settings. \nThe Preserve Settings feature for the Camera allows users to preserve their last camera mode, including filters and Life Photos. The individual sliders can be located under the Photos & Camera section of the Settings app. \nApple's redesigned emojis has put an end to the classic Peach \"butt\" emoji, which created a firestorm on social media . However, most users seem to be happy with the new emojis which include a Gorilla, who has already been dubbed Harambe by some, new David Bowie inspired faces, new female and male professions and more. \niOS 10.2 is expected to be available later this year for supported iPod, iPhone and iPad devices. tags:",

      "text": "0 Apple's new iPhone 7 Plus is displayed after the new iPhone 7 Plus went on sale at the Apple Store at Tokyo's Omotesando shopping district, Japan, September 16, 2016. Reuters/Issei Kato \nApple may release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in a new “jet white” variant, according to a new report. The latest Apple smartphones currently have five available colour options. \nJapanese Apple tracker Mac Otakara credits supply chain sources as the root of the rumoured new iPhone colour variant. The sources did not reveal when the jet white iPhones would be made available. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 smartphones are currently available in five colours: silver, black, jet black, gold and rose gold. \nThe jet black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets are quite popular and in-demand. Most of the jet black variants sell out quickly at local retail shops. New online orders of the jet black iPhone 7 units are put on a wait list that can last over a month, according to Fortune . \nThe Mac Otakara report did say that the supply chain sources may be unreliable. Apple has not officially made known any such option regarding its flagship phones. Mac Otakara previously leaked Apple’s developing plans for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, including the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the addition of the jet black variant. Both leaks turned out to be true. The Japanese site was also correct when it announced a number of previously unknown iPhone 7 details, including its branding, flat Home button, longer earpiece opening and the absence of a Smart Connector cable. \nIt is not entirely questionable why Apple would release another colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. The jet black models were a huge hit and it is only wise to take advantage of the resulting momentum. The jet white iPhone may very well appeal to Apple fans just as much as the jet black variant. \nThe Mac Otakara story was initially reported by MacRumors .",

      "text": "Apple Tells Suppliers to Expect Strong MacBook Pro Shipments Going into 2017 Tuesday November 8, 2016 1:44 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Apple has told part and component manufacturers of its new MacBook Pro line-up to expect strong shipments to last until at least the end of 2016, according to sources in the upstream supply chain (via DigiTimes ). Apple is reportedly optimistic about fourth-quarter sales of its new notebooks and expects MacBook Pro shipments to maintain the same level going into 2017, said the sources, while related revenues and profits are all projected to enjoy growth next year. The same sources noted that Apple was initially not very aggressive about placing new MacBook Pro orders and was also said to have delayed the product shipment schedule by a calendar quarter, due to low yield rates for some components including hinges, battery and keyboard. Apple's stance changed after the October launch, however, and some market analysts now expect MacBook Pro shipments to reach 15 million units in 2016, with shipments staying at that level in 2017. Meanwhile, Taiwanese ODM manufacturer Wistron has reportedly landed orders for the OLED Touch Bar strip used in Apple's higher tier notebooks, according to a report in the Economic Daily News (EDN) , summarized by DigiTimes . The Chinese language daily quoted market watchers who said that the keyboard is hard to build and its original Singapore-based supplier was having difficulties meeting Apple's demand, prompting Apple to transfer orders to Wistron. The delayed launch of the new MacBook Pros was partly because of low yields of the keyboards, but shipments are starting to pick up as yield rates improve, said EDN .",

      "text": "Leave a comment \nApple Watch wearers can know take photos with a flick of the wrist, using the CMRA watch band. \nProduced by visual communication company Glide with input from global design consultancy IDEO , the CMRA band has two HD cameras for capturing photos and videos. \nGlide and IDEO claim the product is the first to add camera capability to the Apple 's smartwatch, which is sometimes criticised for offering limited functionality independent of its paired iPhone. \nThe CMRA band has both a self-facing camera for video chat and an outward-facing one for photographing other subjects. Related story Apple Watch Series 2 is \"completely reengineered\" for swimming \nThe two-megapixel self-facing camera lens is located just above the watch face, while the eight-megapixel outward-facing camera is directly adjacent to it, just beyond a sharp bend in the wrist band. \nThe wearer pushes an indentation on the band to start the camera and angles their wrist to get the desired composition. \nGlide CEO Ari Roisman described CMRA as the realisation of a widely held dream. \n\"As smartwatches become independent of the phone, wrist cameras will become commonplace for capturing memories and communicating visually,\" said Roisman. \"We are thrilled to be the first to deliver on this long-awaited vision – something science fiction has imagined for over half a century.\" \nGlide is the company behind a visual messaging app of the same name. Roisman worked with former Apple Watch engineer Shawn Grening to develop the project in little over one year. \nIf they prove popular, products like CMRA could turn around flagging smartwatch sales , which fell by 32 per cent in the second quarter of 2016. \nThe Apple Watch recorded an even sharper drop in sales in that same period, down 55 per cent year on year, though Apple has since then released an updated model that was expected to attract renewed interest. \nThe CMRA band has eight gigabytes of embedded memory and a rechargeable battery. Photos captured on the band automatically sync to the iPhone's camera roll. Related story Smartwatch sales experience first decline as Apple Watch popularity dives \nAvailable in blue, black, white or grey, the splash-resistant rubber band connects to the phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. \nGlide is now taking pre-orders and plans to ship the product from spring 2017.

      "text": "– A + Apple patents augmented reality mapping system for iPhone By Mikey Campbell\nTuesday, November 08, 2016, 01:35 am PT (04:35 am ET)\nApple on Tuesday was granted a patent detailing an augmented reality mapping system that harnesses iPhone hardware to overlay visual enhancements onto live video, lending credence to recent rumors suggesting the company plans to implement an iOS-based AR strategy in the near future.\nAs published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's U.S. Patent No. 9,488,488 for \"Augmented reality maps\" describes a mapping app capable of tapping into iPhone's advanced sensor suite to present users with real-time augmented views of their surrounding environment.\nIn some embodiments, digital information like street names, points of interest and more are overlaid on top of live video pulled from a device's camera. Other variations include complex functions like GPS-based navigation.\nFor example, a user might open activate iPhone's rear-facing camera by navigating to an AR feature within the Maps app. The system automatically correlates data from onboard sensors, including gyroscope, digital compass and accelerometer components, with GPS data to pinpoint iPhone's position in space, tilt and alignment.\nUsing the newly gleaned information, the app is able to intelligently determine an approximation of the displayed live video scene, including field of view. From there, the captured image, or live video feed, is visually augmented with vital mapping information downloaded from an offsite server.\nCertain embodiments offer simple POI identification, for example the name of buildings and monuments, though the system allows for more complex computations. In some examples, Apple's invention generates interactive route guidance complete with onscreen path indicators overlaid onto the live streamed video. The method can also pull data from the cloud to alert users that they are heading down a one-way street, for example.\nDepending on device orientation, the system is capable of switching display formats from live video to a bird's-eye view, making transitioning into and out of AR mode a seamless experience.\nToday's USPTO award comes five years to the day since Apple first applied for the patent grant in 2011. Only minor changes were made to the document to clarify and enhance claims.\nApple is known to be working on augmented reality solutions, though exactly what form that product will take is unclear. CEO Tim Cook in an quarterly investors conference call in July signaled Apple is particularly interested in AR, a sentiment he reiterated multiple times since then.\nAs tech industry competitors like Google, Microsoft and Facebook field their own AR/VR systems, pundits believe Apple plans to dip its toe into the AR/VR waters with an iPhone-based solution. Bolstering those claims are a multitude of AR patents, the latest covering device localization technology assigned to Apple from recent acquisition Flyby Media .\nWhile an iPhone AR mapping app is intriguing, integrating the same technology into an in-car heads-up display would prove revolutionary. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently hinted that Apple might use AR technology developed for mobile to break into other areas of interest like autonomous driving systems pulled from the ashes of Project Titan .\nApple's augmented map patent was first filed for in February 2010 and credits Jaron Waldman as its inventor.",

Now you have these connected televisions starting for as little as Rs. 30,000. These TVs allow instant access to apps such as Netflix, YouTube, etc, and connect to the Internet through Wi-Fi. Our pick would be smart TVs made either by Sony (based on Android TV) or LG (WebOS) because the user experience is far superior when compared to rivals.\nEven the affordable smartphones can easily run streaming apps such as Netflix, Hotstar, Hooq and Spuul.\nSmartphones\nWe have reached a stage where even the affordable smartphones can easily run streaming apps such as Netflix, Hotstar, Hooq and Spuul. What matters is the screen size, and if you intend to use the phone to watch a lot of your favourite movies and TV shows, we would recommend at least a 5.2 inches (the Asus Zenfone 3, for example) display size—the ideal would be at least 5.5 inches (the OnePlus 3 and iPhone 7 Plus, for example).",

      "text": "Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack from iPhone 7 surprised many, but this audio chipmaker’s content increased substantially and the transition represents huge growth opportunity going forward.\nThe Company\nFounded in 1984 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Cirrus Logic ( CRUS - Free Report ) is a supplier of high-precision analog and digital signal processing components for a variety of audio, energy and industrial applications. They have ~1,380 employees and ~3,200 customers worldwide. Majority of their products are sold through direct sales channels.\nThe company has a strong intellectual property portfolio with 2,400 patents issued and pending. Cirrus Logic is the only supplier of a complete audio IC solution from capture to playback. Their audio chips are used in the leading smartphone brands, tablets, digital headsets, wearables and many emerging smart home applications.\nApple is CRUS’s largest customer, accounting for ~78% of the revenue in the reported quarter though the company develops solutions for many industry leading global brands.\nJack-less iPhone a Boon for Cirrus\nApple’s decision to remove the headphone jack has been great for this company. Their content in each iPhone 7 unit has gone up substantially because their chips are used in new lightning EarPods and adapter.\nThis is a huge opportunity for Cirrus because Apple sells about 45 million units in a quarter and is expected to sell 70 million in the holiday quarter.\nMany other smartphone makers are also making the switch from tradition headphones to digital headphones, following’s Apple’s lead.\nExcellent Earnings and Upbeat Guidance\nThe chipmaker reported its Q2 fiscal 2017 results on October 27. Revenue of $428.6 million came in above the high end of their guidance thanks to better-than-expected demand for some portable audio products.\nAdjusted earnings of $1.24 per share were substantially above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 per share.\n“We are extremely pleased with our progress in the September quarter as we began volume shipments of our new digital headset solution, expanded our share with boosted amplifiers and ramped production in a mid-tier smartphone at another leading customer”, said the CEO.\nThey also raised their guidance for the current year after solid results. Revenue is expected to range between $475 million and $515 million while GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 47 and 49%\nEstimates Soaring\nAfter the big beat and upgraded guidance, analysts have raised their estimates for the company. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and next fiscal year have soared to $3.73 per share and $4.41 per share respectively, up from $2.83 and $3.35, before the results. Rising estimates sent the stock back to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe company has an excellent record of beating as can be seen from the following “Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart”:\nThe Bottom Line\nAudio/video features continue to grow in complexity and differentiation value. While they continue to expand in high-end devices, they have now started moving into mid-range devices. These features continue to expand beyond smartphones and tablets, into wearables, accessories, automotive and connected homes.\nWith its leadership position in Analog and Mixed Signal Technology and focus on fast growing markets, Cirrus seems to be well positioned for solid growth in coming quarters.\nThe company is highly dependent on a single customer, so that makes the stock a bit risky but I think it’s worth a look due to growth potential.\nConfidential from Zacks\nThis week, Zacks researchers have named 7 other stocks that look to break out even sooner than today's Bull of the Day.

      "text": "By: Tech Desk | Published:November 8, 2016 1:23 pm Apple replaced its Space Grey colour with a new matte-black colour with the iPhone 7, 7 Plus this year, and added a new jet-black version as well (Image Source: Macotakara) \nApple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus might have been launched last month, but a recent report suggests that a new colour variant – Jet White, might be on the cards. Apple introduced the glossy ‘Jet Black’ colour with the iPhone 7 lineup and has received positive response from consumers. According to a 9to5Mac report, which has quote a Japanese blog – saying that the Cupertino giant might add a new glossy white colour to its 2016 flagships. \nApple replaced its Space Grey colour with a new matte-black colour with the iPhone 7, 7 Plus this year. The company also introduced a new jet-black colour for its latest flagships, limited to only the top two (128GB and 256GB) variants of both devices. While the anodized aluminium matte-black variant is as durable as previous colours, the jet-black design has been noted to be a finger print magnet – while also being prone to easy scratching. \nApple has been successively adding new colours to its lineup since for quite some time. The iPhone 5s saw the addition of a gold colour variant, while the iPhone 6s got a new rose gold version. With the iPhone 7 however, the company has added two new colour (possibly three) variants. \nEven while the new iPhone 7 Plus features a dual rear-camera setup that makes it look apart from the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus, the iPhone 7 has little to distinguish it apart from Apple’s previous two flagships. Is the additional of so many new colour variants with the iPhone 7 an attempt to make them look apart and drive sales? It is also possible that following production delays, Apple deferred the launch of the jet-white colour to sometime later. \nRead- Apple will not bring an iPhone SE upgrade in 2017: Report \nThis might just be a rumour, as there is no precedence of Apple launching a new colour variant after the launch of a phone. If however the colour is coming, the company is sure to make an official announcement about it first. \nA recent report by KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo has said that Apple is expecting a drop is demand for the iPhone 7 – which can be the reason for the introduction of a new colour variant. Kuo added that the Cupertino tech giant will not be launching a successor to the iPhone SE in 2017 to boost sales of its flagship phones.",

The iPhone Show Are Apple’s AirPods worth the wait? (2:35) More for you to like: Nov 8, 2016 3:30 AM \nWeren’t we supposed to be listening to music on our new AirPods by now? \nApple has officially postponed the launch of its truly wireless earbuds from late October to who knows when. One Chinese supplier estimates that we won’t be rocking out with our AirPods until January 2017, which definitely screws with our holiday wish list. \nDespite the delay, you should still hold off if you’re looking for a new pair of wireless earbuds. In this week’s episode of The iPhone Show , Oscar concludes that the forthcoming AirPods are definitely worth the wait. Thanks to a brand-new W1 chip, the AirPods sport longer-lasting battery life, improved wireless connection, and can pair seamlessly to a nearby iOS device. The AirPods even have special sensors built-in that can detect when you remove them from your ears so they can automatically pause the music. \nAll these features alone makes the AirPods already superior to other truly wireless earbuds on the market right now. And on top of that, the $159 AirPods are actually more affordable. Most truly wireless earbuds will cost you at least $200, and their batteries don’t last as long. \nWhat do you think? Do you like what you’ve heard about the AirPods so far? How long would you be willing to wait to get a pair? Are wireless earbuds even something you’re interested in buying? Let us know in the comments. \nPreviously on The iPhone Show : Why   Touch Bar is the touchscreen done right Related:",

      "text": "Reddit \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company winning sole supplier status for Apple’s A10 chip has seen the company achieve both record profits and share price, reports Bloomberg . It was recently suggested that record revenue suggested strong iPhone 7 sales going into the holiday quarter. The world’s largest contract chipmaker has surged 32 percent in 2016, climbing to its highest level versus MSCI’s global gauge of technology stocks on record. The $156 billion company now accounts for 16 percent of Taiwan’s entire equity market value, the biggest proportion according to data stretching back 13 years, and none of the 33 analysts who cover it recommend selling the shares. While the company has benefited from a broader rally in technology companies this year that’s seen rivals including Intel Corp. reach multi-year highs, TSMC is luring investors with record profit as demand for Apple Inc.’s new iPhones fuels orders for its processor chips. \nSamsung’s spectacular troubles with the Note 7 are likely to assist TSMC in its efforts to be Apple’s only supplier for the A11 chip in next year’s iPhone 8 also. The company has said that it is almost ready to begin mass-production of chips using the 10-nanometer process expected to be used for the A11. \nWhile analysts are bullish about the company’s prospects, they do warn that the company is heavily dependent on the iPhone’s fortunes, with one observing that ‘any hiccup on iPhone sales this and next year could have a big impact on TSMC.’ Guides",

      "text": "> Technology After Jet Black, Apple to relaunch iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Jet White colour? If Apple decides to launch iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Jet White, then there will be 3 colour changes in all to the 2016 iPhones. By Rutu Ladage | Updated: November 8, 2016 5:07 PM IST Comments \niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been 2 of Apple’s best iPhones and both the devices brought some much needed features to Apple’s iPhone series. From being water-proof to debuting with 2 cameras, both the smartphones are making people go crazy and queue up outside Apple stores. Though the devices did not see as much of as impact as earlier generation smartphones, they are some of the most innovative devices that are launched by Apple. And a whole lot of craze surrounding iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus was their colours. Apple debuted both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in an all new colours – Jet Black, which is a completely deep black shade. The colour made people go crazy and the stocks for the new Jet Black shade iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were over within a few hours of launch! \nApple has always known to experiment with colour in their devices. A couple of years back, when Apple announced the first ever “Gold” iPhone, the iPhone 5S, people went completely crazy. Right after Apple’s Gold launch, we saw every smartphone manufacturer follow the trend and launch gold metallic devices. Apple soon followed it up with Rose Gold, as that was the flavour of the season and voila! We now see Rose Gold colours all around. Apart from the first few iPhones (and the unfortunate iPhone 5C), Apple has stuck to metallic looking colours for their devices. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black were the first ever variants to it where Apple decided to go with glossy look instead of the metallic matte finish. And Apple once again created a trend. More than anything else, it is the iPhone colours that people seem to lust after, rather than the actual features of the device! There will be no iPhone SE 2.0 in 2017 say reports \nBut now, after the success of the Jet Black shade which has seen unprecedented sales, rumours are suggesting that Apple is all set to launch a new, all-white or the Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus! They won’t be new devices but rather, Apple will relaunch these 2 devices which are already in a lot of demand. The all new Jet White shade will complement Jet Black and Apple will have launched 2 completely new black and white devices with their 2016 iPhone line up. Apart from Jet Black shade, Apple also made a slight variation to its standard metallic Grey shade and instead of the metallic Grey, launched a new Matte Black. So now, Apple’s colour palette boasts of A glossy Jet Black, a matte Black, Silver, Gold and Rose Gold. If Apple decides to launch iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Jet White, then there will be 3 colour changes in all to the 2016 iPhones. Which is a lot more than new features in iPhone 7! Just Saying. BlackBerry launches BlackBerry DTEK50, DTEK60 Android phones: Complete features and specifications \nWhile Jet Black has been one of the most demanded colour this season, the shade does not come without it’s own set of problems. Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are complete fingerprint magnets. As is the case with any glossy device, the Jet Black shade is extremely easy to smudge and get stains on too. Right before launch, Apple had already warned potential buyers that since the colour is a glossy jet Black shade, it won’t be scratch resistant and indeed, the Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus versions are the easiest to scratch. One of the major reasons Apple shifted to metallic colours was to prevent discoloration of their devices over a period of time but with Jet Black, it goes right back to where it all began. Clearly, if Apple does launch a Jet White version, the device won’t come without it’s own share of problems. While Jet White might hide smudges better, the scratches will be quite a sight! Skullcandy launches Method Wireless earbuds with flexible collar for Rs 5,299 \nThere’s been no official statement from Apple regarding the new Jet White variant, but then, it could be a late launch. Though Apple does not launch different colours of the same iPhone at different times, it has launched different version of the iPhone at a later date – example in case being iPhone SE. As recent reports suggested that Apple will not launch a newer version of iPhone SE, looks like their Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus version might be the new mid-year Apple launches. But then, if we observe, in some markets, Apple has their special Red Edition iPods, which are – special and a philanthropic step by Apple. Could this new Jet White version be something similar like Apple Red? Apple White perhaps and be region specific, launched with a cause? Well, whatever the answer, it sure will be exciting to see a new Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus version up for sale!

      "text": "Reddit \nThere’s been a great deal of discussion and debate about Apple’s decision to remove all but USB-C and headphone ports from the new MacBook Pro, but Weblogs founder and Internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis turned the dial up to 11 in an appearance on This Week in Tech . \nIn criticising both the loss of the ports from the MacBook Pro and headphone socket from the iPhone 7, he said that Apple CEO Tim Cook was ‘boring, visionless and incompetent’ and called for him to leave the company. \nThe discussion began reasonably enough, with a comment from host Leo Laporte that Apple’s price-cuts to USB-C cables and adapters was an acknowledgement of ‘a mis-step’ by the company, but that provoked a solid two-minute all-out rant by Calacanis. It started with the usual criticism of promoting an operations guy to CEO and went on from there. \nIf you put the person in charge of logistics in charge of Apple, the ships and the trains and everything’s going to run on time, but the product is going to suffer […] \nGetting rid of the headphone jack, and forcing people to make a decision if they want to charge their phone or make a phone call, is incompetence […] And to take the MagSafe connector […] to take this innovation that they’re known for and throw it away, and put four USB-Cs and take away another loved feature, the HDMI that plugs right in, knowing that people were in the video business and developers love that, it reeks of some level of incompetence that can only happen when you put someone as boring and visionless as Tim Cook in charge of a company with a legacy and a passionate user-base like Apple. \nCalacanis went on to compare his view of Cook with Steve Jobs, seemingly forgetting that Steve hand-picked his successor. \nThe first comment on the video was from someone who didn’t seem overly impressed. You can trust Jason Calacanis, he’s an expert in incompetence. \nView in our poll were split, with a slim margin considering the switch to all-USB-C ports a positive move.

      "text": "Apple is Placing Aggressive Orders for the New MacBook Pro [Report] LIKE MORE Posted 4 minutes ago by iClarified · 190 views · Translate Apple is placing aggressive orders with suppliers for the new MacBook Pro ahead of the holiday season, reports DigiTimes. Sources say the company is optimistic about sales in the fourth quarter despite complaints from professional users who believe the notebook doesn't meet their needs. Apple temporarily lowered its prices on USB-C adapters, cables, and peripherals to appease upset customers. The sources pointed out that Apple was not initially very aggressive about placing new MacBook Pro orders and was also said to have delayed the product' shipment schedule by a quarter due to low yield rates for some components including hinges, battery and keyboard. However, Apple has started turning aggressive after the launch in October. Shipments could reach 15 million units in 2016 and stay at that level in 2017.",

      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 7 Chipmaker Reports Record Profits 1:25 pm By Roland Hutchinson \nTSMC makes the A10 processor for Apple, the processor is used in the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the company has just reported record profits. \nThe company’s share price has increased significantly because of the record profits and this also suggests that sales of Apple’s iPhone 7 handset are high. \nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker has surged 32 percent in 2016, climbing to its highest level versus MSCI’s global gauge of technology stocks on record. The $156 billion company now accounts for 16 percent of Taiwan’s entire equity market value, the biggest proportion according to data stretching back 13 years, and none of the 33 analysts who cover it recommend selling the shares. \nWhile the company has benefited from a broader rally in technology companies this year that’s seen rivals including Intel Corp. reach multi-year highs, TSMC is luring investors with record profit as demand for Apple Inc.’s new iPhones fuels orders for its processor chips. \nApple has yet to report how many units of their iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus they have sold, the company is expected to have high sales of the device over the holiday period.",

      "text": "Apple’s CEO Tim Cook Is Boring and Incompetent, Internet Guru Says GO Jason Calacanis wants Tim Cook to leave from Apple Nov 8, 2016 13:46   We’ve seen quite a lot of people out there criticizing Apple and CEO Tim Cook after the latest product launches, but Internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis launched some pretty serious accusations, criticizing some of the most recent decisions, such as the removal of the headphone jack. In case you’re wondering who Jason Calacanis actually is, it’s worth mentioning that he’s the one who invented Weblogs when he was just a blogger, before joining AOL and working on Netscape. He was also involved in some other companies, including Sequoia Capital, Mahalo.com and Angel Investing, which were both founded by him. The removal of the headphone jack Going back to what he said, Calacanis used the last edition of This Week in Tech podcast to blame Tim Cook for all the bad decisions that Apple made lately, including the removal of the headphone jack. “Getting rid of the headphone jack, and forcing people to make a decision if they want to charge their phone or make a phone call, is incompetence,” he said in his statement. “And to take the MagSafe connector […] to take this innovation that they’re known for and throw it away, and put four USB-Cs and take away another loved feature, the HDMI that plugs right in, knowing that people were in the video business and developers love that, it reeks of some level of incompetence that can only happen when you put someone as boring and visionless as Tim Cook in charge of a company with a legacy and a passionate user-base like Apple.” Apple’s removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone was one of the most criticized changes that the company introduced in the last decade, but Cupertino executives described this as an act of courage that nobody else was willing to do. Right now, however, Apple is indeed forcing iPhone 7 users to either charge their iPhones or listen to music with wired headphones, as doing both things at the same thing is not possible given the fact that there’s just one Lightning port. Opinions on whether Calacanis is right or not are still mixed at this point, but there’s no doubt that Cook had his own share of criticism following this new product launches, so it’ll be quite critical for him to make the new iPhone and MacBook sell better than their predecessors.",

      "text": "iPhone Backups Are 1,000 Times Harder to Hack in iOS 10.2 GO Apple improves encrypted backups with latest iOS update Nov 8, 2016 13:21   Apple has recently released the first iOS 10.2 beta, and in addition to new emoticons, it appears that the company has a made an under-the-hood change that’s critical for the security of data included in backups. Security experts at iMazing explain that iOS 10.2 beta makes encrypted backups no less than “1,000 times safer,” as the OS update also increases the required processing power to crack the password. Apple attempted to bolster the security of encrypted backups with iOS 10 in the very first version, but due to a security flaw, the company offered exactly the opposite, and made backups actually easier to hack. Cupertino fixed the problem quite fast, and 10.1 introduced a fix in this regard, blocking brute force attacks and making passwords almost impossible to hack. iOS 10.2 beta But this has all been improved in the last beta and should become available for everyone when iOS 10.2 goes live for all users, as it’s currently in testing with developers and users enrolled in the beta program. “Now in the first iOS 10.2 beta, things changed yet again, and Apple packed a little surprise for would-be attackers: not only is the entire backup database now encrypted, but validating a user password is now much more demanding in terms of processing power, requiring many more iterations to generate the derived key. Our user’s password is safer than ever, taking the better part of a 1’000 years for our hypothetical hacker to crack,” iMazing explains. Apple pledged to increase the security of its products ever since the FBI tried to force the company into hacking the iPhone that was owned by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. Apple refused, but the FBI eventually managed to break into the device with help from hackers whose names have not been disclosed. Apple is reportedly trying to build a hackerproof iPhone as well, and it’s likely that this increased security of encrypted iTunes backups is part of this plan. The company hasn’t yet confirmed the strengthened security of iTunes backups, but more information will probably be provided when iOS 10.2 will be out of beta.",

      "text": "Getty Images Cadillac can go toe-to-toe with Silicon Valley giants like Apple and Google on creating future automobile technology, the president of the luxury car firm told CNBC on Tuesday, as he revealed a new shared car ownership product.\nGoogle has been working on driverless car technology while Apple was rumored to be interested in jumping into the auto space too. Both have their own in-car operating systems as well. Earlier this year, Alphabet -owned Google partnered with Fiat Chrysler to develop self-driving minivan prototypes.\nJohan de Nysschen, president of Cadillac, told CNBC he would not rule out partnerships with any of these firms, but the luxury carmaker is able to develop its own high-quality technology capabilities in house, he said.\n\"I think that in the future there may indeed be a market for autonomous driving enabled vehicles that provide transportation from A to B, but that's not the market Cadillac is in. We are a luxury brand we want to offer all of the benefits but we want to do it in an emotionally engaging way,\" De Nysschen told CNBC in an interview at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon.\n\"I know it sounds like a bold claim, but we know as much about connectivity and autonomous driving and technologies as any of the companies in Silicon Valley, we also know a lot more about integrating these into automobiles and we also know a lot more about developing and manufacturing automobiles. Which I think still gives us a very strong competitive position.\"\nShared ownership service on the way show chapters\nChina is a big growth engine for brand: Cadillac President\nCadillac President, Johan de Nysschen talks about the luxury automaker’s future, when it comes to innovation, connectivity and technology.\nChina is a big growth engine for brand: Cadillac President 7 Hours Ago | 03:05 The Cadillac president also revealed to CNBC that the company is working on a new shared ownership model. De Nysschen said that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are \"brand agnostic\" and about functionality.\n\"That is not quite Cadillac. But it doesn't mean that we can't cultivate a product and a way of owning a Cadillac that allows people who want to move from A to B in the luxury of a Cadillac, has all the safety and connectivity benefits … That is some of the exciting things that our teams area working on,\" De Nysschen said.\nHe added that the product is likely to be a shared ownership model where you can \"buy access into Cadillac ownership and have guaranteed availability of a variety of Cadillac models either for yourself to drive or be driven in\".\nshow chapters\nOf course we do care about who wins US election: Cadillac\nCadillac President, Johan de Nysschen says “economies of skill” is what generates cost competitiveness, while commenting on trade and the U.S. elections.\nOf course we do care about who wins US election: Cadillac 7 Hours Ago | 01:37 De Nysschen would not elaborate but said that this is \"under development\".\nLast year, General Motors , the owner of Cadillac, launched its own car sharing program called Maven, which allowed people to rent Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick vehicles, by the hour.\nAt Web Summit on Tuesday, Nissan announced a shared ownership scheme which allows people to part-own a new Micra. Nissan said this would launch in Paris later this year with cars expected on the road by 2017. The service uses social profiling and location technology to match compatible owners who together will jointly own a car.\nThe trend is part of automakers' efforts to adapt to new ownership models being borne out of services like Uber and Lyft. Many carmakers admit that in the future, a larger portion of people won't want to own cars but instead share them.",

      "text": "Apple on Monday released iOS 10.2 beta 2 , which ended up being an atypically exciting release for a second beta. Each new beta release usually refines features offered in an initial beta release, and obviously fixes any bugs that are uncovered. In the case of iOS 10.2 beta 2, however, Apple fans got their first taste of an entirely new app called simply \"TV.\" Apple unveiled its new TV app last month during its big MacBook Pro event, and the company sees this new app as a major advancement in its entertainment lineup. TV gives users a single hub through which they can browse and search for movies, TV shows and other videos hosted online — as long as they're not on Netflix . Then, selecting a video will automatically open the appropriate app through which it can be streamed. TV is a nifty new app and users with iOS 10.2 beta 2 can begin testing it right now. Don't have a developer account to access the beta? Don't worry, because this post will show you how to install iOS 10.2 beta 2 without the need for a developer account or even a computer.\n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nHey Apple, why are you trolling us? OnePlus is officially releasing an even faster smartphone How to get the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar on any Mac for free ",

      "text": "We’ve seen quite a lot of people out there criticizing Apple and CEO Tim Cook after the latest product launches, but Internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis launched some pretty serious accusations, criticizing some of the most recent decisions, such as the removal of the headphone jack. In case you’re wondering who Jason Calacanis actually is, it’s worth mentioning that he’s the one who invented Weblogs when he was just a blogger, before joining AOL and working on Netscape. He was also involved in some other companies, including Sequoia Capital, Mahalo.com and Angel Investing, which were both founded by him. The removal of the headphone jack Going back to what he said, Calacanis used the last edition of This Week in Tech podcast to blame Tim Cook for all the bad decisions that Apple made lately, including the removal of the headphone jack. “Getting rid of the headphone jack, and forcing people to make a decision if they want to charge their phone ...",

      "title": "Bought any MacBook Pro dongles? Apple will be sending you free money",
      "text": "On Friday, Apple announced a limited-time sale on some of the rather expensive dongles for its new MacBook Pro. The news was well-received by people who didn't really want to spend $19 for the privilege of having a USB port, but it looks like Apple is extending the deal to everyone who has already bought any USB-C adapters.\n9to5Mac reports that readers who bought USB-C adapters for their new MacBooks in the last week have seen automatic credits applied to their accounts for the difference between the sale price and what people paid for the non-discounted adapters.\nDON'T MISS: OnePlus is officially releasing an even faster smartphone\nA reader says that an email from Apple confirmed the automatic credit:\n“Thank you for your recent Apple Online Store purchase.\nApple recently lowered the price of the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) you ordered. We are pleased to inform you that we will provide you with a credit for the difference between the price you paid and the new, lower price.\nApple”\nIt's a classy, if predictable, move from Apple. Given the Apple Store's return policy, customers could have gone into the store to return the dongles and then re-buy them on sale anyway, so Apple's really just making that process automatic. Still, given the laziness of people, it will amount to Apple giving away some of its hard-earned dongle profit.\nThe dongle sale, and now this credit, are the latest conciliatory moves by Apple over the MacBook Pro's port situation. When the company announced a new laptop with four USB-C ports and nothing else, it probably wasn't expecting the level of backlash that it saw. Taking people's headphone jacks is one thing, but it seems like the MagSafe connector and SD card reader are truly sacred ground.\nIt's unclear exactly how far back the credits for the adapter sale will go, but if you've bought a USB-C adapter for any MacBook from the Apple Store in the last 30 days, I'd strongly suggest contacting Apple support and trying to get a refund for the difference.\nTrending right now:\n5 major new Galaxy S8 features may have just been uncovered Hey Apple, why are you trolling us? OnePlus is officially releasing an even faster smartphone See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "BII \nThe rise of mobile payments technology truly began in 2014 when Apple Pay hit the market. At the time, it was the only major mobile wallet out there.\nBut in the last two years, mobile wallets have flooded the market with offerings such as  Samsung Pay, Chase Pay, Android Pay, Microsoft Wallet, Walmart Pay, and Kohl's Pay. Each of these offers unique benefits to the user and encourages customers to form shopping habits around them. \nAnd so far, they seem to be succeeding. \nBI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, finds that mobile payment volume will reach $75 billion this year. That figure should swell to $503 billion by 2020 thanks to advancements in mobile payments technology. \nBelow, we've outlined how mobile and contactless payments work and explained the different types of payments technology that are shaping the present and future. \nWhat Are Contactless Payments and How Do They Work? To understand how contactless payments work, let's take a hypothetical example. You have an iPhone, which allows you to take advantage of Apple Pay. You input your credit card information onto your phone, which stores it for later use. \nLater on, you're shopping at a store that has mobile payment readers at the register. Rather than reach for your wallet, you take out your phone and hold it a few inches away from the point-of-sale (POS) terminal. This device then automatically reads the payment information stored on the smart chip embedded in your card and then processes the transaction. \nEach chip connects to an antenna, and POS terminals emit a high frequency radio wave that facilitates communication between the reader and the phone. When the mobile device is in range, a wireless communication protocol links the terminal and the phone, which exchange information and conduct a secure transaction. \nAll of this occurs in fractions of a second. \nNear-Field Communication (NFC) Payment Technology Near-field communication, or NFC, technology works by bringing together two electronic devices, typically a mobile device such as a smartphone and a reader of some kind. NFC tech always involves one initiator that generates an RF field to power a passive target. In terms of payments technology, the reader would be the initiator and the smartphone (which contains the stored credit card information) would be the target. \nThe market potential for NFC payment technology is enormous, as merchants have actually been inadvertently rallying behind this type of contactless payment tech. As more U.S. merchants adopt the EMV security standard as of October 1, 2015, they must order new EMV-compliant terminals from major providers such as Verifone and Ingenico. More often than not, these devices accept NFC payments through mobile wallets. \nIn short, EMV will help make NFC technology universal because NFC offers a clear preferred mobile acceptance technology. And this transition is well underway. Verifone said in its Q3 2015 earnings call that NFC terminal penetration had likely reached 100% among top-tier merchants. \nBII \nBluetooth Payment Technology Bluetooth is a bit of a wild card in the payments industry. Mobile payments technology focuses quite a bit on NFC, and with good reason. But Bluetooth could be the true transformer in this area.\nAll the major mobile platform developers, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and BlackBerry have supported Bluetooth for the last several years, but they shifted focus to NFC in the payments world as they released their mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Android Pay, etc.).\nBluetooth, however, could change the game. Mobile payments such as Apple Pay have been slow to catch on in certain areas, but Bluetooth likely would not have such problems, especially because it has some inherent advantages.\nFor starters, Bluetooth has a much longer range than NFC, as it can reach up to 50 meters compared to NFC's need to have the two devices centimeters away from each other. This longer range could reduce friction during the checkout process even more than NFC technology already does. On top of this, Bluetooth creates a truly hands-free experience because shoppers would not even need to take out their phones to tap them to a reader. \nFurthermore, Bluetooth payment processing is almost always faster than NFC, even if it's by fractions of a second. And finally, NFC is limited to one-to-one interaction, as in one mobile device and one payments reader. But Bluetooth can facilitate multiple transactions at once from a single payments terminal, which would further speed up the checkout process.\nMore to Learn Mobile payments technology will evolve in numerous ways in the coming years, but this is just one piece of the much larger and more complex payments ecosystem.\nThat's why BI Intelligence spent months compiling the greatest and most comprehensive guide on the world of payments entitled  The Payments Ecosystem Report : Everything You Need to Know About The Next Era of Payment Processing. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the payments industry, choose one of these options:\nSubscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

      "text": "There are plenty of bumper cases out there for Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but none of them offer the type of protection you'll get from the next-generation ThanoTech K11 bumper — at least not without adding an unusable amount of thickness to your iPhone. The beauty of bumpers is that they offer fantastic protection for your iPhone without hiding the handset's gorgeous design or adding excessive bulk. In fact, since most bumpers only cover the edges of a phone and not the front or back, the handset feels just as thin in the hand as it would with no case at all.\nWe have tested a number of iPhone 7 bumpers so far and to be frank, we haven't been thrilled with any of them. Some looked nice but didn't offer much in the way of protection, while others offered great protection but were far too bulky. Luckily, the company behind one of our favorite iPhone 6/6s bumpers is back with an updated model for the iPhone 7, and it's better in almost every way.\nMUST SEE: Hey Apple, why are you trolling us?\nThe newly updated ThanoTech bumper features a sleek and slender design that looks a great deal like the previous-generation model, but it has been updated in a number of important ways. There have been structural improvements made, which have resulted in an even more durable design. Then ThanoTech also made some key design changes to offer better grip as well as better access to buttons and ports.\nOf course, the important question is whether or not the new K11 bumper for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus still protect as well as the old models, and the drop tests that begin just after the 2:20 mark in the video below certainly suggest that's the case.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kKLKkCN-bY\nIn the video, iPhones protected by the K11 bumper were dropped from 4 feet, 6 feet, 10 feet, and 16 feet in order to show off the case's durability. While drops from higher distances resulted in some scuffing on the K11, which is only to be expected, the iPhones emerged completely unscathed each time. We've been testing a prototype of the K11 for a few days now and while we haven't quite been brave enough to drop a phone from 16 feet in the air, the case and iPhone held up just as advertised in a few test drops from between 3 and 4 feet.\nNow, for the bad news: the K11 bumpers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus aren't yet available for purchase. Instead, ThanoTech is running a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first run. The company is seeking $60,000 by November 21st, and the cheapest option is a $20 early bird special, though only 23 early bird slots were left at the time of this writing. After they're gone, the new K11 will cost $25, which is still a good deal.\nThanoTech has run two successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past, so risk here is minimal as far as Kickstarter goes. Check out the full campaign page with plenty of additional information right here .\nTrending right now:\n5 major new Galaxy S8 features may have just been uncovered Hey Apple, why are you trolling us? 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "BII\nThe rise of mobile payments technology truly began in 2014 when Apple Pay hit the market. At the time, it was the only major mobile wallet out there.\nBut in the last two years, mobile wallets have flooded the market with offerings such as Samsung Pay, Chase Pay, Android Pay, Microsoft Wallet, Walmart Pay, and Kohl's Pay. Each of these offers unique benefits to the user and encourages customers to form shopping habits around them.\nAnd so far, they seem to be succeeding.\nBI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, finds that mobile payment volume will reach $75 billion this year. That figure should swell to $503 billion by 2020 thanks to advancements in mobile payments technology.\nBelow, we've outlined how mobile and contactless payments work and explained the different types of payments technology that are shaping the present and future.\nWhat Are Contactless Payments and How Do They Work? To understand how contactless payments work, let's take a hypothetical example. You have an iPhone, which allows you to take advantage of Apple Pay. You input your credit card information onto your phone, which stores it for later use.\nLater on, you're shopping at a store that has mobile payment readers at the register. Rather than reach for your wallet, you take out your phone and hold it a few inches away from the point-of-sale (POS) terminal. This device then automatically reads the payment information stored on the smart chip embedded in your card and then processes the transaction.\nEach chip connects to an antenna, and POS terminals emit a high frequency radio wave that facilitates communication between the reader and the phone. When the mobile device is in range, a wireless communication protocol links the terminal and the phone, which exchange information and conduct a secure transaction.\nAll of this occurs in fractions of a second.\nNear-Field Communication (NFC) Payment Technology Near-field communication, or NFC, technology works by bringing together two electronic devices, typically a mobile device such as a smartphone and a reader of some kind. NFC tech always involves one initiator that generates an RF field to power a passive target. In terms of payments technology, the reader would be the initiator and the smartphone (which contains the stored credit card information) would be the target.\nThe market potential for NFC payment technology is enormous, as merchants have actually been inadvertently rallying behind this type of contactless payment tech. As more U.S. merchants adopt the EMV security standard as of October 1, 2015, they must order new EMV-compliant terminals from major providers such as Verifone and Ingenico. More often than not, these devices accept NFC payments through mobile wallets.\nIn short, EMV will help make NFC technology universal because NFC offers a clear preferred mobile acceptance technology. And this transition is well underway. Verifone said in its Q3 2015 earnings call that NFC terminal penetration had likely reached 100% among top-tier merchants.\nREUTERS/Beck Diefenbach\nBluetooth Payment Technology Bluetooth is a bit of a wild card in the payments industry. Mobile payments technology focuses quite a bit on NFC, and with good reason. But Bluetooth could be the true transformer in this area.\nAll the major mobile platform developers, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and BlackBerry have supported Bluetooth for the last several years, but they shifted focus to NFC in the payments world as they released their mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Android Pay, etc.).\nBluetooth, however, could change the game. Mobile payments such as Apple Pay have been slow to catch on in certain areas, but Bluetooth likely would not have such problems, especially because it has some inherent advantages.\nFor starters, Bluetooth has a much longer range than NFC, as it can reach up to 50 meters compared to NFC's need to have the two devices centimeters away from each other. This longer range could reduce friction during the checkout process even more than NFC technology already does. On top of this, Bluetooth creates a truly hands-free experience because shoppers would not even need to take out their phones to tap them to a reader.\nFurthermore, Bluetooth payment processing is almost always faster than NFC, even if it's by fractions of a second. And finally, NFC is limited to one-to-one interaction, as in one mobile device and one payments reader. But Bluetooth can facilitate multiple transactions at once from a single payments terminal, which would further speed up the checkout process.\nMore to Learn Mobile payments technology will evolve in numerous ways in the coming years, but this is just one piece of the much larger and more complex payments ecosystem.\nThat's why BI Intelligence spent months compiling the greatest and most comprehensive guide on the world of payments entitled The Payments Ecosystem Report : Everything You Need to Know About The Next Era of Payment Processing.\nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the payments industry, choose one of these options:\nSubscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Getty Images Apple's App Store Has a Counterfeit Problem Some fake apps are filled with pop-up ads, while others contain malware or can steal credit card and other personal information. By Lindsay Gloor | November 8, 2016 \nBefore you try to do your holiday shopping with an iPhone app, make sure that app is the real deal. \nApple removed hundreds of fake retail and product apps from its App Store last week after The New York Times and the New York Post started asking about the counterfeit apps. \nThe counterfeiters ranged from retail chains like Dollar Tree to big department stores like Nordstrom to even designer brands like Christian Dior. Article Continues Below Continue Reading While some only offered endless pop-up ads, others asked users to enter credit card details or contained malware that could steal personal information. SEE MORE: Apple Says It Killed The Headphone Jack Out Of 'Courage' Security experts told The New York Times that most fake apps are created in China and somehow manage to slip through Apple's review process. In the past, the tech-giant's review process has been criticized for being too tough on app developers, but it seems something might have changed. Earlier this year, an Apple official said in an interview that half of all apps are now approved within 24 hours and 90 percent are approved within 48 hours. One Apple spokesperson responded to the issue in a statement , saying \"We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” Despite efforts to remove them, new imitation apps continue to appear. Developers might change their app's content after it has been approved or resubmit similar products after fakes have been uncovered. Apple allows users to report suspicious apps. Fake apps tend to have no reviews and no history of previous versions, and often, their menus don't make sense or use poor English. TRENDING IN Business NEWS",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Five reasons why Apple's new MacBook Pro makes me want to switch back to Windows I've patiently waited for Apple to refresh the MacBook Pro line, but what Apple delivered makes me want to switch back to Windows. | Topic: Hardware \nI like my current MacBook Pro. It's been a great and problem-free workhorse, but it's getting a bit long in the tooth, and I'm in the market for an upgrade. \nProblem is, I don't like the new MacBook Pro. CNET Exclusive: Does the Mac still matter? \nApple's not a democracy, and I don't get a say in what goes into the MacBook Pro, but what I do get a say in is whether I exchange my hard-earned cash for one, and I'm not convinced any more that it's the right machine for me. \nHere's what I don't like: #1: I'm not sold on USB-C \nThe thing that I connect the most often to my MacBook Pro is a flash drive. The next is my Compact Flash card reader. Thee connect to a regular USB port, so this means either upgrading my hardware, or get a one-way ticket to Dongleville. \nYou can't even connect the Lightning cable that comes with the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro without a dongle. Let that sink in. \nIt might be cheaper for Apple to go with a single port (or maybe Jony Ive thinks it's it looks better or something), but it just doesn't fit in with my workflow (at least yet). #2: I'm not thrilled about the removal of the MagSafe connector \nOne of the features that drew me to the MacBook Pro in the first place was the MagSafe connector. I always saw the power ports on laptops as a weak point, and combined with my \"more bull than ballerina\" approach to handling my gear, the idea of a port that would allow the cable to detach before breaking something was compelling. \nBut the MagSafe is no more. You charge the new MacBook Pro using one of the four USB-C ports. And these ports are affixed directly to the mainboard, which means you break one, you're in an expensive world of hurt. Sure, there are dongles that go some way to helping , but this feels like a really clumsy solution. \nMagSafe was a great solution, and it's now gone. #3: The Touch Bar feels like a big gimmick \nI've got as much information as any other potential buyer about the Touch Bar, and to me, it feels like a big gimmick. I'm not convinced that a small touchscreen display above the keyboard is an improvement over on-screen UI, especially given its placement and size. \nNice try, Apple, but this is no substitute for a true touchscreen MacBook Pro. I would have been happier with a touchscreen trackpad that the Touch Bar. #4: Bored of Apple's pursuit of \"thinner and lighter\" \nMy existing MacBook Pro is thin enough and light enough already. It's gone far enough. \nI'd much rather Apple focus on better battery life, or kit out the MacBook Pro with more ports than put effort into eliminating a few millimeters here and there. #5: Price \nThe new MacBook Pro is a top dollar item. A tool aimed at professionals who want to get work done. And yet Apple considers 256 gigabytes of storage to be a good starting point. \nIf you want more you can get it, but it's going to cost you. Not only do you have to pay for a higher-spec version, you also pay big bucks for the storage. A $2,400 MacBook Pro with 256 gigabytes of storage jumps to an eye-watering $3,800 once you upgrade that to two terabytes. Even a more modest upgrade to one terabyte kicks the price to $3,000.",

      "text": "There are plenty of bumper cases out there for Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but none of them offer the type of protection you'll get from the next-generation ThanoTech K11 bumper — at least not without adding an unusable amount of thickness to your iPhone. The beauty of bumpers is that they offer fantastic protection for your iPhone without hiding the handset's gorgeous design or adding excessive bulk. In fact, since most bumpers only cover the edges of a phone and not the front or back, the handset feels just as thin in the hand as it would with no case at all. We have tested a number of iPhone 7 bumpers so far and to be frank, we haven't been thrilled with any of them. Some looked nice but didn't offer much in the way of protection, while others offered great protection but were far too bulky. Luckily, the company behind one of our favorite iPhone 6/6s bumpers is back with an updated model for the iPhone 7, and it's better in almost every way.\nMUST SEE:  Hey Apple, why are you trolling us? \nThe newly updated ThanoTech bumper features a sleek and slender design that looks a great deal like the previous-generation model, but it has been updated in a number of important ways. There have been structural improvements made, which have resulted in an even more durable design. Then ThanoTech also made some key design changes to offer better grip as well as better access to buttons and ports.\nOf course, the important question is whether or not the new K11 bumper for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus still protect as well as the old models, and the drop tests that begin just after the 2:20 mark in the video below certainly suggest that's the case.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kKLKkCN-bY\n \nIn the video, iPhones protected by the K11 bumper were dropped from 4 feet, 6 feet, 10 feet, and 16 feet in order to show off the case's durability. While drops from higher distances resulted in some scuffing on the K11, which is only to be expected, the iPhones emerged completely unscathed each time. We've been testing a prototype of the K11 for a few days now and while we haven't quite been brave enough to drop a phone from 16 feet in the air, the case and iPhone held up just as advertised in a few test drops from between 3 and 4 feet.\nNow, for the bad news: the K11 bumpers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus aren't yet available for purchase. Instead, ThanoTech is running a Kickstarter campaign to help finance its first run. The company is seeking $60,000 by November 21st, and the cheapest option is a $20 early bird special, though only 23 early bird slots were left at the time of this writing. After they're gone, the new K11 will cost $25, which is still a good deal.\nThanoTech has run two successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past, so risk here is minimal as far as Kickstarter goes.

      "text": "Apple patents augmented reality mapping system By Dan Pye ● 27 minutes ago \nApple has been granted a patent for “Augmented Reality Maps” that layer map information and directions over live iPhone video, giving more credibility to recent rumors that the company will soon be integrating AR into its existing product lines. A drawing enclosed with the patent application shows street names superimposed on the image being received by the iPhone’s camera and points of interest labeled in the distance. The idea is to use the phone’s GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, and digital compass to determine the device’s precise position and use that information to provide thew correct information about what’s in front of the user. \nApple’s patent adds hints that it’s working on “onscreen path indicators” to help with directions and the ability to have the iPhone shift between a bird’s-eye view when held flat while seamlessly switching to the AR overly view when help upright. CEO Tim Cook has said AR is likely to become a “core technology,” but KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo warned investors not to expect it for the next year or two. Kuo said he expects Apple to “leapfrog” competitors by 3-5 years once they finally enter the market, and Apple’s ambitious patent indicates they’re eyeing applications that integrate the technology to make existing products function in new ways.

      "text": "Google's big bet on virtual reality is launching on November 10 \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple is still searching for another successful product that can diversify its revenues, since its profits still rely largely on iPhone sales. \nRecent comments from CEO Tim Cook indicate that Apple may be exploring augmented reality (AR) as the next product that could help it succeed in that goal, Business Insider reported . \nCook, speaking at an event last month, said that he expects AR to eventually become a part of people’s everyday lives, “like eating three square meals a day.” This outlook is consistent with the results of a recent survey by Yeti in which respondents indicated higher levels of long-term optimism for AR than for VR. \nCook also predicted that AR would come to operating systems (like iOS) in the “not-too-distant future,” although he acknowledged that there are still may technological challenges that must be overcome first. Those challenges, Business Insider noted, include: Building AR capabilities into the cameras of iOS devices and the operating systems, so the camera can identify objects in its view, a key first step to enabling AR. Adding hardware like 3D sensors to iOS devices. Apple bought Primesense, which builds similar hardware, back in 2013. Providing a platform for developers to build AR apps on top of Apple’s AR hardware and software. Building an AR-specific product, like an AR headset or glasses that can leverage the AR capabilities in iOS devices. \nApple’s already experimented with AR capabilities in the iPhone, including a feature for Apple Maps that provides an AR view of local listings. However, the first sign that Apple is really serious about AR would be when it starts adding AR hardware and software to a new generation of the iPhone. If it finds that AR is a successful selling point for a new iPhone model, it would incentivize the company to accelerate efforts to build an AR-specific product like a headset. \nThe tech industry has promoted the prospect of VR for the past few decades. But only now, with headsets backed by big names like Sony and Facebook, is VR finally becoming a concrete product with mass market potential. While VR technology is largely associated with the gaming industry, the platform offers a new set of content opportunities in entertainment, advertising, and more. \nBut where is it all going? \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on virtual reality content that examines how various VR headset categories will shape VR content development and looks at the trajectory for mobile gaming revenues to get a sense of how spending on VR content might develop. The report also lays out what types of content users and developers can expect on VR platforms, including gaming, video entertainment, and advertising. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: VR headset manufacturers are driving both the development and distribution of VR content by investing significant technical and monetary resources in developers, in an effort to build up an exclusive content library. High demand for VR headsets by mobile and console gamers will fuel demand for VR content. The VR content market will take an increasing portion of the mobile gaming software industry. Beyond gaming, VR video entertainment will remain short form until demand for VR headsets increases. Ads featured on VR headsets will likely have higher view-through rates than standard video ad spots. Other industries are also beginning to experiment with VR content. Travel companies, publishers, e-commerce merchants, and social platforms are beginning to see potential in this new category. VR content faces major hurdles that could keep developers from investing: The VR experience must be good enough for people to take up the devices. In addition, developers need to know that a sufficient user base exists to be worthy of the resource investment in VR content. \nIn full, the report: Provides a breakdown of each type of VR headset, what platforms they run on, and how content will differ for each. Includes estimates for global VR headset shipments by category. Includes a mobile gaming forecast to give a sense of the most important market that will drive spending on VR content in the next five years. Lays out what other industries are developing VR programs. Discusses some of the potential barriers that could dissuade developers from investing in VR content. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the VR universe, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "Apple's App Store Has a Counterfeit Problem Lindsay Gloor , Stephanie Liebergen 8:56   \nBefore you try to do your holiday shopping with an iPhone app, make sure that app is the real deal. \nApple removed hundreds of fake retail and product apps from its App Store last week after The New York Times and the New York Post started asking about the counterfeit apps. \nThe counterfeiters ranged from retail chains like Dollar Tree to big department stores like Nordstrom to even designer brands like Christian Dior. \nWhile some only offered endless pop-up ads, others asked users to enter credit card details or contained malware that could steal personal information. \nSEE MORE: Apple Says It Killed The Headphone Jack Out Of 'Courage' \nSecurity experts told The New York Times that most fake apps are created in China and somehow manage to slip through Apple's review process. In the past, the tech-giant's review process has been criticized for being too tough on app developers, but it seems something might have changed. Earlier this year, an Apple official said in an interview that half of all apps are now approved within 24 hours and 90 percent are approved within 48 hours. \nOne Apple spokesperson responded to the issue in a statement , saying \"We ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk. \nDespite efforts to remove them, new imitation apps continue to appear. Developers might change their app's content after it has been approved or resubmit similar products after fakes have been uncovered. \nApple allows users to report suspicious apps. Fake apps tend to have no reviews and no history of previous versions, and often, their menus don't make sense or use poor English.  ",

      "text": "Google and Apple’s AI-driven digital assistants may have some competition with a new device from Samsung next year.\nSamsung just revealed plans to include its own AI personal assistant in the soon-to-be-announced Galaxy S8 smartphone at recent press event.\nThe artificial intelligence will come from an open AI platform created by part of the team originally responsible for Apple’s Siri.\nSamsung recently acquired the open AI platform company, Viv Labs, and plans to incorporate the AI into not just future versions of the Galaxy line of phones, but also Samsung’s broader range of IoT devices.\nGoogle also recently launched its AI-powered Google Assistant , which is built into Google’s new smartphone and smart home hub. The search powerhouse said it plans to continue to develop new hardware with its AI assistant at the core.\nSamsung, on the other hand, currently has a larger established base of connected products across connected home, appliances, and consumer electronics. The plan is for the new artificial intelligence assistant to integrate across those many connected devices within Samsung’s ecosystem, which is the primary reason the team at Viv decided to work specifically with Samsung, detailed in a press conference.\nOther voice-driven digital assistants have been in the market for a while, however. Amazon’s Alexa-enabled Echo smart home speakers connect consumers with other smart products in their homes and third-party services elsewhere.\nIn Samsung’s case, the Viv Labs open AI platform appears to somewhat invert the model.\nThe idea is that the AI platform would be embedded into the devices for the end-user and then third-party brands can build their services around that platform, which could then be seamlessly added to the list of feature sets within that connected product, without any need to additional apps or setups on the end-user’s side.\nHowever, this new breed of natively integrated AI-assistants in the products and services themselves seems to be the direction the major players want to push the market.",

      "text": "Apple patents AR maps solution Apple patents AR maps solution Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Rumors have been going around that Apple is looking into AR and VR solutions for quite some time now. And we've already seen some patents that back these statements up. The latest one, however, might be among the more interesting.Just today Apple was granted a patent for “Augmented reality maps”. According to the patent description, Apple is looking into using AR for navigational purposes. For example, a user would be able to select a nearby point of interest, or search it on the web, and get the route displayed on top of a live video feed from a smartphone's camera or similar video capturing device. The system will automatically detect the device's orientation, tilt, field of view and GPS location and will be able to point the user in the right direction. For example, if you're facing south, but your route is to the north, an indicator would appear on the screen to let you know you have to turn around.Unlike regular GPS solutions, users won't have to rely on bird-view maps only. In fact, if the presented drawings are something to go by, the route would be drawn on the video feed as a line, going down the street, turning around corners and so on.The drawings associated with the patent also show that the technology will be able to overlay street names and addresses over the live video feed. So, if it works as it claims, you'll be able to point your camera at a random house and get its street address right there, on your smartphone's screen.The search bar is also shown directly on top of the live feed, which will address an issue described in the patent – users won't have to rely on separate apps for navigation, POI search and AR guidance. All of this will be packed in one neat little package and displayed right there, on top of what your camera sensor picks up.With Apple being rumored to scale their self-driving car project down to car accessories and related tech, the solution could pave the way for a new generation of car navigation. Especially with more cameras being fitted onto newer car models, this AR patent could prove to be a pretty good driving companion, if you're not sure where you're going.

      "text": "  Apple News Advertising will be outsourced to NBCUniversal in 2017 November 8,   \nApple is going to outsource all of their Apple News advertisements to NBCUniversal in early 2017. This deal was done because Apple shuttered their iAd network in June and they do not have a dedicated advertising unit anymore. \nApple News launched last year in the US and the United Kingdom. They currently have over 70 million subscribers and major news organizations such The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, will still be able to sell their own ads and keep all of the revenue, but now NBCUniversal, rather than Apple, will sell the extra inventory. \nNBCUniversal would not say how the revenue would be split for the ads it sells against other publishers’ content; in the past, publishers would get 70% of the revenue with the other 30% going to Apple. \nMany news organizations are finding that Apple News is the catalyst for driving page views to their online publications. CNN’s chief product officer, Alex Wellen, told the Nieman Lab that the network’s Apple News content got more than 36 million unique readers in September, which is more than seven times what it got the month before that. The company’s page views also jumped to almost 275 million from just 43 million. Bloomberg also says its traffic from Apple News has led to a 500% increase in October because more of their articles are appearing in the Apple Top News section.  ",

      "text": "Both OnePlus and Apple are rumored to be working on the next-gen OnePlus 4 and iPhone 8 smartphones, respectively. We compare the rumored specs and features of the impending flagships. ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nOnePlus 4 and the iPhone 8, the successors of two popular flagship smartphones - the OnePlus 3 and the iPhone 7, respectively - are already creating a buzz online. \nFeatures and specs of the two much-awaited smartphones have already started emerging online. We compare the two impending flagship smartphones to give you a peek into what is in store for 2017. Display \nThe OnePlus 4, like its previous iteration, is anticipated to tout a 5.5-inch screen size. The display, said to be an OLED one, will possibly be flexible. The handset is rumored to pack in a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. \nThe iPhone 8 , on the other hand, is rumored to sport a 4.7-inch curved OLED instead of an LCD one. The handset will likely have the same resolution as the iPhone 7, 1,334 x 750 pixels. \nThe bigger screen size, coupled with a better resolution, potentially gives OnePlus 4 brownie points when compared to the iPhone 8. Processor And RAM \nThe OnePlus 4 is rumored to pack in the Snapdragon 830 processor and 8 GB of RAM, which will be an improvement over the OnePlus 3. \nThe iPhone 8 will likely house the next-gen A11 64-bit processor from Apple and 2 GB of RAM like older smartphones, unless the company decides to shake things up a bit. \nThe higher memory capacity would potentially give the OnePlus 4 an edge over the Apple smartphone. Storage \nThe iPhone 7 is available in 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB internal storage options, but has no option to expand the memory further. The iPhone 8 is expected to take the same route and it is unlikely that Apple will introduce a memory card slot. \nThe OnePlus 3 comes in 32 GB and 64 GB storage options, of which only the latter is available in the United States. The OnePlus 4 could improve on this and be made available in 32 GB and 64 GB options in the United States as well. OnePlus is also rumored to be bringing the 128 GB option for the OnePlus 4. \nMoreover, the company is anticipated to introduce an expandable memory option in the OnePlus 4, which will allow additional 256 GB storage via a microSD card. \nIf OnePlus introduces the memory slot, then the OnePlus 4 would have an advantage over the iPhone 8 and effectively offer a higher storage space. Camera \nThe iPhone 7 boasts a 12-megapixel primary and 7-megapixel selfie camera, and the iPhone 8 will likely take the same route. \nThe OnePlus 4, on the other hand, is rumored to rock a 23-megapixel or 21-megapixel front-facing camera, as well as a 16-megapixel or 12-megapixel selfie one. It could have a dual-camera setup per rumors. Battery \nOnePlus 4 is rumored to sport a 3,500 mAh or 4,000 mAh battery. The battery capacity of the iPhone 8 is not known. Operating System \nThe OnePlus 4 is rumored to come with its Oxygen OS with Android Nougat out of the box. The iPhone 8 is anticipated to come pre-loaded with iOS 11. \nHowever, OnePlus is expected to tweak the OS and add few more elements to the Android OS to offer users a better experience. Additional Features \nSince the iPhone 8 will be the 10th anniversary edition of the handset, it is expected to house some groundbreaking features. Apple is rumored to be working on an iris scanner for the iPhone 8. The company could also introduce a 3D camera and may completely do away with the physical buttons and have a Touch ID display instead. It may also have wireless charging support. \nThe OnePlus 4 is anticipated to offer features that can take advantage of the VR Loop technology. OnePlus is also rumored to bring back the Sandstone color option with the OnePlus 4. Release \nBoth the smartphones are expected to be released in the second half of 2017. © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

      "text": "Report: Apple acquired technology, employees from streaming music startup By Dan Pye ● 23 minutes ago \nWhen streaming music startup Omnifone went bankrupt this summer, Apple acquired some of the company’s technology and at least 16 of its employees, TechCrunch reports. Apple was initially rumored to be acquiring Omnifone in June, and 16 of the company’s London-based employees have since changed their LinkedIn status to show they’re now working at Apple. Omniphone still owns over 50 patents related to streaming, downloading and digital media identification, but it’s unclear how many of those — if any — Apple has acquired. A source claims some of that technology found its way into Apple Music and iTunes, and the employees who joined Apple from Omnifone include engineers now working in iTunes and apps. Apple declined to comment on the story.",

The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States.\n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels.\n\n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche)",

      "text": "BI Intelligence \n\nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing  subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple is still searching for another successful product that can diversify its revenues, since its profits still rely largely on iPhone sales.\nRecent comments from CEO Tim Cook indicate that Apple may be exploring augmented reality (AR) as the next product that could help it succeed in that goal, Business Insider reported . \nCook, speaking at an event last month, said that he expects AR to eventually become a part of people’s everyday lives, “like eating three square meals a day.” This outlook is consistent with the results of a recent survey by Yeti in which respondents indicated higher levels of long-term optimism for AR than for VR.\nCook also predicted that AR would come to operating systems (like iOS) in the “not-too-distant future,” although he acknowledged that there are still may technological challenges that must be overcome first. Those challenges, Business Insider noted, include:\nBuilding AR capabilities into the cameras of iOS devices and the operating systems, so the camera can identify objects in its view, a key first step to enabling AR. Adding hardware like 3D sensors to iOS devices. Apple bought Primesense, which builds similar hardware, back in 2013. Providing a platform for developers to build AR apps on top of Apple’s AR hardware and software. Building an AR-specific product, like an AR headset or glasses that can leverage the AR capabilities in iOS devices. Apple’s already experimented with AR capabilities in the iPhone, including a feature for Apple Maps that provides an AR view of local listings. However, the first sign that Apple is really serious about AR would be when it starts adding AR hardware and software to a new generation of the iPhone. If it finds that AR is a successful selling point for a new iPhone model, it would incentivize the company to accelerate efforts to build an AR-specific product like a headset.\nThe tech industry has promoted the prospect of VR for the past few decades. But only now, with headsets backed by big names like Sony and Facebook, is VR finally becoming a concrete product with mass market potential. While VR technology is largely associated with the gaming industry, the platform offers a new set of content opportunities in entertainment, advertising, and more.\nBut where is it all going?\nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on virtual reality content that examines how various VR headset categories will shape VR content development and looks at the trajectory for mobile gaming revenues to get a sense of how spending on VR content might develop. The report also lays out what types of content users and developers can expect on VR platforms, including gaming, video entertainment, and advertising.\nHere are some key takeaways from the report: \nVR headset manufacturers are driving both the development and distribution of VR content by investing significant technical and monetary resources in developers, in an effort to build up an exclusive content library. High demand for VR headsets by mobile and console gamers will fuel demand for VR content. The VR content market will take an increasing portion of the mobile gaming software industry. Beyond gaming, VR video entertainment will remain short form until demand for VR headsets increases. Ads featured on VR headsets will likely have higher view-through rates than standard video ad spots. Other industries are also beginning to experiment with VR content. Travel companies, publishers, e-commerce merchants, and social platforms are beginning to see potential in this new category. VR content faces major hurdles that could keep developers from investing: The VR experience must be good enough for people to take up the devices. In addition, developers need to know that a sufficient user base exists to be worthy of the resource investment in VR content. In full, the report: \nProvides a breakdown of each type of VR headset, what platforms they run on, and how content will differ for each. Includes estimates for global VR headset shipments by category. Includes a mobile gaming forecast to give a sense of the most important market that will drive spending on VR content in the next five years. Lays out what other industries are developing VR programs. Discusses some of the potential barriers that could dissuade developers from investing in VR content.

      "text": "Google and Apple’s AI-driven digital assistants may have some competition with a new device from Samsung next year.\nSamsung just revealed plans to include its own AI personal assistant in the soon-to-be-announced Galaxy S8 smartphone at recent press event.\nThe artificial intelligence will come from an open AI platform created by part of the team originally responsible for Apple’s Siri.\nSamsung recently acquired the open AI platform company, Viv Labs, and plans to incorporate the AI into not just future versions of the Galaxy line of phones, but also Samsung’s broader range of IoT devices.\nGoogle also recently launched its AI-powered Google Assistant , which is built into Google’s new smartphone and smart home hub. The search powerhouse said it plans to continue to develop new hardware with its AI assistant at the core.\nSamsung, on the other hand, currently has a larger established base of connected products across connected home, appliances, and consumer electronics. The plan is for the new artificial intelligence assistant to integrate across those many connected devices within Samsung’s ecosystem, which is the primary reason the team at Viv decided to work specifically with Samsung, detailed in a press conference.\nOther voice-driven digital assistants have been in the market for a while, however. Amazon’s Alexa-enabled Echo smart home speakers connect consumers with other smart products in their homes and third-party services elsewhere.\nIn Samsung’s case, the Viv Labs open AI platform appears to somewhat invert the model.\nThe idea is that the AI platform would be embedded into the devices for the end-user and then third-party brands can build their services around that platform, which could then be seamlessly added to the list of feature sets within that connected product, without any need to additional apps or setups on the end-user’s side.\nHowever, this new breed of natively integrated AI-assistants in the products and services themselves seems to be the direction the major players want to push the market.",

To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple is still searching for another successful product that can diversify its revenues, since its profits still rely largely on iPhone sales. \nRecent comments from CEO Tim Cook indicate that Apple may be exploring augmented reality (AR) as the next product that could help it succeed in that goal, Business Insider reported . \nCook, speaking at an event last month, said that he expects AR to eventually become a part of people’s everyday lives, “like eating three square meals a day.” This outlook is consistent with the results of a recent survey by Yeti in which respondents indicated higher levels of long-term optimism for AR than for VR. \nCook also predicted that AR would come to operating systems (like iOS) in the “not-too-distant future,” although he acknowledged that there are still may technological challenges that must be overcome first. Those challenges, Business Insider noted, include: Building AR capabilities into the cameras of iOS devices and the operating systems, so the camera can identify objects in its view, a key first step to enabling AR. Adding hardware like 3D sensors to iOS devices. Apple bought Primesense, which builds similar hardware, back in 2013. Providing a platform for developers to build AR apps on top of Apple’s AR hardware and software. Building an AR-specific product, like an AR headset or glasses that can leverage the AR capabilities in iOS devices. \nApple’s already experimented with AR capabilities in the iPhone, including a feature for Apple Maps that provides an AR view of local listings. However, the first sign that Apple is really serious about AR would be when it starts adding AR hardware and software to a new generation of the iPhone. If it finds that AR is a successful selling point for a new iPhone model, it would incentivize the company to accelerate efforts to build an AR-specific product like a headset. \nThe tech industry has promoted the prospect of VR for the past few decades. But only now, with headsets backed by big names like Sony and Facebook, is VR finally becoming a concrete product with mass market potential. While VR technology is largely associated with the gaming industry, the platform offers a new set of content opportunities in entertainment, advertising, and more. \nBut where is it all going? \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on virtual reality content that examines how various VR headset categories will shape VR content development and looks at the trajectory for mobile gaming revenues to get a sense of how spending on VR content might develop. The report also lays out what types of content users and developers can expect on VR platforms, including gaming, video entertainment, and advertising. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: VR headset manufacturers are driving both the development and distribution of VR content by investing significant technical and monetary resources in developers, in an effort to build up an exclusive content library. High demand for VR headsets by mobile and console gamers will fuel demand for VR content. The VR content market will take an increasing portion of the mobile gaming software industry. Beyond gaming, VR video entertainment will remain short form until demand for VR headsets increases. Ads featured on VR headsets will likely have higher view-through rates than standard video ad spots. Other industries are also beginning to experiment with VR content. Travel companies, publishers, e-commerce merchants, and social platforms are beginning to see potential in this new category. VR content faces major hurdles that could keep developers from investing: The VR experience must be good enough for people to take up the devices. In addition, developers need to know that a sufficient user base exists to be worthy of the resource investment in VR content. \nIn full, the report: Provides a breakdown of each type of VR headset, what platforms they run on, and how content will differ for each. Includes estimates for global VR headset shipments by category. Includes a mobile gaming forecast to give a sense of the most important market that will drive spending on VR content in the next five years. Lays out what other industries are developing VR programs. Discusses some of the potential barriers that could dissuade developers from investing in VR content. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the VR universe, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pedestrians walk by the new flagship Apple Store on May 19, 2016 in San Francisco.Â \nApple recently acquired both talent and technology from defunct cloud-based music platform Omnifone. According to a TechCrunch report , at least 16 employees from Omnifone began working for Apple starting in August, with most new hires on LinkedIn listed as software engineers and engineering managers working on iTunes and other apps. \nApple confirmed with Billboard that \"some\" former Omnifone employees are now working for the company, but did not go into head count. Apple also did not comment on reports that it purchased tech assets from Omnifone, a subject of speculation since July, when it was reported that the London-based company had found a buyer for some of its parts. \nFounded in 2003, Omnifone provided licensing and backend services for a variety of cloud-based digital music services, including Neil Young 's Pono, before entering administration in May 2016 after determining it could not meet its debt liabilities. At the time of administration, Omnifone’s parent company said it had £1,418 in cash at bank, and was owed over £21.6 million in intercompany debts by its subsidiaries.",

      "text": "DUBLIN, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple , Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday.\nIreland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid.\nDublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States.\n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels.

The market watchers pointed out that the keyboard is rather difficult to build and its original Singapore-based supplier was having difficulties meeting Apple's demand prompting Apple to shift orders to Wistron, the paper noted. Sources say the delay in launching the MacBook Pro was partly due to low yields and as yields improve shipments are picking up.To learn more about the Touch Bar, click here .",

      "text": "Jason Calacanis Says Apple CEO Tim Cook's Lack of Vision and Incompetence is Killing the Company [Video] LIKE MORE Posted 2 hours ago by iClarified · 1843 views · Translate Jason Calacanis, an Internet entrepreneur, accuses Apple CEO Tim Cook of being incompetent and 'killing this company' on the latest This Week in Tech episode.Calacanis blames Cook's lack of vision for a disappointing refresh of the MacBook Pro and suggests it may be time for Cook to step down. If you put the person in charge of logistics in charge of Apple, which they did, it's fine, the ships and the trains, everything is going to run on time but the product is going to suffer. They need a product visionary in there to understand that getting rid of the phone jack and then forcing people to make a decision if they want to charge their phone or make a phone call is incompetence. Then to take the MagSafe connector, which Steve Jobs is like this is so important the MagSafe because your computer is not going to go flying across the room, and everybody's like oh my god hallelujah this MagSafe is so genius, and to take that innovation that they're known for and throw it away, and put USB-C, put four USB-Cs, and then take out another loved feature, the HDMI that plugs right in, knowing that people who are in the video business and developers love that, it wreaks of some level of incompetence that could only happen when you put somebody as boring and visionless as Tim Cook in charge of a company with a legacy and a passionate user base like Apple. It's a disaster right now. If they start losing Mac video editors and Mac artists to this new Surface thing. That is horrible. We have to talk about when is Tim Cook is getting out of that chair because he is killing this company. I mean I know they have a ton of money but he has to get out because Jony Ive's phoning in.

      "text": "One of the best new features of Apple's brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is the water-resistance. Apple says the phones can easily withstand a spill, a splash or even a quick dunk, and we've seen them take some underwater photos as well and emerge unscathed. They're still just \"water-resistant,\" however, which is a far cry from being \"waterproof.\"\nIf you have an older iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus and you want a simple way to make your phone not just water-resistant but actually waterproof, the Cos2be Waterproof Phone 6s Case is just what the doctor ordered. It features a very sleek design unlike all those waterproof cases that are basically just big plastic bags, and it's less than $20 on Amazon.\n(more…) \nTrending right now: \nEvidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more The new MacBook Pro is selling much better than you thought ",

      "text": "Ireland to formally submit appeal on Apple case this week Reuters Reuters Photo: \nDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday. \nIreland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. \nDublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels. \n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche) Related Links",

      "text": "One of the best new features of Apple's brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is the water-resistance. Apple says the phones can easily withstand a spill, a splash or even a quick dunk, and we've seen them take some underwater photos as well and emerge unscathed. They're still just \"water-resistant,\" however, which is a far cry from being \"waterproof.\"\nIf you have an older iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus and you want a simple way to make your phone not just water-resistant but actually waterproof, the Cos2be Waterproof Phone 6s Case is just what the doctor ordered. It features a very sleek design unlike all those waterproof cases that are basically just big plastic bags, and it's less than $20 on Amazon.\nSome key details:\nWATERPROOF + DUSTPROOF: protective TPU case with jelly bumper provides shock absorb, antiscratch, dustproof and antislip protections, not suitable for professional underwater activities SUPER SLIM & TRANSPARENT TPU case: provides comfortable grip, protects your smartphone without obstructing the front and rear cameras, without extra bulk SHOCKPROOF + HEAT DISSIPATION: AIRBAG design on all sides, Withstands drops from 6.6'/2 m to the concrete- meets or exceeds MIL STD 810F-516 IMPORTANT NOTE: Please remove the THIN FILM on the surface of the front case after installation. Please confirm your phone model before purchasing, select size 4.7” for iPhone 6/6S, select 5.5” for iPhone 6/6S Plus. If you don’t know what is your phone model, please use a ruler to measure the diagonal length of your screen (only finger touch part) The Cos2be Waterproof Phone Case is available for the iPhone 6/6s and the iPhone 6/6s Plus , and both models cost just $16.99. It also comes in space gray, silver, gold or rose gold to match your iPhone's color.\nTrending right now:\nEvidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more The new MacBook Pro is selling much better than you thought See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple ‘Aggressive’ In MacBook Pro Orders As Strong Sales Expected   09:10 PST \nApple recently unveiled its revamped MacBook Pro models that feature many improvements, including but not limited to a multitouch Touch Bar that’s a first for its notebooks. It appears that the new notebooks have been selling well because according to a new report, Apple is “aggressive” in ordering new units from its suppliers as it expects strong sales of the new MacBook Pro to continue well into next year. It does seem possible since the company has made us all wait for a very long time for the new MacBook Pro lineup. \nDigiTimes reports , citing sources in the supply chain, that Apple has aggressively been placing orders for the MacBook Pro. It says that Apple is “optimistic” about sales in the holiday quarter and that it expects the new MacBook Pro lineup to perform well next year as well. \nThis is contrary to initial reports which claimed that the new MacBook Pros were not selling as well as the company would have hoped. It was even reported at one point that Apple had actually delayed orders for the MacBook Pro because of low yield rates of some components. The keyboard, battery, and hinges were identified as the parts with low yield rates. \nApparently, things are looking up for the holiday season as millions of people set out to buy new stuff for themselves as well as for their family and friends. The report suggests that MacBook Pro shipments for 2016 will reach 15 million units and that Apple is likely to maintain the same pace in 2017. \nFiled in Apple . Read more about Macbook Pro .

      "text": "Reddit \nOver the summer a report surfaced and was debunked that Apple had acquired Omnifone, a music streaming company that provided Samsung’s defunct Milk Music service used. Today a new report adds that Apple later acquired some technology from Omnifone, which went bankrupt in May, and hired some ex-employees, but stopped short of a full acquisition. \nTechCrunch reports that “there was some technology picked up” by Apple from Omnifone following the streaming music company’s bankruptcy early this year, although there are no specifics. \nOmnifone is described as an “independent provider of cloud-based unlimited music services to consumer electronics vendors” so the idea is that some underlying technology was purchased that could be used to improve Apple Music. \nThe new report also adds that several Omnifone employees now work at Apple: \nApple hired at least 16 employees and purchased select technology from Omnifone, an early player in streaming music services that filed for bankruptcy this summer. \nWhile Apple seems to have stopped short of fully acquiring Omnifone, its Apple Music streaming service is based on the acquisition of Beats Music . \nRecent known Apple acquisitions have mostly been around artificial intelligence and machine learning; Apple recently denied earlier reports that it was interested in buying Jay-Z’s Tidal music service. \nAs for Apple Music, the company recently announced that the service is up to 17 million paid subscribers so far. Apple Music got a major redesign with iOS 10 back in September, and a rumored price drop could see its $10/month rate drop down to $8/month. Guides",

      "text": "Tim Jonze \nOnce, Apple ads told us that PCs were for dorks. But now its own products are overpriced, dongle-tangled and everywhere. Perhaps it’s time to reopen Windows? The Apple/Peep Show ads were smug and annoying and made you realise Apple didn’t understand Peep Show. Photograph: Apple Contact author   17.07   17.18   \nA bout a decade ago, Apple ran a series of adverts featuring the comedians Mitchell and Webb , designed to highlight the difference between Macs and PCs. They didn’t bother explaining what the spec differences were, or even showing you pictures of the products they were advertising (Alan Sugar would have fired the bladdy useless lot of ’em on the spot). Instead, Apple’s whole purpose was to point out how much cooler their computers were compared with PCs. \nOn the left, David Mitchell was in full Mark Corrigan-mode as the PC, wearing a brown suit and explaining how family holidays are best represented in pie-chart form. On the right, Robert Webb slouched around with his hands in his jeans, breezily explaining how effortlessly creative he was as a Mac. It wasn’t a great advert series. It was smug. It was annoying. And it made you realise that Apple didn’t understand Peep Show . (People rooted for Mark, and Jez wasn’t cool. Super Hans using his MacBook to order psilocybin on the dark web would have been cool, although the Advertising Standards Authority might have had something to say about that.) But you accepted their point: PCs were stuffy, out-of-touch, virus-ridden machines suitable only for grey office drones to run spreadsheets on. Your dad had one, and it kept freezing whenever he tried to show you the email he had received saying he was due £5,000 compensation as the victim of a road accident. The Apple experience, on the other hand, was a constant dress-down Friday full of pictures, music and movies. \nThe reason Apple got away with this ad was because they were – undoubtedly – a very cool company. Throughout the 00s, they changed the way we consumed entertainment and shaped the ways in which we interacted with each other. What is more, they did so in the form of nice white curvy things that, compared with the grey/black boxy PCs, made the world seem like a better place (if, by better, you mean a permanent episode of Black Mirror where we would sooner press handheld blocks of plastic than converse with our friends and family). Apple were so cool they had a quasi-spiritual air to them, with feverish launch events and a leader who singlehandedly pioneered normcore. Compared with all this, what did Microsoft have? Clippy, a crudely animated paperclip that was supposed to help you with writing covering letters. \nThe distressing news, then, for people who have spent approximately the economic output of Moldova on Apple products over the past two decades, is that Apple in 2016 no longer seems very cool. In fact it now seems a bit of a mess, as out-of-touch and unfriendly as Mark Corrigan. Its products look increasingly samey or – worse – plain ugly. Its innovations, such as the Touch Bar, look like the kind of thing a toddler might come up with at an hour’s notice (“Put some iPad ... here!” *toddler points to above the number keys on a nearby laptop*). They raised their already-extortionate prices to cash in on Brexit (technically our fault that one, but still). And they seem to be on a mission to make everything as incompatible and user-unfriendly as possible. Currently, Apple are selling a whopping 17 different dongles for all the different bits their devices no longer serve properly. Meanwhile, their compatibility is a car-crash example of capitalism gone rogue: even the iPhone’s new standard Lightning headphones won’t connect to Apple’s latest line of laptops without an adaptor . It all points to a grand strategy whereby come 2036 you won’t be able to type at all without special gloves that have to be individually purchased to fit each finger, and then will only allow you to spell out the word “plonker”. Where once Apple had an app for things you didn’t imagine were possible, now they have a dongle for things that were perfectly possible before you needed a dongle. \nOh, and on top of all this, they’ve got a CEO called Tim (embarrassing) who wears a fleece and doesn’t seem to think he’s Jesus. It’s all wrong. \nBut if Apple’s cachet is fading, who does that leave us with? Surely not Samsung – its phones literally blow up in your hands . Step forward ... Microsoft and Bill Gates! Once, he was derided as a squeaky-voiced billionaire who couldn’t possibly be as cool as that guy who tucked his roll-neck shirt into stonewashed dad jeans (weird times, looking back now). These days, Microsoft’s co-founder is doing some pretty cool stuff . Such as pouring his billions into philanthropic projects fighting malaria in Africa. And helping to eradicate poverty. Of course, ending life-threatening disease is only technically cool if you can make nice, shiny computers on the side, but Microsoft seems to be sorting that side of things out too. A recent launch event saw it turning its attention to the world’s “creatives” – tempting designers and musicians to cross the bridges and start taking a Surface Pro to their nearest organic coffee store. Is such a shift really possible? It could be. After all, even Clippy seems to have harnessed his valuable retro appeal of late , starring in memes with all the nonchalance of a piece of animated stationery who always knew he was about more than page indentation advice. Have the tables turned? Has Mark finally got the whip hand over Jez? \nThe ball’s in your court, Apple . You were cool once. But now you need to sort out your products and at least try to end measles. Failing that, how about making something we can at least plug a USB stick into?",

      "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday.\nIreland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid.\nDublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States.\n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels.\n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche)",

      "title": "How to install iOS 10.2 beta 2 with no developer account and no computer",
      "text": "Apple on Monday released iOS 10.2 beta 2 , which ended up being an atypically exciting release for a second beta. Each new beta release usually refines features offered in an initial beta release, and obviously fixes any bugs that are uncovered. In the case of iOS 10.2 beta 2, however, Apple fans got their first taste of an entirely new app called simply \"TV.\" Apple unveiled its new TV app last month during its big MacBook Pro event, and the company sees this new app as a major advancement in its entertainment lineup. TV gives users a single hub through which they can browse and search for movies, TV shows and other videos hosted online — as long as they're not on Netflix . Then, selecting a video will automatically open the appropriate app through which it can be streamed.\nTV is a nifty new app and users with iOS 10.2 beta 2 can begin testing it right now. Don't have a developer account to access the beta? Don't worry, because this post will show you how to install iOS 10.2 beta 2 without the need for a developer account or even a computer.\nMUST READ: Hey Apple, why are you trolling us?\nApple often releases developer betas and public betas at the same time after an initial beta release, but iOS 10.2 beta 2 is a different story. Since the new build introduced an entirely new app, Apple likely wanted to wait an extra day for the public release in order to ensure that there are no major bugs. Of course, that won't stop non-developers from wanting to check out the new TV app as soon as possible, and we've got you covered.\nAs he often does, YouTube user iCrackUriDevice has put together a video showing exactly how to install iOS 10.2 beta 2 without a developer account. In fact, you won't even need to connect your iPhone or iPad to a computer. Instead, all you need to do is install Apple's developer beta profile (which can be found through this post ) and the new iOS update will become available as an over the air (OTA) update.\nThe video also goes through more of the new features included in iOS 10.2 beta 2, including all those hot new emoji that came along with Unicode 9.0 support. You'll find a rundown of everything new in iOS 10.2 beta 2 beginning just before the 7:30 mark, and instructions on how to install iOS 10.2 beta 2 begin at about 10:00.\nTrending right now:\nHey Apple, why are you trolling us?

      "text": "Apple has hired at least 16 employees and purchased technology from bankrupt British startup Omnifone, TechCrunch reported on Monday.\nThe obvious use for the ex-Omnifone talent and technology would be to make Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music, more reliable and better. \nOmnifone was founded in 2003 and previously provided cloud tools to companies that wanted to do online music streaming, and even administered online music subscriptions for companies like Sony and BlackBerry. \nThe technology and expertise could help Apple as it tries to catch up in the streaming music business, which is currently dominated by Spotify.\nDeal or no deal? To be clear, Apple has not confirmed that it purchased Omnifone, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this summer. \nIt's possible that Apple purchased technology and hired Omnifone's staff without purchasing the company's outstanding debts and client obligations. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. \nA report from Omnifone's bankruptcy administrators from earlier this summer had previously suggested that Omnifone had found a buyer for parts of the company for $10 million, TechCrunch reported. \nApple CEO Tim Cook said the company had completed four acquisitions in the quarter from July to September  during Apple's most recent earnings call . \nApple usually does not announce its acquisitions, but when news outlets learn about an acquisition Apple usually provides the following statement, which essentially confirms the deal:  \" Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.\" \nIn July, an Apple spokesperson pointed out to Business Insider that in the matter of Omnifone the company had not given its standard statement for confirming acquisitions.\nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n",

      "text": "0 0 \nCortana is Microsoft’s direct response to Apple’s now iconic voice assistant Siri. The main function of Cortana is that of a voice assistant that helps you complete different tasks, while both providing and soaking up information transmitted verbally. \nIn a recent discovery, it seems that Microsoft have been pushing a patent that intends to make Cortana behave more like a human being, in the way that she greets users across all used platforms. The main issue to Cortana as she is currently, according to Microsoft, is that she isn’t greeting users as a human being would, and that they are trying to fix that. If you had a real life assistant, they wouldn’t greet you with the same exact phrase twice or three times in a day, so if Cortana is to be more realistic, she shouldn’t either. \nThe way Microsoft intends to fix this is by having Cortana soak up personal information and get more accustomed to your preferences, based on your emails, calendar appointments, messages and so on, and personalize each greeting accordingly. An example of this would be that Cortana will greet you by saying “happy birthday” the first time she greets you on your birthday, while secondary encounters will be greeted with something different like “I hope your day is going well”. Cortana will also implement things like sports or weather in her greetings, according to what you like. Cortana will be able to combine greetings as well, taking two different personalized greetings and turning them into a grander, more unique one. \nThe patent is apparently from back in April, but there is no word yet regarding the implementation to live of this update. The feature branches out, requiring compatibility between platforms and tweaking so that Cortana doesn’t sabotage her mobile counterpart or vice versa. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "– A + Filing suggests Apple investing big in OLED supply, increasing capital expenditure By Mike Wuerthele \nTuesday, November 08, 2016, 08:59 am PT (11:59 am ET) \nAn investment firm has delved deeply into Apple's most recent Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing, and sees purchase orders extending over one year in duration which suggests to them that Apple is in the middle of a big OLED buy from Samsung —the main supplier of the technology.\n\n\n\n\nJ.P. Morgan has noted that Apple has placed a purchase order with more than a year duration for the first time, and totals around $4 billion. It coincides with an \"off-balance sheet obligation\" for the same amount from the third quarter, which the analysts believe is related to long-term OLED sourcing from Samsung for a potential future iPhone.\n\nThe order may be related to a change that Apple made in its risk related to component acquisition statement, adding that in addition to needing mass quantities of parts, it may have trouble acquiring troublesome components \"on commercially reasonable terms.\" OLED technology is finicky to produce, with even minor impurities causing the loss of an entire batch of screens, and rising costs for purchasers.\n\nSamsung may not be the only source of the technology. Earlier this year, the Sharp CEO made remarks that Apple was shifting to the technology away from LTPS, and iPhone screen supplier Japan Display was seeking loans to shift to OLED production.\n\nRumors have pegged an OLED iPhone to a high-end model in 2017 , the 2018 release , or possibly wait until 2019 .\n\nApple currently uses OLED screens in the Apple Watch, and for the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro .\n\nIn other tidbits gleaned from the 10-K filing by J.P. Morgan, Apple's employee count at the end of the fiscal year was over 116,000 employees, up 6,000 year-over-year. Fiscal year 2015 saw an increase in headcount of about 17,500 people.\n\nApple is also slated to spend $16 billion in capital expenditure, up from a previous estimate of $13 billion.",

      "text": "0 Shares \nWith its latest iPhones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple introduced a new colour option that was exclusive only to those willing to pay more for a device with higher storage capacity, Jet Black. The new colour option turned out to be a hit with consumers just as other colour options the company had introduced to the iPhone in previous years, Space Gray and Rose Gold, had. \nThis even without factoring in the prior warning the company had given customers about the Jet Black iPhone 7 being prone to getting smudges all over and not entertaining even the remotest of scratches. \nNow there is talk of Apple wanting to do the same again only that this time round things will be a bit lighter. A Jet White iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus anyone? \nJapanese blog Mac Otakara , citing unnamed Apple suppliers, says that a “pure white” variant of the iPhone 7 may be on its way. It is not immediately clear if the said iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Jet White model will also be available in lower storage configuration (32GB). \nWhile Apple does not have such a history of introducing new colour options for devices mid-cycle as other companies like Samsung (and recently Huawei too) do, this has been a year of firsts for the Cupertino-based smartphone giant and we may not be surprised if it happens. But there’s always a “but” in everything and only time will tell. Shares",

      "text": "Apple on Monday released iOS 10.2 beta 2, a freshened up version of its initial iOS 10.2 beta that had been released just one week earlier on Halloween day. The releases were a bit closer than usual, but Apple was apparently eager to get the new build into developers' hands. Why the rush? iOS 10.2 beta 2 is about much more than just bug fixes — it's the first version of Apple's iOS 10.2 software that includes the brand new \"TV\" app that Apple showed off on stage during its big MacBook Pro event in late October. Now, following a successful rollout to developers on Monday, iOS 10.2 public beta 2 has been released, giving the public the opportunity to begin testing TV.\n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nEvidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more Donald Trump’s son just broke the law while voting ",

      "text": "Loading... Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro Apple and Microsoft both announced new notebooks designed to appeal to business and consumers alike. Is the new MacBook Pro or Surface Book right for you? Let's See How the Screen Sizes Measure Up One of the first things to consider before buying a MacBook Pro or Surface Book is screen size. The MacBook Pro ships in both 13-inch and 15-inch varieties. The Surface Book with Performance Base has a 13.5-inch screen. Anyone looking for a larger screen will need to choose Apple's option. Both computers, though, feature outstanding display clarity and quality. Check Out the Processor Options On performance, Microsoft's Surface Book with Performance Base has a slight edge. The device ships with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor and support for a higher-end graphics chip in the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M. Depending on the version customers pick, the lower-end MacBook Pro models come with an Intel Core i5 chip, while bigger models have Intel Core i7 processors. On the graphics side, Apple offers up to an AMD Radeon 455. Both options top out at 16GB of RAM. The Surface Book Has a Touch Screen If a touch screen is important, the Surface Book with Performance Base is the best option. Apple has decided against a touch screen in the MacBook Pro, saying it doesn't fit well with a notebook. Microsoft, however, believes it's a must-have. Customers ultimately will determine which company is right. The MacBook Pro Has the Touch Bar While the MacBook Pro doesn't have a touch screen, it does have what Apple calls the Touch Bar. The component is a multitouch strip that sits above the keyboard and gives users access to software controls. Apple has opened the Touch Bar to third-party developers to ensure apps come with the software functions users want. Depending on its developer support, the Touch Bar could be either a gimmick or the MacBook Pro's secret weapon. Choose Between a Pure Notebook and a Hybrid PC Customers ultimately will need to decide whether a hybrid is important to them when choosing between the two computers. Apple's MacBook Pro is a standard notebook with a clamshell design. The Surface Book comes with a hinge that allows it to be used as both a notebook and a tablet. The difference is an important one that shouldn't be overlooked. The Surface Book Supports a Stylus Unlike the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book supports a stylus. Using the Microsoft Surface Pen, users can draw on the screen, sign documents and perform other creative actions. Since Apple's computer doesn't support a stylus or any touch input, for that matter, creative professionals might find a more suitable option in Microsoft's computer. Big Battery Life Could Be a Decisive Factor Apple promises 10 hours of battery life in the MacBook Pro, delivering solid mixed-use performance during the day. However, Microsoft is the clear winner here, offering up to 16 hours of battery life. While mileage may vary depending on how the computers are used, the Surface Book is the best option for anyone needing a bit more battery life to get through the day. Neither Model Is Over-Equipped With Ports Neither the MacBook Pro nor the Surface Book with Performance Base is a real winner when it comes to port support. Apple's MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. The Surface Book ships with two USB 3.0 ports, an SD Card reader, a headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort. Which computer wins depends on the accessories owners want to plug into their machine. Software Compatibility Considerations The Surface Book runs Windows 10 Pro, which is compatible with numerous applications of every description for consumers and business users. It also includes some important security enhancements. The MacBook Pro runs on macOS Sierra, which also works with a huge stock of existing applications. While Apple has done a fine job of adding more support for third-party applications, Windows is still the platform most developers design their apps for first. It All Comes Back to Pricing Inevitably, some customers will choose their computer based on price. However, neither option is cheap. The Surface Book with Performance Base starts at $2,399 and goes up to $3,299 for the highest-end option. Apple's Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 for the 13-inch model and tops out at $2,799 for the highest-end version. Customizations to the machine will push the price higher.",
