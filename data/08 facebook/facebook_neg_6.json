We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1500 people,\" Mendelsohn said in a statement to Mashable .\nThe new office is under construction in Fitzrovia, central London.\nMendelsohn pointed out that the UK is \"home to the company's biggest engineering base outside the US\".\nShe brought as an example the team in Somerset, which developed Aquila, a solar powered unmanned plane that will connect remote area of the world to the internet.\nLondon was also where Workplace, a platform aimed at connecting workers in simpler ways, was launched in October 2016.\nThe moves comes after Google confirmed plans to build a new headquarters in London and create 3,000 jobs in a £1bn investment plan.",

      "text": "Is Facebook part of your holiday marketing plan? \nAre you looking for tips to improve your holiday campaign? \n  10 Facebook tips to widen your visibility and reach during the holiday season . 10 Facebook Marketing Tips for the Holiday Season by Mari Smith   Plan Your Holiday Marketing \nBefore you utilize the power of Facebook, take the time to plan your promos and content. #1: Create a Content Calendar With Key Dates \nLooking to increase holiday sales? Make sure you know the key dates. Note the shopping holidays following Thanksgiving: Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday, as well as Christmas, Chanukah, and other celebrations. \nCreate a word document or spreadsheet, or use a project management tool to keep track of what holidays you want to cover on social media. \nRemember, you can play off of all of the holidays, not just the traditional ones. Consider getting a copy of Chase’s Calendar of Events each year or at least look at the special month holiday celebrations . \nTo really stand out, be the first in your industry to start posting . For example, ecommerce site Nanigans is at the top of my mind, since they were one of the first I saw post this season . Nanigans is one of the first to post regarding the season, making the post more memorable. \nOnce you decide which holidays your company will celebrate and highlight with your content, work backward to ensure timely, relevant content is created, tested, and scheduled . #2: Emphasize Strong Visual Elements in Your Content \nWhen planning your holiday posts, keep in mind that Facebook is a visual platform. Use videos, animated GIFs, and images to grab attention. \nFor example, My Baking Addiction used this image of crumbly mini cherry cheesecakes to stand out in the news feed. It’s a bright visual with an interesting perspective that received more than 4,000 reactions and over 600 shares. In fact, nearly all of their posts are images and videos that make your mouth water. My Baking Addiction used a unique visual to make their holiday post stand out. \nAs it gets closer to the end of the year, users’ news feeds will be bombarded with a lot of holiday content. Facebook recommends using motion to grab attention during the holidays. Use visuals to stand out , catch eyes, and stop your readers’ thumbs. #3: Share Your Brand’s Story \nUse the end of the year as a time for your fans to get to know your business and the people behind it. \nFor instance, the Arlington Club , a restaurant in New York City, highlighted the backstory of Executive Chef Frank Cervantes. This image post featured a photo of the chef and a quote explaining what started him on this career path. Arlington Club uses the end of the year to introduce the people behind the company. \nInvite people into your business’s world. Take the opportunity to share a milestone with your audience, do a series of posts showcasing your employees , or both. \nAustralian fashion retailer Country Road shared its brand story in a visually rich Facebook ad campaign to promote its Holiday 2015 campaign . The campaign proved to be almost five times more effective at driving in-store sales than online sales. Country Road wanted to position itself as the store for holiday gifting to maximize Christmastime sales across its women’s, men’s, children’s, and home ranges. Country Road tells its brand story as part of its Holiday 2015 campaign. \nIt’s all about storytelling, and doing it in a personal way. #4: Connect Emotionally Through Content \nThere’s a reason Facebook added reactions (love, laugh, wow, cry, and angry) to the Like button. People want to express their emotions when a story evokes different feelings. Your business content has to compete with posts from your audience’s friends and family. \nEngage your audience by creating highly relatable, emotional, human-interest content that will tug at people’s heartstrings, draw them in, evoke sentiment, or make them laugh . You want your audience to see a post and think, “Hey, that’s me, too!” \nIberia Airlines created an emotional video ad series featuring Santa Claus handing out presents to families during a flight. The company wanted to develop an internationally engaged community, on the move, reuniting with friends and families scattered across the globe to celebrate with loved ones. The video campaign garnered 4 million views and a reach of 46 million. \nPeople check Facebook to see what’s happening in their friends’ lives. So when you create posts or ads, make sure you’re contributing positively to their day and their Facebook experience. This video campaign by Iberia Airlines connects through the emotion of the holidays. #5: Craft Content for Maximum Shares \nThe goal of any post is to get a lot of engagement since engagement (especially shares) leads to even more comments, likes, and shares. Be intentional with the content you create. \nIdeally, I recommend you craft content that’s worthy of amplifying with paid reach . In other words, whether you choose to put budget into a post or not, each piece of content you publish should pass your “boost-worthy” test. Before publishing, ask yourself these questions : Is this post potentially “thumb-stopping” for my audience? Does it capture their attention sufficiently to want to stop, read/watch, engage, and/or share the post? Is this post in context within the news feed? In other words, while Facebook users’ friends are sharing warm personal stories and fun videos, does this post fit in, yet still stand out? Does it offer educational and/or entertaining content? Does it meet the needs of your audience and their audience? Fans engaged well with this top candy recipes post by Taste of Home. \nTaste of Home knows their audience. Their Top Christmas Candy Recipes post last year exceeded 9,500 shares. Reactions were close to 10,000. Mixing an entertaining element with an emotional connection is a delicious recipe for getting more shares. This will bring even more attention to your business. Leverage Facebook Tools and Features to Deliver Your Message \nOnce you have your key dates and content in mind, use Facebook tools to amplify your message and reach more people. #6: Host Virtual Events via Facebook Live \nWith the growing popularity of Facebook’s Live video broadcast feature, now you can easily host virtual events such as a virtual office party or customer appreciation party via Facebook Live. Create a Facebook event on your business page and invite your friends and fans . Facebook recently started rolling out a new feature that allows you to pre-announce your Live video event and garner an audience ahead of time. \nDuring the event, you can do random giveaways , play games and offer prizes , or both. Other options include a live Q&A, flash sales available only while you’re live, and a treat (discount) for those watching after the fact. \nLifestyle guru Martha Stewart hosted a fun live Holiday Workshop with decorating ideas from The Home Depot using Facebook Live video on her fan page. Martha Stewart shares decorating ideas in this Facebook Live workshop for the holidays. \nOf course, you don’t have to get as fancy as Martha. A simple and sincere Holiday greeting, like Michele Ruiz did here via Facebook Live, can draw in your fans. \nIf you plan to host an in-person holiday party, why not invite fans into your world by broadcasting via Facebook Live video? It will give people a taste of off-the-clock fun at your business. \nFacebook is investing heavily in garnering more awareness and users for its Live video feature, including launching an international ad campaign on television, buses, and billboards. Facebook is also paying celebrities and media outlets to use Live video. So now is the perfect time for you to jump into the world of Live video on Facebook. #7: Create Facebook Offers \nFacebook enables you to create an online or in-store offer to share on your business page . \nClick Offer in your status bar. Next, choose Online or In Store , and then select an option from the Offer Type list , which can be Percent Off; Amount Off; Buy One, Get One; or Free Stuff. The settings available when creating a Facebook offer. \nFor an online offer, include the URL . Then enter the details of your deal. Add a title (up to 50 characters), description (up to 500 characters), and up to five photos . You’ll see a preview for desktop or mobile view as you add information. \nFacebook offers are an easy way to share special bundles, discounts, and incentives with your audience all year long. However, it’s even more relevant during the holidays. #8: Cater to Mobile Audiences With Facebook Ads and Posts \nMost people are on mobile so be sure your ads, posts, and any related landing pages are optimized for it. \nThis fun image post from Target with different Thanksgiving pie options looks great in both the mobile and desktop feeds. It’s a cute post that brings humor to most people’s favorite Turkey Day dessert. This Thanksgiving post by Target shows well on both desktop and mobile feeds. \nMobile ads are important for targeting people shopping on the go. However, they’re also valuable for directing people to your brick-and-mortar business. Use the Local Awareness feature to target audiences when they’re near your business . You can even give them directions to your location right on their phones. \nFacebook ad units that tend to perform well on mobile include video, slideshow, carousel, and canvas. Make sure the web page your audience lands on after clicking your ad is fast-loading and quick and easy to understand. \nRemember, mobile-friendly does not apply only to Facebook ads. Make sure all of your content is designed for people browsing Facebook on their mobile devices. #9: Use Engagement Custom Audiences \nA relatively new type of audience that you can reach with Facebook ads is called engagement custom audiences. These are people who have already shown an interest in you by watching your videos, interacting with one of your other ads, or sharing your website links on Facebook. You can draw engagement custom audiences in further by placing additional paid content in their feeds . Set a custom Facebook audience based on engagement. \nHere are the targeting options currently available for creating engagement custom audiences that you can use for your Facebook holiday ads: \nVideo Views : Create variations of audiences comprised of people who have already viewed one of your videos , whether the video was organic or promoted. Views are at least: 3 seconds, 10 seconds, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%. The longer your video, the less likely people will have watched to the end, so it’s better to select 25%, for example. \nDennis Yu gets even more advanced and granular by targeting people who have watched 3 seconds but not at least 10 seconds; or watched video A and B but not C. You can target any type of ad to these audiences . \nLead Ads : Someone may have looked at your lead ad but didn’t complete the form (enter their email address). Target people who’ve interacted with your lead ad since they’re already familiar with you and have cared enough to click once. Narrow your custom Facebook audience by percentage of video watched. \nCanvas Ads : Similar to lead ads, target people who have interacted with your canvas ad but haven’t taken any action yet. \nLink Sharing : Link targeting is brand new and available to only a limited number of advertisers so far. You’ll be able to create an audience based on people who shared your content on Facebook. If someone has gone to the trouble of sharing your content, they’re likely interested in learning more about what you have to offer. \nAnyone who has interacted with your Facebook content is likely already familiar with you. Target them further through custom audiences, especially the new engagement variables. #10: Retarget Your Website Visitors \nIt can take many touches for a prospective customer to get familiar enough with you to take the next step. People don’t always make a purchase decision on the first visit, so remind them who you are through retargeting. \nYour ad performance and conversion will be much more effective when you use the Facebook pixel and retarget potential customers who already visited your website . In fact, Facebook is now beginning to give priority to ads that are connected to a properly installed Facebook pixel, even including boosted posts. Select View Pixel Code from the Actions menu to view your Facebook Pixel code. \nFirst, ensure you have the Facebook pixel installed on your website. Go to the Pixels section in Ads Manager and select View Pixel Code from the Actions menu. Copy and paste the code to your website . \nAlso, use the Facebook Pixel Helper browser extension to double-check that the pixel is correctly installed and firing properly . The icon on your browser should light up. \nNow you can go into your Ads Manager and create a variety of website custom audiences based on time on site. The choices are most active users: top 5%, top 10%, and top 25%. Create a custom Facebook audience based on website visit data. \nSomeone who spends 2 minutes on your site is a hotter prospect than someone who visited for just 10 seconds. This is a wonderful new feature that Facebook added earlier this year. \nIn Conclusion \nThe period leading up to the holidays is the largest consumer spending time of the year. People buy gifts for others and themselves. Since they don’t always know what they’re looking for, help them. \nUse the holidays as an opportunity to shine a light on your business. When you understand and integrate what Facebook offers in terms of ad tools into your marketing campaign, it can make the difference in having a successful holiday season. \nWhat do you think? How do you use Facebook for your holiday promotions? What are some of your success stories?   comments. 10 Facebook Marketing Tips for the Holiday Season by Mari Smith  ",

And the insults and jokes came from all sides, including the hosts, presenters, and performers.\nCo-hosts Gigi Hadid and Jay Pharoah got things started right away with not-so-great impressions of Melania and Donald Trump.\n\"I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children Sasha and Malia,\" Hadid said through pouted lips and a fake accent, mocking Melania's RNC speech that lifted material from a speech given by Michelle Obama.\nRead more at Foxnews.com→",

      "text": "Close AP Fake news is more than just Facebook's problem -- it's our problem, too. Tips for telling truth from fiction. Filed under Editorials at Connect with Dallas Morning News Editorial Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nYes, Facebook has a problem with fake news. It needs to do crack down on that. \nBut the bigger problem may be the way its users, and that means just about all of us, tend to believe what we want to hear, and share headlines that confirm our biases with our friends. \nWe do so without stopping to ask ourselves whether they are true. Whether we trust the site we are reading. Whether that site, in fact, is even trying to get the news right. \nThey often aren't. These fake news sites have proliferated across Facebook, which has created a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem that that allows them to thrive. \nThat's why Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg needs to take seriously complaints that his company has helped spread disinformation at an alarming rate. \nBut it's worth noting that this same ecosystem has for years dominated the web, where marketers, publishers and many others, from massive companies to solo bloggers, have learned that one way to lure readers is to play to their emotions, confirm their biases, or to shock them. \nFrom cat videos to the classic bait-and-switch headlines that never live up to the content on the other side of the link, users of the Internet are confronted daily with content aimed to manipulate them. \nWhy? Because on the Internet, the bigger the audience, the bigger the payoff. \nBut this election saw this trend accelerate -- and alarmingly. No longer are bad actors on the web content with manipulative headlines. Now they've learned that they can build bigger and bigger audiences if they just make up stories that so outrage or excite audiences that readers don't even bother to ask whether they are true. \nA BuzzFeed News analysis determined that during the final three months of the presidential campaign the top 20 fake stories -- stories that were not just wrong, but made up -- outperformed the top 20 true stories generated by traditional media. \nBy fake, we mean stories published by obscure sites -- often newly created, with hidden or hazy ownership -- that appear to be created solely to generate revenue by publishing the wildest possible falsehoods. \nThat's how so many of us ended up seeing headlines declaring Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump. He never did, of course, but its authors didn't care. \nA site called The Political Insider ran this screaming headline to great results. Nearly 800,000 Facebook users liked, commented or shared the story after reading \"Wikileaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS -- Then Drops Another Bombshell.\" Not true, of course. \nAlso exploding online? A piece by the cleverly named Denver Guardian headlined \"FBI Agent Suspect in Hillary mail Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder Suicide.\" Again, totally false. \nIt wasn't just fake news sites, either. Sometimes hyper-partisan political groups created Facebook pages directly, and then spread false and misleading stories regularly. Most of the fake stories favored Donald Trump or savaged Clinton, but the left also got in on the game, just not as frequently. What both sides had in common is that knew that enough readers wanted so badly to believe a headline like that that they'd share without another thought. \nThat puts the problem on Facebook's shoulders, and on ours. \nSocial media users should recognize that their own credibility -- with their friends, colleagues and others in their networks -- is on the line when they share stories created only to dupe them. \nFor his part, Zuckerberg must recognize that he's created the ecosystem where falsehood flows so freely. Last week, his company and Google each announced new rules limiting fake news sites' ability to advertise. That's a start. \nMeanwhile, the most reliable check will come from users who ask themselves whether they trust the site they are about to recommend to friends before they hit the share button. The above is a screen grab of how Snopes.com handled its conclusions that the Pope Endorses Trump story was fake. A Fake News Checklist \nProfessional purveyors of false news know something about us -- we love to share stories that confirm our biases, often the more extreme the better. Here's what we can do to combat that. \n1. If you don't recognize a site, don't trust it -- not yet. Check it out first. When you share something, it's your credibility on the line. \n2 Even if the site seems legit, don't believe something just because it confirms your suspicions, or appeals to your hopes. Before sharing, check it out on sites like snopes.com or politifact.com \n3. Pro tip for liberals and conservatives alike: If a political story from a site you've never heard of seems too good to be true, it probably is. Again, check it out before sharing. \n4. Don't stop reading sites that you don't know. Seek them out, even. The more established media have no monopoly on important news, valuable perspective. But make any site earn your trust when it comes to facts, before you rely on them. \n5. Save some of the scrutiny you bring to unfamiliar sites for even the most respected of news organizations. Journalists, even good ones, sometimes make mistakes. Sometimes their blinders frame a story in a way that leaves out important angles. Make all journalists -- those whom you agree with and those you don't -- earn your trust when it comes to accuracy, context and fairness. View Comments",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter WICHITA, Kan. (AP) – A Texas woman suspected of faking a pregnancy for months and kidnapping a newborn was a longtime acquaintance of the girl’s mother, who was found shot to death at her Kansas home, authorities said Monday. Yesenia Sesmas, 34, of Dallas, was being held in a Dallas jail on a Kansas warrant, with first-degree murder and kidnapping charges pending. Authorities who are pursuing the charges are seeking to have her extradited back to Kansas. The baby was reunited with family members in Kansas on Saturday. The baby’s mother, 27-year-old Laura Abarca-Nogueda, was found dead at her home Thursday, setting off a search for the missing baby, whose name has been spelled by police both as Sophia or Sofia. The infant was six days old when she was reported missing. Semas had known the baby’s mother for years and had spent some time in Wichita before returning to Texas to live several months ago, Wichita police Lt. Todd Ojile said. She traveled to Wichita to kidnap the baby, he added. The FBI joined in the investigation with 25 agents working on the case, Ojile said. Late Friday night investigators identified a suspect in the case, leading them to a house in Dallas where the baby was found unharmed after a swat team executed a search warrant at 4:30 a.m. Saturday. The baby was inside the home along with Semas. Also living there were Semas’ boyfriend along with the suspect’s son and niece. Police do not believe the others in the home were aware of the woman’s plans, Ojile said. (© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Outlines Projects to Reduce Fake News By Tracy Staedter, Seeker | November 21, 2016 02:25pm ET MORE Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a keynote conference on the opening day of the World Mobile Congress at the Fira Gran Via Complex in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 22, 2016. Credit: David Ramos/Getty Images \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a comment to his home page last night that finally addresses the problem of fake news on his social media site. \"Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway,\" he wrote. \nThe importance of and interest in the topic arose shortly after the election when journalists like New York Magazine's Max Read began faulting social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit for Donald Trump's unexpected win. \"The most obvious way in which Facebook enabled a Trump victory has been its inability (or refusal) to address the problem of hoax or fake news,\" Read wrote. \n\"Fake news is not a problem unique to Facebook, but Facebook's enormous audience, and the mechanisms of distribution on which the site relies — i.e., the emotionally charged activity of sharing, and the show-me-more-like-this feedback loop of the news feed algorithm — makes it the only site to support a genuinely lucrative market in which shady publishers arbitrage traffic by enticing people off of Facebook and onto ad-festooned websites, using stories that are alternately made up, incorrect, exaggerated beyond all relationship to truth, or all three,\" Read wrote. \nIn just the last year, nearly 140 new hoax news sites arose, reported Buzzfeed , including WorldPoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co and USADailyPolitics.com — all, oddly enough, originating from a Macedonian town of Veles. They're not the only websites of their kind. \nRELATED: Is Hypnosis A Complete Hoax? \nOn Nov. 12 Zuckerberg acknowledged the presence of these and other hoax news sites on Facebook, but downplayed their influence, saying \"...more than 99% of what people see on Facebook is authentic.\" \nBut what people see may not influence them as much as what they share. And therein lies the problem of fakery. It likes to go viral, more so than real news. \nAnalysis from BuzzFeed founding editor, Craig Silverman, revealed that the \"... 20 top-performing false election stories from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions and comments on Facebook.\" In the same time period real stories from 19 actual news sources generated a 7,367,000 shares, reactions and comments. \nDozens of other sites have continued to write about the fake new problem, picking away at this post-election wound. Even President Obama called attention to it this past Thursday while visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. He said, \"Because in an age where there's so much active misinformation, and it's packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television, where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we've come to take for granted.\" \nFinally last night at 9:30 pm, after Zuckerberg landed in Lima for the APEC Summit , he posted a response that seemed to take a different tone. \"We've been working on this problem a long time and take this responsibility seriously,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \nHe outlined at least seven areas the company is working on in order to reduce fake news. They are: Stronger detection Make it easier for people to report that a story is fake Third party verification Flagging stories as false Raising the bar for stories that appear in the News Feed Disrupting the economics of fake news with better ad policies (one announced earlier in the week) Getting input form journalists \nHe concluded with, \"Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.\" \nHere's the note in full: \nIn the meantime, don't be fooled by fake news. Always check Snopes.com to confirm that a story is true. And for tips on spotting hoaxes in your feed, check out this public Google Doc from Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass. \nIf it sounds too outrageous to be true, it's probably not. \nOriginally published on Seeker .

      "text": "View this image › ID: 10021882 \nAs midnight approached on November 6, 2012, a newly re-elected Barack Obama tweeted a photo of himself embracing the first lady, with the message “four more years.” The president’s election night tweet went unprecedentedly viral, racking up more than 500,000 retweets within a few hours and capping the most active day in Twitter history. Meanwhile, on Facebook, a network four times Twitter’s size, the same photo had fewer than 100,000 shares — evidence the energy around current events was elsewhere. It was a triumph for Twitter, a rare occasion when the little bird out-sang its big blue brother. At Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, it was an alarm bell ringing loudly in the middle of the night, a call to action. \nFour years later, Facebook couldn’t be more relevant. The platform played a defining role in the 2016 election — but perhaps not for the reason it hoped. In the days after the vote, it’s come under fire for creating an infrastructure that played to confirmation bias and allowed political-meme-makers, sensationalists, and fake news purveyors to thrive — and perhaps even alter the election’s outcome . The company’s influence was so apparent that when CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied that the fake news coursing through its system influenced the election his own employees disputed him. \nAnd while it was likely never the company’s intent to create a system that encouraged people to hear only what they wanted — whether or not it was true — Facebook didn’t get here by accident. It made a huge push over the last four years to be a destination for news, indeed, to be your “perfect personalized newspaper.” Since that Obama tweet, the company retooled its platform, creating a system designed to make it easier to share and promote timely and trending stories and to help them spread rapidly across its network. In the process, Facebook, with its 1.79 billion monthly active users, grew to more than five times the size of Twitter. \nThe promise of tapping into this lightning enticed massive news organizations to go all in on Facebook. But those enhanced sharing and interaction mechanisms, coupled with changing platform dynamics, created a system that catered to reinforcing existing world views. Facebook’s News Feed algorithm prioritizes sharing and time spent reading articles, but in a scroll-through world these measurements are prone to reward material that doesn’t challenge you. This in turn enabled a host of loose-with-the-truth upstarts to use it, at times, even more successfully than mainstream news organizations to go mega-viral. \nEssentially, Facebook built a petri dish for confirmation bias, developing ideal conditions to grow news sources whose mission was to provide people with fodder that backed up their own beliefs. Here’s how it got there. It Starts With The Share \nFacebook’s transformation began almost immediately after the 2012 election. On November 14, 2012, a full eight days after the vote, a TechCrunch headline proclaimed : “Facebook Finally Launches ‘Share’ Button For The Mobile Feed, Its Version Of ‘Retweet.’” \nThe move, seemingly minor at the time, set the table for a behavior shift on Facebook, encouraging people to share quickly and without much thought. That in turn helped all forms of content boom across the network. As the TechCrunch article astutely noted: “When people do use the Share button on the web, they often give their own description of a link. But on mobile where typing is more of a pain, a Share button could encourage people to rapidly re-share link after link.” \nThe mobile share button would help links surpass text and photos as the fastest growing form of content shared on Facebook. This would prove crucial in an unexpected but very important way not long down the road. Fake It ‘Til You Make It \nIt’s no coincidence that Allen Montgomery started National Report , his wildly successful fake news site, only a few months after Facebook added the mobile share button. The California-based satirist watched in a bit of amazement as articles from fringe conservative news sites began booming across Facebook, and decided he wanted in on the action. “I was seeing those sorts of sites all over the place with large followings and they were getting good traffic and I just thought to myself, Well I could do that ,” Montgomery told BuzzFeed News. And so he debuted National Report in February 2013. \nMontgomery could have reported the news, or simply blogged. But he noticed that fringe political pages would pick up just about anything that helped them make their point, including fabricated news. So National Report began publishing fake news about gun control, abortion, and President Obama, which Montgomery suspected would set off the right. It sure did. The sites quickly began aggregating his stories. “We really went for the confirmation bias thing,” Montgomery said. “What we assumed people wanted to hear, that was really what we were selling.” View this image › ID: 10021968 \nNational Report had impact. Real impact. Shortly after Montgomery fabricated a story about food stamps being used in Colorado to buy weed, the Colorado legislature introduced a real bill to ban the practice. \n“That one was a fun one for me,” Montgomery said. “It’s not that hard to get people to share that stuff and to get the right-wing folks all riled up. It’s kind of scary how easy it is, really.” Getting Trendy \nThe new share button wasn’t the only feature Facebook added to get timely content spreading across its platform. In March 2013 it introduced hashtags, which, as AllThingsD pointed out , were borrowed straight from Twitter: “Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery. And Twitter should be very flattered right now.” \nFive months later, on August 6, 2013, Facebook held a press event that, according to TechCrunch , repeatedly “emphasized real-time content” in its News Feed. The next day, Facebook added another feature: Trending. Facebook emphasized that Trending, a module that highlights some of the most talked about content on Facebook, was a small test, and promised to “share more details down the line if we decide to roll it out more widely.” View this image › ID: 10021976 \nAdding a slew of Twitter-like features gave Facebook a new capability to rapidly disseminate of-the-moment content. Facebook still wasn’t as fast as Twitter’s real-time updates, but it didn’t have to be. It was fast enough , and its 1 billion monthly active users, compared to Twitter’s 250 million or so, made up in mass what it lacked in energy. \n“These features gave people visibility into what people were talking about in the moment,” a former Facebook product manager told BuzzFeed News. “Now anyone, not just public figures, could add their voice to bigger conversations across the internet.” \nThose changes set up Allen Montgomery’s National Report for a big year. “2014 ended up being huge for us,” he said. National Report received around 30 million page views that year, he said, almost all thanks to Facebook. \nBy November 2014, Mark Zuckerberg was feeling pretty confident in Facebook’s capacity to deliver the latest news, enough so that he likened Facebook’s aim, incredibly, to that of a newspaper’s. “Our goal is to build the perfect personalized newspaper for every person in the world,” he said. “We’re trying to personalize it and show you the stuff that’s going to be most interesting to you.” \nTo build this “perfect personalized newspaper,” Facebook had to make the News Feed as interesting and relevant to people as possible. And to do that, it engaged in a number of quality-improving measures, including surveying its users on what they found valuable, and optimizing for time spent reading stories after a click from the Facebook News Feed, in addition to measuring traditional metrics like the number of shares and likes. \nThese moves were well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed. You’re unlikely to spend much time reading and interacting with material you disagree with. As another former Facebook employee told BuzzFeed News, “Even though they could show you stories that you disagree with, they’ll probably not because chances are you’ll spend more time on Facebook if you are seeing stuff you agree with and that you like.” \nFake news sites just out for a profit, and fringe websites trafficking in propaganda, both benefitted enormously. And a Facebook now outfitted with the mechanisms to make stories rapidly propagate turbocharged their rise. The First Steps Against Fake News \nAs early as August 2014 Facebook knew it had a growing problem on its hands, but approached it with kid gloves, pledging to mark links from hoax websites with a “satire” label. The Washington Post , in a story calling out the “terrible hoax-news industry,” explained its necessity. “A top post on Empire News will frequently boast more than a quarter of a million Facebook shares, far more than on any other social platform,” the Post reported. ”As that information spreads and mutates, it gradually takes on the pall of truth.” \nIn January 2015, Facebook got more aggressive. It wrote a News Feed FYI blog post with the title “Showing Fewer Hoaxes.” People were complaining about fake news and hoaxes, the blog post said, so Facebook would diminish these posts’ reach. “A post with a link to an article that many people have reported as a hoax or chosen to delete will get reduced distribution in News Feed,” the post said. And with that, Facebook began a public fight against fake news. \nBut the filter bubble was still getting bigger than ever, and it was about to get worse due to a change in the way people were behaving on the site. Trumped Up \nOn June 16, 2015, Donald Trump hit the ground in Iowa and began campaigning for president, taking shots at his fellow Republican contenders and telling the news media that only he could beat Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. A Bloomberg story from that day said “Democrats joyfully welcomed Trump’s entry into the race.” \nClearly, these Democrats hadn’t yet taken notice of his Facebook page. Two days later, a Trump post about immigration would receive more than 190,000 shares on Facebook. That was almost twice as many shares as Obama’s election night post had three years earlier. Facebook: DonaldTrump ID: 10021986 \nWith the presidential primaries underway, another fundamental change was taking place inside Facebook, one responsible for giving even more prominence to posts from news organizations and public figures, though the company had not yet started reckoning with it. \nSo-called “original sharing,” where people post their own photos, text updates, etc., instead of simply pressing “share,” was declining. The extent of Facebook’s original sharing problem came to light in an April 2016 article in The Information , which reported that original sharing was down by 21% in mid-2015 compared to the previous year. With sharing down, content from celebrities, political candidates, and news sites began to fill that void. Faceboook’s algorithm was already turning the platform into a playland for confirmation bias content, and the original sharing decline gave it yet another boost. \nFacebook continues to push back on this notion, and pointed BuzzFeed News toward comments Mark Zuckerberg made in an earnings call in April. “Overall sharing is up across Facebook,” he said. \nFacebook also maintains that the mix of what people see in NewsFeed has remained unchanged. “In general the percentage of News Feed that has been links and therefore also news distributed through links has been very consistent over time,” Facebook Product Management VP Adam Mosseri told BuzzFeed News in an interview. “The vast vast majority of stories in people’s News Feed are not news.” \nAnd meanwhile, Donald Trump, the iconic original sharer, was building steam. The Appearance Of Bias \nNow that it had new tools in place to identify and promote trending stories, Facebook took another step that it largely kept secret: It began making editorial decisions about the content that would appear in Trending. The company had hired a team of humans to curate its Trending column, but in August 2015, it told Recode that its algorithms alone were responsible for deciding what ended up there. “These people don’t get to pick what Facebook adds to the trending section,” Recode reported. “That’s done automatically by the algorithm. They just get to pick the headline.” \nNot so. In May 2016, Gizmodo published an explosive story reporting that these human curators “routinely suppressed conservative news.” The article, quoting the curators themselves, found that there was indeed human judgement involved in what appeared, and didn’t appear, in the Trending column. A conservative member of the curation team told Gizmodo that right-leaning Trending topics were regularly omitted.“I’d come on shift and I’d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn’t be trending because either the curator didn’t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz,” the curator said. \nThe revelations created a major scandal, one so damaging that Zuckerberg went as far as to admit “I know many conservatives don’t trust that our platform surfaces content without a political bias” in a post to his Facebook page — even through Facebook claimed it found no evidence of wrongdoing. \nThe day of Zuckerberg’s admission, the CEO hosted a meeting of conservative leaders inside Facebook to address the controversy. Conservative publisher Brent Bozell, who attended the meeting, told BuzzFeed News he walked away believing Facebook was sincere in its efforts to mend fences. “Everyone in that room wants the trust to be restored,” he said. “Trust is everything in this business.” \nThe election was less than six months away. Fake News, Real Resilience \nBy the start of 2016, Facebook had been doing battle with fake news for over a year, and it wasn’t winning. A BuzzFeed News analysis of thousands of Facebook posts published across nine top fake news sites found that the average engagement (likes + comments + shares) per post for these sites’ Facebook pages was higher in February 2016 than it was in January 2015. In its analysis, BuzzFeed News used data from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics company that Facebook thought so highly of it acquired it right after the election. \nA story from Allen Montgomery’s National Report even made its way into a December 2015 New York Times gun control editorial and sat there for months. When BuzzFeed News contact the Times about the story, it removed the link and issued a correction . \nThough BuzzFeed News looked at nine fake news sites in its analysis, there was a 10th, American News , that didn’t make it in. American News , liked by more 5 million people on Facebook, was bigger than the rest of the sites in the analysis by a wide margin. American News is not a fake news site, per se, but it often takes a nugget of truth and writes a dramatically exaggerated story around it with a conservative slant. After Bernie Sanders wrote an op-ed in the New York Times reacting to Trump’s victory saying he’s willing to work with the president-elect under some circumstances, for example, American News published a story with the headline: “Sanders Completely Turns On Hillary, Now Backing Trump.” (Sanders, in no part of his op-ed, said he supported the president-elect.) \nAmerican News is only one of a number of publications of its kind on the internet. You can think of them as mermaids. Seen from the surface, all appears to be normal. But go deeper, and things start to look fishy. These sites are masters at heavily slanting news to play on confirmation bias, and some are very, very popular. \nBreitbart, a populist conservative website with a massive readership and 2.8 million Facebook fans, can sometimes stray into mermaid territory. In August, for instance, it used a picture of the Cleveland Cavaliers championship parade in a story about a massive Jacksonville Trump rally. \nThese mermaids made Facebook’s self-assigned job of policing fake news extremely difficult. Zuckerberg, in a Facebook post last Saturday, did his best to explain this minefield. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” he said. \nThis was further exacerbated precisely because it had already come up against accusations that it was exhibiting bias against conservative news sources. \nAs the election approached, Facebook thus developed an “internal culture of fear,” when it came to fake news, according to Gizmodo (Facebook disputed elements of Gizmodo ’s report). If Facebook were to take action to limit spread of fake news, it would do so under intense scrutiny since it was already distrusted by conservatives for this very same action; suppressing news slanted to their viewpoint. In a world where a spectrum of truth exists, Facebook couldn’t find the place to draw the line. \nIf you want to know what Facebook would have faced if it took dramatic action against fake news, just ask Bozell, the conservative publisher who joined the meeting with Zuckerberg. “Would there be a backlash if they tried something? Of course there would,” he said. “There also be a backlash from the left if they tried it against the left.” \nAsked what would happen if Facebook deleted fabricated stories about the pope endorsing Donald Trump, for instance, Bozell said the move would unleash a world of trouble. “There would be a vicious reaction from those who would point to [other] people on Facebook saying that Trump was a member of the Klan or that Steve Bannon is a white supremacist,” he said. “If Facebook were to make the decision that it was going to look at the conservative movement and delete what it called ‘fake news,’ that would be a big big big big big mistake.” The Triumph Of The Filter Bubble \nIn this environment, both your right-wing uncle and left-wing aunt got drunk on fake news (and spin and propaganda), sharing shot after shot of a content format designed to appeal to those on both sides of the political spectrum that was now moving across the platform with relative impunity. \nIn an analysis of more than 1,000 posts on Facebook pages across the political spectrum, BuzzFeed News found that some of the least accurate pages registered some of the highest engagement . And the election neared, some of the top ‘news’ stories from hoax sites generated more engagement than the some of the top news stories from non-hoax sites. \nPerhaps more importantly long-term, agenda-driven sites like Breitbart saw their influence skyrocket while this was taking place. Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon joined the Trump campaign as CEO in August 2016 . And on November 8, Bannon not only watched his boss win the Presidency, he witnessed his in-the-can for Trump website beat out CNN, Fox News and The New York Times on election day for Facebook interactions. Bannon last week was picked as President Trump’s chief strategist. Breitbart, a publication many once considered fringe, is now the definition of mainstream. \nOn the day following the election, Mike Masnick, the editor of Techdirt, tried to make sense of Facebook’s role in the outcome, and wrote an article succinctly headlined: If You’re Blaming Facebook For The Election Results, You’re An Idiot. “People are believing those stories because they match with their real world experience of seeing how the system has worked (or not worked) for too long,” Masnick wrote. \nIndeed. Fake news and sensationalist news would be relatively ineffective without the existing worldview they confirm. But with that backstory in place — a distrust of ‘the system’ held by millions of Americans — Facebook provided the accelerant for this stuff to spread and take hold across the country during a deeply contentious election. \nAllen Montgomery, the fake news site proprietor, said he had no regrets about his role in helping develop the fake news genre. He maintained that stance when pressed about how his initial goal of seeding fabrications into conservative publications turned out to be far more serious than originally thought. “I think it’s depressing,” Montgomery said of people’s inability, or unwillingness, to distinguish real from fake. “At the end of the day, the confirmation bias thing is the keyword. You can sell somebody anything, and Trump certainly was a master at that. Confirming what people want to believe.” Alex Kantrowitz is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco. He reports on social and communications.

      "title": "Facebook didn’t get the memo about fake news. Of course it didn’t.",
      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in his trademark gray tee. (image: Getty) More It shouldn’t be news that fake news is a problem on Facebook and other social networks: We’ve had decades of practice with hoaxes, urban legends and other fraudulent “facts” floating around the Internet. It’s been 21 years since Snopes.com founder David Mikkelson began busting myths online , seven years since FactCheck.org had to debunk fake reports about Snopes’ funding , and two and a half years since the Washington Post launched a “What was fake on the Internet this week” blog… which it abandoned in frustration just over a year ago . But this election season saw fake news run amok . A BuzzFeed study found that over the last three months of the campaign, the 20 most-shared fake election stories got a slightly larger audience than the top 20 election stories from legitimate sites. Commence the blamestorming Now, some people are now wondering if Facebook’s role as a vector for fake news played a part in Donald J. Trump’s shocking Election Night win. Gizmodo’s recent report that Facebook ( FB ) quashed a News Feed update to call out hoaxes because it would have nailed too many conservative sites — something Facebook denies — amped up that angst. So did the Washington Post interview with fake-news entrepreneur Paul Horner featuring this quote: “I think Trump is in the White House because of me.” Facebook has responded with a stages-of-denial sequence, first saying this isn’t a big problem that couldn’t have made much of a difference, then taking a step to address the issue. Last Thursday, founder Mark Zuckerberg called the fake-news issue “small” and inconsequential, then expanded on his thoughts in a Facebook post . “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” Zuckerberg said. “The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics.” He added that “we don’t want any hoaxes on Facebook” and said the company is helping users to flag fake content. A few days later, Facebook (along with Google) said it would ban fake-news sites from using its advertising systems . It’s unclear how they will decide which sites deserve this exile. Friday night, Zuckerberg posted another note , saying that Facebook was working on automatic classification and third-party verification of stories and was “exploring” adding warning labels for fake news. Zuckerberg is probably right that fake news didn’t sway the election. It almost certainly has less of an effect than the Clinton campaign’s decisions about allocating resources in the Midwest or voter-ID laws suppressing turnout in some of those same states. But fake news can still hurt Facebook. When I see obvious nonsense overrunning the site — like when a click on a link about Trump’s possible tech policy led Facebook to suggest a story from a fake-news factory called “Ending the Fed” — I have to wonder how stupid it thinks I am. If a site can’t resist this kind of junk (see also, Google Now featuring Breitbart News in its election-stories spot this summer, or Google search results for a query about election totals leading off with an amateur and wrong blog post ), why should we trust its other recommendations? Stop being surprised about trolling If Facebook is serious about making itself less of an accelerant for lies, it’s got no shortage of advice about what to do next. Thursday, a group of 20 fact-checking organizations posted an open letter to Zuckerberg urging that the social network “strengthen users’ ability to identify fake posts and false news by themselves.” Journalism professor Jeff Jarvis and Betaworks CEO John Borthwick posted a 15-item to-do list Friday that starts with making it easier for users to flag fake news. A team of college students have already shipped code that automatically marks news items as verified or not . Meanwhile, Facebook’s existing tools for flagging fake stories are too obscure: You must click or tap the arrow in the top right corner of a News Feed post, select “Report post,” select “I think it shouldn’t be on Facebook” and then choose “It’s a false news story.” Then your vote apparently vanishes. If friends see the same link, they won’t know you called it out. (This function doesn’t work on the related-stories links that Facebook displays after you follow a shared link. Zuckerberg’s Friday-night note said the site was “raising the bar” for those links.) Read More But Facebook and other social-media sites need to a proactive approach to fake-news publications that exploit their rules and norms. They don’t watch for network intrusions and then research what happened — they assign people to try to break in . They pay bug bounties to researchers who find new vulnerabilities. They make their own staffers think they’re being hacked , then grade how they respond to the drill. But when it comes to the sort of social engineering that can make a network unfriendly or unlivable, the managers of our social networks remain shocked, shocked, to find that trolling is going on in here. It’s past time for them to start doing the same sort of aggressive searching for vulnerabilities that their “infosec” experts already undertake. “I’ve long thought that this is something they should be doing” said Sarah Jeong , author of “The Internet of Garbage,” a book chronicling how social networks treat abuse as an outsource-able cleanup problem. She has yet to see any such efforts. Facebook says it’s factored in the possibility of abuse when launching features like Facebook Live. But in too many other cases, it’s shown itself to be as reactive as every other social network — and the way it’s gotten played by fake-news sites and now must pledge that it’s “committed to getting this right,” as Zuckerberg wrote Friday, fits into that pattern. We now have yet another example of how optimizing for users of goodwill doesn’t work . The trolls and the con artists and the fraudsters aren’t going to stop coming, any more than the hackers will let up. We need to stop being surprised by their arrival.",

      "text": "Facebook drone failure prompts a US investigation The NTSB wants to understand the problems involved in a June 28th test flight. Share Save \nFacebook may have been beaming with pride when it completed the first full test of its Aquila internet drone on June 28th, but that \"structural failure\" near the end? US officials aren't so happy about that. The National Transportation Safety Board has revealed that it's investigating the incident, which it considers \"substantial\" enough to be treated as an accident. The exact circumstances aren't available, but there wasn't any damage on the ground. \nIn a statement to Bloomberg , Facebook reiterates that it was \"happy\" with the test flight, which checked everything from basic aerodynamics to controls. There were \"no major unexpected results,\" the social network says. It likely wasn't catastrophic, then, but the NTSB's involvement still raises eyebrows. Is it investigating just to be cautious, or is this more than a small snag? \nWhatever the situation, it's only going to add to Facebook's headaches as it tries to offer free, far-reaching internet access. On top of the imperfect drone flight, it lost a satellite to SpaceX's Falcon 9 explosion on September 1st. Both ventures are inherently risky -- Aquila is effectively a barebones solar-powered wing -- but we suspect that Facebook wasn't expecting to run into that much trouble in a relatively short time.",

      "text": "By Chris Chase \nPublished November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print LANDOVER, MD - NOVEMBER 20: Quarterback Kirk Cousins #8 of the Washington Redskins celebrates after teammate running back Rob Kelley #32 (not pictured) scores a fourth quarter touchdown against the Green Bay Packers at FedExField on November 20, 2016 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) \nThere's a pall hanging over the Washington Redskins and, for once, it doesn't have to do with the team looking up hopelessly at the Giants, Cowboys and Eagles. In an otherwise exciting football year in D.C., the specter of quarterback Kirk Cousins' impending free agency looms after every game, which each have been serving as a public referendum on Cousins' future in Washington. Will the Redskins bring him back under the franchise tag, sign him to a contract worth between $80 and $90 million (a funny-money guess based on how much the far-inferior Brock Osweiler got in free agency in 2015) or let him walk away? The question has overshadowed a promising season - the future clouding the present.\nThe risks on all sides are obvious. The Redskins can sign Cousins to that big deal, watch him regress (or get injured) and waste four years waiting to get out of a contract so unwieldy it doesn't allow the team to build a foundation in other areas. It's happened before. Or they can let Cousins go and spend the next decade watching him lead a rejuvenated Bears franchise that beats the Redskins every two or three years just to rub it in. No one really considers the best-case scenario: Cousins plays like a quarterback in or around the top 10 of the league and the new-look Redskins front office builds a team around his competence that can compete annually.\nD.C. sports pessimists (so, like 95% of them) only think about the first two possibilities and have already made up their mind about the former.\nMore from FoxSports Dak on what record win streak means to Cowboys Giants are on a roll but are still taking it one game at a time Whitlock 1-on-1: Mike Pereira explains missed NFL extra points | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Denver Broncos, Houston Texans best fit Tony Romo for 2017 season | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF \"Sure, pay Kirk Cousins $80 million. If there's anything we've learned over the course of 20 years it's that Washington is a place where quarterbacks and overpaid free agents flourish. Seriously, I'm asking, what has happened that would make anyone believe this could work for another five years?\" - A D.C. sports fan who wishes to remain nameless because if Cousins gets signed and actually manages to outperform his contract he wants to be able to say he saw it coming \nThat's a reasonable position. Going by history, it's perhaps more reasonable than hoping Cousins gets signed and lives up to the deal. Albert Haynesworth, Bruce Smith, Adam Archuleta, Jeff George, Dana Stubblefield and Deion Sanders provide the compelling case as to why. Then again, all those were free-agent transfers. Washington rarely gives one of its own a massive contract - last year's extension to Trent Williams, which was the largest in NFL history for an offensive tackle, might have been the first.\nWith each additioanl win, Cousins gets closer to becoming the second and possibly earning the biggest contract in history for a team that knows something or five about big contracts. Right now, the Redskins are 6-3-1, their best record through 10 games since 1996. They're 11-4--1 in the past 16 regular season games, the third-best mark for any NFL team. That record makes for the best season-long stretch since the final year of Joe Gibbs 1.0.\nCousins is the straw stirring the drink. He's played 26 games since becoming the full-time starter and is throwing for 279 yards per game on a 69 percent completion clip with 46 TD, 18 INT and a QB rating of 100.4. Over that aforementioned 16-game stretch, he's thrown for 4,772 yards, 31 TD, 8 INT and a rating of 107.2. He throws a gorgeous deep ball. He looks off receivers. He and Jordan Reed have a connection that brings to mind Brady and Gronkowski. There are mistakes - holding onto the ball too long, audible calls into busted plays, unfortunate passes - but the good far outweighs the bad. All season I've been saying that barring a meltdown the Redskins are going to have to stick with Cousins, stats and record be damned, for the simple reason there's no one else available. Now it's different. The Redskins are going to stick with Cousins because he's earned the money and there's every reason to believe he'll keep on doing so.\nConsider that even if Washington's worst-case scenario comes true - winning two of the final six, let's say - Cousins will still have led the franchise to a winning record in back-to-back years, something that hasn't happened since 1996-97 when Washington was a juggernaut that went 9-7 in '96 and followed that up with a 8-7-1 record the next year. (Last year's division champs went 9-7. This year, the team has a tie on its ledger. Could it be another 9-7/8-7-1 finish? This is where the pessimism of a Washington sports fan kicks into hyperdrive.) The last back-to-back playoff appearances came a year after the 1991 Super Bowl title and has only happened eight times in the Super Bowl era (five of which were with Gibbs). Right now, Cousins is on the verge of erasing a slew of two-decade droughts by getting Washington back to the playoffs and putting the team in great position to go on a run D.C. hasn't seen since years before the internet.\nThat's why he has to return. If his last six games are average or below average, that shouldn't be a sign to keep looking. It merely lowers his price. Yes, a contract might take some soul-searching for Washington fans who think they're perpetually stuck in the 1980s and a front office that loves to get in its own way. It should be pretty simple though: The Redskins have a quarterback playing more consistently over 26 games than any time since before Lawrence Taylor met Joe Theismann's leg. (Mark Rypien's 1991 still stands as the best full season by a Washington quarterback in the last 30 years but Cousins is challenging that in 2016.)\nThe cold feet are natural. For years, the Washington sports scene was a study in disappointments. D.C. never got to have fun things. Then all of a sudden, over the course of eight years Joe Gibbs returned, baseball did too, the Capitals took a surefire superstar at No. 1, the Nationals got two and the Redskins were going to spend a decade watching Robert Griffin III take them to the playoffs.\nIt all came crashing down. Gibbs 2.0 was a disappointment, though it resulted in the most playoff appearances for any Redskins coach since Joe Gibbs. (And don't sleep on what Gibbs did with a subpar roster, particularly in 2007 when the team rallied from the midseason murder of Sean Taylor to go on a four-game winning streak and make the playoffs.) The Nationals were mediocre-to-horrible for years. Despite tremendous regular-season success, Alex Ovechkin and the Caps can't win a playoff series. Stephen Strasburg got hurt. Bryce Harper won an MVP then had a season best described as \"you'll get 'em next year.\" The team is 0-3 in playoff series despite having the second-best record in baseball over the last five seasons. And RG3? His tale is the stuff of 19th-century Russian literature.\nOutlaying a possible nine figures to a quarterback who isn't worth it can get even the best-run franchises into a rut. (Washington only need look 25 miles to the north for an example.) That's not a worry the Redskins can afford to think about. When you have five playoff appearances and just two postseason wins since 1992, you don't get to keep searching for a Peyton Manning or Tom Brady. You realize you haven't had it so good in 30 years. You realize discarding quarterbacks is the mark of the mediocre. You remind yourself, and be thrilled, that you somehow got a franchise cornerstone in the fourth-round of a draft in which you took another quarterback at No. 2. Then you pay the man his money.",

      "text": "The NTSB is investigating the ‘structural failure’ of Facebook’s Aquila internet drone Posted IBM expands its UK presence with 4 new data centers \nSay what you will about the merits of Facebook’s Internet.org and Free Basics — it’s pretty cool that they’re building a huge, solar-powered, laser-shooting drone to deliver it. But a “structural failure” that occurred on the Aquila’s first test flight may be more serious than Facebook made it out to be: the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, Bloomberg reports . \nWe’ve contacted the NTSB for more information and to acquire the report on the incident, if it exists (these things can take time), but haven’t heard back yet. We’ll update the post when we do. \nFacebook wrote about its tests (which occurred on June 28) in July, listing several things they were looking at, learned, and so on. Under the “real world conditions” bullet point, the blog post admits things weren’t entirely nominal: \nWe are still analyzing the results of the extended test, including a structural failure we experienced just before landing. We hope to share more details on this and other structural tests in the future. \nReally, it was too much to hope that nothing would go wrong on the first full-scale test of an enormous, experimental aircraft design. But the NTSB doesn’t get involved if a screw drops off — Bloomberg reports that the safety organization classified the incident as an “accident,” which implies the damage was “substantial.” \nThese terms, however, have specific meanings to NTSB investigators and aircraft testers. If the Aquila had nosedived into the ground, caught fire, or sustained some other high-profile damage, that likely would have come out by now. We’re waiting on the incident report for the rest of the information — but considering the scope of the project and pride evinced by Facebook in the Aquila’s development, it seemed reasonable to, well, clip its wings a little bit. 0",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nIsn’t it startling the number of unhappy, unfulfilled relationships out there? \nA long time ago, I set out on a mission to create an incredibly fulfilling and loving relationship that was different from the normal relationships so many people seem to be in. \nI didn’t want drama; I didn’t want argument after argument; I didn’t want distrust and dishonesty; I didn’t want jealousy and insecurities taking over the relationship. \nMy partner and I strive for excellence and we never settle for less than the best in each other. This is rare, but it doesn’t need to be. \nI’ll show you what I’ve experienced to be the best things to allow a long-term relationship to thrive. \nIf you apply these ten things to your relationships, they will be transformed forever. 1. Reveal your most authentic self. \nLove can’t flow in a relationship if there is a lack of authenticity. \nFor a relationship to thrive, we must allow ourselves to be completely authentic with each other. We must reveal our true selves. \nAuthenticity creates such a strong bond. I’m never more connected to my partner than in those moments of truth. 2. Communicate. \nYour partner can’t read your mind, even if you wish they could. \nCommunicate verbally what you want, feel, desire, and hate. Tell them what you’re happy with and what you’re annoyed about. It’s a must. 3. Give without expecting anything in return. \nTo give unconditionally means to give without ever needing anything back. \nThis means losing any expectations you may have. Just because you did something nice for the other person doesn’t mean they have to do something for you too. \nIf you can give without expecting anything in return, then you won’t look to your partner for fulfillment. Instead, you’ll fulfill yourself through your own kindness. This is fearless loving. 4. Be present. \nIf you’re with your partner one-on-one, then be with your partner in the moment with utmost presence. \nWhat’s the point if we are only half there? Drop your phone. Forget everything else. Just be with each other. 5. Support each other. \nNever hold back your partner for fear of them finding something better than you. Never bring them down because you’re scared they’ll spread their wings and fly away. \nSupport them in all they do and allow them the freedom to fly free in all their potential. \nWith the support of the one that loves us most, anything is possible. 6. Be the greatest listener your partner has ever experienced. \nWe all love being listened to. It’s so powerful to be fully present with someone and actively listening to all they want to express. \nBy listening, we allow a space for our partners to open up and be truly authentic. By listening, we allow our partners to feel seen, noticed and not judged. 7. Create a shared vision. \nCreate a life together. Create a shared vision where you can both seek your individual desires but also move forward together. \nA shared vision for the future builds a strong bond where we can get excited and inspired by each other. It’s a way to work together toward the life we both want. 8. Have fun. \nIf a relationship isn’t fun, then what’s the point? \nSure, we have responsibilities, mouths to feed, and money to earn. But we must never lose that sense of fun. \nPlay. Flirt with each other. Laugh. Be silly. 9. Thank each other. \nMy partner and I are two incredibly grateful people. One of the things that makes our relationship thrive is our ability to thank each other for every little thing that we do. \nBe grateful for being in each other’s lives. \nMake a list of ten or more things you are grateful for about your partner and read them out to each other. Never forget to thank each other for the smallest of things. 10. Touch each other, often. \nCuddle, kiss, touch each other’s bodies, make love, and give each other pleasure without wanting anything back. \nTouch brings connection and creates a strong bond, so do it as often as possible. \nDo these ten things and they’ll make a huge difference to your relationship. They are so simple but many people don’t do them, or they forget about them once a relationship has been going for a while. \nDon’t take people for granted. If you’ve been with each other for a while, don’t ease off. Don’t treat your partner like they’ll always be around. \nLove now, or you may just miss your chance.

      "title": "16 Heavy-Hitting Facts About the 'Rocky' Movies",
      "text": "YouTube Like us on Facebook \nThe first Rocky —which was released 40 years ago—told a seemingly improbable rags-to-riches story about a loan shark/amateur boxer going the full 15 rounds against a champion fighter that weirdly mirrored the improbable story of how the movie went from a distant dream of Sylvester Stallone’s to a real, Best Picture Oscar-winning film and subsequent franchise. On the 40th anniversary of the original film's release, here are some heavy-hitting, high-flying facts about the Rocky series. 1. STALLONE WROTE THE FIRST DRAFT OF ROCKY IN THREE AND A HALF DAYS. \nWith a little bit of screenwriting experience, and the idea for Rocky in his head for almost a year after witnessing a Muhammad Ali fight, Sylvester Stallone—who had $106 in the bank at the time—spent about 84 hours using a pad and a pen to write the first draft of Rocky . In his original version, Adrian was Jewish, Mickey was racist, the Paulie character was Adrian’s Jewish mother , Apollo Creed was Jamaican, and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight and opening a pet store for Adrian with the money he made. 2. THE STUDIO WAS INTERESTED IN HAVING JAMES CAAN, BURT REYNOLDS, OR RYAN O’NEAL PLAY ROCKY. \nUnited Artists offered Stallone up to $340,000 to sell them the rights to the screenplay if he agreed to not star in the movie. When the budget was lowered to $1 million, the studio was no longer allowed to keep Stallone from starring. He was paid $20,000 for the script and a SAG minimum of $350 per week for acting instead. 3. ADRIAN WAS ALMOST PLAYED BY SUSAN SARANDON. \nStallone and the producers decided that she was “too sexy.\" Cher was also considered. Bette Midler was offered the role but turned it down . Carrie Snodgress had in fact won the part, until her agent asked for too much money . Talia Shire auditioned at the last minute to save the day. 4. STALLONE AND CARL WEATHERS REHEARSED THEIR (FIRST) BIG FIGHT FOR FOUR WEEKS. Director John G. Avildsen shot their rehearsals on Super 8 so that the actors could see what they were doing. When it came time for the actual pretend Creed/Balboa I, filmed at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, producers advertised that anyone who showed up to play the audience would receive a free chicken dinner. 5. ROCKY AND ADRIAN VISITED THE SKATING RINK AFTER IT WAS CLOSED FOR BUDGETARY REASONS. \nOriginally, Adrian and Rocky have a date during the skating rink’s operating hours. Because it would've cost money to pay for extras to skate around them, Avildsen asked Stallone to change the scene so that the couple had the rink all to themselves . 6. IT WAS A FAMILY AFFAIR FOR THE STALLONES. \nSly's brother, Frank Stallone Jr., played a street corner singer in Rocky , while Frank Sr. was the timekeeper for the fight. Stallone’s first wife, Sasha, received a kiss from Rocky during his training session in Rocky III . 7. CHARLIE CHAPLIN AND ELVIS PRESLEY WERE FANS OF THE FIRST MOVIE. \nChaplin wrote to Stallone that Rocky reminded the silent film star of a character he used to play. Stallone regretted turning down Chaplin’s invitation to visit him in Switzerland after the director died a few months later. Similarly, Stallone turned down Elvis’ offer to watch Rocky with him in Memphis months before The King passed away. 8. BURT YOUNG LOST WEIGHT FOR THE SEQUEL BECAUSE HE HADN'T PLANNED ON BEING IN IT. \nHe lost weight for another film; Young initially did not want to play Paulie again. Stallone wrote a line into Rocky II to address the obvious physical difference. 9. ROCKY’S FAMOUS RUN LASTED FOR 30.61 MILES. \nOr his run in the sequel did, according to a 2013 calculation by Philadelphia magazine. Eight hundred Philadelphia children were used as extras for Rocky’s run from his house to the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 10. THERE WAS AN ALTERNATE ENDING TO ROCKY II . \nFootage was shot of Adrian and Paulie actually witnessing Rocky and Apollo’s second fight in person, instead of back at home with the newborn baby. In that version, Adrian gets swept up into the ring with the other spectators and ends up in Rocky’s arms to end the movie. 11. THERE WAS A BIG DEBATE OVER THE ROCKY STATUE. \nStallone donated the 8’6”, 2000-pound statue of Rocky Balboa to the Philadelphia Museum of Art after filming of Rocky III concluded. Philly residents were divided on whether or not the statue deserved to remain at the top of the museum steps. The Art Commission eventually placed it on the sidewalk of the Philadelphia Spectrum sports arena. It briefly returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for Rocky V , then back to the Spectrum until 2006, when it traveled to the base of the Art Museum steps for its 30th anniversary , where it remains. 12. WYOMING AND CANADA PLAYED THE ROLE OF THE SOVIET UNION IN ROCKY IV . \nThe epic training Rocky went through before fighting Ivan Drago was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Camera, sound, and transportation equipment froze in the minus-20-degree weather . The Balboa/Drago match held in Drago’s U.S.S.R. was filmed at the PNE Agrodome in Vancouver, British Columbia. 13. DOLPH LUNDGREN SENT STALLONE TO THE HOSPITAL. \nLundgren hit Stallone so hard in the chest when shooting the first round of the Balboa/Drago fight that Stallone’s heart hit his breastbone and began to swell. Had he not been sent to the ER and then intensive care for eight days, the heart would have continued to swell until he died. 14. ROCKY WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE AT THE END OF ROCKY V . \nStallone cried writing the death of his iconic character. It was all for no reason, since two weeks into filming, Avildsen—who came back to direct Rocky V after Stallone directed parts II, III, and IV himself—was told by a studio executive that Rocky Balboa, like Batman, Superman, and James Bond, could never die . In the original script, Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn kills Balboa in their street fight, concluding with Adrian giving a heartfelt speech to the reporters crowded outside the hospital about how Rocky’s spirit will live on forever. 15. BOXERS JOE FRAZIER AND CHUCK WEPNER FELT THAT STALLONE TREATED THEM UNFAIRLY AFTER HEAVILY BORROWING FROM THEIR LIVES TO WRITE THE MOVIES. \nBefore Rocky Balboa did it, \"Smokin'\" Joe Frazier ran the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and spent some early mornings punching meat at the slaughterhouse that employed him. He said in 2008 that he only received compensation for his Rocky walk-on cameo, and it was all a “sad story” for him. Stallone was initially inspired by watching Muhammad Ali fight a major underdog fighter named Chuck Wepner in 1975, who lost but managed to knock Ali down once in the match and became a local New Jersey hero. Wepner even wrestled Andre the Giant at Shea Stadium before Balboa battled the Hulk Hogan character Thunderlips in Rocky III . Wepner sued Stallone in 2003 . The two settled for an undisclosed amount. \nAli, meanwhile, noted the similarities between himself and Apollo Creed. He didn’t seem to mind. 16. ROCKY’S TURTLES CUFF AND LINK OUTLIVED A COUPLE OF THE CHARACTERS. \nThe female red-eared sliders that appeared in 2006’s Rocky Balboa are the same turtles from the original 1976 picture.

      "text": "shares \nFacebook appears to be testing a new feature that lets you find nearby wireless hotspots. \nNot long ago, Facebook started asking Pages to list Wi-Fi locations at their physical addresses. It seems this is the backbone that the information is built on, but it might also lend itself to some inaccurate results. \nThe inclusion seems an obvious fit for a network that’s pushing Facebook live harder than ever. Without a strong internet connection, people have pretty shoddy results when trying to film live video. The more nearby locations Facebook can point you to, the better the quality of real-time information sharing, news, and viral-esque video content becomes. It’s everything Facebook wants from its Live feature. \nWhat’s not clear is if Android users have the feature. Those we polled didn’t, but that’s not to say there aren’t some lucky Facebook users that have it. As for iOS , it hasn’t rolled out to everyone just yet. I don’t have it, but some of our team does. It’s really a mixed bag. \nIf you’re one of the lucky ones, you can spot the feature in the hamburger menu in the mobile app. \nNow, if we could just get Facebook and Google to team up we’d be able to not only find Wi-Fi, but a toilet to use it on .",

      "text": "Harsh truths about fake news for Facebook, Google and Twitter Digital platforms are urged to take responsibility and accept their role as publishers by: Richard Waters , Matthew Garrahan and Tim Bradshaw \nTo judge by the headlines being passed around on social media during her campaign, Hillary Clinton was often in serious trouble. \n“Experts” believed the Democratic presidential candidate had suffered brain damage. Or maybe she was trying to hide alcohol and drug addiction. She was also facing imminent indictment, now that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had finally found evidence of criminality in her use of a private email server — though the New York Police Department, after uncovering shocking evidence of her links to money laundering and sex crimes involving children, might pounce first. \nIn the heat of the most bitter US presidential election in memory, the internet was having a field day. A barrage of fake news — much of it aimed at undermining Mrs Clinton or boosting her opponent — was just part of the diet. It included conspiracy theories, misdirection, prejudice, harassment and hate speech, specially created to circulate on the digital networks that are now central to mass communication and media consumption. \nAccording to critics, the digital platforms contributed to a virulent tribalism, as long-simmering partisan divisions boiled over. And they served to further undermine faith in established media outlets, as many members of a polarised electorate found ready support for the prejudices and unfounded suspicions they already harboured. \nThe aftermath has brought criticism of some of the biggest internet companies — in particular Facebook and Twitter — and an admission that change is needed . “We have a problem in the tech industry we have to deal with,” says John Borthwick, a New York tech investor. “These platforms are central to our democracy. Something has started to go wildly wrong.” Finger pointing \nThe backlash in the wake of the election of Donald Trump , the Republican candidate, has centred on fake news: false reports that are dressed up to look like genuine news articles, sometimes from news sources invented solely for the purpose. Passed around widely on Facebook, retweeted on Twitter or promoted by Google’s search algorithms, some of these stories managed to infiltrate the popular political discourse. A site's fake news story about the popular vote in the US election \nThey included the “report” from the Denver Guardian, a non-existent publication, that an FBI agent suspected of leaking emails from Mrs Clinton’s private server had been found dead in a murder or suicide. With the velocity that characterises the flow of news on Facebook, that report was shared up to 100 times a minute on the network. \nNot all the misinformation favoured the Republican candidate, though most of it did. Of the 20 fakes that generated the most audience engagement on Facebook in the final three months of the campaign, all but three were either pro-Trump or anti-Clinton, according to an analysis by news website BuzzFeed. The made-up stories also touched a nerve: Facebook’s users engaged more deeply with the fakes than the top 20 stories produced by a selection of established media companies. \nThe viral success of fake news on Facebook and the role the sharing of these articles might have had in tilting the election for Mr Trump have caused considerable angst inside the company. Comment Zuckerberg’s flawed approach to fixing his fake news problem His evasions smack of someone fearful of unpicking his own business model \n“There is anxiety around the election and there are questions around the role that Facebook and other organisations may have played,” says one person with knowledge of the internal discussions at the social networking site. \nPresident Barack Obama said last week that, when it is no longer possible to tell “what’s true and what’s not, and particularly in an age of social media…then we have problems”. \nIn Silicon Valley, where a dominant liberal culture is in shock over the election result, there has been finger pointing over the part the world’s most powerful tech companies may have played. \n“People need to step up and call out the platforms for being effectively propaganda machines for either side,” says Justin Kan, a successful entrepreneur and now an investor at Y Combinator, which funds internet start-ups. “The leadership in Silicon Valley needs to call out Facebook to do the right thing.” \nMark Zuckerberg , Facebook’s chief executive, has rejected much of the criticism , while conceding that there is “more to be done” to stop the spread of fake news. In the days after the election, he claimed it was a “pretty crazy idea” that false stories had somehow had a bearing on the result. But growing pressure led him at the end of last week to outline a number of measures the site was taking to try to tackle the problem. How a fake news item about Hillary Clinton appeared on Twitter \nThe steps taken by the big internet companies in the wake of the election highlight the pressure they have been under to act. Google and Facebook moved last week to prevent their advertising from appearing on sites that carry fake news, a belated attempt to make lying less profitable. Twitter suspended a batch of alt-right accounts — linked to US rightwing extremist groups — for hate speech. \nEvidence that has surfaced since the election shows that the digital platforms will have to do more to weed out misinformation and harassment from their systems, taking in not just fake news but a wider range of abusive behaviour. \nBots — automated systems designed to imitate people — did much to circulate fake news headlines on Twitter, according to Philip Howard, a professor at Oxford university’s internet institute. About a fifth of all tweets about the election were generated by accounts that produce high volumes of posts, he says, a clear indication that they were bots rather than real users. ‘Digital denial’ \nGoogle’s algorithms have also been shown to be vulnerable. For instance, it is a week since a false report that George Soros — often a target of rightwing attacks — had died. \nBut a search for “George Soros” on November 20 still returned this headline at the top of the In the News section of Google’s first page of results: “ Breaking Intel: George Soros DEAD ”. The story was from a site called the Event Chronicle. The Event Chronicle's fake news article about George Soros \nFacebook’s Mr Zuckerberg says only 1 per cent of news circulating on the site was fake. But with the company now used as a news source by nearly half of Americans, that represents a vast amount of traffic. Also, Mr Howard says the location of bot groups operating on Facebook suggests much of the fake information was targeted at Facebook users in swing states like Ohio and Florida, potentially increasing its impact. \nThe failure to block the tide of misinformation has reawakened complaints from the traditional media world that the digital companies have deliberately turned a blind eye, much as they were accused of doing in the case of copyrighted content. \nGoogle and Facebook have resisted describing themselves as media companies or publishers that are responsible for the content they distribute. \n“These companies are in digital denial,” says Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp. “Of course they are publishers and being a publisher comes with the responsibility to protect and project the provenance of news. The great papers have grappled with that sacred burden over decades and centuries, and you can’t absolve yourself from that burden or the costs of compliance by saying, ‘We are a technology company’.” A Facebook post linking to a fake news item on Obamacare \nAlong with other recent failures, such as errors in measurement that led Facebook to inflate the number of times its video ads were seen, the furore over fake news has intensified calls for internet companies to think of themselves as media concerns. \n“The measurement, fake news and extremist content issues highlight that new media or social media companies are not technology companies; they’re media companies,” says Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP , the world’s largest advertising group. “They are responsible for the content in their digital pipes.” \nYet the business imperatives the internet platforms follow may have given them too little incentive to exercise this type of responsibility. Weeding out false information “hasn’t been a priority”, says Mr Borthwick. “Content, more often than not, has been a means to an end — and the end is more sharing, more connectivity.” \nOne former Facebook staffer also says the way the company is run may have exacerbated the distribution of fake news. Its engineers focus on improving engagement — clicks, likes, comments, shares — as the primary measures of success of any new feature. New projects are typically released after six-month “sprints”, during which pressure to increase those metrics is intense. \n“Engagement is a dangerous drug,” says a former Facebook manager. “Nobody is incentivised to think critically about unintended, often long-term consequences.” Another Facebook post linking to a fake news item critical of President Obama \nThat may also contribute to a “filter bubble” problem that leaves users inside an echo chamber of similar views. \nWorse, the pursuit of engagement for its own sake may exacerbate the problem and add to the flow of angry, hateful and inaccurate information. “There’s a lot of evidence that what people share is not necessarily what they researched but what gives them an emotional response,” says Mr Kan. \nThe posts that bring the strongest reactions, adds Mr Borthwick, are “catnip to the news feed”. So the Facebook engineers have an incentive to feature these items most prominently, aiding the spread of information that deepens political divisions. Room for improvement \nIt is unclear how far the internet companies will move to address these issues. Early attention has turned to the algorithms used to weed out fake news, an area in which many experts believe there is scope for improvement. The age of vitriol Edward Luce on US politics and social media Social media is enabling prejudice to slip into the mainstream. What does this mean for democracy? \nMr Zuckerberg has made no mention of another issue raised by critics: whether the sites should hire human editors. Employing people to carry out detailed filtering of content is impractical given the scale of the networks, say critics such as Mr Borthwick. \nBut he, and others, argue that internet companies should still hire “public editors” who can help to establish guidelines and shape their thinking in product design and other issues that will affect the way their services are used. \nSuch calls may continue to fall on deaf ears. “The culture they’ve built and the people they’ve hired” mean that internet companies like Facebook simply do not recognise any need for editorial sensibility, says Ben Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. \nThe cultural chasm runs even deeper. On Twitter, a commitment to free speech has long contributed to the site’s hesitation to stamp out harassment, a flaw it belatedly tried to fix last week with new controls to combat bullying, racism and misogyny. \nMr Zuckerberg, casting Facebook more as a communication platform than a media site, takes a similar stance. “We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible,” he wrote last week. \nBut old authorities become muted in a world where users’ voices are pre-eminent. In an interview last week with The New Yorker, Mr Obama complained that, on a Facebook page, an explanation of global warming by a Nobel Prize winner looks no different than one by a paid climate change denier. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook 'errs on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible'© Bloomberg \nHe added: “The capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal — that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarise the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.” \nIn the wake of a bitterly divisive US election, Facebook users are retreating deeper into their “filter bubbles”. The bitterness of the loss, says Mr Howard, means that many on the losing side have been systematically “unfriending people who voted for the other candidate”. \nThe result is likely to be even deeper tribal divisions. That can only add to an environment in which many people are all too ready to believe the most biased or inaccurate information about the opposing camp — and to shout it out to anyone who will listen. Blocking tools that help machines tell good stories from bad \nHow hard would it be to train a computer to spot fake news? Not very, according to critics who say companies such as Facebook and Twitter have not tried hard enough to block misinformation from their sites. \nThey compare the problem to previous online scourges, like the spam that once threatened to overwhelm email systems, as well as so-called “content farms”— sites that produce large amounts of low-quality articles designed to trick search engines and generate advertising. In these and similar cases, algorithms were adapted to identify and either expunge or downplay the offending material. \nWith their huge resources, the internet companies should find this an easy problem to crack, says Ben Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. “Facebook has more money than God,” he adds. \nIt took four students 36 hours last week to come up with a rudimentary tool for blocking fake news. Developed during a coding competition at Princeton University, the browser plug-in adds warnings to information that cannot be verified and suggests alternative material pulled from more reliable sites, says Nabanita De, one of the developers. \nA number of media companies are working on a project to help machines tell good information from bad, such as new types of metadata to help an algorithm judge a story’s reliability. Such signals might include how a news site was funded or information about the reporter, says Sally Lehrman, director of a journalism ethics programme at Santa Clara University who leads the project. Google and LinkedIn have backed the idea. \nWriting last week, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was working on better ways to detect misinformation but the plague of fake news during the US elections has left many doubters.

      "text": "Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Agence France-Presse / 11:03   \nWASHINGTON—Hillary Clinton was about to be indicted, Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump: the battle over fake news is heating up after a White House campaign in which the misinformation industry may have swung the outcome of the vote. \nLast week, Google and Facebook moved to cut off ad revenue to bogus news sites. But media watchers say more is needed to stamp out a powerful phenomenon seen by some people as a threat to democracy itself. \nREAD: Google, Facebook to pull out ads from fake news sites ADVERTISEMENT \nOne of those people is President Barack Obama, who has warned that fake news threatens the basic principle of freedom of speech. \n“If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect,” Obama said during a visit to Germany. \nThe hoaxes of the 2016 election season were in many cases spectacular —“Did the Clintons Commit Murder?”— and created by groups purely out to make money from clicks and ads. \nAnd since Trump’s victory, reports have exposed the dark underbelly of operations — run from Macedonia to California — that boast of making easy money with wholly fabricated stories, under such headlines as “Look At Sick Thing He Just Did To STAB Trump In The Back.” \nAn analysis published by BuzzFeed News found that the 20 top-performing bogus stories from hoax websites and extremely partisan blogs generated slightly more than 8.7 million “shares” on Facebook to just 7.4 million from major news websites, in the three months before the election. \nNow, the outcry over fake news and its apparent role in the election is prompting calls for Facebook to consider itself a media company, with editorial responsibilities, which the social network has repeatedly rejected. \nArbiters of truth? \nWashington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan argued that Facebook “should hire a top-flight executive editor and give that person the resources, power and staff to make sound editorial decisions.” \nFor Gabriel Kahn, a former journalist who teaches at the University of Southern California, “they’re in the same business as pretty much every media company, which is aggregating audiences and using that to sell advertisements.” \nAnd Kahn believes that Facebook, by considering itself a “neutral” platform, “allows the media ecosystem to be polluted” with bogus news. \nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Friday offered additional insight on plans to curb online misinformation while arguing for caution. \n“The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,” Zuckerberg said in a posting. \n“We believe in giving people a voice… We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.” \nZuckerberg said nonetheless that Facebook would step up efforts to weed out fake news with “stronger detection,” an easier process to report hoaxes and “third party verification” from “respected fact checking organizations.” \nREAD: Facebook lays out gameplan for fighting spread of fake news \nTech entrepreneur Elad Gil said it should not be too difficult for a company like Facebook to apply its technical expertise to determine when a news story is fake. \n“Intriguingly, a group of undergrads at Princeton were able to build a quick and dirty fake news classifier during a 36-hour hackathon,” Gil said in a blog post. \n‘Click farms’ vs ideology \nNortheastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy argued that it is important to differentiate between “click farms” which make money off entirely fake news and politically driven news sites. \n“I think Facebook could do a lot to crack down on fake news, and I think that’s something everybody could agree on, but if they try to go against the ideologically motivated sites it will inevitably get caught up in the culture wars,” Kennedy said. \nThe prevalence of ersatz news, analysts note, comes in a context of deep distrust of mainstream media, which is often accused of one-sidedness. \nAny effort to filter out those voices could “lead to the relitigation of ancient disputes over media bias,” said Kennedy. \nReason magazine editor Scott Shackleford said it would be hard to draw a line between filtering bogus news and ideological censorship. \n“So a decision by Facebook to censor ‘fake news’ would heavily weigh in favor of the more mainstream and ‘powerful’ traditional media outlets,” he wrote. \nCity University of New York journalism professor Jeff Jarvis and startup entrepreneur John Borthwick argued in a blog post that the media and technology industries should work together to help readers establish the credibility of news. \n“We do not believe that the platforms should be put in the position of judging what is fake or real, true or false as censors for all,” they wrote. \n“The platforms need to give users better information and media need to help them.” \nEven if the online platforms do not turn into media firms, the two wrote in the blog, they should “hire high-level journalists inside their organizations” to “bring a sense of public responsibility to their companies” and “to explain journalism to the technologists and technology to the journalists.”",

      "text": "Study: most students can't spot fake news That's one reason why Facebook and Google would want to fight bogus stories. Save Cultura Creative (RF)/Alamy \nIf you thought fake online news was a problem for impressionable adults, it's even worse for the younger crowd. A Stanford study of 7,804 middle school, high school and college students has found that most of them couldn't identify fake news on their own. Their susceptibility varied with age, but even a large number of the older students fell prey to bogus reports. Over two thirds of middle school kids didn't see why they shouldn't trust a bank executive's post claiming that young adults need financial help, while nearly 40 percent of high schoolers didn't question the link between an unsourced photo and the claims attached to it. \nWhy did many of the students misjudge the authenticity of a story? They were fixated on the appearance of legitimacy, rather than the quality of information. A large photo or a lot of detail was enough to make a Twitter post seem credible, even if the actual content was incomplete or wrong. There are plenty of adults who respond this way, we'd add, but students are more vulnerable than most. \nAs the Wall Street Journal explains, part of the solution is simply better education: teach students to verify sources, question motivations and otherwise think critically. That's happening in some schools. However, the data also illustrates the responsibilities that internet companies and parents share in keeping a lid on fake news. Facebook and Google can help by taking down these stories or depriving their creators of ad money , but parents also need to talk about accuracy and prevent younger kids from accessing sites with significant accuracy problems.",

      "text": "Facebook is pouring resources into making Facebook Live catch on, even running outdoor ads for the service to teach people how and when to use it. Now, Facebook is testing real-time ads brands and publishers can use to alert people to live broadcasts.\nAt the moment, brands and publishers are promoting their Facebook Live content through sponsored posts prior to the broadcast or once the live video has ended. The new ads will appear in newsfeeds at the time of the live stream, giving both brands and publishers the chance to grab people in the moment, according to Liam Copeland, director of decision science for social media agency Movement Strategy.\nThe ads are still in the testing phase, said Copeland. A Facebook rep confirmed that the social network has been “running a small test” of the Facebook Live ads, but refused to share details on which advertisers and publishers are testing this feature right now.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the value of live videos often depends heavily on timeliness, paid promotion of any kind takes time to grow, explained Mike Dossett, manager of digital strategy for agency RPA.\n“That presents a unique challenge if there is any lag between the stream going live and the promotional support going live,” said Dossett.\nBenefit Cosmetics, for instance, ran boosted posts from September 19 to September 25 for a live video called “Brow Hour” that aired on August 23. The campaign performed much better than other Facebook Live videos from the company, garnering a million reach, 392,000 engagements and 389,000 views, according to Laurin Hicks, digital brand manager for Benefit Cosmetics.\n“A couple of months ago, we saw which live video performing well organically and then place boosted posts around it to reach more people,” said Hicks. “We are looking to develop a robust strategy in 2017. For instance, we plan to promote a live video a week later rather than three or four weeks later, and we want to test Facebook’s lookalike targeting.”\nAside from the real-time promotion feature that Facebook is currently testing, the platform introduced scheduled live streams last month to let advertisers and publishers make an announcement post for an upcoming broadcast.\n“I do believe [brands] would be willing to invest more in production for Live format if Facebook were able to showcase, guarantee the type of audience reach and scale brands could buy into,” said Ethelbert Williams, CMO for cosmetic brand InstaNatural. “There are strategies to boost reach for Live format video today, but the ability to drive better visibility and accountability for what a brand could actually achieve is enticing and helps justify any investment here.”\nRelated",

      "text": "Here’s exactly how bad Facebook’s fake news problem really is Mike Wehner Pin it Share If you’ve been on the internet at all within the past two weeks, you’ve likely seen more than your share of reports on Facebook ‘s fake news problem, but just how bad is it really? PC World performed a rather interesting test to answer that question, and the results are jarring. To test what kind of fake news was being circulated, and who was seeing it, two entirely new Facebook profiles were created. Both white males of the same age, each of the profiles “liked” three people: Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton on one, and Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and Newt Gingrich on the other. Then, PC World tracked all the stories that Facebook recommended for each fake profile. DON’T MISS: The 5 best Black Friday sales you can shop right now After just two days, the page of the Republican-leading user was littered with fake news posts — 10 in total — while the stories that populated the Democratic-leaning user’s news feed were all factual. The startling contrast showed that many of the false narratives were based around claims of Democratic wrongdoing, such as Michael Moore “attempting a coup d’etat against Trump” in which the Secret Service had to intervene, or that Clinton has been circulating the personal information of Electoral College members to bully them into voting for her. Meanwhile, the user flagged as a Democrat received posts based on Gallup polls and petitions. Overall, the story breakdown shows that the Republican was flooded with nearly three times as many political stories, and almost four times as many stories PC World classified as “slanted.” The results, which you should definitely read in full, highlight a big problem with Facebook’s echo chamber, but it’s hard to say how much of an impact these fake stories actually have on the reader. The spread of fake news on social media is largely isolated to — and shared by — the individuals who already hold a certain belief. Would eliminating those 10 fake news stories have measurably changed the outlook of the Republican user, when even the factual stories on both sides are dramatically slanted in terms of tone and content? It’s impossible to say, but it’s certainly worth consideration. Trending right now:",

      "text": "Facebook puts faith in UK tech with pledge to add 500 jobs Number of British employees to increase 50% when new headquarters open in London Read next by: Madhumita Murgia , European Technology Correspondent \nFacebook will hire an extra 500 employees in the UK next year, boosting its British headcount by 50 per cent when it opens its new London office in the latest sign of technology companies pledging confidence in the capital. \nThe California-based social media group’s plans to expand in Britain follow Google’s announcement last week to hire an extra 3,000 people while Amazon and Apple are both taking up new lodgings in London over the next few years with room for expansion. \nSadiq Khan, the London mayor, said Facebook’s decision to expand in London showed its strength as a tech hub “keeps on growing”. He added: “The capital’s vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook’s continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.” \nNicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s European head, will announce the new jobs at the CBI annual conference on Monday, where she will also discuss Facebook ’s latest strategy to help small businesses expand by connecting them to customers around the world via Facebook. \n“We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1,500 people,” Ms Mendelsohn said. “Many of those new roles will be high-skilled engineering jobs, as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US and is where we have developed new products like Workplace.” Related article Berlin claims post-Brexit success in luring start-ups German capital says five have relocated from London and dozens more may follow \nShe said more than 300m people were connected via Facebook to small British businesses, about 10 per cent in Britain. “The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook’s story,” she said. \nLast week, Google announced plans to hire an additional 3,000 people in its London office over the next few years, in an effort to widen its pool of global engineering talent. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, also announced an expansion of the search group’s digital skills training programme in the UK, which will include training in social media, web analytics and ecommerce in 100 cities and towns across the country. \nDespite foreign companies casting a clear vote of confidence in the UK after the Brexit referendum, leaders of both large and small tech groups continue to worry about accessing skilled global talent. \n“We need clarity about the existing EU employees, and we need a regime that allows for frictionless movement of talent,” said Julian David, chief executive of industry body TechUK, whose members include Facebook and Google. “It’s the same across every part of the tech industry, from start-ups to highly established large companies.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

(CBS News/AP) – The driver of an elementary school bus that crashed in Chattanooga, killing at least five children, has been arrested and faces charges including vehicular homicide. \nCalling the Monday afternoon crash “every public safety professional’s worst nightmare,” Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher told an overnight news conference that 24-year-old bus driver Johnthony Walker was charged with five counts of vehicular homicide. Walker was also charged with reckless driving and reckless endangerment. Johnthony Walker, 24, is being charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving. ( HAMILTON COUNTY, TN SHERIFF’S OFFICE) \nFletcher said earlier that investigators were looking at speed “very, very strongly” as a factor in the crash. \nPolice said overnight that five children were killed in the crash. Earlier in the day, Hamilton County District Attorney Neal Pinkston told news outlets the crash killed six. The Associated Press wasn’t immediately able to reach officials early Tuesday to clarify the discrepancy. \nOne student who was on the bus told CBS Chattanooga affiliate WDEF-TV the driver “wasn’t paying attention and was going real fast.” \nThe National Transportation Safety Board tweeted that a team would be heading to Chattanooga Tuesday morning to investigate.",

May and John Ruskay 6:04 a.m. EST November 22, 2016 The new 'anti-terrorism' package builds on an already shameful legacy. Eid prayer in Moscow on Sept. 12, 2016. (Photo: Yuri Kochetkov, epa) \nWhile Russia’s foreign policy was frequently discussed during this election year, Russian policy at home merits similar scrutiny by the American people and the incoming administration. President Putin signed a package of laws in July that includes the most repressive legislation since the Soviet era against the right of freedom of religion or belief. Under the pretext of fighting terrorism, the package includes a particularly chilling measure, especially for evangelical Protestants and others who actively share their faith. The new measure makes it a crime to engage in religious activities that range from preaching and teaching to religious publishing, anywhere in Russia besides government-approved sites. \nAfter Putin signed the package into law, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), on which we serve as commissioners, condemned its enactment . The United States, its people, and the world community should do likewise today. \nUnfortunately, this is hardly the first attempt during the Putin era to equate peaceful religious behavior with terrorism or extremism. For nearly a decade, Russian authorities have targeted innocent people of faith by deploying against them an anti-extremism law that requires neither using nor advocating violence for actions to be labeled “extremism.” Under this law, authorities have arrested people ranging from peaceful readers of Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi to the pacifist Jehovah’s Witnesses for distributing their literature. Convicted individuals face up to four years in prison. \nThe new anti-terrorism package builds on this shameful legacy by increasing the prison terms included in the extremism law . \nIn addition, the new law targets “missionary” activity in several ways. Trump's Kafkaesque bromance with Putin: Our view \nIt allows only religious organizations that officially have registered with the Russian state to engage in such work. Many religious groups, particularly evangelical Protestants, do not register because registration is against their faith or because Russian authorities simply refuse to register them. \nThe new law also restricts the kinds of beliefs that will be honored or can be shared with others. For example, it bans even discussion of “ refusal on religious grounds of medical assistance,” which could be used against Christian Scientists or Jehovah’s Witnesses due to their views on medicine. The law also bans “motivating citizens to refuse to fulfill their civic duties set by law.\" Such a ban may be used against those who conscientiously object to military service based on their religion. \nFinally, the new measure limits missionary activity to land and buildings that registered religious associations own, as well as to their pilgrimage sites, cemeteries, and those educational institutions used for religious ceremonies. \nThus, door-to-door discussion of beliefs could be banned, as could the sharing of beliefs in residential buildings. Since evangelicals attend house churches, many will fall under the law’s reach. \nAlong with possible prison terms, individuals deemed to have violated the law could face fines approaching 1 million rubles. The fine for organizations ranges from 100,000 to 1 million rubles ($1500 to $15,000). Since unregistered groups are considered illegal entities, individual members also could be prosecuted. \nProsecutions already have begun. \nOn July 22, Aleksei Telius, a Baptist pastor who organized a children’s summer camp in Noyabrsk, was fined 5,000 rubles . On August 14, Donald Ossewaarde, an American Baptist, was fined 40,000 rubles for holding religious services in his own home in Oryol.",

Joerik and Pauline, who had come to India last year on a backpacking trip, covered a distance of 13,560 km.\n(Photo: Facebook)\nWhile on their journey, Joerik even proposed to Pauline on the banks of the Ganges. They later got married in a simple ceremony in Bali, Indonesia.\n(Photo: Facebook)\nAfter their six-month-long backpacking trip ended, the duo came back to India to relax in an Ashram in Kerala. Over there they came up with the decision to return to Holland via a van. Their Facebook page serves as an interesting account of their experiences and also helped them crowd-fund their travels.",

New to the parade this year are the characters from DreamWorks's upcoming Trolls . Returning to the parade route are Ronald McDonald, Thomas the Tank Engine, Hello Kitty and Sinclair Oil's Dino. But how does the retail giant choose which characters will appear in the lineup ? \nBalloon characters are chosen in different ways. For example, in 2011, Macy’s requested B. Boy after parade organizers saw the Tim Burton retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. (The company had been adding a series of art balloons to the parade lineup since 2005, which it called the Blue Sky Gallery.) When it comes to commercial balloons, though, it appears to be all about the Benjamins. First-time balloons cost at least $190,000—this covers admission into the parade and the cost of balloon construction. After the initial year, companies can expect to pay Macy’s about $90,000 to get a character into parade lineup. If you consider that the balloons are out for only an hour or so , that’s about $1500 a minute. Those figures are also from several years ago, so no doubt the cost of balloons has seen some inflation since then ( ba-dum-tss ). \nHave you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

      "text": "False headlines on social media have scores of people believing news that isn't true. This week, social media giants Facebook and Google decided ... \nZuckerberg has been adamant about making sure all points of views have a place on Facebook, but he took time out from an international conference to address the growing debate over fake news. And some say questionable decisions Facebook made months ago might have made the problem worse, reports CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told global leaders in Peru he wants to connect the world. \nBut even as he demonstrated virtual reality to Peru’s president, he was forced to deal with a more troubling reality back at home -- the seemingly unchecked proliferation of “fake” news on the site. A Facebook representative addressed the controversy Monday.“The amount of news that is on our site, that is, as you would call it, fake news, is very small, but we’re not satisfied with that,” said Nicola Mendelsohn. Zuckerberg outlined seven ways the social media giant hopes to curtail misinformation on the site, including “stronger detection” measures, “easy reporting” of fake stories by users, “third party verification” by fact-checking organizations, and possibly adding “warnings,” flagging false stories by third parties or the Facebook community. But critics say Zuckerberg’s proposed fixes are too little, too late. “I think as a diplomatic answer it was great, but you know, I think what people really want are more specifics and he failed to deliver that,” said Gizmodo technology editor Michael Nunez. Adam Schrader was contracted to work for Facebook’s “trending topics” division in May. He said he was laid off four months later and the division was eliminated.He said Zuckerberg himself maybe was not responsible for seeing this problem coming, “but leaders within the company should’ve been paying more attention to what was you know showing up in people’s news feeds for sure.” Schrader ‘s job was to help make sure that inaccurate news didn’t trend on Facebook. But he said his trending topics division was eliminated just weeks after criticism earlier this year, that Facebook’s information gatekeepers were suppressing conservative viewpoints. He said his division could have helped minimize the amount of fake news. \n“By stopping fake news from trending, you’re likely to stop fake news from spreading further and I think one of the biggest principles of journalism is making sure people have truthful accurate and fair news,” Schrader said. \nWhen asked how much personal responsibility Facebook users should bear in making sure the news they read or share is accurate, Schrader said it’s unrealistic for everyone to fact-check all the news on their feeds, so it’s up to the distributor – in this case Facebook – to step in. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

This is it. This effort from Serbia's fourth tier is officially the worst miss of all time. Note his teammate's pure disbelief at the end. pic.twitter.com/dNW9Jn2Ema — Andy Ha (@_AndyHa) November 22, 2016 \nIt took skill to miss a goal from that close. It took panache. That is no ordinary miss. That was harder to miss than it was to make, considerably harder to miss than it was to make , and this Serbian fourth-division striker showed us magic. \nGod bless this miss, and god bless that striker, who may have to retire from the game after this video goes viral.

(Photo: Nam Y. Huh, AP) \nAirport officials warned Thanksgiving fliers to arrive early to airports as the holiday rush kicks into high gear. \nMother Nature appeared to be cooperating, with few significant weather problems expected at major airline hubs between now and Thanksgiving night. But airports will be busy. \nThanksgiving travel ramps up Tuesday before reaching a crescendo on Wednesday, which is one of the year’s busiest days for air travel. This year’s Thanksgiving travel period could be a record one. \nMore than 27 million passengers — a record for the holiday — were expected to fly on U.S. airlines worldwide between Nov. 18 and Nov. 29, according to the Airlines for America trade group. \nAllow extra time, expect busy terminals \n\"The key during this busy travel week is to give yourself extra time and to plan ahead,\" Kevin Dillon, the airport chief at Connecticut’s Bradley International Airport near Hartford, said in a statement . \nDillon’s statement was just one of dozens of similar statements issued by airport officials across the nation. \nAt Los Angeles International, officials there said they expected LAX to be the USA’s busiest “the busiest origin-and-destination airport” – or the busiest U.S. airport if connecting passengers are excluded. Officials predicted a record 2.3 million passengers would fly through LAX during an 11-day window around Thanksgiving. \n“Travelers will need to ‘pack their patience’ as they’ll be sharing the roadways, terminals and gate areas with between 215,000 to 232,000 passengers” during the period’s busiest days, the airport said in a statement . “The slowest travel days are Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday with between 162,000 to 190,000 passengers.” \nAside from the possibility of busy terminals and long lines at check-in and security, numerous airports have also warned passengers to expect heavier-than-usual traffic on entrance roadways that could add extra time in getting to the airport.

      "text": "Facebook downsizes SMB sales in Europe, reportedly cuts 30 jobs in Germany Posted Most students can’t tell fake news from real news, study shows \nAs Facebook’s advertising business continues to grow globally , the social network is also streamlining operations in certain markets. TechCrunch has learned that Facebook is consolidating sales operations in Europe focused on small and medium businesses. In the process it is laying off around 30 people including employees in Hamburg, according to a source among those cut. \n30 is a small proportion of Facebook’s overall employee count of 15,724 (as of the end of September). It’s notable for a company that has not made regular practice of laying people off. \nIt’s not clear what the subtext might be for this latest cut, if any. Facebook declined to provide a comment for this story (we’re still asking). \nFrom what we understand, the company’s SMB director in Europe, Middle East and Africa, Stefanos Loukakos, who is based out of Facebook’s global headquarters in Dublin, made the cuts to consolidate SMB operations across fewer locations. \nOur source said that the Hamburg office covered Facebook’s SMB business in German-speaking markets (Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as Turkey and Israel — regions that will now be covered from SMB sales offices in Dublin and Lisbon. \nThere will still be SMB activity in Hamburg and across Germany, where Facebook does some marketing outreach to SMBs in the form of online content and events. \nOther small rounds of layoffs this year have pointed to bigger thematic changes at the company. They included around 40 people going in the wake of Facebook restructuring parts of its ad-tech business, specifically at LiveRail, which has since been shut down . \nThere were also reportedly around 15-18 contractors let go who had been working on Facebook’s Trending team, a group tasked with curating news for Facebook. News has been a problematic area for the social network for a while , but it’s come into the spotlight especially this year, as many have accused Facebook of being a haven for disseminating fake news . Facebook’s still trying to fix this . \nTurning back to today’s news, in September, Facebook announced that it had hit 4 million advertisers on its platform, and while it does not break out specific numbers or the performance of specific regions, it’s been long understood that small and medium businesses form a large part of that base, both in the U.S. and internationally. \nBut over the years, there have been some tense moments between Facebook and SMBs , as Facebook has sought to build out more of its paid ad products over organic reach (that is, unpaid distribution) on the platform. \nMore generally, Facebook has been shuttering parts of its ad business that are seeing less activity. Just last week, it closed down the ad-serving part of its Atlas platform to focus on Atlas’s measurement tools. \nIn the German market, meanwhile, Facebook has not been a stranger to regulatory heat, specifically from the country’s data protection watchdog. In March, it became the subject of an antitrust privacy probe , and in September Germany was the first country in Europe to order Facebook to stop tapping into data from WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook. (That’s now extended to all of Europe.) \nWe’ll update this story as we learn more. \nFeatured Image: Sean Gallup/Getty Images 0",

      "text": "print \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nStudents have a tough time distinguishing between ads and news, and understanding conflicts of interest in information that is presented as fact, according to a new Stanford study reviewed by The Wall Street Journal . \nThe study comes at a time when Facebook and Google are being loudly criticized for helping spread fake news during a contentious presidential election. A recent study by BuzzFeed showed that in the lead-up to the election, the top fake-news stories on Facebook outperformed legitimate news stories shared by some of the most popular media companies. \nBut some hoped that the social-media savvy of younger generations might help them better separate truth from falsehood online. This study suggests that’s simply not the case, at least at a young age. \nAccording to the study, 82% of middle-schoolers couldn’t tell the difference between a news article and an ad labeled “sponsored content.” Similarly, “ more than two out of three middle-schoolers couldn’t see any valid reason to mistrust a post written by a bank executive arguing that young adults need more financial-planning help,” the Journal reports. \nIn middle school, it seems, the fact that the source of a piece of information could lead to bias isn’t understood. \nThe study included 7,804 students from middle school through college.",

      "text": "Fake news sites designed to trick you This is not a fake news story. Facebook's stock is actually red hot lately. Shares of the social network have rebounded sharply in the past few days after a post-Election Day pummeling. \nConcerns about how Donald Trump would treat tech companies and allegations that fake stories on Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) helped Trump beat Hillary Clinton weighed on the stock. Shares fell nearly 10% between November 8 and November 14. \nBut since then, Facebook's stock has bounced back by about 7%. \nSo what happened? \nMany big tech stocks initially tanked after Trump was elected to be the next president due to fears he would be an enemy of Silicon Valley. Trump feuded with leaders in the tech sector, most notably Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) CEO Jeff Bezos, on Twitter throughout the campaign. \nSome tech executives even suggested after Trump won that California should secede from the United States. (Good luck with that.) \nMaking matters worse for Facebook, were the problems it faced with its news feed algorithm. \nA few Clinton supporters accused Facebook of helping Trump win the election because of a preponderance of false news reports popping up on the site -- many of which were extremely negative about Clinton. \nFor example, First Lady Michelle Obama did NOT delete tweets about Clinton. But stories suggesting she had somehow made it to Facebook. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially refused to even consider that Facebook could have influenced voters. But in a surprising turn, the company announced just a few days ago that it was making tweaks in order to fight the scourge of fake news. \nRelated: Zuckerberg says Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news \nThat change of heart probably helped Facebook's stock a bit. Advertisers can't like the fact that Facebook's feed might be able to be gamed. Facebook has to seriously address fake news. \nAnother factor behind the stock's fall and subsequent comeback? The company admitted that there have been errors with some of its internal metrics. \nThat could be a significant problem if it leads marketers to try and negotiate lower ad rates or, worse, ditch the platform altogether. But that seems unlikely. \nWith Facebook's monthly user base approaching 2 billion, advertisers may have to put up with the company's auditing issues. There simply aren't many other platforms that offer marketers this much scope and reach. \nWhat's more, it seems Facebook is doing the right thing for its customers and is admitting candidly that there are issues that it still needs to work on. Investors probably like that as well. \nThere a couple of other factors that can explain Facebook's comeback. \nThe company's Instagram subsidiary is continuing to roll out new features that could make it more competitive with Snapchat. (Although a cynic would argue that Instagram is simply copying Snapchat.) \nFacebook also just announced a $6 billion stock buyback program. \nNow on the one hand, that might be a sign that Facebook is maturing and has nothing better to do with its cash. Other \"older\" tech companies like Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) , Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) and even Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) have bought back stock recently. \nBut Wall Street tends to cheer buybacks for two reasons. First, it's a sign that a company feels its own stock is worth investing in. And second, buying back stock reduces the number of shares outstanding -- which, in turn, boosts earnings per share. \nFinally, tech stocks in general have rebounded in the past week. The Nasdaq is now at an all-time high. Trump is probably not going to wage war with Silicon Valley after all and the Golden State is not going to become the Golden Nation State. \nFacebook investors probably don't have that much to worry about. Shares are still up more than 15% this year. The company is now worth $350 billion. And sales continue to grow at an impressive clip thanks to its core platform, Instagram and WhatsApp. \nSo Facebook should be fine for the next four years. \nIf nothing else, its nearly 2 billion users are going to have a lot to talk about and share thanks to Trump being in the White House. And hey. Maybe most of that content won't turn out to be fictitious either. \n 07 PM ET",

      "text": "What goes up doesn’t necessarily come down in one piece. That’s what Facebook seems to be finding out during its tests of prototype systems designed to get the world online.\nThe social network cooed when its stratospheric Internet-spewing drone, Aquila, took to the skies for the first time back in July. But while the test flight lasted three times longer than planned, it didn’t end so well. Facebook engineers noted at the time that the aircraft suffered a “structural failure” during the flight. But according to Bloomberg , the National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating the incident, and now says that the aircraft experienced “substantial” damage.\n\nLiftoff for the Aquila went very smoothly. It’s the second big setback for Facebook’s plans to bathe the planet in Internet access. Back in September, a SpaceX rocket containing the Amos 6 communications satellite exploded on the launchpad . A large chunk of the satellite’s spectrum was reserved for use by Facebook as part of its plan to roll out wireless broadband across the globe. The explosion has since been found to be the result of a fueling problem , but that’s no consolation to Mark Zuckerberg, who at the time said that “the problem isn’t the money; it’s that now it may take longer to connect people.”\nClearly, Zuckerberg is feeling the frustration that come with testing exotic hardware. (It’s almost as if it’s more difficult than building a website.)\nStill, it’s understandable: two-thirds of the company’s three-part plan to connect the world  is now mired in technical issues. The third route to providing a global Internet, by the way, is a new breed of wireless networks . At least they don’t need to be airborne.\n(Read more: Bloomberg , The New Yorker , “ Facebook’s Three-Point Plan to Get Four Billion More People Online ,” “ Facebook Is Testing a Super-Speed Public Wi-Fi System ,” “ Meet Facebook’s Stratospheric Internet Drone ”)",

But false articles can, to borrow a word from our next president, \"bigly\"impact how some people view the truth. The Denver Post published a story with the headline\" There is no such thing as the Denver Guardian, despite that Facebook post you saw. Denver Post \nDays after Donald Trump was elected president, Zuckerberg said it was \"pretty crazy\" to think fake news could have influenced the election and warned Facebook \"must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth.\" \nLess than two weeks later, with the issue still simmering, Zuckerberg shared a more detailed account of projects he said were already underway to thwart the spread of misinformation. \nWhile Zuckerberg didn't delve into the details, a post Friday night provided a seven-point plan for how Facebook plans to do its part to help rid the social network of fake news stories. \n\"Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway,\" he wrote. \nFacebook's approach has leaned on a mix of humans and algorithms, but Zuckerberg said even more can be done to foster \"stronger detection.\" \n\"The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,\" he said. \nHe also said he wants to make it easier for people to flag fake stories and that Facebook will focus on \"raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under linked in News Feed.\" \nFacebook is also exploring the concept of working with fact-checking organizations to provide a third party verification to stories and the idea of labeling stories that have been flagged as false. \nZuckerberg's post comes amid a BuzzFeed report that \"renegade\" Facebook employees had organized their own task force to take on fake news. \n\"It's now more important than ever that platforms are trustworthy or believable,\" Talan said. People need to \"know when something is accurate or not.\" \nAside from the approach of having the community and algorithms flag stories, Facebook is also taking on the lucrative business of fake news. \nSome faux outlets can potentially make money by running advertisement's from Facebook's network — something the company made clear last week won't be tolerated.

      "text": "(BigStock Photo). In the crucial final months of the election, Facebook engagement with bogus news stories outpaced legitimate news, according to BuzzFeed’s analysis . It’s an alarming trend, particularly when you look to the future. A new generation is coming of age — one that has been raised on social media and the unfiltered, unregulated Internet.\nStunner from @CraigSilverman : Fake news *beat* real news on Facebook over last 3 months of election https://t.co/y1rgvV5rDs pic.twitter.com/U5sR7lJADM \n— Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) November 16, 2016 \nDespite growing up digital natives, this group is wildly under-equipped to filter what they see on social media and websites for accuracy.\nThat’s according to a new study, published by Stanford University History Education Group (SHEG) for the Robert McCormick Foundation.\nResearchers asked middle school, high school, and college students to complete 56 tasks, like differentiating an ad from a news story and determining which tweet in a series is most reliable. They analyzed 7,804 student responses, surveying kids from under-resourced inner-city schools and well-resourced suburban schools. College assessments were administered at six universities, including Stanford.\n“Overall, young people’s ability to reason about information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: Bleak ,” writes Sam Wineburg, a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education and the lead author of the study.\nEighty-two percent of middle school students surveyed couldn’t tell the difference between an ad labeled “sponsored content” and a real news story.\nIn a faux Facebook argument over gun control, high school students were asked whether a New York Times article one person cited or a chart from the Minnesota Gun Owners PAC was a more reliable source. Half of the students found the chart to be better evidence because it had “more information.” Less than 10 percent of students said the NYT article was stronger.\nSixty percent of college students failed to produce accurate results when asked to spend eight minutes investigating whether Planned Parenthood’s founder supported euthanasia. They frequently cited Google results from pro-life sites like Life News.\nThe Stanford researchers behind the project were floored.\n“We even rejected possible tasks because we thought they would be too easy,” writes Wineburg. “Our first round of piloting shocked us into reality. Many people assume that because young people are fluent in social media they are equally savvy about what they find there. Our work shows the opposite to be true.”\nFacebook and Google parent, Alphabet, are trying to curb the dissemination of fake news on their platforms but they won’t be able to eliminate misleading content on the web altogether. That’s why SHEG created the study. It includes each of the exercises researchers used to measure students media literacy. They want educators to use it as a guide to assess and teach students how to be smarter online.\n“Never before have citizens had so much information at their fingertips,” writes Wineburg. “Whether this bounty will make us smarter and better informed or stupider and more narrow-minded will depend on our awareness of this problem and our educational response to it. At present, we worry that democracy is threatened by the ease at which disinformation about civic issues is allowed to spread and flourish.”",

      "text": "Oregon lawmaker asked to step down after sharing Facebook video of blacks being mowed down by cars Outrage as Oregon pol shares video of blacks being mowed down NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  25 PM \nAn Oregon lawmaker is being asked to step down after he shared a disturbing video on Facebook of blacks being mowed down by cars. \nIt is believed that Daniel Benjamin, a city councilor in Salem, did not shoot the footage in the video, according to TV station KATU . However, local activist Teressa Raiford blasted him for sharing it, telling the station that \"it's very indecent when it comes from public officials.\" \nThe video, according to the station, shows a series of collisions between cars and people. Benjamin also includes a comment from conservative blogger Ron Dwyer, who says \"as this video shows people are starting to get tired of the Black Lives Matter bullies blocking the roadways,\" according to the station. \n\"I think it's sickening and it's pretty much disgusting,\" Raiford, lead organizer for Don't Shoot Portland, told the station. \"You're promoting racial intimidation and harassment and possibly murder. He needs to resign ... Ask him to resign or just go ahead and get done with him.\" \nHiker who fell into Yellowstone hot spring 'dissolved overnight' \nSalem Mayor Anna Peterson told the station that she spoke with Benjamin after the video \"actually made my stomach churn.\" Salem City Councilor Daniel Benjamin is facing criticism after sharing video on Facebook of blacks being mowed down by cars. (KATU) \n\"I told him that I was disappointed and shocked at the video and I suggested that he take it down,\" Peterson told KATU . \"We're striving hard to let people in the community know that the city of Salem stands firmly beside the civil rights of every person in this city.\" \nWhile the mayor can't remove Benjamin from office, she told the station that the City Council can punish a councilor if they conduct themselves poorly. \nBenjamin did not immediately respond to the Daily News for comment, but told KATU that the post was not racist, and anyone who does not like it can simply unfriend him. \n\"To infer I'm a racist is actually racist,\" he told the station. Benjamin might face sanctions from the City Council over the video. (KATU) \nBenjamin had written that the video was \"courtesy of Devious Keely. Give her page a like.\" Keely told the station that the video was being \"re-purposed into things I never meant it to mean.\" \n\"It was passed to me from friends of mine that I just put together in a mash-up,\" Keely told the station. \"A lot of it is from news feeds like local stations such as yourself.\" \nKeely emphasized that the video had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter or anything Trump related. Keely told the station it's \"just people not understanding that blocking roadways is 1) Illegal in most states without a permit, and 2) Dangerous and something that one should not do.\" Join the Conversation:",

(Photo: Biondo Productions, courtesy of MGM Resorts International)\nChef Masaharu Morimoto has more than a dozen restaurants in as many cities, adding Las Vegas to his roster on October 21 when he debuted his eponymous concept at MGM Grand. Sin City has its fair share of celebrity chefs, and Morimoto brings his signature Japanese cuisine and a one-of-a-kind teppan concept. We asked the Iron Chef four brief questions about finally opening on the Strip. Here's what he has to say.\nWhat brings you to Las Vegas now?\nPeople choose to come to Las Vegas from all over the world. I wanted to take the challenge. I mean, who doesn’t like Vegas?\nWhat's your impression of the city's food scene and what do you want to bring to it?\nIt’s an honor to be able to open a restaurant in Las Vegas alongside fellow celebrity chefs. It's great — we talk about Vegas when we see each other.\nMy whole team will work together and bring our best while maintaining the consistency of our style.\nUSA TODAY\nAround the world in NYC kitchens: Cook Japanese with chef Morimoto\nWhat do we have to order at the new restaurant?\nTeppan menu. Morimoto Las Vegas has my first Teppan tables in the U.S. I see Teppan as a tool that allows our chefs to cook right in front of the guests so I want to try new things there.\nHow often will you be in Las Vegas?\nI’ll come back as much as I can to make sure we're doing things right. I don’t come to Vegas to play casino games, but I suppose I just made a bet of a lifetime. I’ll be here often, so I don’t lose.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Chef Masaharu Morimoto's restaurants and dishes Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nTEXAS (CBSDFW.COM) – Thanksgiving smells like bacon for most Texans. \nThe state ranks number one in the number of people who wrap their turkey in bacon, according to Honeysuckle White-brand turkey, which compiled some facts from a national survey the company conducted. \nTexas also ranks in the top three states watching football on Thanksgiving, right behind Colorado and Oklahoma. \nNearly half of Texans go to two or more Thanksgivings, too and 91 percent ranked turkey an important part of the Thanksgiving meal while only 64 percent said cranberry sauce was important. \nWhile dinner guests are feast hopping between Tryptophan induced naps, there’s little rest for many hosts. Twenty-five percent of Texas hosts awake before 6 a.m. to start preparations for the big meal. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nSAN ANTONIO (AP) — A murdered San Antonio police detective was a genuine and generous man who took seriously his job of protecting the community both on duty and off, his friends said. \nDetective Benjamin Marconi’s immediate family members declined to comment, but a friend, Mike Bobo, who owns a deli in San Antonio, said Marconi never wavered from doing what was right. \n“You come across people in your life that will judge or demean or say things about other people jokingly or not,” Bobo said Monday. “He would never be that person.” \nMarconi, 50, the father of two grown children, was fatally shot Sunday as he sat in his patrol car writing a traffic ticket. \nA 31-year-old man upset about a custody dispute has been arrested in the shooting. The man, Otis Tyrone McKane , apologized during an exchange with reporters as he was being led Monday to the Bexar County jail. He’s charged with capital murder. \nFormer state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, a longtime friend of Marconi, told the San Antonio Express-News that the officer always kept safety in mind and would threaten to take the car keys of people at bars he deemed unfit to drive. \n“He was always the first one to tell somebody, ‘I’m taking your car keys away. Time to stop.’ He never stopped being the protector, even in a social situation,” Van de Putte told the newspaper. \nAt times he would pass along advice to her grandchildren. \n“He was so good with little ones. He would say, ‘You make good choices, because I have to deal with people that don’t make good choices, and then they have to go to the big timeout. You know what the big timeout is, don’t you?’” she said. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)",

      "text": "I guess Kendall let Kylie do her makeup for the Facebook live because according to Kylie there was soooo much confusion as to whether Kendall had gotten lip injections or not. \nKylie said in a Snapchat video after the interview, \nYou guys, Kendall let me over line her lip today with lipliner and everyone thinks she got lip injections. I’m sorry Kendall. \n(Personally, I’m not convinced many people thought Kendall got injections. Seems kind of like Kylie is just fishing for compliments on her mad lip makeup skillz, but whatever.) \nKendall didn’t seem to mind too much since she was laughing as Kylie imposed the puppy filter on her face. Snapchat \nOf course, Kylie is apologizing for/bragging about her makeup abilities when she COULD be apologizing copying an artist’s work for a Kylie Cosmetics marketing campaign … but again, whatever. \nLook, Kylie doesn’t have time to correct every wrong in her life, right now, OK? \nShe’s got all these tiny puppies to take care of ever since her dog Bambi unexpectedly gave birth on Sunday. \nIn fact, she’s so busy she didn’t even have to go to the American Music Awards to cheer on her friend Gigi Hadid while she was hosting. \nKylie posted new pictures of her two new babies, who are already looking bigger and more adorable. Snapchat \nWell, you can’t blame Kylie for not wanting to leave these guys.

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nBy Lisa Haven\nWith the election of Donald Trump as our president, many people are pushing the idea that our economy is going to take off like a rocket despite the fact that we have been and are on the greatest unfixable debt binge in world history. If truth be told, the economy was already on its way out due to Obama tripping our debt and I fear that the globalists just might “let it all fall” under Trumps presidency—a president who they deeply detest and will stop at nothing to destroy because he is a nationalist.\nIn the video below I reveal that even though President-Elect Donald Trump is about to take office, and make VERY good changes for America, it won’t come without a backlash from the globalists. I do believe there is a real danger headed our way and the cards are already starting to fall. All that and more in this report….\nGET TIGERSTREAM- https://tigerstream.tv/\nAccording to Michael Snider at the Economic Collapse Blog these 11 things Donald Trump will inherit from Obama:\n#1 Nearly 7 out of every 10 Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. That means that about two-thirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment.\n#2 Reuters is reporting that U.S. mall investors are poised to lose “billions” of dollars as the “retail apocalypse” in this nation deepens.\n#3 Credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since 2012.\n#4 Approximately 35 percent of all Americans have a debt that is at least 180 days past due.\n#5 The rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a 50 year low.\n#6 The total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost 10 million.\n#7 The number of homeless people in New York City (where Donald Trump is from) has hit a brand new record high.\n#8 About 20 percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents.\n#9 Total household debt in the United States has now reached a grand total of 12.3 trillion dollars.\n#10 The total amount of corporate debt in the U.S. has nearly doubled since the end of 2007.\n#11 When Barack Obama entered the White House, the U.S. government was 10.6 trillion dollars in debt. Today, the U.S. national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of $19,842,173,949,869.58.\nPlease remember virtually every stock market crash came after a major bond crash, and today, bonds are beginning to crash in a massive way. So please be ready, you never know what tomorrow holds.\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

      "text": "Getty Images Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook 's chief executive, has cultivated relationships with China 's leaders, including President Xi Jinping . He has paid multiple visits to the country to meet its top internet executives. He has made an effort to learn Mandarin. \nInside Facebook, the work to enter China runs far deeper. \nThe social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social network has been blocked, these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, the people added. \nMore from The New York Times: \nFake news in U.S. election? Elsewhere, that's nothing new \nFacebook, in cross hairs after election, is said to question its influence \nUsing Twitter's new expanded mute powers \nFacebook has restricted content in other countries before, such as Pakistan , Russia and Turkey , in keeping with the typical practice of American internet companies that generally comply with government requests to block certain content after it is posted. Facebook blocked roughly 55,000 pieces of content in about 20 countries between July 2015 and December 2015, for example. But the new feature takes that a step further by preventing content from appearing in feeds in China in the first place. \nFacebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it would offer the software to enable a third party — in this case, most likely a partner Chinese company — to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network, the people said. Facebook's partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users' feeds. \nThe current and former Facebook employees caution that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering China and, like many experiments inside Facebook, it may never see the light of day. The feature, whose code is visible to engineers inside the company, has so far gone unused, and there is no indication that Facebook has offered it to the authorities in China. \nBut the project illustrates the extent to which Facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements, \"to make the world more open and connected,\" to gain access to a market of 1.4 billion Chinese people. Even as Facebook faces pressure to continue growing — Mr. Zuckerberg has often asked where the company's next billion users will come from — China has been cordoned off to the social network since 2009 because of the government's strict rules around censorship of user content. \nThe suppression software has been contentious within Facebook, which is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its users after the American presidential election's unexpected outcome spurred questions over fake news on the social network. Several employees who were working on the project have left Facebook after expressing misgivings about it, according to the current and former employees. \nA Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, \"We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country.\" She added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into China. \nFacebook's tricky position underscores the difficulties that many American internet companies have had gaining access to China. For years, companies like Google and Twitter have been blocked there for refusing to yield to the government's demands around censorship. In 2010, Google said it was directing users of its search engine in China to its service in Hong Kong , because of censorship and intrusion from hackers. Other companies, like the professional social networking service LinkedIn , agreed to censor some content on their platforms in China. \nThe current climate for internet companies in China may not help Facebook. In August, the ride-hailing giant Uber gave up an expensive battle to crack the Chinese market, selling its Chinese business to an incumbent rival , Didi Chuxing. More broadly, China has streamlined and tightened its controls over the internet under President Xi, targeting influential social media celebrities and adding new reviews to popular online video sites. \n\nStill, some officials responsible for China's tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of Facebook's operating in the country. It would legitimize China's strict style of internet governance, and if done according to official standards, would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic. Even so, resistance remains at the top levels of Chinese leadership. \nSome analysts have said Facebook's best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor. Finding a partner — and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in Facebook's China operation — would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the Silicon Valley company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company's government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with Beijing . \nFacebook and Chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few years about the social network's entering the market, according to employees who were involved in the discussions, though the two sides have been unable to reach a compromise. \nFacebook currently sells advertising for some Chinese businesses from its Hong Kong office. Among its customers are state-media sites that act as the propaganda arm of the Chinese government, and that operate official accounts where they post articles. Chinese citizens who wish to gain access to Facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network, or VPN. \nIt's unclear when the suppression tool originated, but the project picked up momentum in the last year, as engineers were plucked from other parts of Facebook to work on the effort, the current and former employees said. The project was led by Vaughan Smith, a vice president for mobile, corporate and business development at Facebook, they said. Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Smith speaks a smattering of Mandarin. \nUnveiling a new censorship tool in China could lead to more demands to suppress content from other countries. The fake-news problem, which has hit countries across the globe , has already led some governments to use the issue as an excuse to target sites of political rivals, or shut down social media sites altogether. \nOver the summer, several Facebook employees who were working on the suppression tool left the company, the current and former employees said. Internally, so many employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forum that, in July, it became a topic at one of Facebook's weekly Friday afternoon question-and-answer sessions. \nMr. Zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience about the tool. He told the gathering that Facebook's China plans were nascent. But he also struck a pragmatic tone about the future, according to employees who attended the session. \n\"It's better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it's not yet the full conversation,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said, according to employees.",

      "text": "0 \nFacebook's tentative plans to crack down on fake news and hoax sites is being met with the usual conservative ire . Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to help reduce the spread of misinformation on Facebook has set off a “widespread panic” among some owners of the biggest hyperpartisan conservative pages. \nThe problem, according to the conservative acting as intermediary, is that conservatives sites were pushed into publishing fake news because They Like Money. It’s not their fault they wrote that stuff. Massoumi acknowledged that during the election his and other big pages did publish some misleading and false information, though he said they removed the latter once they realized their mistake. He said they began to push the boundaries after new players, such as sites run from Macedonia or others such as Ending the Fed, entered the market, copied their approach, and then began reaping huge Facebook engagement by publishing false and misleading content. \n“We strayed because of the competitive nature of the algorithm in the News Feed and we do need to be brought back,” he says. “But the problem is I operate in an environment where sites like Ending the Fed and these unknowns are going to beat us unless we go from tilted to misleading.” \nYeah, well. You could act responsibly anyway and get cut a smaller check, like Legitimate News Outlets do, but I suppose that thought does go against the entire conservative mindset. Touché. \nAnyhoo, the central worry is that conservatives sites thus \"pushed\" into generating crooked hoaxes will be unilaterally punished before they have a chance to \"clean up their act.\" Massoumi said he and his fellow big conservative page owners want to cooperate with Facebook to “create an environment where the news is legitimate and there is way less fake news.” They agree there are bad actors who need to be warned to clean up their act or face a permanent ban. \nWhich is a good thing, and more along the lines of what we had before conservatives complained in the first place and demanded Facebook remove all editorial discretion, but oh well. Sometimes these things need to actually crash and burn before the conservative side will acknowledge the point the not-conservative side had been making all along. \nA bit of good news is that the threat of action is already having some impact. Some small publishers who scored big viral hits with false stories are now removing them from their sites. Ending the Fed’s false story about the pope endorsing Trump and it’s false story about Obama cutting money from the military to spend it on Syrian refuges are both no longer online. (Its Facebook page is still active as of this writing.) \nAll that said, let's not kid ourselves here. Facebook has been incompetent at news curating since the beginning of this episode and there's nothing that would suggest they're going to stop being incompetent now. The company bowed to conservative demands that more conservative news be displayed on Facebook by eliminating the editorial group responsible for vetting news before it got posted. The result was, predictably, a flood of viral fake news and hoaxes, upon which the Facebook response has been to insist that they can solve the problem algorithmically, eventually, someday, if the rest of us are really going to get that upset about it. \nNow Facebook and Google both are barring hoax news sites from their ad networks, but aren't explaining how they're doing that or what happens if and when legitimate sites get caught up in that mix—it seems an effort aimed mostly at the hoax sites that got recent publicity and which are therefore generating the most humiliation for the two companies. Zuckerberg in particular seems enamored of an approach where Facebook users \"flag\" fake news and an algorithm will trundle off to bar the offending sites, and if you can't immediately deduce how that particular feature would be immediately abused to hell and back by the internet's various ideological cretins and troll farms you haven't been around very long. \nSo that's an update on where we are. Facebook is moving to restrict hoax sites, conservatives are upset about it again, and nobody gives a damn whether non-conservatives are upset about it because we do not get private ideological meetings with the founder of the company to proclaim our Itemized List of Grievances. If we did, we'd probably say \"put the damn human editors back, you louts. You and we both know damn well you can't determine the credibility of a news story based on how many likes it gets or who complains. By the time you develop an artificial intelligence capable of doing that on its own we’re all going to be hiding from the robot uprising in caves and bunkers and nobody will have any damn wi-fi connection anyway.\" \nSo let's all watch what happens, I guess. Forgive us if we’re not feeling terribly optimistic these days, but … well, look around.",

      "title": "Report: Mark Zuckerberg is so desperate to get Facebook into China, he supports censoring news",
      "text": "Facebook's wants to connect the world, even more of it than the 1.79 billion people—or more than half the global population—it's already reaching every month.\nBut there's an entire nation unable to share or react to posts: China, which has blocked Facebook, its associated sites, and its apps.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook's mobile business is bigger than ever\nBut on Tuesday, a New York Times report revealed that Facebook's been working on ways to move past that that ban—one of which involves censoring news: A tool that would prevent posts from showing up in a particular geographic region, which according to current and former Facebook employees (who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Times) the company already has.\nThis tool, according to the Times sources, isn't currently in use, and might never get used. But as the Times illustrates, it's fairly important to know if Facebook is willing to censor users' content, as the Chinese government demands. The Times sources also say that Zuckerberg supported and defended the tool.\nWhen asked about the censorship tool for China, Facebook demurred. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,\" the company said, in a statement to Mashable (part of which appeared in the Times story). \"However,\" the statement continued, \"we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.\"\nFor those who just read Facebook's statement, you may have noted that Facebook did not even remotely deny the existence of such a tool.\nWhat it did do was echo—almost verbatim—what Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said at the annual shareholders meeting in June: \"We’re learning. We’re studying about the Chinese market, and we’ll see what happens,” she said.\nDirect government cooperation is the way that Weibo, China's largest social network, is able to operate in the country, according to a report earlier this year from the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nFor now, Facebook's business does have a presence given that the company still sells advertising to Chinese companies. Twitter, which is also banned in the country, also operates a similar business.\nMeanwhile, Facebook is still failing to address the spread of fake news on its network where it is currently live: America's.\nFacebook is about to give China ability to block real stories and yet can't control fake news here. This should OUTRAGE us. https://t.co/EmH109tOHR\n— Clara Jeffery (@ClaraJeffery) November 22, 2016",

      "text": "Technology News | Tue Nov 22, 2016 | 8:19pm EST Facebook builds censorship tool to attain China re-entry: NYT left right A Facebook error message is seen in this illustration photo of a computer screen in Singapore June 19, 2014. REUTERS/Thomas White 1/2 left right In this photo illustration, a man holds an iPad with a Facebook application in an office building at the Pudong financial district in Shanghai, September 25, 2013. REUTERS/Carlos Barria 2/2 \nFacebook Inc ( FB.O ) has quietly developed a censorship tool that could persuade China to allow the world's biggest social media network to re-enter the world's second largest economy after a seven-year ban, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. \nFacebook developed the software, which suppresses posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographies, with the support of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the newspaper said, citing unnamed current and former employees. ( nyti.ms/2fPxUXQ ) \nZuckerberg in March met China's propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan who said that he hoped Facebook could strengthen exchanges and improve mutual understanding with China's internet companies, according to state news agency Xinhua. \n\"We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,\" Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \n\"However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.\" \nForeign companies in China, especially in media, face political pressure from a range of regulations. The country's military newspaper calls the internet the most important front in an ideological battle against \"Western anti-China forces.\" \nChina, which has the world's largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. \nThough Facebook has developed the new tool, it does not intend to suppress the posts itself, NYT said. \nFacebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users' feeds. \nThere is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said. It is one of many ideas Facebook has discussed with respect to entering China and it may never see the light of day, it added. \nFacebook, which has struggled in recent months to combat allegations that it unfairly removes certain content on its service, aims to continue to grow in developing nations where it currently has smaller penetration rates. \n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Above: Mobile phone with Facebook log in page. Image Credit: Lewis Mulatero — Getty Images \nFacebook has developed technology that could finally make its service palatable to Chinese authorities, who have blocked it since 2009. \nThe social network giant has quietly built a tool for blocking certain posts from showing up in feeds of users in some regions, according to a report from the New York Times , citing anonymous sources. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly a strong supporter of the tool, which could be used to censor politically sensitive content in China. \nFacebook would delegate control over which content to suppress to a third-party, most likely a Chinese business partner, according to the report. The partner would be able to see which stories or content users are sharing and then decide whether those posts should show up in Chinese users’ feeds. \nWhile software for the tool can be seen by Facebook employees on their internal system, it’s still merely one of many experiments the company has considered as part of a push to get into China and may never be officially released, notes the report. Some employees who worked on the tool have since left Facebook after expressing concerns about the project. \nRumors of this tool come at a particularly awkward time for Facebook. The company has been heavily criticized since the recent U.S. presidential election for failing to curtail the spread of false news articles on its network about the candidates. Initially, the company defended itself by saying that it’s merely a technology company and that it doesn’t want to police what users post and share. However, Facebook has since softened its stance by saying it would explore ways to cut back on fake news. \nFacebook’s development of censorship tools is driving at least partly by the potential riches of reentering China. \n“We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country. However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China,” a Facebook spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. “Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” \nThe story has been updated with a statement from Facebook. \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "text": "Gucci Mane Casually Proposed to His Girlfriend at a Hawks Game By Facebook And it was incredible. \nGucci Mane isn't a guy who seems very high strung. He's currently living his best post-prison, sober life, and yet the man exudes as much chill as ever. But proposing to your girlfriend can be one of the most stressful things a man can do. There's just so much to worry about: The ring itself, the way you ask, and of course, the setting that will forever live in both of your memories. And though proposing to your girlfriend during the \"Kiss Cam\" while sitting court side at an NBA game (specifically \"Gucci Mane Night\" at the arena) doesn't seem like the most casual thing to do, leave it to Gucci Mane to make the event a casual—and extremely cool—gesture in the name of romance. \nGucci's Mane's girlfriend, Keyshia Ka'oir, has always seemed like an awesome girlfriend for multiple reasons. For one, she stayed with Gucci Mane through his multiple stints in prison. So, loyalty...check. She also runs his Snapchat account, from which she often posts videos of the meals she's prepared for her partner. So, even though by no means is it her responsibility to cook for her partner, it's an incredibly nice thing to do. She also seems like a genuinely nice person when she posts videos to the social media platform, and to top things off, she's very, very pretty. As another Atlanta-based rapper might say, the entire thing was \"sensational.\" Loading View on Instagram \nThe one thing people might notice about Gucci's matter-of-fact proposal is the fact that he did not get on one knee to pop the question. Which is pretty much the most Gucci Mane thing ever. Plus, it's 2016, and boring, traditional rules of chivalry need not apply, and at the end of the day, she said yes!. Here's to a long, happy marriage to the newly-engaged couple. Cheers to Guwop! Up Next: Vince Staples Talks Rapper Chains",

      "text": "Posted on November 22, 2016 by Editor - Business News \nArticle Attribution and Read More at: Article Source \nFacebook Inc has quietly developed a censorship tool that could persuade China to allow the world’s biggest social media network to re-enter the world’s second largest economy after a seven-year ban, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. \nFacebook developed the software, which suppresses posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographies, with the support of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the newspaper said, citing unnamed current and former employees. \nZuckerberg in March met China’s propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan who said that he hoped Facebook could strengthen exchanges and improve mutual understanding with China’s internet companies, according to state news agency Xinhua. \n“We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \n“However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” \nForeign companies in China, especially in media, face political pressure from a range of regulations. The country’s military newspaper calls the internet the most important front in an ideological battle against “Western anti-China forces.” \nChina, which has the world’s largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. \nThough Facebook has developed the new tool, it does not intend to suppress the posts itself, NYT said. \nFacebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. \nThere is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said. It is one of many ideas Facebook has discussed with respect to entering China and it may never see the light of day, it added. \nFacebook, which has struggled in recent months to combat allegations that it unfairly removes certain content on its service, aims to continue to grow in developing nations where it currently has smaller penetration rates. \n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay) Share This:",

      "title": "Who Was the Mysterious Babushka Lady at JFK’s Assassination?",
      "text": "YouTube Like us on Facebook \nOn November 22, 1963, dozens of people in Dallas, Texas lined the streets to watch President John F. Kennedy’s motorcade pass by Dealey Plaza. In the weeks and years that followed, many of their identities became known, while others still go by identifying nicknames (such as \"Umbrella Man\" or \"Badge Man\"). Conspiracy theories have abounded since that day, including ones surrounding \"Babushka Lady,\" so-called because the mystery woman was wearing what looked like a Russian head scarf. She was standing on the grass between Elm and Main Streets, photographing the moment JFK was shot, and now, 50-some years later, we still have no idea who she is, and whatever footage she may have taken of the president’s assassination has never been found. \nA number of bystanders in Dallas took photos and videos, to varying degrees of quality, of what became the president’s assassination, and Babushka Lady appears in a few. In Dallas resident Marie Muchmore’s film (which has become one of the primary chronicles of that day), Babushka Lady appears at 0:41 , standing behind a man, Charles Brehm, and his 5-year-old son, Joe. We can only see the back of her, but she wears a long tan coat, holds her arms up by her face, and stands with a wide stance. \nIn another video, taken by U.S. postal carrier Mark Bell, Babushka Lady is visible at 0:47 after the shots were fired and the motorcade has just passed by. Her back is to the camera, but she seems to have walked closer to the street and stands across from the grassy knoll. She remains standing , while others around her are running for cover or sitting on the ground in shock. The Zapruder film, which has become possibly the most famous citizen video because it is considered the most complete, offers a frontal view of Babushka Lady at 0:37, but her camera obscures her already-blurry face. \nSeven years after the assassination, in 1970, a former dancer and singer at a burlesque club named Beverly Oliver claimed to be Babushka Lady. Oliver asserted that she photographed the assassination with her Yashica Super 8 camera, and two FBI agents took the camera from her. Oliver also claimed that she knew Jack Ruby, who supposedly introduced her to suspected JFK shooter Lee Harvey Oswald, saying Oswald was a member of the CIA. (Ruby, of course, went on to shoot Oswald while he was in custody.) Oliver’s story has some serious problems , though, and has been generally debunked. \nShe was a slender 17-year-old in 1963, which clashes with the older woman who appears in the film footage of Babushka Lady. Additionally, the Yashica Super 8 camera wasn’t produced until the mid-1960s. Oliver has backtracked on some of her claims, arguing that her camera was a prototype that she got before it became available to the general public. \nConspiracy theories involving Babushka Lady proliferate, with some theories holding more merit than others. Some say she was a Russian spy, an assassin holding a camera gun, a secret service agent, or a man dressed as an older woman (her wide stance for example, as seen in Muchmore's film, could be viewed as a bit unusual for a woman in the 1960s—especially one dressed in a time-appropriate dress and trench). Because it had been raining earlier that morning, some women in Dealey Plaza wore scarves on their heads; but, the rain had stopped at 10 a.m. , and since the shots weren’t fired until 12:30 p.m., Babushka Lady wasn’t wearing a scarf to shield herself from active rain. Perhaps she was holding binoculars rather than a camera, which would explain why her photographic or video footage has never been found. But because she never came forward to tell law enforcement what she saw (unlike other spectators who witnessed the shots being fired), her identity (and what she may know) remains a mystery.

      "text": "BEN KIRCHNER Like us on Facebook \nThe Middle Ages was no time to start a rave—but that didn’t stop Frau Troffea. On July 14, 1518, she stepped onto the streets of Strasbourg, France, and, although there was no music playing, began to boogie uncontrollably. Troffea danced for three straight days, and by the time she was tied up and hauled away, more than 30 other people had joined in. Within a month, 100 people were frantically jigging—and none of them could stop. \nThis was no ordinary dance party. Hyperventilating and hallucinating, most of the dancers seemed to be totally unconscious. Seldom able to stop for food or rest, some literally danced until they dropped dead of heart attack, stroke, or exhaustion. Local physicians ruled out supernatural causes, blaming the “dancing plague” on “hot blood.” They also decided that the best course of action was to encourage the delirium to be danced out. Authorities erected a stage and hired musicians, but the plan backfired: It just encouraged more people to dance. \nThis wasn’t the first time a European village had been plagued by “dancing mania.” The first outbreak had occurred in the seventh century, and cases sporadically struck every few decades. No country was immune: Italy, France, Holland, and Germany all suffered. The Strasbourg plague, however, was the worst. It struck 400 people and lasted until September, when it suddenly stopped as mysteriously as it began. \nThe cause of these dancing plagues? Some blame ergot, a poisonous mold found on damp rye that ’ s related to LSD. Others accuse Sydenham’s chorea, a disorder linked to strep throat and rheumatic fever that causes fluid, dance-like twitches. Medical historian John Waller makes a more psychological diagnosis: stress-induced mass psychosis. Sixteenth-century Europe was not a great time to be alive: The Black Death loomed large, smallpox and syphilis were raging, and famine was everywhere. All the ingredients for mass hysteria were there, just waiting for someone to snap. More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Never mind fake news and Trump/Pence, what we should be fearful of is Facebook’s algorithms, and their relentlessly pursuit of economic self-interest A fake news report claiming that Facebook was to begin charging. Photograph: Facebook   07.00   \nA fter the US election , many people feel we’re on the verge of an apocalypse. What might not be obvious is that it’s an artificial intelligence apocalypse, like the ones in The Terminator and The Matrix. The fact is the machines have taken over, enslaved us, and may now destroy us. \nNo, seriously. Let me explain. \nHere’s what an AI apocalypse looks like in broad brushstrokes: \n1. We carefully program AI with a well-defined goal for the betterment of the human race, give it power, and set it loose. \n2. It develops unexpected emergent behaviours, and begins to have impacts unforeseen by its creators. \n3. The well-defined goal is achieved. Unfortunately, the unintended consequence is the downfall of humanity. \nLet’s compare this to current circumstances. \nThe Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard reports that nearly half of all Americans get their news from Facebook . The social media site delivers news via its algorithms, which decide what stories you, as an individual user, see, and in what order. You might ask what’s wrong with that, when Facebook’s mission statement is to “give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected”. ‘We’re on the verge of an AI apocalypse, like the one in The Matrix.’ Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd /Allstar \nBut the fact is that rather than serving this goal, Facebook’s AIs are servicing a far older and more well-established social goal, which was designed for the betterment of mankind. This is the goal of maximising value in pursuit of economic self-interest. \nNeoliberal economics is based on the idea that the pursuit of individual, economic self-interest leads to the creation of greater value, which benefits society and results in the emergent betterment of mankind. \nThe individual self-interest being pursued in this case is that of Facebook , a legal person who is programmed, within our economic and legal system, with a single mandated goal: the delivery of maximum value to its shareholders. Facebook’s AIs are the technological limbs of that person, and they must ultimately reach out into the world to carry out that goal. \nTo that end, an election cycle is a goldrush, where these value-maximising AIs can reach out to mine your eyeballs. The more you check your feed, the more ad-based value the AIs can generate for the shareholders. \nWhat no one foresaw was that in order to keep us clicking and sharing, headlines had to work harder to grab our attention, shouting ever more sensational and titillating news stories, millisecond-by-millisecond. The resulting lightspeed feedback loop coupled our fears and hopes for the future to the simple, relentless value system of the AIs and their corporation. It was only a matter of time before humans became collaborators, or as Arron Banks , friend of Nigel Farage and financier of the Leave.eu campaign, stated in the recently published account of its Brexit campaign: “ The more outrageous we are, the more attention we’ll get. The more attention we get, the more outrageous we’ll be .” \nIf the outrageous headlines can get you to take action, and click through, then there are even more AIs out there ready to feed their own revenue loops, with highly shareable, click-baiting stories and memes. They even exploit simple human foibles, with finger slips that activate ad links, and malware that infects our devices to keep other AIs informed about us, so we can be further targeted with material tuned to our particular trigger points. Each step in this massive computational network manipulates you for a click-through, generating a micropayment-driven AI ad placement feeding frenzy. \nOf course, it’s not just Facebook involved as an end supplier in this new economic boom. Note that beneath each CNN article, every one of them sold with a tempting headline, there usually appears copious paid content. This is part of an algorithmically driven revenue generation strategy called “ smart ad placement ” by Turner Broadcasting, the subsidiary of Time-Warner that owns CNN. Turner’s site boasts of how optimising algorithms place ads “in the style of CNN editorial content, with the ability to be placed directly in editorial streams of content and alongside relevant CNN editorial videos and articles”. Even a “pure information” site like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight has been accused of warping its statistical algorithms to make the US election seem closer than it might have done, and its graphs therefore more tempting for obsessive checking. Silver has defended himself against these accusations, tweeting: “The reason we adjust polls for the national trend is because **that’s what works best emperically** [sic]. It’s not a subjective assumption.” But there is no doubt that his site is now a for-profit poll predictor, owned by ESPN. \nSome are concerned that the problem that has developed is so-called “ fake news ”. While Wikipedia defines “fake news” as a synonym for news satire, in the post-election shock it has now become an umbrella term for the uncontrolled explosion of misleading information dispersed on social media during the election. Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to make Facebook impede “fake” news . Perhaps he’ll use real human editors, but in the recent past, his company has eliminated real people in this role , in favour of algorithms, to ensure less bias in their presentation of news. A moment of truth for Mark Zuckerberg | John Naughton Read more \nBeing able to discern what is true and what is fake is not a goal that AIs can achieve easily. As Zuckerberg himself has said, the problem is “complex, both technically and philosophically”. This is because the “truth” is a complex human concept that is very hard to programme. Witness that the website Politifact , dedicated to fact-checking US politics, has to place “truth” into six categories (only half of which are definitive) and provide a detailed, carefully written analysis to explain the nuances of the verity of each statement it examines. Human truths and falsehoods are not simple 0s or 1s. \nFurthermore, the war on fake news misses the point. Regardless of whether AIs present “true” or “false” news, they will still be working towards their primary directive: the maximisation of value for the corporation. \nThe unforeseen outcomes of neoliberal values coupled to highly efficient AIs are ultimately emergent effects on our social fabric. AIs “personalise” newsfeeds for you, but this personalisation isn’t really for your benefit, it’s to place you in a tighter demographic category, making you a more targeted value proposition to sell to advertisers. The effect of this is that we have all been herded into digital echo chambers. And, with our emotions engaged by clickbaiting, profit-generating, dubious headlines, we’ve aided the process through enraged blocking and unfriending of anyone whose opinions differ from our own. \nThe truth is that Americans are no more simply Republican and Democrat than news is simply true and false, and our segregation into crisp, sale-able demographic packages serves only to reduce a complex human picture made up of difficult social and political issues. But the vast, unsympathetic network of AIs is not concerned with this complexity, it is working towards its programmed goal: to maximise value. And it is doing a great job. Through the election cycle Facebook’s stock rose 924% faster than the US stock market index, the S&P 500. \nThe unintended consequence of this massive AI success may now be our own downfall: an apocalypse, heralded not by trumpets, but by Trump/Pence. Leaders who are more than willing to collaborate with our new robot overlords, communicating with us through them via a series of ever more inflammatory tweets. A world where we are more closed as individuals, and where we are less connected as communities, the ironic opposite of the world envisioned in Facebook’s mission statement. \nI’d write more, but right now I’ve got to go and check my Facebook feed, CNN, and any other news site I can find to see what outrageous things our president-elect may have done in the past few minutes. Or perhaps find something to share that might help impede his progress. Perhaps a funny Joe Biden meme. \nSomewhere an AI would smile. If it had a face.",

      "text": "Do you know what you've done? (Reuters/Mariana Bazo) Share Mike Caulfield Director of blended and networked learning, Washington State University, Vancouver Obsession 2016 November 22, 2016 \nRecently, tech blog BGR graciously linked to an older post of mine showing that the scale at which fake news stories trend on Facebook can dwarf traditional news in terms of shares. The BGR story ended with this paragraph: \nOn a related note, it stands to reason that most individuals prone to believing a hyperbolic news story that skews to an extreme partisan position likely already have their minds made up. Arguably, Facebook in this instance isn’t so much influencing the voting patterns of Americans as it is bringing a prime manifestation of confirmation bias to the surface. \nAs regular readers know, my core expertise is not data analysis of Facebook, but in how learning environments (and particularly online learning environments) affect the way users think, act, and learn. A long time ago I was online political organizer, but my day job for many, many years has been the investigation and design of net-enabled learning experiences. \nThe BGR conclusion is a common one, and it intuitively meshes with our naive understanding of how the mind perceives truth. I see something I agree with and I reshare it—it doesn’t change my mind, because of course I already believed it when I reshared it. However, from a psychological perspective there are two major problems with this. Saying is believing \nThe first problem is that saying is believing . This is an old and well-studied phenomenon, though perhaps understudied in social media. So when you see a post that says “Clintons suspected in murder-suicide” and you retweet or repost it, it’s not a neutral transaction. You, the reposter, don’t end that transaction unchanged. You may initially post it because, after all, “Whoa if true.” But the reposting shifts your orientation to the facts. You move from being a person reading information to someone arguing a side of an issue, and once you are on a side of the issue, no amount of facts or argument is going to budge you. This may have been built into the evolution of our reason itself. In this way, going through the process of stream curation is at heart a radicalizing process. \nI’ve said many times that all social software trains you to be something. Early Facebook trained you to remember birthdays and share photos, and to some extent this trained you to be a better person, or in any case the sort of person you desired to be. \nThe process that Facebook currently encourages, on the other hand, of looking at these short cards of news stories and forcing you to immediately decide whether to support or not support them trains people to be extremists. It takes a moment of ambivalence or nuance, and by design pushes the reader to go deeper into their support for whatever theory or argument they are staring at. When you consider that people are being trained in this way by Facebook for hours each day, that should scare the living daylights out of you. \nIt’s worthwhile to note as well that the nature of social media is we’re more likely to share inflammatory posts than non-inflammatory ones, which means that each Facebook session is a process by which we double down on the most radical beliefs in our feed. \nIn general, social media developers use design to foster behaviors that are useful to the community. But what is being fostered by this strange process that we put ourselves through each day? \nThink about this from the perspective of an Martian come to Earth, watching people reach for their phone in the morning and scrolling past shared headlines, deciding in seconds for each one whether to re-share it or comment or like it. The question the Martian would ask is: “What sort of training software are they are using, and what does it train people to do?” \nAnd the problem is that—unlike previous social sites—Facebook doesn’t know, because from Facebook’s perspective they have two goals, and neither is about the quality of the community or well-being of its members. The first goal is to keep you creating Facebook content in the form of shares, likes, and comments. Any value you get out of it as a person is not a direct Facebook concern, except as it impacts those goals. And so Facebook is designed to make you share without reading , and like without thinking, because that is how Facebook makes its money and lock-in, by having you create social content (and personal marketing data) it can use. \nThe second Facebook goal is to keep you on the site at all costs, since this is where they can serve you ads. And this leads to another problem we can talk about more fully in another post. Your average news story — something from the New York Times on a history of the Alt-Right, for example — won’t get clicked, because Facebook has built their environment to resist people clicking external links. Marketers figured this out and realized that to get you to click they had to up the ante. So they produced conspiracy sites that have carefully designed, fictional stories that are inflammatory enough that you *will* click. \nIn other words, the consipiracy clickbait sites appeared as a reaction to a Facebook interface that resisted external linking. And this is why fake news does better on Facebook than real news . \nTo be as clear as I possibly can—by setting up this dynamic, Facebook simultaneously set up the perfect conspiracy replication machine and incentivized the creation of a new breed of conspiracy clickbait sites. \nThere will be a lot of talk in the coming days about this or that change Facebook is looking at. But look at these two issues to get the real story: Do they promote deep reading over interaction? Do they encourage you to leave the site, even when the link is not inflammatory? \nNext time you’re on Facebook you’ll notice there are three buttons at the bottom of each piece of content, outlining the actions you can take on that content. None of them says “read”. Facebook makes conspiracies familiar, and familiarity equals truth \nIt would be terrifying enough if this existential problem—that Facebook was training people to be extremists and conspiracists through a process of re-sharing—was the worst bit. But it’s not. The larger problem is the far larger number of people who see the headlines and do not reshare them. \nWhy is this a problem? Because for the most part, our brains equate “truth” with “things we’ve seen said a lot by people we trust.” The literature in this area is vast—it’s one of the reasons, for example, that so many people believe that global warming is a hoax. \nIf you think about it, it’s not a bad heuristic for some things. If someone tells you that there’s better farmland over the mountain, and then another person tells you that, and then another person, then your mind starts seeing this as more likely to be true than not, especially if the folks telling you this are folks you trust. If someone tells you that there’s gold mines under every house in the town, but they can’t be touched because of federal laws—well that’s not something you hear a lot, so that’s obviously false. \nYou say—no, that’s not it at all! The gold mines are ridiculous, that’s why I don’t believe in them! The good farmland is logical! I’m a logical being, dammit! \nI’m sorry, you’re not, at least on most days. If enough people told you about the gold mines, and every paper in the town made passing reference to the gold mines you would consider people who didn’t believe in the hidden gold mines to be ridiculous. Want examples of this? Look at the entire sweep of history. \nOr look at Lisa Fazio’s work on the illusory truth effect. The effect of familiarity is so strong that giving you a multiple choice question about something you know is wrong—“The Atlantic Ocean is the largest in the world, True or False?” can actually increase your doubt that you are right, and even convince you of the false fact. Why? Because it counts as exposure to the idea that other people believe the lie. This is why Betteridge Headlines are so dangerously unethical. If I publish headlines once a week asking “Is There Gold Buried Under Sunnydale?” with an article that says probably not, eventually when you are asked that question by someone else your mind will go—you know, I think I’ve heard something like that. \nAll it takes is repetition. That’s it. \nDon’t believe me? Go check out how many people believe Obama is a Muslim. Or ask yourself a question like “Does Mike Pence support gay conversion therapy?” without looking up anything and then ask yourself how it is that you “know” that one way or the other. If you know it, you know it because it seems familiar. A lot of people you trust have said it. That’s it. That’s all you got. \nIf Betteridge Headlines are borderline unethical, then Facebook is well over that line. The headlines that float by you on Facebook for one to two hours a day, dozens at a time, create a sense of familiarity with ideas that are not only wrong, but hateful and dangerous. This is further compounded by the fact that what is highlighted on the cards that Facebook is not the source of the article, which is so small and gray as to be effectively invisible, but the friendly smiling face of someone you trust. \nThe article that intimated Clinton may have murdered an FBI agent and his wife and burned them in their home to conceal the evidence was shared by over half a million people . If we assume a share rate of 20-to-1 that means that over 10 million people were exposed to the idea that this actually happened. If we assume that there is a lot of overlap in social networks, we can assume that they were exposed to it repeatedly, and it came from many people they trusted. \nAnd that’s just one headline. People exposed themselves to Facebook multiple times a day, every single day, seeing headlines making all sorts of crazy claims, and filed them in their famil-o-meter for future reference. We’ve never seen something on this scale. Not even close. \nIf Facebook was a tool for confirmation bias, that would kind of suck. It would. But that is not the claim. The claim is that Facebook is quite literally training us to be conspiracy theorists. And given the history of what happens when conspiracy theory and white supremacy mix, that should scare the hell out of you. \nI’m petrified. Mark Zuckerberg should be too. \nThis piece originally appeared on Hapgood . Follow Mike on Twitter at @holden . Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas . We welcome your comments at . Read full story ",

      "text": "Facebook creates ‘censorship tool’ to return to China   14:49 Get short URL A man holds an iPad with a Facebook application in an office building at the Pudong financial district in Shanghai © Carlos Barria / Reuters Facebook has reportedly developed a censorship tool so the social media company may be allowed to re-enter the Chinese market. Facebook has been banned in China since 2009. Read more China bans online news organizations from reporting original stories \nAccording to the New York Times which cited unnamed Facebook employees, the software suppresses posts from appearing in people's news feeds in particular geographic areas. It was developed with the support of company CEO Mark Zuckerberg who has made several visits to China, meeting with the country’s top internet executives. \n\"We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,\" Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah told Reuters. \n\"However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside of China by using our ad platform,” she added. \nThe censorship software will enable a Chinese partner company to monitor popular stories and decide whether the posts should appear in users’ news feeds. \nLike other social networks such as Twitter, Facebook was blocked in mainland China seven years ago due to the government’s strict rules on user content. Google is currently operating in the country via its Chinese-language subsidiary. The professional social networking service LinkedIn has agreed to censor some content on its platforms in China. The country has its own social network Weibo. #Zuckerberg hints at third-party news verification to fight ‘fake news’ on #Facebook https://t.co/WbtcHgxcwE pic.twitter.com/nOLVyOhXuC — RT (@RT_com) November 19, 2016 \nAnalysts warn a new censorship tool could lead to more requests from other countries to block content on Facebook. The social media company has reportedly blocked 55,000 pieces of content in around 20 countries between July and December 2015. \nAccording to the press, there is no evidence Facebook has already offered the software to Chinese authorities. It may be one of Facebook’s initiatives as the company is desperate to gain access to China's market of 1.4 billion people.",

      "text": "  \nLooking to lift spirits, Ashley White expected 10 people at most to respond to her Facebook post asking if people wanted to help her shoot a music video of \"Hallelujah.\" She ended up with more than 50 and a new program, The Hallelujah Project, which is raising money for The Trevor Project, Planned Parenthood, The Human Rights Campaign, and American Civil Liberties Union. \n\"What it is is an effort to unite people and bring forth the message of hope and encouragement in this time of need,\" White wrote in an email. \n\"I saw so many people wanting to do SOMETHING, but not knowing what to do. I sat straight up in bed at 1 a.m. on Friday morning [after the presidential election] and basically didn't sleep the next three days as we arranged, composed, and organized an intense cover of the song 'Hallelujah' and filmed the video - both featuring voices and performances of over 50 local actors. \n\"I really think we made something very special and it's only the beginning. The overall goal is to provide an outlet and opportunity for people to come together, give back, and spread hope and love to the masses in any way we can.\" Nikki Cloer waiting for Ashley H. White and John Holmes to set up the shot for the 'Hallelujah' music video.w Doug Fowler \nJohn Holmes and Keaton Rogers filmed the video which White directed, produced and arranged, with piano arrangement by Adam C. Wright and vocal arrangement by Katrina Kratzer who also played the violin and sang.

      "text": "A spokesperson for Facebook has not explicitly denied a report claiming that the social media company developed a “censorship tool” that would allow it to “suppress posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographic areas,” as part of efforts to enter into the Chinese marketplace. A Facebook spokesperson asked about the report, which was published by the New York Times on Tuesday night, told ABC News that the company has “long said that we are interested in China,” and is “spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” but has “not made any decision on our approach to China.” \n“Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform,” the spokesperson added. The spokesperson refused to be named for this story. \nAccording to the Times’ report, which cites three anonymous former or current employees, Facebook has suppressed content on its network in other countries in the past, including in Pakistan, Russia and Turkey. \n\nChinatopix Via AP \nChinese paramilitary police personnel patrol along the Bund, a popular tourist attraction in Shanghai, China, Dec. 31, 2015. \nWhile the report said that this previous activity was standard practice for U.S. internet companies working abroad, this new tool steps up the approach by “preventing content from appearing in feeds in China in the first place.” \nThe cited unnamed employees allege, according to the Times’ report, that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg “has supported and defended the effort.” \nReacting to the news, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, issued a statement on Wednesday saying in part: \"That Facebook has been engineering a way to accommodate Communist China's censorship is deeply disturbing.\" \n\"The promise of technology lies in creating a future that is freer,\" Cotton also said. \"But if Facebook shamefully rationalizes censorship in pursuit of short-term profit, it will be placing its fortunes in a future that is more closed, less prosperous, and much darker.\" \nThe popular social media network has been banned from China since 2009, according to the Reuters news agency . \nNews of the tool comes as the company continues to face pressure from critics who wish to see it take greater steps to address the proliferation of so-called “fake news,” here in the United States. \nOn Saturday, Zuckerberg posted on his own Facebook page a lengthy post saying “we take misinformation seriously,” but urged caution, saying “problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,” and “we need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content,” and “we do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves.” \nLast week Facebook was one of two companies that moved to block fake news sites from using its third-party advertisement services -- a decision that could cut off one source of revenue for the fake news sites. \nABC News' Ali Rogin contributed to this report from Washington. \n  \" \n    \nThanksgiving  ",

      "text": "Mobile Facebook’s Content Blocking Sends Some Very Mixed Messages A tool to censor content in China seems at odds with the social network’s inaction over fake news in the U.S. by Jamie Condliffe November 23, 2016 \nFacebook has reportedly built a new censorship tool as part of its bid to succeed in China—a revelation that’s hard to square with its response to its fake news problem. \nMany Internet giants have tried to crack China in the past. But it typically requires a softening of principles, which was perhaps best demonstrated in 2006, when members of Congress in the U.S. accused Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft of “ sickening collaboration ” with the Chinese government over their decision to censor content. \nMark Zuckerberg, though, has made no secret of the fact that he aims to succeed where others failed . And now, according to the New York Times , the social network has built systems that can be used to stop certain content from appearing in news feeds. Sources tell the newspaper that the software was developed specifically to help Facebook “get into China.” Mark Zuckerberg, right, gave Chinese Premier Li Keqiang a warm welcome at the China Development Forum earlier this year. \nAccording to the report, the censorship wouldn’t be directly performed by Facebook itself. Instead, the software would allow a third-party to monitor content being posted to the social network, then stamp out items as it saw fit. The initiative has apparently proved divisive at Facebook. Some employees are said to have quit over its development. \nThose may not be the only qualms to be aired over the news. Critics will no doubt compare this to the ongoing issue of fake news that’s plaguing the social network in the U.S. If the company might be prepared to censor Chinese content, why not block misinformation, too? \nThe problem, of course, is making the call: deciding what's true and false can be difficult. As Eugene Kiely, the director of FactCheck.org, explained to Bloomberg : “There’s bad information out there that’s not necessarily fake. It’s never as clear-cut as you think.” Mark Zuckerberg is very much aware of that issue. Indeed, he has publicly stated that he wants the social network and its staff to “be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth.” \nThat’s probably why Facebook’s only solution to the fake news issue so far has been to halt the provision of ads to sites that peddle false information. Zuckerberg has promised that more will be done, but we shouldn’t expect it in a hurry—especially given his warning that the issues are “complex, both technically and philosophically.” \nThe censorship tool developed for China seems to neatly sidestep that weight of responsibility, instead passing the reins over to a third party. That may be enough for Zuckerberg to convince himself that Facebook isn’t acting unethically by censoring content. But this man is in charge of one of the primary conduits through which over one billion people receive news and information. Passing the buck is no longer an option, even if it does help you make it in China. ",

      "text": "print \nREUTERS/Maxim Shemetov \nOn Tuesday, Twitter cofounder Ev Williams neatly pointed out how big Facebook's fake news problem is with one screenshot. \nWilliams was reading Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's November 18 Facebook post , which updated the world on Facebook's progress and goals in tackling fake news, when he noticed some suspicious posts on the side. Both turned out to be fake news. \nHere's the screenshot (with our added annotations in red) that Williams posted on Medium , the publishing platform where he is CEO: \nEv Williams/Business Insider \n\"Despite appearances, the first one doesn’t point to espn.com,\" Williams wrote in a Medium post. \"It goes to espn.com-magazine.online and attempts to sell a muscle-building supplement using ESPN branding and a fake news story. The CNN-branded ad goes to less work. It just takes you to a site called Fine the Racers with an exclusive offer for a 12-week program to strengthen your toes (?).\" \nWhat's particularly worrying about this incident is that these posts are ads (note: \"sponsored\"), and Facebook has already pledged to ban fake news sites from its ad network. \n\"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" Facebook said in a statement to Reuters on November 15 . \nHowever, that looks to be easier said than done. \nThe spread of fake news on Facebook became a focal point of discussion after the election of Donald Trump, drawing comments from the likes of President Obama. A recent study by BuzzFeed showed that in the lead-up to the election, the top fake-news stories on Facebook outperformed legitimate news stories shared by some of the most popular media companies. One fake-news writer even said he thought he might have helped Trump win the election. \nFacebook has said it's working on fixing the problem. Zuckerberg wrote on November 18th (in the post cited by Williams), a few things that Facebook was working on to try and combat fake news. Here's a summary: Stronger detection: better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake to catch more misinformation faster. Third-party verification via \"respected fact-checking organizations.\" Warnings: labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties and the Facebook community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. Working with journalists and others in the news industry to get input and better understand their fact-checking systems and learn from them. \nBut it seems that Facebook has a long way to go. \nOne good thing to note is that Williams does have a bit of a bias here, as he founded both Medium, a publishing platform that in some ways competes with Facebook, and cofounded Twitter. But his point is certainly still well-taken. \nAdditional reporting by Bryan Logan.",

      "text": "Mazda rotary engine returning in 2019 Published November 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print (Mazda) \nThe Wankel rotary engine could return to a Mazda car as early as 2019, but it won’t be spinning its wheels. \nCarsGuide reports that Mazda’s head of research and development, Kiyoshi Fujiwara, has confirmed that the automaker will launch its first electric car in 2019, and said that it will likely use a small rotary engine as a range extending electricity generator for when the battery runs out of charge. Related Image Expand / Contract Mazda EV prototype (Mazda) \nMazda has demonstrated a prototype of this type of series-hybrid vehicle before, and the powertrain configuration is currently in use in several cars, including the BMW i3 REx, which has a two-cylinder reciprocating engine onboard. \nThe appeal of the rotary in this application is the high power density afforded by its compact design, and its smooth-running nature. Fujiwara said Mazda is developing the EV itself, rather than collaborating with a major automaker that already builds them. \nSPIN: MAZDA'S ROTARY ENGINE MAKES A 180-DEGREE TURN \nMazda last built a car powered by a rotary engine in 2012, the RX-8, but had to abandon it largely to poor fuel efficiency and emissions. It has continued to work on the technology, however, as it is one of the company's signature features. Mazda officials have previously suggested that if they can get it to perform as well as a reciprocating engine, it will bring it back to power a conventional sports car, too.",

      "text": "Facebook doesn't care. You know this.\nAfter all, why should anyone be surprised by that recent report alluding to the potential of Facebook supporting Chinese censorship of their News Feed? They want to make inroads into China, where the service is currently banned. China is a huge potential market for them. The social network is a machine, and human users are its grist.\nWe're there to create data that increases the platform's value. And the nature of that data—whether it's a pictures of an infant, or a fake news post influencing someone's vote—is secondary.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook failed America this year — now it should kill the News Feed\nEven as Facebook figures out how to calm Americans who fear the spread of propaganda on its platform, on Tuesday, we learned about their apparent calculations as to how it might censor Chinese users, in order to appease their government.\n\"The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential,\" Mike Isaac of the New York Times reported .\nFacebook didn't deny any details of the report in a statement to Mashable .\nFor those keeping score, you'll note: Facebook allows a wide mass of its users the freedom to spread fake news (which they won't regulate), while simultaneously working to prevent another group from sharing actual news.\nNeedless to say, that set off a few alarm bells.\nFacebook thinks that fake news isn’t a problem. Apparently they’re convinced that real news is: https://t.co/0b8SkRYLTj\n— Michael Moyer (@mmoyr) November 23, 2016\nWe can't do anything about fake news, but we can help China's censors if it means more users and ad revenue https://t.co/XY21S4dfDH pic.twitter.com/5D1pgLgTRh\n— Alex Fitzpatrick (@AlexJamesFitz) November 22, 2016\nThe only was this is even remotely surprising to you is if you believe Facebook is a company that puts ideals before growth. And that would be surprising to anyone who's paid attention to what Facebook does, as opposed to what they say they do. As a company, Facebook demonstrates consistently that it is not a company with ideals. Or rather, one whose core ideal is growth.\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg says his goal is to connect the world, he means it. Facebook's ambition isn't just to get every breathing being on its platform, but to ensure everyone has internet access in the first place—so that they can use Facebook. Earlier this year, it tested a huge drone capable of beaming internet access to areas of the world lacking it. (While Facebook initially said the test was successful, new reports indicate otherwise .)\nFacebook's core ideal is growth\nFacebook's ambition is to dominate the internet—to create a \"second internet,\" one everyone you know is in, and one you never have to leave. And to grow, concessions are required.\nIntegrity, when it comes to free speech? Above their pay grade, at least when it comes to Facebook potentially reaching China's 1.375 billion people. Similarly, cracking down on fake news people enjoy sharing won't bring in new users—it may, in fact, alienate existing ones. That's why the company's always very careful to frame any changes as responses to user feedback .\nAnd those changes are always minor: Facebook has supposedly been tinkering with its algorithm to combat hoaxes and spam for years now, producing few substantial changes the average user would be able to identify.\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, explained perhaps more than she meant to about the company's philosophy in a simple Quote: published in a 2014 Time magazine cover story .\n\"If the first decade was starting the process of connecting the world, the next decade is helping connect the people who are not yet connected and watching what happens,” she said.\nIn retrospect: Yikes.\nAgain: This is a company powerful enough to connect the entire world, and their plan is to do so, then see \"what happens.\" Their position is a digital Manifest Destiny assuming societies and cultures benefit from internet access. And not just internet access, but a particular sort of internet access: Theirs. One defined by Facebook, a company run by rich white men in Menlo Park, California.\nFacebook builds the tools, and we deal with the fallout.\nAnd maybe they will! It's hard to argue against a fundamental ability to access to information. Even if some of that information encourages people to commit acts of terrorism or believe outright falsehoods that destabilize American democracy, the argument against free information is far outweighed by the one for it. The UN even once issued a report labeling internet access a \"human right.\" They're not wrong.\nThe issue, here, is that Facebook has developed a supremely powerful technology littered with problems it won't take responsibility for. Facebook builds the tools, and we deal with the fallout.\nZuckerberg made that clear in response to a question about the social network's responsibilities to fact-checking, which was posted on Facebook (where else?) by The Next Web 's Matt Navarra:\nNews and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance. We are also serious about building software for companies, but we don't call ourselves an enterprise software company. And we are serious about building planes to beam internet access, but we don't call ourselves an aerospace company. We care deeply about all these things. We are a technology company because the main thing we do across many products is engineer and build technology to enable all these things.\n(Emphasis ours.)\nCall me old-fashioned, but if you build an internet-beaming plane, you'd better call yourself an aerospace company. Somehow, Facebook gets away with a shrug: \"We are a technology company.\"\nWhat Facebook's 1.78 billion monthly users are left to do, then, is abandon the pretense that the company will ever operate with principles an amoral robot couldn't understand. All the social network wants to do is build toys and grow.\nWe can decide to accept that and exist on its ever-expanding platform—because yes, it is capable of good things—or abandon it in protest.\nBut expecting morals from a company worth hundreds of billions of dollars has usually turned out to be for the foolish—and more often than not, for reasons staring us in the face all along.\nBONUS: Elon Musk's $2.6 billion bet on a clean energy empire",

Post to Facebook Canton cop resigns over racial Facebook post A Canton police officer accused of posting a racist message on Facebook has resigned from the department.   Freep.com: http://on.freep.com/2ggzu1K   2   Canton cop resigns over racial Facebook post Darrell Clem, hometownlife.com 2:40 p.m. EST November 23, 2016 A police officer accused of a racist Facebook post has resigned. (Photo: File photo) \nA Canton police officer accused of posting a racist message on Facebook has resigned from the department. \nPublic Safety Director Joshua Meier confirmed that the officer, after one year on the job, resigned abruptly Monday before an internal investigation was completed. \n\"This was the officer's decision and not anybody else's,\" Meier said. \"We were in the middle of the internal investigation when the officer resigned.\" \nThe officer's decision halted the internal investigation and averted a due process hearing that would have determined his fate. He was suspended with pay Nov. 11, the same day Canton Public Safety Department officials issued a statement referencing \"a racist social media post\" the officer allegedly made during a live feed on Facebook of a presidential election protest. \nThe officer, allegedly referring to African Americans, posted the words \"go home monkeys.\" The incident drew attention to a police department where officials say they have worked diligently to develop strong relations with all segments of the community. \n\"I think the important message to get out is that this incident is not reflective of the entire Canton Public Safety Department and we are going to pick up the pieces and move forward in a positive direction, working with the community as we always have,\" Meier said, adding that Canton officers \"are held to the highest standards\" in law enforcement. \n\"This was an isolated incident that we dealt with accordingly,\" he said. \"It's a very unfortunate incident for everybody involved.\" \n► Related: 6 Detroit officers suspended amid bribery allegations in FBI probe \nMeier said the police department will remain transparent going forward. Police officials issued a statement about the officer's Facebook post on the same day they learned of it. \nPolice Deputy Director Chad Baugh had warned that \"behavior like this will not be tolerated\" and said, \"As a complete department, we are incredibly disappointed\" by the incident. \nCanton's top government official, Supervisor Phil LaJoy, has said the incident \"is not reflective of the department\" and called the situation \"sad.\" \nBaugh said the department has policies pertaining to social media and appropriate use of it by police officers. \nLocal officials haven't disclosed the officer's name, though some media outlets have reported it. Baugh called it \"a safety issue.\" \nDarrell Clem is a reporter for Hometownlife.com. Contact him at dclem@hometownlife.com or 734-972-0919.

      "text": "Facebook is unlikely to succeed in China, even if it compromises on free speech Posted Sherpa Foundry casts a wider net, hoping to catch customers abroad \nFacebook may have laid some of the early groundwork to launch its social network in China, but the U.S. company’s chances of making a dent in the world’s most populous country remain remote. \nA New York Times report that Facebook is developing a system that could censor information to appease the Chinese government is the talk of the tech industry right. The timing couldn’t be worse: domestically, Facebook is under pressure for failing to adequately manage the influence of fake news on the U.S. election , yet here it is seemingly prepared to quash legitimate information on user timelines to kowtow to the Chinese government and further its interests in a country of 1.3 billion people. \nFacebook’s China conundrum hasn’t changed much since its IPO in 2012 , when it admitted it may not ever find a way into the country. \nRecently, however, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly justified the development of censorship software, telling staff that “it’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation.” That triggered a number of departures, according to the New York Times, but the truth about China is that it would take a huge effort from Facebook to be relevant to the general conversation in the first place. \nEven if Zuckerberg — who has made little effort to hide his interest in doing business in China — sold out and agreed to censorship in exchange for being unblocked, Facebook has a major challenge in finding a place to sit within the nation’s already-developed social media ecosystem. \nSticking to its roots won’t cut it because Facebook-style social networking has already failed in China. \nRenren, the company widely labeled as ‘China’s Facebook,’ has long since pivoted. Initial promise saw Renren attract investment from SoftBank in its early days, and before its U.S. IPO in April 2011, the company claimed 160 million users. \nThat NYSE listing raised $743 million , but the share price has fallen from a first-day close of $18.01 to just $1.81 today. These days Renren’s service is barely used and the company is more notable for its investment deals, which include stakes in a mortgage lender and a delivery service . That investment business and its social video platform are being spun out of the company to give them room to breathe, such is the decline of the core service and ‘traditional’ social networks in China. \nRenren and lesser rivals like Kaixin withered because they missed mobile, hugely popular messaging app WeChat didn’t and now it is king. \nWeChat’s dominance has been clear for a long while — I wrote as much back in 2013 — and today it has 846 million monthly active users , the majority of whom are in China. It is also a critical part of parent firm Tencent’s mobile monetization strategy. More to the point, for Facebook, is that it occupies the space that Facebook is aiming for in China — and then some. \nMessaging apps have taken a huge bite into social networks, no where more so than China where you frequently notice people out and about in public using WeChat groups, or holding their phone to their face to use the push-to-talk ‘walkie talkie’ feature to communicate. \nBut WeChat goes beyond messaging. It is the internet, and more. \nIt includes a Facebook-style timeline feed from friends — Moments — consumers can connect with branded accounts as they do with Facebook Pages, there’s a payment system, shopping, banking, appointments and now a new feature that enables developers to build their own apps for the messaging platform, thereby disintermediating official app stores. \nWeChat is essentially the mobile portal for Chinese consumers, as A16z partner Connie Chan put it , while Twitter-like Weibo covers social with 297 million MAUs , so it is hard to see what new tricks Facebook can bring to the party \nThen there’s the fact that, in China, your Western brand means very little. \nJust ask Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who agreed to sell his company’s China business to rival Didi . Facebook’s global appeal is muted in China. Apple and the iPhone are thriving in China as exceptions to the norm, but Facebook doesn’t have that same brand gravitas. \nThe average person in China has no immediate need for Facebook. Sure, you can connect with people who are overseas but, at this point, people who would find Facebook useful to connect with friends or family overseas almost certainly already use it via a VPN. Facebook’s ad buying service estimates that the social network has an audience of around 2.1 million users in China, a tiny portion of the country’s reported 710 million internet users . \nZuckerberg’s burning desire for China seems to be the catalyst for the development of the censorship tool, which the Times report stressed may not ever be deployed, but Facebook should tread very carefully here. Compromising on free speech can only lose it friends in the West, and the chances of any kind of success in China are very slim. \nSticking to its existing strategy of serving advertising customers in China that want to reach a global audience is a better bet but, even then, working with state-run publications — as Facebook does — throws up plenty of issues around media manipulation and fake news.

When life hands me lemons, I make tarte au citron. 14 mins ago Fascism and The Historical Irony of Facebook’s “Fake News” Problem Fred Turner is a Stanford-based historian of 20th century media, who chronicled the emergence of what became the Internet from the ideals of 1960s Bay Area countercultural movements in his book “From Counterculture to Cyberculture.” He also happened to write a book called, “The Democratic Surround: Multimedia and American Liberalism from World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties,” about how American media artists and theorists were disturbed by the tendency of radio and film to foment fascist movements in Europe in the 1930s and tried to create a new, more democratic approach to media in the U.S. in response. Before the election, Turner and I did an event on Silicon Valley’s effect on American democracy at the San Francisco’s Mechanics Institute , which was founded by the city’s artisans, craftsmen and inventors in 1854 to address the educational needs of the rapidly growing Gold Rush city. I wanted to catch up and get his reflections on the election and Facebook and Twitter’s impact on American politics. Much of the discussion in the press feels ahistorical and there is this irony in that the ideas behind networked and peer-to-peer media are rooted in a resistance to fascism and emerged from the lessons of World War II. Q: So can you explain the core argument of your book? Turner: In the late 1930s, when Germany turned fascist, Americans were mystified. Our intellectual leaders had long thought that Germany was the most culturally sophisticated nation in Europe. They were all asking how this had happened. How did the country that brought us Goethe and Beethoven bring us Hitler? Many Americans blamed the mass media. They had two different ways of thinking about it. First, some believed that Hitler and his clique were clinically insane. Somehow they had transferred their madness over the radio waves and through newsreel movie screens to ordinary Germans. Second, many believed that one-to-many media forced audiences into an authoritarian kind of passivity. When everyone turned their eyes and ears in the same direction, they appeared to be acting out the obedience expected of fascist citizens. When World War II started, the Roosevelt administration wanted to create propaganda to make Americans fight fascism abroad. But the problem was — what media were they going to use? If they used mass media, they risked turning Americans into authoritarians. But if they didn’t, they wondered, how would they achieve the national unity they needed to fight fascism? There was one school of thought that said, “We’ll just copy [Joseph] Goebbels. We’ll de-program Americans later [if they turn totalitarian].” But there were about 60 American intellectuals who were part of something called the Committee for National Morale who had another idea. These were people like anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, psychologist Gordon Allport, and the curator Arthur Upham Pope. They believed that we needed to create a kind of media that would promote democratic personalities. And if we did that, we could prevent racist nationalism. They dreamed of media that would surround you, that would require you to make your own choices and use your individual perception to define the images that mattered most to you. It was meant to be a kind of media environment within which you could make your own decisions, and so become more individually unique. At the same time, it put you in the company of others doing the same thing. The environment was designed to help forge both individual identity and collective unity simultaneously. The Committee for National Morale didn’t end up making media. But a group of Bauhaus artists, who were escaping Hitler’s Germany, took up their ideas and began creating immersive, multi-image environments. Their first big work was a propaganda exhibition called “The Road To Victory” at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1942. Herbert Bayer and Edward Steichedn surrounded visitors with images of all different sizes so that people could choose to be citizens in the company of others. It’s a form that surrounds you, which is why I called the book “The Democratic Surround.” Over the next 50 years, through a series of twists and turns, the democratic media dreams of the Committee for National Morale actually set the stage for Facebook, Twitter and other kinds of peer-to-peer media. The irony is that with Donald Trump, we are seeing a medium and a set of tactics designed to confront fascism being used to produce a new authoritarianism. Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party , went on to rule the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Q: What is fascism and how would you define it? Turner: Fascism, and authoritarianism more generally, is about particular political movements in the early 20th century. They generally feature a leader with dictatorial powers, a single party and the ability to enforce the will of party through military means. You can think of Mussolini’s Italy, Hideki Tojo’s Japan and Nazi Germany. Some key elements of fascism include the following: A reversionary desire to return to an imagined state of greatness from the past. A celebration of heterosexual masculinity. You could think of Vladimir Putin’s need to take off his shirt or Donald Trump’s obsession with the size of his hands. A charismatic leadership style. An absolute disregard for facts and a celebration of myth. An integration of the corporation and the state, which is what Mussolini wanted to do and feels reminiscent of what Trump wants to do today. A deep, structural racism. There is always someone on the outs. In Japan, it was particular minority groups. In Germany, it was obviously the Jews, but it was also gypsies, queers and communists, among others. And you can see that kind of racism, that kind of in-group and out-group dynamic here, with Trump. Many people have called Donald Trump a populist. I don’t think that’s quite right. His anti-elitist rhetoric is certainly in that vein, but his racism, his sexism, and his emphasis on a return to a formerly great America, belong to the fascist line. To me, the constellation of forces that he’s put into play look like early Mussolini. The key difference is that Mussolini and Hitler came to power by essentially building parties first. Trump has use the media to take over an existing state apparatus. Whether he’s able to do what he wants or not, whether he’s competent or not, and whether institutions will resist him, that’s an open question. I don’t think he’s Andrew Jackson though. Q: Let’s go back to media now. You’re talking about media exhibitions in the 1940s. How does the work that these thinkers and artists were doing translate to how online media works today? Turner: The multi-media images in “The Democratic Surround” provide a glimpse of the kind of perceptual world that media thinkers believed would make us less racist and more embracing of our differences. It’s a world in which we’re meant to practice looking at and identifying with others who are not like ourselves. The surround aesthetics of the 1940s came to shape the 1950s, 60s and 70s by moving through two worlds. One, they became the basis of cold war propaganda exhibitions. Well into the 1960s, Americans built multi-image propaganda environments, with an eye toward democratizing populations in authoritarian countries. They built multi-image environments as part of trade fairs or exhibitions in the belief that they would give people the ability to practice the modes of perception that democracy depends upon. Above is “The Family of Man,” a traveling photography exhibition that was meant to show the common bonds of humanity. The U.S. Information Agency transported the exhibit to countries around the world, to showcase the argument for peace and human brotherhood despite the risk of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. In 1955, Edward Steichen built what remains the most influential of these environments, “The Family of Man.” It was an exhibition of 500 photographs of people around the world, hung in a surround format. The US government sent the exhibition around the world for a decade. It’s now on permanent display in Luxembourg. The show’s catalog has sold more than 8 million copies. The second way the surround aesthetic has come down to us and helped drive the rise of social media is through the art world. Thanks to John Cage , it became the basis of Happenings in New York in the late 1950s. Cage believed that concerts and symphonies embodied the hierarchies of old Europe and were essentially exercises in domination by aural means. He knew the Bauhaus refugees well. And so he did with sound what they had done with pictures. He designed sonic surrounds that would open people up to listening to sounds around them and choosing the ones that were most valuable to them. In the late 1950s he taught these techniques to the artists who made the first Happenings. Then the people who are hanging out in this art world, like Stewart Brand, saw this open surround form and took it with them to make things like the 1966 Trips Festival in San Francisco, which was a psychedelic surround. Held 50 years ago in San Francisco’s Longshoremen’s Hall, the 1966 Trips Festival was a seminal event in Bay Area countercultural history put on by Stewart Brand that brought multimedia experiences and psychedelics together. On the left is the Trips Festival program. On the right is a review of the event in the San Francisco Chronicle. Events like the Trips Festival helped drive a countercultural dream of escaping party-style politics through technology. If they just built the right geodesic domes, took the right LSD, and surrounded themselves with the right music and light shows, lots of folks believed they could establish a new and better society. This society would be based on a shared mindset, a shared consciousness that technology would help create. This idea of shared consciousness became a conceptual foundation of the Internet as it emerged into public view. Stewart Brand and the people who were building communes in the 1960s reimagined computers as technologies of liberation. They turned the dreams of the commune movement — which by then had failed — into fantasies that the Internet could be an “electronic frontier.” The computer would now be a “personal” technology — that is, a tool like LSD for the transformation of consciousness. And the net would link these technology-enabled minds together in “virtual community.” The counterculture’s utopian vision of technology still lingers in the air when, say, Ev Williams founds Twitter, or even when Mark Zuckerberg declares his desire to connect everyone on the planet through Facebook. Q: But most people weren’t experiencing these exhibitions or psychedelic festivals. They were watching ABC, CBS and NBC. Turner: By 1968, the psychedelic experiences I’m taking about were widespread. The rock concert was available. Thousands of Americans had gotten to experience it. They were quite universal by the 1970s and 1980s. One questions we might have is why multi-media didn’t replace one-to-many media, the way the Committee for National Morale hoped it would. If multi-media was such a democratizing force, why is mass media still here? One of the things we see with Trump and the Twitter-sphere is that when new technologies come on the scene, they don’t replace old technologies. They layer onto older technologies. Twitter and its liberating potential is already mass mediated. It’s already commercial. When Donald tweets, he isn’t just tweeting to a general populace. He’s generating stories for CBS and NBC, and for that matter, Facebook. He’s generating stories that create an entire media sphere on their own. That is the source of his power. He is using the old fascist charisma, but he’s doing it in a media environment in which the social and the commercial, the individual and the mass, are already completely entwined. Q: What could or should be done about fake news? I think “fake news’ is a really important phenomenon. It’s rumor, and one of the things social media do best is accelerate rumors. Social media radically disable fact checking. They make it easy for people to make up stories that can travel at the speed of light. Social media also show that the original idea that the Internet could be a neutral dissemination medium for news was just a fantasy. I’m not at all sure how firms should manage the new situation, let alone how the state should intervene. “Fake news” is only part of the problem. The real problem is actually more of a structural problem. Media firms in lots of different subsets need to make money on advertising. When you are dependent on advertising, controversy is good. Truth ceases to matter. It doesn’t matter whether it’s true or not. What matters is that it gets a lot of attention. The structural incentives for commercial firms are to leave lots of leeway around the truth of stories because they generate ads. And this means that in many ways, “fake” is become our new “real.” I don’t know how we rehabilitate science and fact. Some large subset of our population believes that climate change is a hoax. For them, the fake is completely real. When you look the mid-20th century, you see Germany leaving facts behind too. Citizens cease to debate the German economy, and instead put their faith in a charismatic leader. In the US now there is a large population that can’t understand what’s happening to them politically, economically or culturally. Today, people can’t understand why abortion is legal. They can’t understand why gay marriage is legal. They can’t understand where the factories have gone. It’s the turn from fact that makes fascism possible. If they turn away from reasoning altogether, they can turn toward feeling like part of a body following a charismatic leader. That said, we have as a country been in terrible places before. PBS has been broadcasting clips from the 1960s, showing riots, people screaming epithets, and bigots, who at the time, had radically misplaced beliefs that African Americans were somehow less than us. At some deep level, I believe what Martin Luther King Jr. said: “The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice.” Q: What advice would you have to founders and people building products? Turner: I don’t envy engineers or executives at tech firms. They’ve been put in the position of being legislators for our public debates. America’s architecture for such debates — Congress, the courts, the executive branch, and to some degree, the press — was built in the 18th century. But the conditions of public discourse have changed, and the speed at which those conditions are changing has accelerated too. This makes engineers reluctant, but necessary, brokers of public discourse. They should first exercise restraint, which they’ve done. They’ve allowed lots of ideas to come through. But secondly, there’s a tough question in front of them right now: At what point do you stop exercising that restraint? Is there a time when something is so pernicious to the social good that it should be barred from being spoken on my platform? Germany outlaws anti-Semitic hate speech, for instance. Should Facebook? So, if you start thinking down that line, if someone threatened murder, you’d probably take that off the platform. If someone threatened assault, you’d take that off. But if a presidential candidate threatens to imprison an entire religious minority, if that candidate tells completely false stories that then circulates through these platform, should you remove them? And if so, how? I don’t know. But the German example would be good to look at. In any case, we can’t pretend anymore that engineers are not legislators of public discourse anymore. Q: One thing that is interesting to me is how discourse around racism has been coded — on both the right and the left — for my entire life. On the right, you have the legacy of the Southern strategy developed by George Wallace, and then on the left, you have euphemisms for addressing the effects of institutional discrimination through talking about the value of diversity. This year, all of the norms and rules for discussing race have been blown apart and the discourse now is so explicit. What do you make of that and how social media has impacted that? Turner: I was born in 1961. The explicit racism that you would hear about while I was growing up was about enforcing white domination. White power was widely assumed to be a normal thing in that period; the challenge for racists was to keep it that way. One of the things I see now is that even with white racism bubbling up, there’s a new context. Today whiteness is just a race like any other. There’s a sense that whiteness is not the hegemonic norm. Rather, its dominance is something that has to be recovered. In that, we can catch a glimpse of a emerging American society that is genuinely multiracial. Q: Any other thoughts? Turner: If we want to make comparisons of today to 20th century fascism, I’d think about Mussolini and not Hitler. The thing we forget about Mussolini is that he was a bumbling figure. A needy bumbler with the same need for showmanship that Trump has. Hitler, in contrast, was a full-on ideologue. Trump is an opportunist, so it’s hard to know where he will go. Even if he were merely a kleptocrat, he might end up empowering others later who are ideologues through deeply undermining of American law, norms and democracy. If Donald Trump is a fascist, he’s a fascist for this time and this country, because the source of his power is his ability to manage and grab attention. He’s constantly seeking it. It’s a weird kind of charisma, and in that seeking, he draws us together, no matter how much we might disagree with his ideas.",

      "text": "Here’s why Facebook may be sending you a check soon Oh, Facebook, we do love you. You provide us with news, with photos and status updates from our loved ones. You make it so that it’s easy to keep in contact with people who live far, far away. And most recently, Facebook has proved that even if it messes up (hey, it happens), it will make it up to you.\nRight now, Facebook is trying to smooth things over with its users after it was caught using photos without their permission — if you were affected, you may receive a $15 check in the mail from Facebook . 1.8 billion have received a check, according to Thrillist. Thrillist states, “The check, which is anything but another viral hoax, is marked with the return address of “Fraley v. Facebook Inc.” So, yes it’s real. And yes, it’s Facebook’s way of saying “sorry.”\nWhat a funny week to get a class action settlement check in the mail from Facebook! pic.twitter.com/LkwJGRRATC \n— Michael Roston (@michaelroston) November 22, 2016 In 2013, Facebook was ordered by the court to shell out a whopping $20 million, distributing $9 million to those users who filed a claim .\n$15 may not be the most exciting payout, but at least the class action lawsuit filed back in 2011, Fraley v. Facebook Inc. , resulted in some sort of justice. Facebook landed in hot water after some sponsored posts used names and profile pictures without user permission.\nThe post Here’s why Facebook may be sending you a check soon appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "The Trailer for the New Martin Scorsese Movie Doesn’t Look Like a Martin Scorsese Movie By Facebook Silence looks a bit out of Scorsese's wheelhouse. That’s not a bad thing, though. \nParamount Pictures has finally dropped the trailer for the new Martin Scorsese film, Silence , which is coming out just less than a month from now. The film stars Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver as Portuguese priests traveling through a perilous Japan to rescue their mentor (Liam Neeson), who—rumor has it—has been captured and denounced his faith. Looks like a barrel of laughs. Check out the preview here: \nScorsese, at this point, doesn’t need to prove his worth as a director, which is maybe why he’s throwing us, and himself, a bit of a curveball here. What could be more of a challenge than getting Garfield and Driver, two actors who haven’t quite convinced anyone of their leading man credentials, to carry a whole movie, and with challenging, silly accents no less? His legacy’s secure, who cares? \nWith that said, there’s also a lot to get hyped for here. Typically, it all looks stunning and tense–check out that somber beachside crucifixion. The survivalist-on-a-mission genre is booming right now, what with the success of last year’s The Revenant . This is like that, but with more people, the same amount of praying, and zero bears, as far as I can tell. Can’t have it all. \nAfter this, Scorsese still has plenty of irons in the fire, with a biopic about classical pianist Byron Janis looks the most intriguing (as well as being very good at piano, dude claims to have talked to ghosts all the damn time ). There’s also a Mike Tyson biopic in the works and one about George Washington, too. \nOnce Scorsese’s done telling the stories of every human ever, he’ll presumably get back to fiction and start working on that Hugo sequel everyone’s waiting for.

      "title": "Dan Rather: What Side of History Will You Be On?",
      "text": "- - \nOn 22 November 2016, journalist Dan Rather penned a message on Facebook about the display of Nazi salutes at an \" alt-right \" conference in Washington D.C.: \nRather published his message on his official Facebook page, but many people encountered it secondhand after it was republished and re-shared on social media: \nSocial media users who have grown weary (and wary) of fake messages eyed the message with skepticism, and while some sites shared the passage with an exaggerated, click-bait title, the message it presents is authentically his. \nAn archived version of Rather's statement can be viewed here , while a screenshot of the post is presented below: \nNow is a time when none of us can afford to remain seated or silent. We must all stand up to be counted. \nHistory will demand to know which side were you on. This is not a question of politics or party or even policy. This is a question about the very fundamentals of our beautiful experiment in a pluralistic democracy ruled by law. \nWhen I see neo-Nazis raise their hands in terrifying solute, in public, in our nation's capital, I shudder in horror. When I see that action mildly rebuked by a boilerplate statement from the President-elect whom these bigots have praised, the anger in me grows. And when I see some in a pliant press turn that mild statement into what they call a denunciation I cannot hold back any longer. \nOur Declaration of Independence bequeaths us our cherished foundational principle: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" \nThese truths may be self-evident but they are not self-replicating. Each generation has to renew these vows. This nation was founded as an opposite pole to the capriciousness of an authoritarian monarch. We set up institutions like a free press and an independent court system to protect our fragile rights. We have survived through bloody spasms of a Civil War and a Civil Rights Movement to extend more of these rights to more of our citizens. But the direction of our ship of state has not always been one of progress. We interned Japanese Americans, Red Baited during the McCarthy era, and more. I feel the rip tide of regression once again swelling under my feet. But I intend to remain standing. \nIn normal times of a transition in our presidency between an incoming and outgoing administration of differing political parties, there is a certain amount of fretting on one side and gloating on the other. And the press usually takes a stance that the new administration at least deserves to have a chance to get started - a honeymoon period. But these are not normal times. This is not about tax policy, health care, or education - even though all those and more are so important. This is about racism, bigotry, intimidation and the specter of corruption. \nBut as I stand I do not despair, because I believe the vast majority of Americans stand with me. To all those in Congress of both political parties, to all those in the press, to religious and civic leaders around the country. your voices must be heard. I hope that the President-elect can learn to rise above this and see the dangers that are brewing. If he does and speaks forcibly, and with action, we should be ready to welcome his voice. But of course I am deeply worried that his selections of advisors and cabinet posts suggests otherwise. \nTo all of you I say, stay vigilant. The great Martin Luther King, Jr. knew that even as a minority, there was strength in numbers in fighting tyranny. Holding hands and marching forward, raising your voice above the din of complacency, can move mountains. And in this case, I believe there is a vast majority who wants to see this nation continue in tolerance and freedom. But it will require speaking. Engage in your civic government. Flood newsrooms or TV networks with your calls if you feel they are slipping into the normalization of extremism. Donate your time and money to causes that will fight to protect our liberties. \nWe are a great nation. We have survived deep challenges in our past. We can and will do so again. But we cannot be afraid to speak and act to ensure the future we want for our children and grandchildren. \nDan Rather is a television journalist , and was one of the most recognizable faces of CBS Evening News for decades. He stepped down from that post in 2005 following a scandal over a story about President George W. Bush that turned out to be based on documents that had not been authenticated, but he continues to do journalism work. Last updated: 23 November 2016 Originally published: 23 November 2016",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nCHATTANOOGA, TN (AP) – Chattanooga police say a sixth child has died from a school bus crash. \nA tweet from the police department Wednesday evening said the agency had received confirmation of the death. \nPolice say the bus was traveling too fast when it veered off a narrow, winding road and crashed into a tree Monday afternoon. \nThe driver, 24-year-old Johnthony Walker, has been arrested and charged with five counts of vehicular homicide. \nThe police department’s tweet did not give the child’s name or age. \nFederal investigators say that the site of a school bus crash was not on the designated route. \nNational Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart says it’s unclear why Walker had taken the bus down Talley Road in Chattanooga. Investigators also don’t know whether he had taken the same route before. \nHart says the NTSB is bringing in a specialist to analyze video and audio recordings made on interior cameras that were damaged in Monday’s wreck. \nInvestigators are facing similar challenges in retrieving speed and braking information from the engine control module that has been removed from the bus. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It took me a while to figure out what to do. Tatianna Taylor holds a Trayvon Martin sign as the Rev. Al Sharpton speaks during the National March Against Police Violence in Washington, D.C. in 2014. (Photo: Kelly Jordan, USA TODAY) \nIn 2012, the world’s attention was drawn to the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a vigilante gunman as the teenager made his way home from the store. \nIt was far from the first time a young black man had been killed by someone who fancied themselves as \"law enforcement\" — but this time was different. In response, three brilliant black women created the hashtag #blacklivesmatter — a simple, yet profound rallying cry that ignited the imaginations of people, including many white people, across the country. Policing the USA From environmental activism to push for justice \nTrayvon’s death made me sick. But as a white person in upstate New York, I wasn’t sure of my place in responding to such a grossly unjust, racialized death. \nI had been organizing for years in my hometown of Buffalo and the surrounding region on issues of environmental justice. It wasn't until after the death Michael Brown, a young black male, at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., that I got off the sidelines and took action. \nI started by doing what I knew I could. I invited friends and family members to my house, and we talked about what we were seeing and how we were feeling. We contributed to the bail fund in Ferguson for folks who were protesting systems of policing, harassment and violence that we also saw in Buffalo. \nSince then, I’ve joined thousands of other white people across this country who are waking up and responding to the call from organizers of color to mobilize for racial justice. \nBlack Lives Matter demonstration in New York. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) Similar to the early civil rights movement \nThis kind of call to action might sound familiar. It’s similar to the call made during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. White people across the country, following the lead of people of color, put their bodies, hearts and livelihoods on the line to take a stand for what was right. They participated in the hard work of moving the moral conscience of white America. \nThe work might look different in different areas of the country. \nIn Cleveland, we organized a group to support the Rice family as they demanded accountability for the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was killed by a police officer while playing with a toy gun at a local park. And in Northern Virginia this year, we knocked on doors in predominantly white neighborhoods to have long and complicated conversations about reparations. \nThe work I do is shaped by my commitment to take direction from and demonstrate support for leaders of color who are most directly impacted by these policies and practices, and to build deep and accountable relationships that ensure that the work is part of a strategy set by people of color. What I hear over and over from those partners is that it is immensely important for white people to disentangle ourselves from the structures and systems that maintain white supremacy. \nAs we enter what promises to be a heightened state of racialized violence, white people must make a decision about which side they are on, and act accordingly. Will we side with white nationalists and corporate elites, or will we side with communities of color who will be persecuted even more intensely in the coming years? If you haven’t been active before, now is your time. \nWe cannot stay on the sidelines any longer. \nErin Heaney is the interim co-director of Showing Up for Racial Justice.

The company used user names and photographs in sponsored posts without asking the users first. In 2013 a judge ordered the company to pay the plaintiffs a $20 million settlement in damages. \nNow, following appeals, Facebook is finally sending out these settlement checks $15 at a time. The recipients are understandably amused. What a funny week to get a class action settlement check in the mail from Facebook! pic.twitter.com/LkwJGRRATC — Michael Roston (@michaelroston) November 22, 2016 \nOf course, $15 isn’t a lot of scratch for a multi-billion-dollar company that abused your private information, but at least it’s something. Payments were sent out on Nov. 17, so keep your eyes peeled to the mail. You may have some apology money coming your way from your favorite social media site.",

      "text": "November 23, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nSnapchat’s under fire from Facebook, with The Social Network copying many of Snapchat’s core features and either releasing them to everyone or within specific markets where Snapchat hasn’t yet gained significant traction. And given that Facebook has more users and more resources, you’d expect that those efforts will eventually start to hurt Snapchat, particularly after it goes public and the pressure mounts for them to keep bringing in more users (as we’ve seen with Twitter ). \nThat’s potentially a big problem, right? But thus far, Snapchat’s been able to remain competitive with the bigger players by releasing more innovative, interesting products and options , delivering entirely new experiences that are so cool that people can’t help but tell their friends about them. the new @snapchat update lets you drop acid whenever you want, wherever you are pic.twitter.com/6P4OprQwy8 — Sam Sheffer (@samsheffer) November 8, 2016 \nBut the question is, can Snapchat continue to innovate fast enough to stay one-step ahead of Facebook and keep users coming back to their app despite them being able to access similar – if not better - tools on networks like Facebook and Instagram, where they also have larger, established friend networks? \nRight now, I wouldn’t bet against the yellow ghost – while Facebook recently announced their new camera option , which includes Snapchat style image filters and will live within Facebook itself, Snapchat launched Spectacles , their first hardware play which has subsequently generated a heap of hype, particularly due to the company’s creative marketing strategy – which, thus far, has involved a giant yellow vending machine being dropped off at random locations around the US (they opened their first official Spectacles store in NYC this week). — Spectacles (@Spectacles) November 20, 2016 \nBut another area where Facebook can comfortably beat out Snapchat is in advertising. Facebook has the most advanced ad targeting options around, and coupled with their aforementioned reach, that’ll make it hard for Snap Inc. to compete. And on top of that, Snapchat’s not known as being particularly advertiser friendly . \nSo how can Snapchat translate their ability to come up with cool new, hype-generating innovations into the commercial arena? \nCheck this out: Found a cool @Spectacles secret! If you point your Snapchat camera at package's lettering, it gives you a special filter! How it works: pic.twitter.com/wPSVpQjk5T — Moshe Isaacian (@MosheIsaacian) November 23, 2016 \nThere’s been no notification about this, Snapchat – typically – isn’t making a big noise about it, but the ability to recognize real world objects and use them as a trigger for in-app content is a big deal. \nThis is actually something they inadvertently flagged a while back (and which we reported on at the time), with a patent filed in January 2015 outlining the process for image recognition-triggered ads that could be used to deliver custom, targeted ad content. \n“For example, a photograph including an object recognized as a restaurant may result in the user being presented with photo filters that overlay a menu of the restaurant on the photograph. Or a photograph including an object recognized as a food type may result in the user being presented with photo filters that let the user view information e.g., calories, fat content, cost or other information associated with the food type.” \nIn addition to providing contextual info, this could also enable businesses to offer discounts and promotions based on the content of an image – for example, here, a person who’s taken a Snap of a cup of coffee is offered a discount coupon based on that snap. \nThe patent actually goes into further detail than just the outline, with a full rundown of how they could use a bidding system for images, creating a whole new advertising eco-system within Snapchat – essentially the same way that Google ads are triggered by keywords, but using images instead. \nThe potential of this is significant, but until now it’s purely been speculation, we’ve seen no indication that Snapchat’s advanced this process. The above example shows that they most definitely have evolved the process – they now have a working, live system that can recognize at least one object in the wild. For all we know, there may even be more. \nSnapchat still has a way to go to fully prove themselves as a real contender for the established social media players, particularly in the advertising sense. But image-recognition-triggered ads could be a major step – and with Snap reportedly looking to announce an IPO early next year , expect them to make an official announcement on this front to boost their brand value ahead of listing. \nThere are major possibilities with this application, and it fits perfectly into Snap Inc.’s mission to improve the way people live via the camera. \nIt’s only a single, and relatively simple, example, but it signals much bigger things.

      "text": "1 share \nFacebook has been getting a bad rep lately for a lot of different things — and rightfully so. There’s the looming fake news problem it can’t seem to fix, and it’s been held accountable for the surprising result of this year’s US election . \nThe first one is for the company to fix, but the second is something that’s a inherent problem of every social network. If you’ve been on Facebook for a while, you’ve been slowly and unknowingly building up a profile of content Facebook thinks you want to see. \nWhenever you like a post, page or another form of content, the service learns and records your preferences to generate an algorithmically curated news feed catered to your interests. But that also means you won’t see anything you might not agree with, or don’t like. \nWhen Trump got elected, Democrats around the US didn’t see anyone celebrating on social media, even though almost half the country voted for him — simply because it all got filtered out. \nEscapeYourBubble is a Chrome extension that wants to try and help everyone understand each other a bit more. Once installed, it asks who you want to understand better — Democrats or Republicans. Based on that choice, it then adds contrasting posts to your news feed. \nThe content is curated from high quality news sources, and consists of articles meant to give an insight into the positive qualities of the group you wish to understand better. \nShortly after installing, I came across an article featuring a pink banner saying it had been put there by the extension. I told it I wanted to understand Republicans, so it linked to a New Yorker piece about the lives of poor people in small town Ohio . The article would offer a Democrat a new perspective on why anyone would vote for Trump, an idea that might seem completely alien to someone who voted for Clinton. \nRight now, the extension is aimed at US Republicans and Democrats, but the rest of the world could also use it — just take a look at the Brexit referendum results that shocked millions across the UK . \nIt’s possible to stop ourselves from polarizing even further, and increased understanding of others’ viewpoints would make for a better world — we just have to try a little harder.",

      "text": "View this image › \nMint Press News / American Herald Tribune \nID: 10048200 As Facebook faces intense pressure about the spread of misinformation in its popular News Feed, the company’s Trending box continues to promote dubious stories to potentially millions of people.\nOn Thursday the Trending box, which appears in the upper-right corner for English-language users on desktop, listed “Karbala, Iraq” as a trending topic for many people. The promoted article associated with that trend was a story from Mint Press News with the misleading headline, “Media Blackout As Millions Of Muslims March Against ISIS In Iraq.”\nView this image › \nFacebook \nID: 10048161 This week has seen millions of Shiite Muslims participate in Arbaeen, one of the world’s largest pilgrimages, in Iraq. But they are not specifically marching against ISIS, nor has there been a “media blackout.” For example, the Washington Post and International Business Time s both published articles about the pilgrimage that show up on the automatically generated topic page on Facebook. Reuters also wrote about it. Major media are also now covering a bombing in Iraq today that targeted Arbaeen pilgrims.\nIf millions of Muslims had decided to march against ISIS in Iraq, it certainly would have been major news. But Arbaeen is an annual religious pilgrimage and has nothing specifically to do with ISIS.\n\nIn spite of the presence of stories from bigger outlets, it was the article from Mint Press News, a small news site based in Minnesota, that was listed the top story both in the Trending box and on the related topic page. That’s likely because its misleading headline inspired people to engage with the story on Facebook.\nA woman in the UK posted the story and has seen it generate more than 1,000 shares and another 1,000 reactions.\nFacebook Post . Facebook: annemarie.smith.906 \nID: 10047785 As detailed in a 2013 BuzzFeed News profile of Mint Press News , the site’s sources of funding are unclear, and it pursues a reporting line that strongly backs the governments of Iran and Syria, and that is anti-Saudi and anti-Israel. The site has at times been the source of dubious claims, such as a 2013 story falsely claiming it had proof that Syrian rebels were responsible for a chemical attack. That story was published with the byline of an AP stringer, who subsequently said she did not report the story and demanded that her name be removed.\nMint Press News also recently began reprinting articles from Sputnik and RT, two of Russia’s state-funded news outlets. The misleading story about the pilgrimage in Iraq was in fact a reprint — but not from a Russian outlet. It was sourced from the American Herald Tribune , a website edited by a Canadian professor and conspiracy theorist named Anthony Hall. He, for example, believes 9/11 was an inside job, and that the Sandy Hook shootings were staged. Hall was recently suspended from his job at an Alberta university over accusations of anti-Semitism.\n\nAfter he was suspended, Hall granted an “exclusive” interview to an Iranian state news outlet where he talked about the need for an “open debate” on the Holocaust and 9/11, among other things. (Many of the millions of Arbaeen pilgrims come to Iraq from Iran.)\n\nHis site’s story does not quote any pilgrims as saying they are marching against ISIS, or offer any other evidence other than to say that “in light of ISIS terror attacks globally, several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms.” (“Several” anonymous people is a far cry from the “millions” cited in the headline.)\nAside from the Tribune story, only one other news outlet appears to have portrayed the Arbaeen pilgrimage as a protest against terrorism: RT. The day before the Herald published its misleading article, Russia’s RT offered an opinion column headlined, “Walking Freedom: Iraq home of largest rally against terror in the world.”\nBuzzFeed News has contacted Mint Press News and Hall for comment and will update if we receive a response.",

      "text": "Annie Reneau Nov 24, 2016 \nEarlier this week, I opened Facebook, and the first photo in my feed was a woman’s face partially wrapped in gauze, her eyes and cheeks purple and swollen. This woman is part of a small online writer’s forum I belong to. She posted her photo and story in that secret group because it was the only safe space she could. \nHer ex — whom she had left for being abusive — had broken into her home a few days prior and assaulted her. Like millions — millions — of other women , she had been violently attacked by a man who was supposed to love and protect her. Like millions of women, she was afraid and confused. Her story was shocking and horrific, but not terribly uncommon. Not nearly uncommon enough, anyway. \nI’ve never been hit by a loved one. I’ve never been afraid of an intimate partner. I can’t imagine the confusion, the fear, and the undeserved shame that women who have been abused experience. I can’t offer an “I’ve been there,” kind of solidarity, and obviously, I don’t wish that I could. \nBut that doesn’t mean that I can’t help. \nThe photos of that woman’s face prompted me to spend several days reading stories about domestic abuse survivors . I’ve read story after story of woman after woman who has hidden her bruises, found herself explaining away abusive behavior, and genuinely wondered if the man she loves might actually kill her in his next fit of rage. I’ve read story after story of partners who have made it sound as if their wives or girlfriends provoked them into beating them bloody, who have apologized profusely for the violence, and who have promised multiple times that it would never happen again. \nI’ve read these stories more to try to understand the abused than the abuser. I know most women in abusive relationships find themselves in those situations unwittingly. I know that abuse often comes on gradually, that it’s not as black-and-white as “If a man ever hits me, I’m out of there.” I know that strong, healthy, smart women can spend years in unhealthy and unsafe situations they don’t know how to get out of. I know that violence can happen with words as well as with fists. \nDomestic violence statistics are sobering, to say the least. One in 4 women in the United States will be victims of severe violence at the hands of an intimate partner during their lifetimes — 1 in 4 . That means that all of us know women who are in or who have been in abusive relationships, and most of us have no idea. I wish I could snap my fingers and make those statistics disappear, but I can’t. \nWhat I can do is be there for women who find themselves trapped in dangerous love. I can be a safe place — a harbor for those of you who feel lost in a stormy sea of anger, blame, shame, and fear. I can and will believe you when you tell me you feel afraid or unsafe. I can and will tell you — as many times as it takes for you to hear it — it’s not your fault, that his blaming words are bullshit, and that nothing you did made hurting you OK. I can and will find you the help you need. \nI will be a safe physical place, as well as a safe emotional one. I won’t ask you why you stayed or why you waited so long to get help. Emotional manipulation is a hallmark of both verbal and physical abuse, and I know that asking you those questions will only deepen the sense that somehow you brought this upon yourself. \nI won’t ask you why he got so angry, since I know you’ve asked yourself that question a thousand times and there is no reasonable answer. I won’t ask you how you can love someone who hurts you. I know that love doesn’t always make sense. \nBut I will tell you that someone who loves you should not hurt you. I will tell you from the bottom of my heart that you don’t deserve to have your body or your heart violated. I will be the bridge between you and the authorities and hold your hand through that scary process. I will offer you whatever strength and support you need. \nI will believe you, and I will believe in you. \nIf you are in a relationship where you do not feel 100% safe, please, please, please tell someone. Tell a friend. Tell a stranger. Tell me. Don’t be afraid that women like me who have never been where you are won’t understand. Don’t be ashamed to admit that you are in a situation you don’t know how to get out of. Don’t be embarrassed that you are one of the 25%. You are not alone. \nThose are not trivial words. That statement is 100% true, no matter how you look at it. You are not alone. \nMy writer friend shared her story here , anonymously, in the hope that other women who may see themselves in it will seek help. \nPlease, tell someone if you are being hurt. If that doesn’t work, tell someone else, and keep going until you find one of us who can help you reclaim your safety. \nIf you need a secret place to escape to, please check out the site www.domesticshelters.org . You do not have to stay with an abusive partner. You do not owe them anything. You do not have to suffer through this. There is no judgment here. Just solidarity and support, sister. \nTell me. Tell someone.",

      "text": "iStock / Norddeutscher Rundfunk Like us on Facebook \nThe Simpsons recently cemented its title as America’s longest-running primetime scripted series with the announcement of seasons 29 and 30. For a time, Baywatch was the world’s most syndicated program, sold to 148 countries and a weekly global audience of over a billion people. And in 1983, up to 125 million people (an unprecedented 77 percent audience share ) watched \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,\" the last ever episode of M*A*S*H . But when it comes to the single most repeated program in history, that title is claimed by none of television’s biggest names, but by an obscure British comedy sketch, filmed in 1963 with a cast of two, that has gained a cult audience all over the world. \nThe two stars in question were British comedian Freddie Frinton and 72-year-old actress May Warden. Frinton first made a name for himself in the music halls and variety shows of wartime Britain, and after World War II added a sketch to his show entitled \"Dinner For One.\" \nIn the sketch he plays James, a butler, employed by Miss Sophie, played by Warden, an upper class woman who is celebrating her 90th birthday with a fine banquet. Sadly, Miss Sophie has long outlived her four closest friends —Sir Toby, Admiral von Schneider, Mr. Pommeroy and Mr. Winterbottom—but places are set at her dinner table regardless, with James valiantly stepping in to impersonate each one. \nAs each of the four courses are served—with Miss Sophie explaining each time that the pair will follow the “same procedure as every year” —James tops up the four missing guests’ glasses, toasts Miss Sophie’s health, and downs them all. And needless to say, by the end of the meal (and after four glasses of sherry, four glasses of white wine, four glasses of champagne, and four glasses of port) James is slightly the worse for wear. At the end of the sketch, as they're going up to Miss Sophie’s bedroom, James asks, “Same procedure as last year?” and Miss Sophie replies, “Same procedure as every year.” James responds, “Well, I’ll do my very best,”—a very risqué move at the time. \n\"Dinner For One\" was originally written in the 1920s by English author and scriptwriter Lauri Wylie, but it proved so popular with his audiences that Frinton eventually bought the rights to it and continued to perform it as part of his show for the next seven years. Then, during a tour of English seaside resorts in 1962, a German entertainer and television star named Peter Frankenfeld happened to see Frinton and Warden performing the sketch in Blackpool and asked if they would like to reproduce it as part of his TV show, Guten Abend . The following year, the pair travelled to Germany and filmed it in English—though under the German title \" Der 90 Geburtstag ,\" or “The 90th Birthday”— in front of a live studio audience; by then, the pair were so used to the material that it took just one take to get a flawless recording. \nBut how did such an unassuming sketch become the Guinness World Records ’ most repeated TV show ever? \nWell, besides proving immediately popular with Frankenfeld’s audience, part of the skit’s success lies in Frinton’s expert physical comedy (which needs no subtitles and so works across the language boundary) and partly in its short running time, which for many years made it the perfect short to fill time between broadcasts. After being used sporadically as little more than a time-filler over the next decade, in 1972, German television network Norddeutscher Rundfunk decided to schedule it at 6 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. The viewers loved it, and a now annual tradition was established. \n\"Dinner For One\" has been shown every New Year’s Eve in Germany since, and has established itself as such a traditional part of the country’s New Year celebrations that Miss Sophie’s catchphrase is now familiar to practically all native German speakers: In 1996, an opposition finance minister even accused his opponent of adopting “the same procedure as every year” in the German parliament. \nMore recently, others countries have gotten in on the tradition, and \"Dinner For One\" has now established itself as a New Year’s tradition in the likes of Denmark, Austria, and Sweden; as a pre-Christmas tradition in Norway, where it’s broadcast annually on December 23; and has amassed a cult following in countries as far afield as Estonia and South Africa. \"Dinner For One\" has since racked up more than 200 individual broadcasts ( it was reportedly shown 19 times on different German networks on New Year’s Eve 2003 alone), easily taking the title as the world’s most-repeated television program. Although ironically, for such a quintessentially British sketch, it has yet to be shown in its entirety on British television … More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "I want to unfriend someone on Facebook but I’m worried I’ll hurt their feelings. What should I do? First, a caveat: I may take a more callous approach to this than the average social media user. But I believe that no online friendship is a given; that every follow is earned. Curate your timeline, and do so rigorously.\nOn Twitter in particular I may unfollow someone in a fleeting fit of intolerance, possibly to reconnect if they pick up their game in future. Easy follow, easy go is the word – Twitter can be bad enough without voluntarily weathering the worst of it.\nNika (@Fitnika101) I'm at the point in my life where I will block or unfriend anyone who raises my blood pressure. I ain't got time for your closed minded BS\nOctober 26, 2016 This doesn’t apply as easily to Facebook , where the worst offenders can be blood ties and a hasty unfriending is more likely to create problems “in real life”. But even there it is worth being mindful about your network.\nThat’s not just for the sake of your own enjoyment (although removing former schoolmates, one-time acquaintances and any racists can improve the Facebook experience immeasurably). It’s also for the security of your information.\nRemember: people are creeping . Don’t make it any easier for them than you have to.\nscare and bday haver (@yayayamie) i never unfriend people on facebook because you never know who will be murdered / become a murderer\nOctober 17, 2016 A few years ago, when I accepted and requested people on Facebook more freely (it was the first year of uni – I was making these ties for life!), I had 800 friends.\nThen one day I watched an acquaintance scroll down her timeline.\nWhat your Facebook posts say about you – personality quiz Read more \nI was dismayed to discover my activity was everywhere, from the stupid pages I’d liked – “Going to the Winchester, Having a Pint and Waiting For This All To Blow Over”; “Getting Inappropriately Drunk in Low-Key Situations”, as was the style of the time – to my comments on the statuses of people she didn’t know.\nMy response was twofold: I became a lot more circumspect about what I posted on Facebook and I culled a lot of friends. I figured that if they didn’t already know I liked getting inappropriately drunk in low-key situations, they shouldn’t be able to find out online. \nMy rule of thumb, which I continue to follow, is if a year has passed since we’ve seen each other, and I wouldn’t stop and chat if we were to pass on the street, they are out of the fold.\nshannon athena ☔️ (@shannonathena) UNFRIEND THE PEOPLE YOU'VE SLEPT WITH ON FACEBOOK\nOctober 17, 2016 I may have gotten carried away. It’s been seven years since the Great Cull of Winter ’09 and I am still 170 Facebook friends shy of the number I started out with – the body count wouldn’t have looked out of place in a Game of Thrones finale. \nI accidentally liked a six-week-old photo on Instagram. What do I do? Read more \nI had also, perhaps, been naive about how personally many people would take this. I had some former friends messaging me – some hurt, some angry – to ask why they’d got the chop. It pays to ask yourself if this is a conversation you’re prepared to have when you go to unfriend someone or, even better, when your friendship is first requested – it’s a lot harder to sever ties than it is to form them in the first place.\nThese days, I am more circumspect about whose requests I accept. People tend to understand if you maintain a tightly guarded social media presence, only for close friends and family. It’s when they get cut from the team that it can turn ugly.\nLynn Collins (@LynnMarie2016) I love when irrelevant people unfriend/block me. It's like the trash took itself out. 😂\nOctober 21, 2016 Perhaps to help with these types of tough calls, in recent years platforms have introduced less antagonistic ways to manage your contacts, without them knowing.\nOn Facebook, “unfollowing” someone – the tab next to “friends” on their profile page – means you won’t see their bad content. It will be sort of like they don’t exist until you get a notification that it’s their birthday – a timely annual reminder to assess whether it’s worth maintaining your online friendship.\nguan (@guan) 6 Facebook friend birthdays today. Tempted to unfriend 3 of them.\nOctober 25, 2016 Muting (which has recently been extended to keywords and conversations) achieves the same on Twitter – and is an arguably more effective weapon against trolls than blocking, which I think can give them a sense of achievement.\nBut, as I said, your sense of obligation to others will likely exceed mine. If you regret hurting someone’s feelings by unfriending them, apologise and reconnect – or take the coward’s route: claim you were “hacked”.\nIf you have a question about online etiquette that needs damage control, email elle.hunt@theguardian.com or tweet her at @mlle_elle .",

      "text": "Facebook Facebook doesn't need to ban fake news to fight it \nMark Zuckerberg’s social media site doesn’t have to become a censor to help fight false stories. It can do a lot by helping its own users with context Facebook’s goal is to try and make sure readers come back every day. There isn’t much emphasis on the negative effects it has on society. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images   13.56 GMT Last modified on   13.59 GMT View   \nIn the wake of the US presidential election, almost everyone agrees that misinformation is a problem. Even Mark Zuckerberg has finally said that Facebook will take it seriously. “Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information,” he wrote earlier this week . \nZuckerberg’s message was slightly undercut for some users by the fact that it was accompanied by adverts for fake news. Ev Williams , the co-founder of Twitter, Blogger and Medium, posted his own example a few days later : links, claiming to be from ESPN and CNN, to stories that implying that Tiger Woods had died and Donald Trump had been “disqualified”, right next to the Facebook chief executive’s post. \nThose examples are the obvious extreme of Facebook’s problem: straightforward hoaxes, mendaciously claiming to be sites that they aren’t. Dealing with them should be possible, and may even be something the social network can tackle algorithmically, as it prefers to do. \nBut they exist at the far end of a sliding scale, and there’s little agreement on where to draw the line. Open questions like this explain why many are wary of pushing Facebook to “take action” against fake news. “Do we really want Facebook exercising this sort of top-down power to determine what is true or false?” asks Politico’s Jack Shafer . “Wouldn’t we be revolted if one company owned all the newsstands and decided what was proper and improper reading fare?” \nThe thing is, Facebook isn’t like the newsstands. And it’s the differences between the two that are causing many of the problems we see today. In print you have a number of contextual clues that suggest a story titled ‘Ed Miliband’s Dad Killed My Kitten’ might not be true. Not so on Facebook. Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA \nIf you walk into a newsagent’s, and pick up a copy of the Sunday Sport (American readers, think the National Enquirer but with a lower proportion of true stories), you have a number of contextual clues that suggest a story with the headline “ Ed Miliband’s Dad Killed My Kitten ” might not be entirely true. The prominent soft porn and chatline adverts; the placement alongside other stories like “Bus found buried at south pole” and “World War 2 Bomber Found on Moon”; and the fact that the paper is in its 30th year of publishing, letting readers build up a consistent view about the title based on previous experience. \nIf a friend shares that same article on Facebook, something very different happens. The story is ripped from its context, and presented as a standard Facebook post. At the top, most prominently, is the name and photo of the person you know in real life who is sharing the piece. That gives the article the tacit support and backing of someone you really know, which makes it far more likely to slip past your bullshit detector. \nNext, Facebook pulls the top image, headline, and normally an introductory paragraph, and formats it in its own style: the calming blue text, the standard system font, and the picture cropped down to a standard aspect ratio. Sometimes, that content will be enough for a canny reader to realise something is up: poor spelling, bad photoshopping, or plain nonsensical stories, can’t be massaged away by Facebook’s design sense. \nNonetheless, the fact that every link on Facebook is presented in the same way serves the average out the credibility of all the posts on the site. The Sunday Sport’s credibility gets a boost, while the Guardian’s gets a drop : after all, everyone knows you can’t trust everything you read on Facebook. \nThen, at the very bottom of the shared story, in small grey text, is the actual source. It’s not prominent, and because it’s simply the main section of a URL, it’s very easy to miss hoaxes. Are you sure you could spot the difference between ABC.GO.COM, the American broadcaster’s website, and ABC.CO.COM, a domain that was briefly used to spread a hoax story about Obama overturning the results of the election? A fake news report claiming that Facebook was to begin charging for its service. Photograph: Facebook \nThen below all of that, are three further buttons: like, share and comment. All three help spread the story, whether you support it or not, because Facebook’s algorithm views engagement with a post as a reason for showing it to more people. And while all three get a button to themselves, nowhere does Facebook provide a similar call to action for the most important response of all: clicking through, and reading the whole story in its original context. \nFor that, you’ll have to scroll back up – but by then, you’ve already moved on to the next article on your newsfeed. And even if you reacted with scepticism when you first read the headline, as time goes by, your initial reaction gets lost, and eventually it becomes one of those things you “just know”. \nIt’s not an accident that Facebook is designed this way. The company extensively tests its site, to ensure its layout is fully optimised for pursuing its goals. \nUnfortunately, Facebook doesn’t A/B test its site for public goods like “functioning media ecosystem” or “supporting extremist politicians”. Instead, the company’s goals are to maximise time spent on site, to try and make sure readers come back every day and continue to share posts, engage with content, and, ultimately, click on the adverts that have made the social network the fifth largest company in the world by market cap. \nSo, here’s what Facebook could do to help deal not with fake news, but with the negative effects it has on our society: de-emphasise who shared a story into your timeline, instead branding it with the logo and name of the publication itself, and encourage readers to, well, read, before or instead of liking, sharing and commenting. \nDoing so might not be great for Facebook’s bottom line, of course. The site would be less “sticky”, users would be more likely to click away and not come back, and the amount of sharing would drop. But maybe it’s time for Zuckerberg to take one for the team.",

(Photo: Jonathan Kolbe) \nBlue was a shy dinosaur, despite a park ranger calling her a “wild animal with killer instincts.” \nThe Velociraptor, whose name you might recognize from the movie Jurassic World , is the newest addition to the exhibit inspired by the 2015 Universal blockbuster. The Jurassic World exhibit debuts Friday in Philadelphia’s Franklin Institute after premiering in Melbourne, Australia, earlier this year. New to the U.S. museum experience is the Raptor Training Paddock, which USA TODAY exclusively previewed. \nGuests of 'Jurassic World' can learn all about dinosaurs by \"meeting\" the animals. (Photo: James Thomas) \nUnlike the roaring animatronic creatures on the exhibit, some more than 24 feet tall, Blue the raptor stood at only about 7 feet. And she was afraid. But a hologram, a raptor trainer reminiscent of Chris Pratt’s Jurassic World character, encouraged her to come greet me. “Easy, eyes on me,” he said to Blue, as I stared at her from the other side of a gate. She tentatively tiptoed toward me and got close to my face so I got a good look at her bluish scales, sharp teeth and blinking eyes. She jerked her head, like a giant chicken with claws instead of wings. She looked real. Until she scampered off, and I saw the actor’s human legs peeking out from under her puppet body. ",

      "text": "“MARK ZUCKERBERG, dead at 32, denies Facebook has problem with fake news.” The satirical headline, which made the rounds online this week, nicely encapsulates the most recent woes of the world’s largest social network: its algorithms, critics say, filled users’ newsfeeds with misinformation—and in the process influenced the American election result. But this is not the only problem the firm is grappling with. A volatile share price, privacy policies and advertising metrics have also kept Mr Zuckerberg (pictured) busy.\n“News” that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump or that a pizzeria in Washington, DC, is the home base of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton, were not confined to Facebook (nor were fake stories only a right-wing phenomenon). They often originate elsewhere, for instance on fake-news websites in Macedonia, which make good money via online ads, and on Twitter. But Facebook’s algorithms give prominence to such misinformation. They are tuned to maximise “engagement”, meaning they present users with the type of content that has already piqued their interest, as outrageous headlines tend to do.\nYet despite all the attention given to fake news, the other problems probably have Mr Zuckerberg just as worried. On November 18th, to the surprise of many, Facebook announced that it would buy back up to $6bn of its shares. That seemed to be in reaction to a 10% drop in its share price since it warned earlier this month that growth next year would be slower and margins lower, as ad space on its services gets tighter and it invests heavily in data centres. The buy-back signals that Facebook considers its shares undervalued, says Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital, an investment bank.\nA couple of days earlier, Facebook had to admit flaws in how it measures its traffic (for the second time in just a few weeks, after disclosing that it had overestimated the average viewing time for its video ads). This time it said that other numbers, including the quantity of clicks from Facebook posts to apps or websites, were smaller than previously stated. Although this did not lead advertisers to overpay, they are likely to make new demands of Facebook, for instance to provide more data about exactly how its ads are viewed.\nIt has also emerged that Facebook has “paused” the ongoing process of merging its data with those of WhatsApp, the messaging app it bought in 2014 for $19bn in shares. When the takeover was announced, Jan Koum, WhatsApp’s founder, promised users their data would stay apart. In August Facebook reneged on the pledge, which upset various privacy watchdogs in Europe. In September the city of Hamburg’s data-protection commissioner issued an order that stops Facebook collecting data from German users of WhatsApp.\nWhether all this will have a discernible impact on Facebook’s finances is a matter of debate among analysts. If advertisers have extra money to spend they do it where they get most bang for their buck, which, Google aside, is Facebook, says Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. In contrast, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research recently wrote that the focus on fake news and the concerns over the measurement of advertising could well cut revenue growth by a couple of percentage points.\nWhatever happens, Facebook’s heft ensures that it will remain in the firing-line. It has nearly 1.8bn monthly users, or about half of the internet population, and it serves up much of what people read online. Whereas Google dominates the market for ads related to online search, Facebook rules the one based on consumers’ online profiles. Together both firms accounted for all new online ad spending this year, according to Mr Wieser.\nWith immense size comes intense scrutiny. Yet it is not clear whether Mr Zuckerberg fully grasps this. When first asked about the role of fake news in the American election campaign, he said it was a “pretty crazy idea” to think Facebook had an impact on voters. Only when Google said last week that it would bar fake-news sites from using its ad services, did it take the same step.\nIn a blog post on November 19th Mr Zuckerberg both set out how the social network would deal with the problem and insisted that Facebook itself does not want to decide whether something is fake or not. But it emerged a few days later that Facebook has already developed a censorship tool, to be used in China should the firm be allowed back into the country, underlining that it knows precisely how to filter its content when it wants to.\nSome of these issues are easier to deal with than others. It should be straightforward enough to deal with any suggestion that Facebook is tricking advertisers. Answering the accusation that it is hurting democracy and violating people’s privacy raises far harder problems. In America almost half of adults now get their political news on Facebook. No other online firm, not even Google, has more data about consumers. More transparency would improve things across the board. So would an acceptance by Mr Zuckerberg of just what a heavy responsibility he now bears.\n under the headline The Mark of the social beast",

      "text": "Facebook and LinkedIn Spam Campaign Spreads Locky Ransomware Facebook and LinkedIn Spam Campaign Spreads Locky Ransomware By 0 \nAn ongoing spam campaign is using boobytrapped image files to download and infect users with the Locky ransomware, Israeli security firm Check Point reports. \nThe security firm says that malware authors have identified vulnerabilities in the Facebook and LinkedIn social networks that forcibly download an image file on the user's computer, but in some cases, the user had to click on the image to download it. \nMalware authors are spreading malicious image files via these two platforms. When users detect the automatic download, if they access the malformed image, malicious code will install the Locky ransomware on their computers. Vulnerabilities in Facebook and Linked remain unfixed \nCheck Point has declined to provide any technical details at the time of writing because both Facebook and LinkedIn haven't fixed the vulnerability exploited by the attackers. The company says it reported the issue back in September. \nThe company has warned users about opening what looks to be an image files with unusual extensions, such as SVG, JS or HTA. \nThis makes us believe the spammers are using double extensions to hide the true nature of the file. By default, Windows hides a file's extension. So when you see a file like image.jpg, it may be actually hiding a second extension, such as image.jpg.hta or image.jpg.js. \nThe file extensions which Check Point mentioned, SVG, JS, and HTA, have the ability to download content from an online server and run it. \nThe criminal group behind the Locky ransomware has used JS and HTA files to install their malware in the past, albeit via file attachments that arrived via spam emails, but not social media. Might be related to another Facebook spam campaign reported on Monday \nThis campaign looks to be related with a Facebook DM spam run discovered by security researcher Bart Blaze on Monday. \nBlaze reported that crooks were using Facebook to spread around a malicious SVG file that included malicious JavaScript code that downloaded the Nemucod malware and then the Locky ransomware. \nFor the time being, it may be safe to avoid opening any unsolicited file you receive via private messages on Facebook or LinkedIn, or files that mysteriously download to your PC.",
