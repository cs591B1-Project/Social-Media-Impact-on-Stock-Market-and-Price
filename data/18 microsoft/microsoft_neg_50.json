      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- European Union antitrust authorities are likely to clear Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. by Tuesday with conditions attached, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's competition regulator, has to decide by Dec. 6 whether to clear the deal or open an in-depth investigation into the merger. The commission is unlikely to open a probe, the people said.\nThe deal would be conditional on the implementation of concessions Microsoft offered the EU in November, though there may be some minor changes to those commitments, one of the people said.\nAs part of its remedy package, Microsoft offered to allow rival professional social networks to continue to have access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter. Microsoft's Outlook provides email and calendar management.\nMicrosoft's pledge would for example allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry.\nIn addition, Microsoft has also vowed to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. The acquisition has already been cleared in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. The company said in June that it didn't require regulatory approval in Japan, South Korea or China.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 13:55 ET (18:55 ",

      "text": "Stay on target iFixit Tears Down The Cadillac of MacBooks With The MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" Touch Bar Gets a Teardown by iFixit The Microsoft Surface Studio is an impressive piece of technology, especially for anyone who’s ever wanted a desktop version of the tablet rather than having to hunker down like a vagabond and using it while walking around. iFixit took the machine to task and gave it a proper teardown , as iFixit is wont to do.\nInside the package a good amount of powerful tech was found waiting, such as a 6th-Generation Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU with 8 GB, 16 GB, and 32 GB RAM, 1 TB and 2 TB hybrid storage options, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M GPU (paired with 2 GB GDDR5) or GTX 980M (paired with 4 GB GDDR5).\nThat’s enough to pique my interest, that’s for sure, and those are just some of the innards. The monitor is pretty fantastic, too: a 28-inch adjustable PixelSense Display with 4500 x 3000 resolution (192 DPI)—supporting sRGB, DCI-P3, and Vivid color profiles, plus 10-point multi-touch. It’s a powerful package, and its weight supports the idea, too: it’s a whopping 21 lbs.\nFor the techies interested in what kind of connections there are, it rocks four USB 3.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet jack and power inlet, SD card slot and 3.5 mm audio jack, and Mini DisplayPort. On the inside, of course, which is probably what everyone’s the most interested in, is a strip of air vents and rubber feet. Once you pull those things off and work your way inside you can access exhaust fans, the machine’s hybrid storage, and on board memory.\nThere’s an impressive heat sink with a powerful bit of cooling power, and a SATA hard drive connector within as well. It’s all pretty standard, except for the way you have to remove the RAM, CPU, and GPU. They’re soldered directly to the board, and you can’t upgrade them. Other components can be difficult to replace as well.\nIt looks like the Microsoft Surface Studio does a good job overall of acting as a desktop replacement from the Surface line, but its overall repairability factor of 5 may make some buyers hesitant.",

      "title": "EU Likely to Clear Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal",
      "text": "BRUSSELS—European Union antitrust authorities are likely to clear Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. by Tuesday with conditions attached, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's competition regulator, has to decide by Dec. 6 whether to clear the deal or open an in-depth investigation into the merger. The commission is unlikely to open a probe, the people said.\nThe deal would be conditional on the implementation of concessions Microsoft offered the EU in November, though there may be some minor changes to those commitments, one of the people said.\nAs part of its remedy package, Microsoft offered to allow rival professional social networks to continue to have access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter. Microsoft's Outlook provides email and calendar management.\nMicrosoft's pledge would for example allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry.\nIn addition, Microsoft has also vowed to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. The acquisition has already been cleared in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. The company said in June that it didn't require regulatory approval in Japan, South Korea or China.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 14:05 ET (19:05 ",

      "text": "Microsoft provides The Game Awards viewers a new trailer for Halo Wars 2 , which offers gamers a glimpse into the events leading up the action in the game. The Game Awards 2016 was home to numerous game announcements and new trailers for upcoming titles. During the event, Microsoft revealed a new trailer for its Xbox exclusive Halo Wars 2 , the real-time strategy game in development at 343 Industries and Creative Assembly.\nThe new Halo Wars 2 trailer provides viewers a bit of narrative leading up to the events of the game. Nearly three decades after the events of the original Halo Wars , and shortly after Halo 5: Guardians , Captain James Cutter and his crew stumble upon the Banished, an enemy force that broke away from the Covenant.\nIn the trailer, an artificial intelligence named Isabel explains the evil-doings of Atriox, the Brute leader of the Banished . Isabel explains how the Covenant used Atriox and his clan as “expendable muscle”, and how Atriox survived numerous wars before eventually rising up to become a legend. Eventually the Brute turned against the Covenant and started the Banished, an army of mercenaries hell-bent on acquiring the most powerful weapon in the galaxy. The full trailer can be seen below.\n\nThe trailer shows Atriox’s brutal fighting abilities and his intimidation and control over his army of Banished. Considering Atriox is the only creature to “defy the Covenant and survive”, he’s undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with, and one that will give players a great challenge throughout Halo Wars 2 .\nMeanwhile, players will take on the role of Cutter and his USNC army to take on and defeat Atriox and his Banished. Like its predecessor, Halo Wars 2 will provide players a birds-eye-view of the battlefield, and task players with making the most of their army and environment to defeat their enemy.\nThe Halo Wars 2 campaign will feature 13 missions and support cooperative gameplay. Additionally, the game will offer a number of multiplayer modes where up to six players can take on each other in quick-paced battles. Players can also enjoy single-player Skirmishes, where they take on AI enemies in the multiplayer game modes and maps.\n\nThe events of Halo Wars 2 will have a “big impact” on the currently unannounced Halo 6 , at least according to 343 Industries narrative director Kevin Grace. Hopefully that means 343 is planning to incorporate characters and events from Halo 5 into Halo Wars 2 as well.\nWhat do you think of the Halo Wars 2 trailer? Are you excited for the newest title in the Halo franchise?\nHalo Wars 2 is set to release February 21, 2017 for PC and Xbox One.\nSource: YouTube \n",

      "text": "surface dial teardown More Microsoft’s Surface Studio is a device defined by its premium user experience. It was engineered from the ground up to just feel great, and an important part of that package is the Surface Dial.\nUntil now it’s been something of a mystery: We knew what the Surface Dial did, and likely how, but thanks to the fine folks over at iFixit , now we can see exactly what makes it tick.\nThe Surface Dial is a unique peripheral. It expands the typical mouse-and-keyboard user input scheme in a really interesting and refreshing way. Even if you’re not a digital artist, you might find yourself using the Surface Dial for everyday tasks – it’s compatible with the whole range of Microsoft Office products and a growing number of productivity apps. So seeing what’s inside is a little bit like finding out how a magic trick works.\nMore: The Surface Dial might not be easy to repair, but the Surface Studio is.\nThe Surface Dial is a bit of a pain to get into once you pull off the magnetic battery enclosure, according to the iFixit teardown. Only after digging into the space between the plastic and magnesium enclosure was the iFixit crew able to get into the Surface Dial’s delicate internals, so it’s not exactly a user-repairable item.\nThe Dial’s non-user-repairable design became even more apparent as the iFixit team dug further in. Accessing the midframe of the device required taking apart the internal bearing mechanism — a plastic cage containing ball bearings, which gives the Surface Dial something like the feel of a premium speaker volume knob.\nGetting to the core of the Surface Dial not only required a series of specialized tools, but would also require drilling out some of the plastic covering up some of the screws which hold the internals in place.\nFollowing the teardown, iFixit gave the Surface Dial a low repairability score of 4 out of 10, and concluded that servicing any of the device’s internals would require a healthy dose of courage and probably a lot of patience.\nPre-order at Microsoft\nCan Dell’s best all-in-one challenge Microsoft’s new Surface Studio?

      "text": "Microsoft’s Surface Studio is a device defined by its premium user experience. It was engineered from the ground up to just feel great, and an important part of that package is the Surface Dial.\nUntil now it’s been something of a mystery: We knew what the Surface Dial did, and likely how, but thanks to the fine folks over at iFixit , now we can see exactly what makes it tick.\nThe Surface Dial is a unique peripheral. It expands the typical mouse-and-keyboard user input scheme in a really interesting and refreshing way. Even if you’re not a digital artist, you might find yourself using the Surface Dial for everyday tasks – it’s compatible with the whole range of Microsoft Office products and a growing number of productivity apps. So seeing what’s inside is a little bit like finding out how a magic trick works.\nMore: The Surface Dial might not be easy to repair, but the Surface Studio is.\nThe Surface Dial is a bit of a pain to get into once you pull off the magnetic battery enclosure, according to the iFixit teardown. Only after digging into the space between the plastic and magnesium enclosure was the iFixit crew able to get into the Surface Dial’s delicate internals, so it’s not exactly a user-repairable item.\nThe Dial’s non-user-repairable design became even more apparent as the iFixit team dug further in. Accessing the midframe of the device required taking apart the internal bearing mechanism — a plastic cage containing ball bearings, which gives the Surface Dial something like the feel of a premium speaker volume knob.\nGetting to the core of the Surface Dial not only required a series of specialized tools, but would also require drilling out some of the plastic covering up some of the screws which hold the internals in place.\nFollowing the teardown, iFixit gave the Surface Dial a low repairability score of 4 out of 10, and concluded that servicing any of the device’s internals would require a healthy dose of courage and probably a lot of patience.\nPre-order at Microsoft\nCan Dell’s best all-in-one challenge Microsoft’s new Surface Studio? Microsoft Surface Studio versus HP Envy 27: which all-in-one truly has it all? Microsoft Surface Dial ships November 10, but can be pre-ordered now for $100",

      "text": "Igor Bonifacic \nDecember 1, 2016 2:07pm \nIn the follow-up to its teardown of Microsoft’s Surface Studio, iFixit has taken apart the Surface Dial. The puck-like accessory was announced alongside Surface Studio during Microsoft’s Fall 2016 event. \nWhen placed on top of Surface Studio’s screen, Dial allows users to contextually adjust app settings. In Photoshop, for instance, the Dial can be used to access the program’s colour wheel. \nWhen not sitting on top of one of Microsoft’s Surface computers (the company plans to update the Surface Pro 3, Pro 4 and Book to make them compatible with Surface Dial), Dial can also adjust global system settings like sound volume. \nPreamble aside, the Surface Dial scored lower on iFixit’s repairability scale than the computer it’s meant to accompany. While it uses standard AAA batteries for power, all of its other components are difficult to access; in fact, gaining access to some of Dial’s most vital components requires drilling a hole.

      "text": "GoDaddy India MD Rajiv Sodhi quits to rejoin Microsoft   Rajiv Sodhi, the Vice President and Managing Director of GoDaddy India and Australia, has resigned from the internet domain registrar to join software giant Microsoft to lead its cloud and server business. “My focus is to lead the company to drive internet adoption amongst small businesses (SMBs) in India and bridge the digital divide in the country. We achieve that through driving massive awareness on mass media and online channels, localising our offerings for the market and providing the best customer care 24X7,” Sodhi said after his appointment at Microsoft. Sodhi had joined GoDaddy in 2012 and led several new projects, products and services in regional languages in India targeted at small business around the country. Under him, GoDaddy became India’s first domain provider to offer its services in regional languages. Prior to joining GoDaddy, Sodhi was Microsoft’s Director-India SMB, Cloud and Software Sales through Distribution and Reseller Channel Management. At Microsoft, Sodhi will be responsible for leading the company’s cloud business and compete with AWS — the global software giant’s main competitor in the cloud domain in India.",

      "title": "Getting Started With Azure Functions Cloud",
      "text": "Microsoft Azure Functions are a super-cool technology introduced by Microsoft. It brings together the code in an event-based programming model. If you need to implement a simple integration between your on-premise or cloud resources, without having complete service, a simple Azure function would be the best choice to go for. You can respond to any event with a set of actions needed to be performed by calling the code from any Azure solution or SaaS product.\nWith a given choice of using different languages like C# or Node.js, developing with code you're familiar with just makes coding more fun. It's way easy to integrate with DevOps. We will be seeing an example of this in this tutorial. More importantly, you have to pay only when the code actually runs. So, let’s get started.\nThis article provides a quick and smart high-level overview of Microsoft Azure Functions, with a practical example of how to start with creating an initial Azure Function using Node.js — and integrating it with GitHub. Also, we will learn how to integrate an output for Azure Functions with other Azure SaaS products, like DocumentDB (NoSQL).\nFor novice cloud developers, aspiring cloud architects, pre-sales consultants, and all other IT professionals associated with the cloud computing, especially with Microsoft Azure, this tutorial will explain the importance and capabilities of Microsoft Azure Functions.\nQuick High-Level Overview  Azure Functions is a solution for running small pieces of the code, or 'functions,' seamlessly in the cloud. Azure Functions can make development more productive, as the only area of concern is to code for handling a specific use-case or problem in an application, without actually worrying about the entire application or infrastructure it’s running on. Azure Functions can be developed in different languages, such as C#, Node.js, Python, or PHP, making it more developer friendly. \nAzure scales the code as needed, and you only need to pay for the time the code runs. \nKey features like choice of coding language, a pay-as-you-go use model, supporting favorite dependency libraries using NuGet, integrated security with OAuth providers, such as Azure AD, Facebook, Google, and other social channels, simplified integrations with Azure SaaS products, continuous integrations, and an open source runtime makes Microsoft Azure Functions a smart cloud technology to work with.\nHere, let's assume that you have Azure Portal Account. If not, create your free  Azure account . \nOnce you’re done with creating an Azure account, let’s start with creating our first Azure Function.\nCreate Azure Functions As of now, there are two ways to create Azure Functions. \nFirst, to go https://functions.azure.com and create an Azure Function. It looks like the screen below.\n\n\n\nThe second way, which I mostly prefer and will use in this tutorial, is to start from https://portal.azure.com .\n\nClick on New => Web + Mobile => Function App, as shown in below image.\n\n\nEnter the desired Function App name and other details. Select the storage account (or create a new one) and click on Create.\n\n\nNow, you will be taken to the  Get Started  page, where you can select to start based on some existing apps, or start from scratch, or you can import your code if you already have it and start from there.\n\nClick on New Function to start with.\n\n\nNow, you will be redirected to the page below with all sorts of different Azure Functions templates. As shown below, there is a dropdown for the language that you can pick from (Bash, Batch, C#, F#, JavaScript, PHP, PowerShell, and Python are the different language options available). \nThere is another dropdown for Scenario, namely — Core, API and Webhooks, Data Processing, Experimental, and Samples, by which you can filter the templates.\nHere, we will select 'GitHub Webhook — Node’ template which will be triggered as per the event over GitHub takes place. Give some appropriate name to this function and click Create.\nAs seen in below image, here, I am giving it name as 'fnLogGitHubIssueActivity' as will be logging details, when there is any comment being entered to Issue section at GitHub. \n\n\nOnce your template is selected, you will land on to the below page. As highlighted in below image, the Develop section consists of Function URL & GitHub Secret key (for integrating with GitHub) and Code (where the desired code needs to be written in). It will be populated with some code, which would log the comments and would be seen in the Log window, as seen below\n\n\nAssuming you have your GitHub account, go to GitHub and log onto your account. \nNavigate to Settings => Webhook & Services tab.\nEnter the Payload URL and Secret key, with the Function URL and GitHub Secret key from portal’s Functions window, respectively.\n\nAs shown in below image, you can select the Events for which we need to trigger the Azure functions. Here, we would select 'Issue comment' as we need to trigger the functions when someone enters the comment to any Issue in GitHub.\nOnce done, click on  Add webhook .\n\nAnd a webhook will be added, as shown below (always verify the URL to be on the safe side).\n\n\n\nTesting Enter the comment to an issue listed at GitHub. \nThe same should get logged into our Azure Function window's 'Log ' section.\n\nCool! It's working. \nYou would have noticed that till now, I haven't worked upon any development tool, like Visual Studio for writing code. It's only and only the portal that we have used so far, and that's one amongst the coolest features of using Azure Functions. Simplicity of coding with Azure Portal.\nBy now, I am sure you would be more familiar with Azure Functions. Let’s extend our tutorial, by integrating Azure Functions output with other Azure SaaS products.\nConsidering the above tutorial, we can log comments entered in GitHub issue section, in Azure products, like Azure Storage Table, Azure DocumentDB (NoSQL).\n\nIn this tutorial, I will log comments entered in GitHub to Azure DocumentDB, using Azure Functions.\nTo do this, go to the Integrate section in the Azure Functions window. Here, under Outputs, click on 'New Output' => Azure DocumentDB Document.\n\nClick on the 'New' link. You will be listed with the existing DocumentDB account associated with your Azure account, if any. You can go with selecting existing DocumentDB account or create a new one, as shown in the second image below. \nOnce account selection is done, the final window will appear. Click on Save, and navigate to the Develop section in your window.\n\nDocumentDB Account Listing \nNow in the Code section, add the highlighted code. This code will add comments to the selected DocumentDB document. You can directly copy the below code (be sure you code correct 'Document Parameter Name' present in Integrate window. Here, as you can see, this name is 'OutputDocument' and the same is added in code section).\n\n\nTesting Enter a new comment at the GitHub Issue thread.\n\nVerify the same at our DocumentDB Document Explorer.\n\n\n\nWhoa! How look how seamlessly we created the new Azure Function, integrated it with GitHub, and then easily extended the Functions output to Azure DocumentDB (NoSQL). All in less than 15 mins ! (This article though took longer time ;) )\nStill, for a more technical information about Microsoft Azure Functions, visit the  developer reference .\nConclusion Azure Functions is a super cool solution for processing data, integrating systems, working with the Internet of Things (IoT), along with building simple APIs and microservices. \nI would highly recommend Microsoft Azure Functions for performing tasks like image or order processing, file maintenance, long-running tasks that you want to run in a background thread, or for any tasks that you want to run on a schedule.\nI hope you have enjoyed this tutorial. If you have any questions with respect to the same or any interesting use-case or suggestion, please do comment below or write to me at meKasamShaikh@outlook.com.\nKnowledge grows by sharing! Don't forget to share this article. If it helped you, it will also help many others, too!\nThank You! Happy Azure Coding!",

      "text": "Anton Watman/Shutterstock\nOne of Windows’ most important security features is BitLocker support, which has provided full-disk encryption since Windows Vista first rolled out. Coupled with a compatible Trusted Platform Module, which is now required for new Windows 10 machines , BitLocker theoretically provides solid protection for a Windows machine that’s lost or stolen.\nHowever, any security feature is only as good as the entire system that surrounds it, and any weak link can present a vulnerability that renders it less than secure. For Windows 10, the weak link involves the fact that the operating system turns off Bitlocker during Feature Updates, aka upgrades, creating a potential exploit, as the official Win-Fu blog reports .\nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Edition aims to knock down ransomware\nAccording to Windows trainer and MVP Sami Laiho, the vulnerability occurs due to the ability to hit SHIFT+F10 during the reimaging process performed during a Feature Update and access the command prompt. This result in access by the non-admin account that’s in use during the update to the root SYSTEM folder and to all of the contents of the non-BitLocker-protected hard drive.\nThe following video provides an overview of the process:\nAccording to The Register , security experts further maintain that anyone with physical access to the machine could exploit the bug to access the BitLocker encryption keys. Fortunately, Microsoft is working on fixing the bug, which affects all relevant versions of Windows 10 including the production versions 1511 (November Update) and 1607 (Anniversary Update) , as well as newer Windows Insider builds.\nThe bug does require physical access to the Windows 10 machine, but once that’s accomplished, for example via theft or by an internal employee, then the bug allows admin access to the system once an upgrade is kicked off. Until Microsoft issues a fix, Laiho recommends disallowing unattended upgrades and using the Long-term Servicing Branch version of Windows 10. That’s not much help to nonenterprise Windows 10 users, however, and so maintaining physical control over a Windows 10 machine becomes that much more important.\nDJI’s cinematic drone gets more precise flight controls with new Pro version Researchers: Intel CPUs are inherently flawed and open to a specific attack Here are 5 features that will make you upgrade to MacOS Sierra",

      "text": "Unlike Apple, Microsoft Wants Windows Phones to Have a Headphone Jack GO Headphone jack still “required” for Windows phones Dec 2, 2016 07:22 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 was certainly one of the most controversial topics of the year, especially because it impacted a popular feature of modern smartphones. It goes without saying that Apple abandoning the 3.5mm audio port was considered just the beginning of a new trend that would have other mobile phone manufacturers across the world doing the same thing, with the rumor mill now suggesting that Samsung itself might ditch the jack for next flagships . But as far as Microsoft is concerned, this is not going to happen because the headphone jack remains an important feature of today’s smartphones and the majority of customers already have headphones that they use on a daily basis with their devices. As CW sharply noticed, the headphone jack continues to be listed as “required for phones” on Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile device minimum hardware requirements page, and it’s unlikely to see any change in the near future. Microsoft and the Surface Phone Truth be told, Microsoft is no longer a very active player in the hardware business in the Windows 10 Mobile ecosystem, and there are rumors that the company could even discontinue the Lumia brand sometime this month. On the other hand, Microsoft is believed to be working on a so-called Surface Phone that would be the “ ultimate device ,” as CEO Satya Nadella himself described it, and the launch could take place sometime next year, possibly in the fall. Given the existing hardware requirements, the Surface Phone, if it ever sees daylight, is very likely to come with the headphone jack, and it makes sense since Microsoft wants its phone to be used as a PC as well with help from Continuum. And yet, there are other ways that would allow Microsoft to deal with a possible removal of the headphone jack and still offer the 3.5mm audio port when used as a PC, such as a dedicated connector integrated into the Continuum dock. This would involve offering an adapter, as is the case with Apple and the iPhone 7, to allow the Surface Phone to be used with headphones while on the go. Of course, everything could change even in the case of Microsoft, especially since the company’s latest phones already embraced USB Type-C, which can also be used for audio output, so it remains to be seen how Redmond sees the evolution of its mobile ecosystem in this regard.",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update Preview Build 14977 GO New build available exclusively for mobile insiders Dec 2, 2016 05:41 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has rolled out Windows 10 Mobile build 14977 for insiders enrolled in the Fast ring to finally bring EPUB ebook support for Microsoft Edge on smartphones. One important mention is that no PC builds are being released this week “due to a blocking bug that could result in broken apps after updating to a new build,” as the company itself explained, but this is alright given the fact that previously, only PC insiders got an update. In terms of new features, Windows 10 Mobile build 14977 only comes with EPUB ebook support for Microsoft Edge, a feature that was previously introduced on PC as well. “When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark,” Microsoft explains. “As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words.” With this change, Microsoft is basically making Edge not only an advanced browser but also a pretty powerful document reader, as it can already handle PDF documents and other common formats. And starting today, it’s also possible to read EPUB ebooks without any other tweaks. Known bugs and more improvements There are obviously some other fixes and improvements, and you can read details about all of them in the box below, but there is one thing that everyone should have in mind when updating to this build. Microsoft says that you should by all means avoid installing new languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone because these downloads could get stuck and not finish downloading. This is a known bug and Microsoft says that users who already installed these in previous builds shouldn’t experience any issue, so the workaround is to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install the keyboards or languages you need and then update again to this build.

      "title": "Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses - Fox Business",
      "text": "Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses \nBy Rob Marvin Print \nMicrosoft is giving small to midsize businesses (SMBs) a new sales and marketing tool with the release of Outlook Customer Manager , a customer relationship management (CRM) application within the Microsoft Outlook email client. Available through the \"Customer Manager\" tab in the toolbar, Outlook Customer Manager is an automated organizational tool designed to surface emails, events, documents, tasks, and other interactions to help business users more effectively manage customer relationships. \nContinue Reading Below \nOutlook Customer Manager essentially turns Outlook into a smart sales inbox. When you click on the tab in the Outlook 2016 toolbar, it brings up a timeline view of automatically organized sales information including calls, deadlines, deals, emails, files, meetings, notes, and tasks related to specific customers. The app exists entirely within Microsoft Office 365 . According to Microsoft, the information in the timeline is gathered from email, calendar, and call log data pulled from various Office 365 apps. \nUsing Outlook Customer Manager, users can also set up reminders to respond to a customer interaction, and associate tasks with a contact, company, or deal. Plus, you can also organize deals in a few different ways. A Microsoft spokesperson provided PCMag with some additional insight, pointing out that you can share specific customer information with a team and use a feature called Focused list, which details particularly important customers and deals. More From PCmag PCMag Startup Toolkit: December 2016 \n\"The information in the timeline is automatically gathered from the email, calendar, and call log data from the Office 365 environment,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \"Outlook Customer Manager helps you stay on top of opportunities and commitments by surfacing timely reminders, letting you associate tasks with a contact, company or deal, and listing deals by stage, close dates, priority, and amount. To help you prioritize your time, the system automatically presents a Focused list of your most important customers and deals.\" \nThe app is currently rolling out to Business Premium subscribers at no extra cost and will be generally available in early 2017. Microsoft is also working to enable full mobile access to Outlook Customer Manager, and has already released a dedicated iOS app that includes meeting information, notetaking, and mobile scanning for business cards. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nWhat about Dynamics? Outlook Customer Manager gives SMBs a light CRM app within Microsoft's email client, but Microsoft also has a standalone CRM app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 . The company has a full-blown enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution as well with Microsoft Dynamics GP , which incorporates CRM along with general ledger, sales, human resources (HR), and accounting and finance features. \nMicrosoft describes Outlook Customer Manager as a lighter CRM app within Office 365 for SMBs that aren't necessarily large enough to employ an entire sales team. The app is geared toward helping entrepreneurs and small business users who are conducting lead acquisition and customer outreach themselves; it gives them an easy, built-in way to manage information and stay on top of interactions. Dynamics 365, on the other hand, is a more heavy-duty CRM platform that provides deeper customer information and financial data as businesses scale up and expand their sales and marketing operations. \n\"Outlook Customer Manager is designed for small businesses that want to stay on top their customer and deal information,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \" Natively built into Outlook, it is simple to get started with and easy to use as a first customer management tool for small businesses. As their needs grow, business can move to Dynamics 365 for sales to take advantage of enhanced customer information, sales process consistency and efficiency, and deeper financial and customer insights.\" \nHow CRM is Getting Smarter Outlook Customer Manager is indicative of a larger trend around using machine learning and automated workflows to better organize and surface customer data. The new Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence (AI) platform bakes in deep learning and predictive analytics throughout the Salesforce CRM cloud, and we've already seen other CRM players begin to implement these kinds of smart email and predictive sales analytics features as well. \nThe major redesign to Zoho CRM came with a new product called SalesInbox, which offers a dedicated mail client for salespeople that uses contextual CRM data to surface relevant emails. Other CRM players have also implemented similar features in the past year, with Pipedrive CRM adding smart email and Base CRM integrating intelligent sales forecasting and email sentiment analysis using predictive analytics data. \nWe're seeing advances in machine learning and business intelligence (BI) across a host of business use cases. Through Outlook Customer Manager, Microsoft is using this kind of data automation to make it easier for small businesses without a dedicated sales team to efficiently manage customer relationships. As we head into 2017, the role AI and data automation in CRM will only grow as businesses look for smarter, more efficient ways to manage interactions, engage leads, and convert them into loyal customers.",

The company declined to comment if it would make the headphone jack an optional port. \nThe headphone jack port isn't a requirement for other Windows devices, including laptops, desktops, tablets, or IoT devices. \nApple gave several reasons for removing the port, saying it was old technology, and said it blocked the integration of newer technologies in the already compact iPhone 7. \nBefore Apple, Android phone makers like LeEco and Lenovo also cut headset jacks from some mobile devices to move on from legacy technology. \nWindows Mobile phone makers could still include wireless audio alongside headphone jacks. But the phone makers will lose opportunities to make devices thinner and experiment with new technologies to replace the headset jack. \nBeyond wireless audio, there's a big push to make the USB-C port the replacement to headphone jacks. Pushing audio through USB-C port and removing audio jacks will allow smartphones to be thinner. \nIt's important to move on to newer technologies, but Microsoft's hesitance to remove the headphone jack requirement has technical and financial merits, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. \nThere was a user backlash when Apple removed headphone jacks from the iPhone 7. People were upset at being forced with the extra cost of buying a wireless headset. Moreover, the wireless headsets have to be charged. \nThe quality of wireless audio isn't as reliable as it is on headphone jacks, O'Donnell said. Apple has, however, developed a special wireless audio chip that delivers audio from the iPhone 7 to the AirPod using three separate communications protocols. That ensures continued high-quality audio streaming. \nMicrosoft still sells Windows phones but has been cryptic about their future. Other Windows phone makers include HP, Acer, Alcatel, and Lenovo. \nSmartphones with Windows have been taken a beating at the hands of iOS and Android. Shipments of Windows phones totaled 1.48 million in the third quarter of 2016, plunging from 5.87 million units in the same quarter a year ago. \nThe market share for Windows Mobile reached a rock-bottom 0.4 percent during the second quarter, declining from 1.7 percent a year ago, according to a report released by Gartner last month. By comparison, Android's market share was 87.8 percent, and iOS's share was 11.5 percent during the third quarter.

Microsoft Pix 1.0.22 comes with some other improvements as well, including tweaks for the default levels of white balance to be slightly warmer in order to enhance the healthy glow of skin tones. In other words, photos should now look a little bit more natural, but Microsoft should do is offer more manual controls in order to give users the option to manually adjust white balance.

This new navigation experience makes it easier for all users to access their most important content and makes authors more productive.\nA new left navigation bar that makes it easier to access content quickly. With Recent, get quick access to the dashboards and reports you’ve most recently accessed – across all of your workspaces. With Shared with m e , we’re introducing a new location for all dashboards that are shared with you by others. You can filter by the owner of the dashboard or search to find what’s relevant and also sort the items by the date it was shared with you. And for shared content you visit frequently, it is even easier to favorite it right from the Shared with me view. Improvements are made to way that content appears in your ‘My workspace’ or Group Workspaces. The content shows up on the main canvas area, with separate tabs for dashboards, reports, workbooks and datasets. If you want to try this new experience, you can learn how to opt-in to the preview today .",

      "title": "Careful with that Surface Dial — iFixit teardown reveals it’s a pain to repair",
      "text": "surface dial teardown More Microsoft’s Surface Studio is a device defined by its premium user experience. It was engineered from the ground up to just feel great, and an important part of that package is the Surface Dial.\nUntil now it’s been something of a mystery: We knew what the Surface Dial did, and likely how, but thanks to the fine folks over at iFixit , now we can see exactly what makes it tick.\nThe Surface Dial is a unique peripheral. It expands the typical mouse-and-keyboard user input scheme in a really interesting and refreshing way. Even if you’re not a digital artist, you might find yourself using the Surface Dial for everyday tasks – it’s compatible with the whole range of Microsoft Office products and a growing number of productivity apps. So seeing what’s inside is a little bit like finding out how a magic trick works.\nMore: The Surface Dial might not be easy to repair, but the Surface Studio is.\nThe Surface Dial is a bit of a pain to get into once you pull off the magnetic battery enclosure, according to the iFixit teardown. Only after digging into the space between the plastic and magnesium enclosure was the iFixit crew able to get into the Surface Dial’s delicate internals, so it’s not exactly a user-repairable item.\nThe Dial’s non-user-repairable design became even more apparent as the iFixit team dug further in. Accessing the midframe of the device required taking apart the internal bearing mechanism — a plastic cage containing ball bearings, which gives the Surface Dial something like the feel of a premium speaker volume knob.\nGetting to the core of the Surface Dial not only required a series of specialized tools, but would also require drilling out some of the plastic covering up some of the screws which hold the internals in place.\nFollowing the teardown, iFixit gave the Surface Dial a low repairability score of 4 out of 10, and concluded that servicing any of the device’s internals would require a healthy dose of courage and probably a lot of patience.\nPre-order at Microsoft\nCan Dell’s best all-in-one challenge Microsoft’s new Surface Studio? Microsoft Surface Studio versus HP Envy 27: which all-in-one truly has it all? Microsoft Surface Dial ships November 10, but can be pre-ordered now for $100",

      "text": "Why not give your loved one a Surface Pro 4 convertible tablet instead of four calling birds on the fourth day of Christmas this year? How about an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift VR headset on the ninth day in lieu of nine ladies who might need a bit of convincing to randomly start dancing and impress that special someone?\nIf you can’t afford to spend between $600 and $800, the US Microsoft Store will also have you covered with ultra-low-cost Windows laptops, tablets, Xbox games and controllers during the 2016 “12 Days of Deals” celebrations.\nVery shortly after wrapping up the Black Friday and Cyber Monday discount bash , Redmond will roll out new and old daily special offers starting Monday, December 5. But our mobile-focused readers may find the December 8 and 16 deals the most compelling of the bunch, with the Surface Pro 4 first sold at $250 off list in an entry-level Core m3 configuration, and then including up to $359 savings, presumably in higher-end variants.\nIt’s worth highlighting the former $649 bargain shall also fetch you a free sleeve, while the latter sounds awfully similar to a Best Buy Cyber Week promo still up for grabs right now.\nYou probably don’t want to ignore Microsoft’s “up to 70%” savings on “select Windows 10 tablets” either, coming December 9, or December 13’s refreshed $100 gift code deal with HTC Vive or Oculus Rift purchases.\nThe post Microsoft fully previews ’12 Days of Deals’ on Surface Pro 4, VR headsets, and more appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "​Microsoft is pushing hard for everyone on Windows 10 to stick with Edge, and the company has even turned to what it calls “tips notifications” (or as others describe them, ads) to convince users to give it a try, but all these efforts don’t seem to pay off just yet. Statistics provided by NetMarketShare for the month of November show that Microsoft Edge is very far behind all its rivals, and what’s worse, is even going in reverse when it comes to market share evolution. At this point, Microsoft Edge has a market share of 5.21 percent, which makes it the fourth most-used browser across the world, but all its rivals are ahead, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. For what it’s worth, Internet Explorer is doing a lot better, even though Microsoft no longer releases new features and improvements to the app. Windows 10 availability One of the reasons Edge is suffering from limited adoption is that it’s exclusively available in Windows 10, and...",

      "text": "​Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system keeps growing in terms of Steam adoption and new data provided by Valve for the month of November shows that nobody can stop its ascension trend that began when it officially launched in July 2015. At this point, Windows 10 is powering no less than 48.37 percent of the computers on Steam, up 0.39 percent from the previous month, but at the same time, Windows 7 also improved its share to 28.82 percent, an increase of 0.16 percent versus October. Windows XP still alive What’s a little bit surprising is that the 32-bit version of Windows 10 actually declined 0.12 percent to 1.23 percent, but overall, Windows 10 is still growing when analyzing the performance of both versions. Windows 8.1 64-bit continues to be the third top operating system on Steam with a share of 8.59 percent, down 0.11 percent, while the core Windows 8 is losing ground fast and is currently at 1.19 percent.

      "title": "Christmas comes early for music fans, with nine free holiday albums from Microsoft",
      "text": "The holiday spirit is strong with Microsoft, as Surface Pro 4-headlined “12 Days of Deals” will begin on Monday, just as various Cyber Monday leftovers are set to expire. Meanwhile, today only, i.e. until 11:59 p.m. PT on December 2, or “while supplies last”, US Windows Store visitors can nab a boatload of premium Christmas audio content free of charge.\nAll you technically need to do is present a valid Groove Music Pass before enjoying your complimentary downloads, or simpler and cheaper yet, sign up now for a free 30-day trial. That’s technically , because it seems the restriction can be circumvented if you really don’t want to try out Redmond’s digital music streaming service , formerly dubbed Xbox and Zune Music.\nAs for exactly what you’re getting, it’s a bona fide holiday must-have for tree decorators, stocking stuffers, and even heart-growing Grinch copycats. In fact, you can probably put the original soundtrack of Boris Karloff’s 1966 animated classic “How The Grinch Stole Christmas” at the top of your free holiday playlist.\nFollow that up with Justin Bieber’s retro and modern “Under the Mistletoe, Deluxe Edition” album mix, Ariana Grande’s first holiday EP, “Christmas Kisses”, “A Mary Christmas” from Mary J. Blige, The Jackson 5’s “Ultimate Christmas Collection”, Rod Stewart’s “Merry Christmas, Baby” deluxe variant, the remastered and expanded “A Charlie Brown Christmas” soundtrack, “A Motown Christmas”, and last but not least, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra’s “Dreams of Fireflies.”\nIn total, that’s nine great albums, typically worth a combined $80 or so, available for free on Windows PCs and phones, iOS, Android devices and more.\nThe post Christmas comes early for music fans, with nine free holiday albums from Microsoft appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft’s been rolling out a lot of new backwards-compatible games this month, the latest of which is 2006’s beloved The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Bethesda tweeted that Oblivion , and all its DLC with the exception of Shivering Isles, was available for download on the Microsoft store. As always, if you still have the original disc, your game will be downloaded free of charge. Oblivion , which has been out for over 10 years, arrives right on the coattails of backwards-compatible versions of Mass Effect 2 (2010) and 3 (2012) , which were debuted earlier this month. Bethesda’s banking on the nostalgia \nThough the road to backwards compatibility was tumultuous to say the least, Microsoft seems to be finally making good on their years-old promise of bringing fan favorite games to their next generation consoles. Far and away the most requested game to be brought back to life, Red Dead Redemption (2010), was finally revived in July 2016. Other favorites making a comeback include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2007), XCOM: Enemy Unkown (2012), Assassin’s Creed II (2009), and the Gears of War series. \nThe Oblivion revival is the first backwards-compatible Elder Scrolls game. Previously, Bethesda brought back Fallout: New Vegas (2010) , and Fallout 3 (2008) became available the same day as Fallout 4. The Skyrim (2011) remaster released earlier this month was largely a disappointment—offering no new content and graphics that users have been running on PC since 2012. Bethesda fans are largely calling for remasters of older titles like Oblivion and Morrowind (2002) , and ports of newer titles like Skyrim— a sensible opinion. As Bethesda rushes in the shadows to bring us Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond, it appears as if they’re banking on nostalgia to bring in quick funding for their future exploits. \nRegardless, I’m happy to see an old favorite re-emerge in time for the holidays. \nYou can purchase Oblivion directly from the Microsoft store — and please, for the love of Akatosh, don’t become a vampire.

      "text": "\nIt’s been more than a year since Microsoft released Windows 10. The OS saw huge growth following the initial launch — but, as expected, growth as started slowing down over the past couple of months. According to a recent report from Net Market Share, the operating system claims 24% of the desktop market , but it didn’t see a huge growth over the past few months. The same applies to Steam’s latest Hardware Survey report.\nAccording to the latest Steam Hardware Survey report , 49.6% of Steam users are running Windows 10 — with 48.37% of users running the 64-bit version of the OS, while the other 1.23% are running the 32-bit of the OS. For comparison, 49.33% of Steam users were running Windows 10 last month which clearly shows the slow growth for the OS.\nOther operating systems, on the other hand, didn’t see any growth last month. For example, 8.69% users are now running Windows 8.1 — but 0.12% of the users moved to other operating systems in the past month. Additionally, 34.22% of users are now gaming on Windows 7 — but it gained only 0.01% users. Interestingly enough, macOS Sierra gained 0.95% of users.\nWindows 10’s growth will likely start increasing once more businesses start moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10. As for gamers, this will likely change as well as more gamers will probably want to move to Windows 10 because of the new gaming features in the Windows Store. As more desktop games are coming to the Windows Store, more gamers will likely be interested in switching to Windows 10.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft Programming Chief Julia Liuson: How We Moved From Windows Platform, To Any Platform",
      "text": "[caption id=\"attachment_2642\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Microsoft's Julia Liuson: \"Big open source projects like Android, Chrome and Java happen with a design process that is essentially behind the corporate wall -- we decided not to do that with our approach to open source and instead work with an 'inclusive design process' from the start for .NET and Visual Studio Code etc.\" Image credit: contentparty.org[/caption]A decade ago when Microsoft asked: Where do you want to go today? It didn't really mean we could go anywhere, in a truly open software sense of the term. They (it, the firm) really meant: Where do you want to go today within a Windows-specific 'proprietarily' closed platform of software using our applications, browser and tools? But that would have made a really shoddy marketing slogan.Latterly, in an attempt to broaden, Microsoft moved on to use Windows Everywhere , but even this slogan has now become redundant. Today in late 2016, the firm has adopted a different tune and it is one of: Any developer, any app, any platform , at the software engineering and programming level at least, which ostensibly translates directly to the user level too.Yes okay, obviously, Microsoft would still like all roads to lead back to Windows and its other platforms if occasionally possible -- Azure cloud, Office 365, .NET and its newer breed of cognitive services -- but something of a turnaround has occurred. Turning the big ship around\nA shift from focusing on proprietary platforms to embracing an open source approach doesn’t happen overnight and requires something much deeper than marketing slogans. The questions triggered by this big change are: h ow has the firm been re-engineering itself, what's life been like inside the big ship making the turnaround and can we see any holes in the argument it is now putting forward?\nJulia Liuson is corporate vice president for Visual Studio at Microsoft and is responsible for developer tools and services, including all the firms programming languages and runtimes. In other words, she's the software boss at Microsoft.Speaking at the company's recent Connect () 2016 event in New York, Liuson opened up on a few truths as she detailed the Microsoft journey from 'Linux is a cancer' (in the era of Ballmer) to 'any platform is cool by us' today. Truth be told, many of the open platform (Linux related and otherwise) developments were happening inside Microsoft even During Ballmer (DB). As we have reported before on Forbes , Microsoft's Amanda Silver has explained how the firm had been working with open source JavaScript standards (as best it could) even in less open times. Microsoft's Liuson tells a similar and related set of story facts. Maybe the whole #womeninIT drive for diversity should have been a whole lot more prevalently promoted a very long time ago (clue: of course it should). \"We talk now about how Microsoft is ‘open by design’ now. In fact the very first product that Microsoft open sourced came from my team and this was WiX [a Windows setup and installation engine] and this happened back in 2004. We were probably immature in terms of how to open source at that stage, but we wanted to try something out with that product,” said Liuson. Despite previous CEO Ballmer’s apparent reticence for all things Linux, the firm did actually initiate its first work with Linux (including the launch of the TypeScript open source project) during his tenure. Admittedly, this was primarily and initially with a view to ensuring compatibilities, the wider embrace of the community model came a little later. Open source Word & Excel unlikely “Microsoft is a big company, there were plenty of internal legal challenges that we had to go through and things tend to happen on a department by department basis. So if you are going to ask would the Office division ever open source Word and Excel? Probably not, that just wouldn’t make sense,” explained Liuson. Liuson says she get the question all the time: when is Windows going to be open source? She says that she always laughs and says that, “You should ask Terry that question.” In which case she is referring to Terry Myserson in his role as Windows lead.So what does open by design mean to Microsoft and what does the firm think about the ‘well known’ corporate open source projects? Open Google is behind a corporate wall “So what do I mean when I say ‘open by design’ you ask? If you think about Java, if you think about Chrome, if you think about Android… these are all supposed to be open source projects, but they tend to present huge chunks of code update [much in the same way that a proprietary project would]. You as a developer can submit bug fixes and various nuances, but the design process happens behind the corporate wall even though the final source code is out in the open. This is one definite approach that we decided NOT to do with .NET and Visual Studio Code as we moved to open source them. We want inclusive design meetings to be able to build the future of this technology stack with our developer community,” said Liuson. How does Microsoft actually work with the outside world then? Code commits come in a comparatively standard project as they come in the form of a pull request on the open soucre GitHub code repository. But open source means a lot more than code i.e. there are designs, presentation layer user interface artistry and even international language localization tasks. In total then, open source contribution can be quite an unstructured total process. Would open Microsoft have killed the start button? “Well, that’s a tough question, from my own personal experience I can tell you that there were plenty of Microsoft employees that felt both ways about it. We knew that we needed to move towards presenting a more mobile platform compliant operating system and that’s one of the reasons why it happened,” said Liuson. Looking at how Microsoft now delivers its products, not just for Windows, but for any platform, Liuson talks about the importance of services. She asserts that when a software firm ships a boxed product (as we were used to on DVDs and CD-ROMs and floppies in the past) there is a natural disconnect and you never really get to know your customer.In the world of services (and cloud computing) you are constantly connected to your software customer and can start to provide continuous development/deployment, continuous updates and continuous integration. Is Microsoft viewed as truly open source now? “I would say, to answer that question, not yet,\" admitted Liuson. \"But I would like people to view Microsoft as very open source friendly. But we are a business and we need to earn a salary somehow, so there will of course be a monetization strategy behind much of what we do.\" Given that Liuson has been with the firm for 24 years, it has obviously been interesting to work through a quarter century of change. Looking at the year ahead, the firm has been open about the fact that it has to make some of its more recent open technology announcements 'actually work' in terms of developer tools. So here think about Visual Studio for Mac as a prime example of a product that is so new and so open (that's another story, it has some .NET in it, but that's open now too) that the firm's focus will turn to refining it and making it functional in front of the always-critical open developer community. Looking high level then, do we buy it? Do we accept the really truly open Microsoft? The critically negative answer is: Well, mostly, but then the firm still has deeply rooted monetization streams drawing us back to paid services across Azure and its other platforms and some would argue that Microsoft still has to learn some of the behavioural nuances exhibited in 100% pure Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) community circles. The optimistically positive answer is: Yes, driven by CEO Satya Nadella and the firm's Scott Guthrie, Microsoft has turned the ship around in as big a move as in IBM under Lou Gerstner (a switch from devices to services) and as Intel did under Andy Grove (a switch from memory to microprocessors).If you're looking for the truth, then it's probably somewhere in between the two above.",

This new service will allow customers to convert their data from StorSimple format to Azure blobs. Once the data is in Azure, they can use an Azure service such as Azure Media Services, Azure HDInsight, or Azure Machine Learning to process this data.\nUsing StorSimple Data Transformation, files that you put into your StorSimple on-premises volumes will be converted to Azure blobs. Each file will reside as a blob in your storage account.\nSince StorSimple is often used for storing media content, Microsoft now has the option of converting files directly into media assets in Media Services account. Customers can set up jobs that can move data in a transparent and seamless way with a few clicks. They can initiate these jobs from the Azure Portal, or they can even integrate the APIs in their code.",

      "text": "Microsoft Teams is available to most Office 365 customers. Image: Microsoft \nMicrosoft's chat and collaboration platform Teams may be arriving some time after Slack but thanks to its integration with Office 365, has a few tricks of its own up its sleeve. \nTechRepublic's smart person's guide to Microsoft Teams is a quick introduction, as well as a \"living\" guide that will be revised periodically as new updates are released. Executive summary What is Microsoft Teams? A chat and collaboration platform for Microsoft Office 365 customers designed to simplify group work. Why does Microsoft Teams matter? As well as the chat-based comms, Teams' integration with other Microsoft services allows for shared files and calendars, collaborative editing, and easy switching between voice, video and text chat. The main weakness, in its existing Preview state, is it can't be used to collaborate with anyone outside of an organization. Who does Microsoft Teams affect? The service is available to most subscribers to Microsoft cloud-based Office 365 suite. When is Microsoft Teams happening? Teams is currently available in Preview and will be launched as a generally available service to Office 365 subscribers in January next year. How do I get Microsoft Teams? Enable it in the Office 365 admin center, following the instructions here . What is Microsoft Teams? \nTeams is Microsoft's take on chat-based communication for business, its answer to competing platforms such as Slack and Atlassian's HipChat. \nIn its simplest form the service allows users to set up Teams, each of which is essentially a hub for group chat rooms, which are called channels. \nMultiple chat rooms or channels can be created within a Team and to help keep chats easy to follow, conversations are threaded, flow from top to bottom and notify users of updates. If users need face-to-face conversation, they can jump straight into Skype voice or video chats with other channel participants with a single click. \nHowever, Microsoft is pushing the platform as being more than just a chat hub. Teams is integrated with Microsoft's online office suite Office 365, which means it is tied to other Microsoft Office services, such as Word and Excel, as well as its cloud storage and sharing services such as SharePoint. PowerPoint, OneNote, Planner, Power BI and Delve are also integrated with Teams. \nConsequently any documents, spreadsheets, presentations and the like that are shared within a Team are synced with a copy stored in Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage and a local SharePoint environment, so every Team member always has access to the latest version. Collaborative editing of this shared content is also possible, with each user's changes reflected in the Office software in real time. \nEven if someone doesn't like using Teams, the service's integration with Office 365 means that important updates or content generated within the collaboration platform can be flagged up outside of Teams, for instance Microsoft Delve might highlight an update to an important shared file. \nTeam channels can also communicate with outside services via Connectors. Connectors already exist to push updates from GitHub, Zendesk, MailChimp and Salesforce to Teams' channels and an API framework is available to allow more to be built. Teams will ship with over 70 Connectors and 85 Bots. From within Chat, every Team channel will have access to T-Bot, a bot that can answer simple questions users have about Teams. \nAccess to files, internal sites and dashboards is automatically controlled by Office 365 Groups and SharePoint, with users able to create a new Group or attach the Team to an existing Group when creating the Team. \nAdditional resources",

      "text": "The Microsoft Surface tablet is demonstrated for guests at the Microsoft Annual Shareholders Meeting in Bellevue, Washington on November 30, 2016. / AFP / Jason Redmond (Photo credit should read JASON REDMOND/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo : ASON REDMOND/AFP/Getty Images) Advertisement \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is said to be released next year. The oddly surprising thing is that the Surface Pro 4 is still dominating the market and people are already expecting the fifth one to be so much better that it could blow out any competitors it could possible have. \nBut why is this going on? iTech Post mentioned that there have been not just one. But numerous leaks regarding the tablet and all of them have been more than good. Everyone is saying that there are going to be new features that are going to create a new level of tablet integration. \nAccording to sources ,the tablet is supposed to come out somewhere around the middle of 2017. The previous one came out near the end of 2015 and so this is long overdue. The new tablet is going to come out with a new generation of processor called the Kaby Lake processor. Now this will be intel's 7th generation of tablet processor. \nAnother great feature will be the RAM. The RAM of this tablet is more than likely to follow the other Surface Pros model and it is going to top out at 16GB. Perhaps, even more. This tablet can literally be used to render high quality videos. It will be the most ideal and portable device for designer and producers. \nTech Times have also dubbed this tablet to be the best tablet of 2017 so far. They mentioned other storage features which topped out at around 256 GB of internal storage and an additional 512 of on board storage. They also mentioned how the Pro 4 had battery issues. \nHowever, it is said that Microsoft will solve that problem in the next one. So now, the tablet is powerful as well as highly durable. It will also run on Windows 10 and will support the Type C USb which is not seen in other tablets before. \nThese are but some of the leaked features of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2-in-1 tablet. Once the tablet actually comes out, it may have many new and unseen features. Since everyone is going towards virtual reality, maybe that will be present, too.  ",

      "title": "Using R to Gain Insights into the Emotional Journeys in War and Peace",
      "text": "by Wee Hyong Tok, Senior Data Scientist Manager at Microsoft \nHow do you read a novel in record time, and gain insights into the emotional journey of main characters, as they go through various trials and tribulations, as an exciting story unfolds from chapter to chapter?\nI remembered my experiences when I start reading a novel, and I get intrigued by the story, and simply cannot wait to get to the last chapter. I also recall many conversations with friends on some of the interesting novels that I have read awhile back, and somehow have only vague recollection of what happened in a specific chapter. In this post, I’ll work through how we can use R to analyze the English translation of War and Peace.\nWar and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, and captures the salient points about Russian history from the period 1805 to 1812. The novel consists of the stories of five families, and captures the trials and tribulations of various characters (e.g. Natasha and Andre). The novel consists of about 1400 pages, and is one of the longest novels that have been written.\nWe hypothesize that if we can build a dashboard (shown below), this will allow us to gain insights into the emotional journey undertaken by the characters in War and Peace.\n\nFor example, using the dashboard below, and correlating it with the War and Peace story, we can see how Andrey falling in love with Natsha in Book 6 have created a green (positive) highlight in his life. We can also see how Natsha’s family bankruptcy in Book 6 overshadows her budding romance with Andrey. In addition, we can also observe how Pierre emotional journey stays red (negative), especially in Book 11-14, as he almost killed himself, and finally ending up in prison.\nBuilding the War and Peace Visualization In this post, I’ll show you how we use the d3heatmap package to build the War and Peace visualization. Let’s start with a dataset, where we used Azure Data Lake Analytics, and U-SQL extensions to analyze the English translation of War and Peace.\nLet’s Get Started The dataset (23Mb CSV) consists of 6 columns. V1, V2, V3 captures the year, book, and chapter respectively. V4 is a line of text from the novel. V5 denotes the key phrase extracted from each sentence, and V6 denotes the sentiment associated with the key phrase.\nTo get started, we will first specify the R libraries that we will use to create the War and Peace heatmap visualization.\n# Load libs library (dplyr) library(d3heatmap) library(tidyr) library(stringr) library(reshape) \nNext, we load the data that is stored in Azure Blob storage.\n# Read the war and peace dataset, with key phrase and sentiment extracted warpeace <- read.csv(file = \"https://machinelearningdatasets.blob.core.windows.net/public/warandpeace/warandpeaceSentimentKeyPhrase.csv\" , header = FALSE , sep = \",\" ) \nWe focus on some of the main characters that we want to analyze by specifying them, as follows:\n# Specify the characters in War and Peace bookCharacters <- c( \"Cyril\" , \"Pierre\" , \"Nicholas\" , \"Rostóva\" , \"Natalie\" , \"Natasha\" , \"Catiche\" , \"Ilyá\" , \"Nikolenka\" , \"Pétya\" , \"Véra\" , \"Sónya\" , \"Nicholas\" , \"Alpatych\" , \"Vasíli\" , \"Anatole\" , \"Leyla\" , \"Borís\" , \"Mitenka\" , \"Berg\" , \"Bourienne\" , \"Lorrain\" , \"Michael Ivánovich\" , \"Timókhin\" , \"Kozlovski\" , \"Nesvítski\" , \"Kirsten\" , \"Bilibin\" , \"Bagration\" , \"Murat\" , \"Tushin\" , \"Alpatych\" ) \nNext, we find the rows in the dataset where each of the characters appeared.\n# Create an initial data frame wpBase <- warpeace[grep( \"Mack\" ,warpeace $ V5),] wpBase $ character <- \"Mack\" # For each character in the book, find the rows with the specific book character for (person in bookCharacters) { wpNew <- warpeace[grep(person,warpeace $ V5),] if ( nrow(wpNew) > 0 ) { wpNew $ character <- person wpBase <- rbind(wpBase,wpNew) } } \nIn the book, a character might appear with different names. For example, Natalie and Natsha refer to the same person (depending on whether it is referred to in Russian or French). We attempt to resolve these same-name character references as follows:\n# Resolve to same-name references wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"NatÃ¡sha\" ] <- \"Natasha\" wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"Natalie\" ] <- \"Natasha\" wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"Monsieur Pierre\" ] <- \"Pierre\" wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"Count BezÃºkhov\" ] <- \"Pierre\" wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"Prince Andrew\" ] <- \"Andrey\" wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"Andrew\" ] <- \"Andrey\" wpBase $ character[wpBase $ character == \"Andrey\" ] <- \"Andrey\" \nFinally, we aggregate the sentiments of the characters by the book they appeared in, and then format it so that it can be used as inputs to d3heatmap. We used various useful functions, including melt and cast from the reshape package .\n# Aggregate by character, and then order by book warpeaceG <- wpBase %>% group_by(V2,character) %>% summarize(sentimentOverall = sum(V6)) warpeaceOrderByBook <- warpeaceG[order(warpeaceG $ V2),] md <- melt(warpeaceOrderByBook, id = (c( \"V2\" , \"character\" ))) castd <- cast(md, character ~ V2) # Replace all NA with 0 castd[is.na(castd)] <- 0 \nThis reshapes the data from\n\nto produce the following:\n\nThis is then used as inputs to d3heatmap to produce the War and Peace character sentiment visualization.\nd3heatmap(castd,scale = \"column\" , colors = \"Spectral\" , dendrogram = \"none\" , Rowv = FALSE , Colv = FALSE ) \nThis produces the following heatmap.\n\nI can now use the same approach to gain insights into any book, and understand which chapters of a novel I want to read!\nResources\nFind out how to use U-SQL in Azure Data Lake Analytics to detect key phrases. Download the dataset here. You can see this in action in Joseph Sirosh's keynote presentation at the Data Science Summit , where Matt Winkler demonstrated using how you can use Azure Data Lake Analytics to perform key phrase extractions and sentiment analysis at scale, over the entire collection of War and Peace books.

      "text": "1 of 2 LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- The 3rd annual Game Awards descended upon the Microsoft theater in Los Angeles Thursday to pay homage to the greatest video games of 2017.\nHosted by the show's creator Geoff Keighley, the event was live streamed online across various channels including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook Live, Playstation Network, Xbox Live, Steam and Twitch just to name a few.\nThe awards show kicked off with celebrated game designer Hideo Kojima receiving the Industry Icon Award one year after he was unable to attend the Game Awards due to his unceremonious departure from publisher Konami following the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain .\n\"Last year I thought I lost everything, but I didn't lose anything thanks to all of you\" Kojima said onstage of his fans who have continued to support him.\nBlizzard Entertainment's online multiplayer shooter Overwatch took home the coveted Game of the Year award along with trophies for Best Game Direction, Best Multiplayer Game and Best eSports Game.\nThe title had faced stiff competition from the likes of Doom , Inside , Titanfall 2 , and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End which was the night's other big winner taking home awards for Best Narrative and Best Performance for Nolan North who portrays series main protagonist Nathan Drake.\nOther notable winners included That Dragon Cancer winning the award for Games for Impact, Pokemon Go earning Best Mobile/Handheld Game and Dishonored 2 being named Best Action/Adventure Game.\nThe night was also highlighted by two new trailers for Nintendo's highly-anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . The second clip which debuted later in the show, highlighted the title's new open-world setting that will give players freedom to tackle enemies and obstacles in unique ways.\nSurprise trailers came in the form of a teaser for a future Guardians of the Galaxy episodic game by developer Telltale Games and a cinematic teaser for Kojima's next project Death Stranding that featured film director Guillermo Del Toro keeping an infant safe while making his way across a dystopian city. Doctor Strange and Hannibal star Mads Mikkelsen also makes an appearance as a military leader in control of an army of skeleton soldiers.\nNotably, a new trailer for Telltale's Walking Dead Season 3 also debuted featuring new playable character Javier as he unsuccessfully attempts to save his family from a zombie outbreak from within his own home. The footage also featured an older and more battle-hardened version of series main protagonist Clementine as she joins up with Javier.\nLike Us on Facebook for more stories from UPI.com Related UPI Stories 'The Witcher 3' wins big, new titles revealed at The Game Awards 2015 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild': Link explores open-world Hyrule at E3 2016 Clementine returns in Telltale Games 'The Walking Dead Season 3' E3 2016 teaser",

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft Discounts’ Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft Discounts’ Jennifer Hong Dec 02, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft Discounts’ 2 \nShoppers are still finding deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, ‘Microsoft’ Display Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, ‘Microsoft’ Display 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "title": "Deploy Windows 10 Using MDT and WDS, Part 2: Install WDS and Boot a PXE Client",
      "text": "Tweet 0 Share \nIn the first part of this two-part series, I showed you how to deploy the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and import a Windows 10 image ready for distribution over the network using Windows Deployment Services (WDS). In the second part, you’ll create an MDT task sequence to manage the deployment of Windows 10, and configure WDS. \n\nCreate an MDT Task Sequence \nA task sequence specifies a list of jobs are required to install the OS after the PXE-enabled device boots. In this lab, we’ll use one of the standard task sequences supplied out-of-the-box in MDT. Open Deployment Workbench on the MDT server. In the left pane of Deployment Workbench, expand Deployment Share , your deployment share, right-click Task Sequences and select New Task Sequence from the menu. In the New Task Sequence Wizard , give the new sequence an ID and name, and then click Next . Create a new task sequence in MDT (Image Credit: Russell Smith) On the Select Template screen, select Standard Client Task Sequence from the menu to configure a complete client task sequence, and click Next . On the Select OS screen, select Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation in Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation x64 install.wim, or the OS of your choice, and click Next . On the Specify Product Key screen, select Do not specify a product key at this time . I’m using an evaluation version of Windows for this lab, so I don’t need a product key. You can choose a MAK key or retail product key if necessary. Click Next to continue. Type an organization name on the OS Settings screen, and click Next to continue. On the Admin Password screen, select Use the specified local Administrator password , type and confirm a password, and click Next . Click Next on the Summary screen. Click Finish on the Confirmation screen to complete the process. Right-click the new task sequence and select Properties from the menu. In the Properties dialog box on the General tab, make sure that This can run on any platform is selected. Switch to the Task Sequence tab. Here you can see each step of the task, and customize the options if you wish. For this lab, we’re going to use the default settings. Click OK . An MDT task sequence (Image Credit: Russell Smith) \nNow there’s a task sequence in place, we need to update the deployment share. Right-click the deployment share in the left pane of Deployment Workbench and select Update Deployment Share from the menu. In the Update Deployment Share Wizard , select Completely regenerate the boot images and click Next . On the Summary screen, click Next . Wait for the boot images to be regenerated, and click Finish on the Confirmation screen. Sponsored Configure WDS \nBefore completing the steps below, the WDS server must be configured with an NTFS partition that is separate from the OS system partition. I recommend at least 20GB or larger. Log in to the WDS server with an account that has access to the domain, and local administrator permissions. On the desktop taskbar, right-click the PowerShell icon and select Run as Administrator from the menu. In the PowerShell window, type Install-WindowsFeature -Name WDS -IncludeManagementTools and press ENTER . Wait for Windows Deployment Services to install, and reboot the server if prompted to do so. Click the Server Manager icon on the desktop taskbar. In Server Manager, select Windows Deployment Services from the Tools menu. In the left pane of the Windows Deployment Services MMC, expand Servers , right click your WDS server, and select Configure Server from the menu. Click Next on the Before you Begin screen in the Windows Deployment Services Configuration Wizard . On the Install Options screen, check Integrated with Active Directory and click Next . On the Remote Installation Folder Location screen, change the path. On my server, I have a 20GB NTFS partition (E:) configured for WDS. So, I changed the path to E:\\RemoteInstall and clicked Next . Alternatively, you can click Browse to find the location. On the PXE Server Initial Settings screen, check Respond to all client computers (known and unknown) , and click Next . For the purposes of this lab, we won’t test prestaged computers, so the PXE service point must respond to unknown computers. PXE boot options in WDS (Image Credit: Russell Smith) Uncheck Add images to the server now , and click Finish . Add a Boot Image \nThe next step is to add a boot image to the WDS server. Expand Servers in the left pane of the WDS management console, expand your WDS server, right click Boot Images and select Add Boot Image from the menu. In the Add Image Wizard , click Browse on the Image File screen. We need to locate the boot WIM images on the deployment share located on the MDT server. In my lab, the share URL is \\\\mdt\\deploymentshare$ , which I pasted into the address bar of the Select Windows Image File dialog box. Then double-click on the Boot folder, select LiteTouchPE_x86.wim and click Next . On the Image Metadata screen, click Next to accept the default image name and description. Click Next on the Summary screen. Click Finish on the Task Progress screen. Repeat these steps to add the LiteTouchPE_x64.wim boot image to WDS. Set WDS Server Options \nFinally, there are some options that we need to set for WDS. Right-click your WDS server in the left pane of the console and select Properties from the menu. Switch to the Boot tab. Make sure under Known clients and Unknown clients that Require the user to press the F12 key to continue the PXE boot is selected. In the Default boot image (optional) section, click Select to the right of x86 architecture , select Lite Touch Windows PE (x86) from the list of images in the Select Default Boot Image dialog box, and click OK . WDS server options (Image Credit: Russell Smith) Click Select to the right of x64 architecture , select Lite Touch Windows PE (x64) from the list of images in the Select Default Boot Image dialog, and click OK . Repeat this procedure respectively for the x86 (UEFI) architecture and x64 (UEFI) architecture images, then click OK . Finally, restart the WDS service by right-clicking your WDS in the left pane of the management console, and select All Tasks > Restart from the menu. Click OK in the Server dialog box. Sponsored \nIn this article, I showed you how to customize the Windows 10 deployment in MDT using a task sequence and configure WDS. In the final part of this series, I’ll show you step-by-step how to deploy Windows 10 over the network using the WDS server.",

      "title": "Blade Runner Gets Re-Created, Shot for Shot, Using Only Microsoft Paint",
      "text": "Subscribe Vk Print Xing Yummly Telegram Flipboard \nBlade Runner came out in June 1982. Microsoft’s Paint came out in November 1985. Little could the designers of that rebranded version of ZSoft’s PC Paintbrush packaged in with Windows 1.0 know that the paths of their humble graphics application and that elaborate sci-fi cinematic vision would cross just over 30 years later. Surely nobody involved in either project could have imagined the form the intersection would take: MSP Blade Runner , a fan’s shot-by-shot Tumblr “remake” (and gentle parody) of the film using only Microsoft Paint, starting with the Ladd Company tree logo . \nWhy make such a thing ? “I like the idea of having a blog but basically feel as if I have very little to say about things, at least things that are original or interesting,” creator David MacGowan told Motherboard’s Rachel Pick . “I gravitated to Tumblr with some idea of just posting pictures, but still felt I needed to be posting something I’d actually made myself… [Y]ears ago I used to draw really crappy basic MS Paint pics for a favourite pop group’s fan site, and they always seemed to raise a smile. The idea of doing something else with MS Paint, a kind of celebration of my not being deterred by lack of artistic talent, never really went away.” \nThe mixture of technological and aesthetic sensibilities inherent in using a severely outdated but ever-present digital tool to re-create the enduringly compelling analog visuals of a movie from that same era goes well with the original Blade Runner ‘s project of updating the conventions of film noir to depict a then-newly imagined future. Even more fittingly, a work like MSP Blade Runner could only make sense in the 2010s, the very decade the movie tried to envision. Will it go all the way to the shot of Deckard and Rachel’s final exit into the elevator? “I don’t really think about giving up,” McGowan told Pick. “The idea of actually completing something I start out to do (for once in my life) is very appealing.” Spoken like a 21st-century man indeed.",

      "title": "Office 365 Groups, SharePoint Sites, Microsoft Teams: Where Do I Collaborate?",
      "text": "Confusion reigns about which of the many collaboration tools Microsoft offers is right for the job PHOTO: Jens Lelie \nWhen Microsoft first launched Office 365 Groups, everyone could understand the concept. \nGroups provided a simple way to create a context for sharing information and documents with the people you work with — in many ways an improvement on what SharePoint had promised. \nBefore Groups entered the picture, team collaboration in Office 365 suffered from the Goldilocks effect: SharePoint sites were powerful and fairly customizable, but were complex for most end users to set up and use. OneDrive was often too simple of a repository for the kind of collaboration teams needed. \nGroups were “just right.” Cracks in Microsoft's Collaboration Story \nA simple file repository that was easy to use with no setup, an Exchange alias for the team that you could create a without petitioning IT, a shared calendar and the equivalent of a community via message board, all provisioned and linked together — this was the vision of team collaboration we had in mind all along. \nAnd it got even better once Microsoft Planner came into the picture. Planner brought with it a task management and tracking app that was simpler and more powerful than the traditional SharePoint or Exchange task lists. \nThese seemed like good times in the collaboration world. But not all was sugar and rose petals — some fractures in the strategy started materializing even as Microsoft’s vision of team collaboration's future came into view. \nIt started with these questions: “When should I use a Group and when should I use a SharePoint site?” “Should I use a SharePoint community or a Yammer group?” “What’s the difference between an Office 365 Group and a Yammer group?” “Is Yammer going away?” Adding to the Collaboration Confusion \nRecent developments have done nothing to ease this confusion. \nMicrosoft recently announced that all Groups would get a SharePoint site. Then we got the news that Yammer groups and Office Groups were merging , and every Yammer group would also be an Office 365 Group. \nThen Microsoft Teams showed up on the scene, and we had yet another way to have conversations with our team members. \nAll of this innovation is extremely impressive from Microsoft, especially given the short amount of time it’s taken to release all of it. But the confusion about how workers collaborate that already existed is now even more relevant. \nYammer is clearly different than Teams, and both are different than the original Groups conversation interface — but how do IT leaders translate what we know to the broad base of our employee populations? How do we give them the clarity that they so desperately need in order to collaborate effectively? Microsoft Gives Users Everything But the Kitchen Sink \nEarly on, I had my suspicions that Microsoft may allow us to choose the type of group we could create. For example, if my Group would largely be a social collaboration with the interchange of ideas, I might have opted for a group whose conversations were based in Yammer. If my group was largely going to engage in ongoing real-time conversations, I might have opted for a Microsoft Teams-enabled group. \nBut for now, the writing on the wall seems clear: Groups are the central gravitational force of all Office 365 collaboration. I don’t get a choice — I get everything. \nCreate a new task management board in Planner and you get a Group. When you get a Group, you get Yammer, a Team and a SharePoint site. \nTo confuse matters further, Microsoft recently announced that when you create a SharePoint site collection, it will now automatically provision a Group — whether you want it or not. A Viral Approach to Collaboration \nIn spite of my criticisms, I recognize that Microsoft is in a difficult position. \nAsking users to know beforehand how they will best collaborate leads to a whole new set of problems. Call it the “Yammer bug,” but it seems that the viral spread of collaboration across the organization, versus a more controlled approach, aligns more closely with how Microsoft wants to do productivity. \nHow will workers ever know Teams can be useful if they aren't put in front of them to experiment with? Microsoft is effectively giving workers the power to make the most appropriate and effective use of the tools in front of them. And this can actually work in some organizations. With a little guidance and some experimentation, users may find ways of working they could not have discovered a few short years ago. \nMicrosoft is working hard to try to get this kind of guidance out to the market , though some will still chafe that the world of Office and team collaboration has gotten infinitely more complex in the years since the Ribbon's addition to Excel froze information workers in their tracks. \nYou can’t put the genie back in the bottle. And Microsoft needs to keep innovating to stay competitive — the pace will only quicken. Keep a Light Hand with Governance \nSo what’s an organization to do? \nThe same as always: Understand that governance is not just about control. It’s about creating and communicating policy about how sharing and collaboration should be done, and then creating tools and processes that support users in leveraging the available tools and systems as intended. \nWhere controls are available, appropriate or required, they make sense — but do not look to unnecessarily stifle creativity or innovation in how your teams work. Those days are behind us, and history has told us that it won’t work.

      "text": "Microsoft has finally launched HoloLens in 7 new countries this week, allowing more developers access to the Windows Holographic platform. These new countries include Australia, Ireland, France, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. \n\nThese new countries join the United States and Canada, of whom have been able to buy HoloLens for sometime now. Japan will also be joining the fray in early 2017, with more locations expected to be announced throughout next year.\nHoloLens is available in two models, the Development Edition for developers, or the Commercial Suite for businesses. Depending on your wants and needs, you'll want to choose between either options. You can buy now directly from the Microsoft Store.\nBuy Microsoft HoloLens \n",

In October, Microsoft created a new site for its Ventures arm that listed 10 concerns in which it had invested to date. (At that time, Microsoft execs said Microsoft Ventures had invested in 13 companies, but three had not been publicly named.) \nAs of this week, the Microsoft Ventures site now lists 14 entities in which Microsoft has made investments of undisclosed amounts. The newest additions: \nCloudSimple (May 2016): Next-generation private cloud as a service \nPaxata (October 2016): Platform for business analytics \nZipwhip (October 2016): Business texting software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider for existing landlines, VOIP and toll free numbers \ni3 (Israel IoT Innovation) Equity Partners (November 2016): Investor for early-stage investments in Israeli IoT startups \nYesterday, Israel Internet of Things Innovations and i3 Equity Partners consortium announced they'd established a new investment consortium in conjunction with Tel Aviv University to develop IoT technologies . In addition to Microsoft Ventures, consortium members include GE Ventures, HNA EcoTech, Qualcomm Ventures, and Tata.",

      "text": "\nVirtual Reality is quickly becoming a mainstay feature in the industry, and with Sony recently staking their own claim with PlayStation VR , Microsoft has decided to step in the ring with an offering aimed at Windows 10 users.\nWhile Microsoft’s entry into the market was an expected move, the starting price of $299 is undoubtedly going to surprise many. With the market currently dominated by the likes of the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and the aforementioned PlayStation VR, the software giant’s own offerings will undercut the competition, becoming the most affordable entry point when released.\nInsiders may have taken notice of the “Windows Holographic First Run” application that tests their machine to ensure compatibility with the platform, similar to the SteamVR Performance Test for the Vive. Perhaps just as surprising as the starting price are the minimum hardware requirements which are, in a word, basic:\n4GB of RAM USB 3.0 Port Graphics card supporting DirectX 12 4 CPU cores, including dual-core processors with hyper-threading While Redmond’s VR efforts won’t carry the premium price tag or superior tech in HoloLens, Windows Holographic will be a key element of both.\nThese requirements will make Windows 10 VR accessible to most modern machines, with the biggest obstacle being DirectX 12 support. While most laptops and desktops using a discrete GPU aren’t going to be a concern, integrated graphics on CPU’s are a different matter. Those still using a Sandy Bridge processor (Core-i5 2500k for example) will be required to upgrade to Intel Haswell (or newer) processors, whereas the AMD side will prove to be a little more flexible, requiring a 6000-series APU at the very least.\nWith the minimum hardware requirements being what they are, it will be interesting to see what kind of software the headsets will be able to run. While serious VR gaming is likely out of the equation with the entry-level models, Windows 10 VR is a step in the right direction and is likely to penetrate the market in ways the Vive and Rift are unable to.\nWith the uber-spec Xbox One already confirmed to support VR when it releases in late 2017, the question now becomes this: will Project Scorpio have its own dedicated device, or have the headsets been developed with the company’s gaming division accounted for?\nMore details on the VR headsets are expected to be shared at the WinHEC (Windows Hardware Engineering Community) events on December 4–5 in Shenzhen, China, and December 14–15 in Taipei City, Taiwan.\nThe first devices will release through several partners some time after the Creators Update . The update will introduce new creativity and gaming experiences when it arrives Spring 2017, and will be available for free to all Windows 10 users.\n",

All albums are available free of charge today only, so you need to hurry up if you want to get them.

In case you’re wondering, the albums include Justin Bieber’s “Under the Mistletoe, Deluxe Edition,” and Rod Steward’s “Merry Christmas.” The full list of albums is available below and for the download links, fire up the store and you’re done. This offer in only available in the United States, but just like it’s the case with the Groove Music pass thing, this is not at all a restriction because there are ways to deal with this as well.

Blige – A Mary Christmas The Jackson 5 – Ultimate Christmas Collection Rod Stewart – Merry Christmas, Baby (Deluxe) Vince Guaraldi – A Charlie Brown Christmas, Remastered & Expanded Edition Boris Karloff – How The Grinch Stole Christmas: Original Soundtrack Various Artists – A Motown Christmas Trans-Siberian Orchestra – Dreams Of Fireflies (On A Christmas Night)",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Windows 10 Browser Actually Lost Market Share Last Month GO Edge is being used by 5.21 percent of desktop consumers Dec 2, 2016 10:58 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft is pushing hard for everyone on Windows 10 to stick with Edge, and the company has even turned to what it calls “tips notifications” (or as others describe them, ads) to convince users to give it a try, but all these efforts don’t seem to pay off just yet. Statistics provided by NetMarketShare for the month of November show that Microsoft Edge is very far behind all its rivals, and what’s worse, is even going in reverse when it comes to market share evolution. At this point, Microsoft Edge has a market share of 5.21 percent, which makes it the fourth most-used browser across the world, but all its rivals are ahead, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. For what it’s worth, Internet Explorer is doing a lot better, even though Microsoft no longer releases new features and improvements to the app. Windows 10 availability One of the reasons Edge is suffering from limited adoption is that it’s exclusively available in Windows 10, and Microsoft has no plans to release it on other platforms. At the same time, all its rivals, and including Internet Explorer, can be used on all Windows versions, including Windows 7, which is currently the top choice for desktop users across the world. But seeing Microsoft Edge dropping from 5.26 percent in October to 5.21 percent in November is certainly unexpected, especially because of the hard push we told you about above. In the meantime, however, Google Chrome is doing a lot better and is now running on no less than 55.83 percent of the PCs across the world, and this means that more than 1 in 2 computers actually have Google Chrome up and running. Internet Explorer is now at 21.66 percent, followed by Mozilla Firefox with 11.91 percent. The only browsers that are behind Microsoft Edge are Safari with 3.61 percent and Opera with 1.36 percent. All the others fall in the “Others” category that Microsoft is not interested in competing against.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s iOS Camera App Updated with iPhone 7 Plus Dual Camera Support GO Microsoft Pix receives a new update in Apple’s App Store Dec 2, 2016 09:16 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has recently released a new update for its Pix iOS camera app, adding support for what’s pretty much the most advanced feature in terms of iPhone cameras: the dual-lens system that the iPhone 7 Plus exclusively has at the moment. Microsoft Pix 1.0.22 comes with some other improvements as well, including tweaks for the default levels of white balance to be slightly warmer in order to enhance the healthy glow of skin tones. In other words, photos should now look a little bit more natural, but Microsoft should do is offer more manual controls in order to give users the option to manually adjust white balance. But the biggest change in this version is the addition of support for the dual-camera configuration available on the iPhone 7 Plus, with Microsoft explaining that the app can now “preserve the full detail captured by the telephoto lens.” If you want to read more about the performance of the dual-camera system launched by Apple, you can read our iPhone 7 Plus review here. And there’s also a third improvement in this version that makes it possible to add decorative frames to any image. Microsoft says that both still and live images are supported. What Pix can do for you For those unfamiliar with Microsoft Pix, this is a camera app launched by Microsoft for iOS users and which is supposed to help take better pictures, as it automatically adjusts key settings for increased quality. “Microsoft Pix has serious intelligence behind the lens, so it is a bit like having a pro photographer inside your camera – tweaking settings, selecting the best shots, and enhancing them on the fly – to help people and scenes look their best. It’s designed to help take the guesswork out of getting great photos, so now you can just enjoy the moment, instead of struggling to capture it! Microsoft Pix,” Microsoft explains. The app works on any iPhone running iOS 9.0 or later and is obviously available with a free license from Apple’s App Store.",

To welcome him back and celebrate his return, Microsoft's Major Nelson is giving away some goodies to randomly selected winners who answer a simple question—what is your favorite Dead Rising combo weapon (or weapon of choice during the zombie apocalypse)? There's an official form to submit your answer and those are the only ones that will be eligible for the contest. Major Nelson says he's trying out a new method for contest entry, and specifically says do not leave an entry in the blog post's comments section or on Twitter. Easy enough, but what do you stand to win? Some really sweet swag. The best loot goes to the grand prize winner who will receive the following: Xbox One S Console w/ 2TB Console Stand Xbox Design Lab Code to design your own Xbox Wireless Controller Astro A50 Wireless Headset for Xbox One Seagate Game Drive for Xbox SSD (512GB) Digital Xbox One code for Dead Rising 4 (standard edition) That's not a bad score, and neither is the second place package—it includes all the same items, minus the console and stand. Major Nelson will select an additional five runner up winners, each of which will receive a digital code for Dead Rising 4. The deadline to enter is 7:00 pm ET / 4:00 pm PT on Tuesday, December 6. Winners will have 72 hours to respond to the email notification. As for Dead Rising 4, it's an open world survival horror game that will play a little different from past Dead Rising titles. Unlike before, there will not be a timer system or a co-op story option. However, it will still feature an open world setting like its predecessors.",
