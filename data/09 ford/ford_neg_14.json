      "title": "PSA execs say net pricing gaps with VW, Ford, others closing faster than expected",
      "text": "PSA Group executives say that the net pricing gaps between Peugeot, Citroen and DS Automobiles and their benchmarked rivals are closing faster than planned. Peugeot was almost on par with the Volkswagen brand in terms of net pricing in Europe in the first half, company figures show. By the end of June, Citroen brand had already reached its full-year net pricing target on its new benchmark: Ford. Even the slow-selling DS near-premium brand is narrowing its gap on Audi faster than planned.\nPSA's new Europe boss, Maxime Picat, who led the Peugeot brand until his recent promotion, said that numerous internal comparison tests have shown that Peugeot is already beating VW in the key compact SUV segment. \"Our new 3008 is better [in net pricing] than the new Tiguan and better than the BMW X1 as well,\" he told Automotive News Europe sister publication Automobilwoche .\nPSA is also showing more confidence in its price setting. The most expensive variant of the 3008, the GT diesel, starts at 39,700 euros in Germany. The price range for VW's top trim level for the Tiguan is 33,975 to 42,700 euros in Germany.\nPicat said one key reason the gap narrowed is because the brands Peugeot and DS benchmark for pricing, VW and Audi, had been using incentives to maintain volumes at the height of VW Group’s emissions-cheating scandal. In spring, however, the brands stabilized their incentive spending, Picat said.\nWhile PSA does not officially confirm the benchmarks for each of its brands, it also doesn't deny the names of the brands previously mentioned in this story. Automotive News Europe has also learned that PSA changed its benchmark for Citroen to Ford from Renault. The reason for the change was high volatility in Renault's net pricing in Europe, sources told ANE .\n\nPricing discipline in Europe has helped to make PSA one of the best-performing automakers in world. PSA CEO Carlos Tavares told Automotive News Europe that the automaker ranked fourth globally in terms of operating margin in the first half. PSA reported a 6.8 percent margin for its automotive operations in the January-June period, compared with a 4 percent target set for the full year and 5 percent achieved in 2015. \"We continue to be disciplined in pricing, because performance matters more than size,\" Tavares said on the sidelines of the Paris auto show in September.\nPSA's European sales grew by 7.4 percent to 1,056,000 units in the first half. Overall, PSA's first-half sales were flat at 1.54 million units largely because of a near 20 percent decline in its volume in China and Southeast Asia.",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 — American / British / Project | 23 Comments Bargain Series I XKE: 1967 Jaguar E-Type w/ Ford V8 Swap \nThis 1967 Jaguar E-type FHC runs a Ford 302 and automatic in place of its original 4.2 liter six and 4-speed manual. Though said to be a running, driving car, it’s also described as a project that’s been partially de-trimmed in preparation for new paint. As shown, the car remains mostly together with somewhat scruffy cosmetics, but mechanically it sounds quite healthy with many new parts listed. The swap itself was reportedly a professional job, but we wish the car still had three pedals. Find it here on eBay in Salem, Oregon with a $27,201 BIN. \nSaid to be a rust-free California car, it photographs well despite older, roughed-up paintwork and tight shots taken in a crowded garage. Brightwork could stand buffing or re-plating, and save for the grille and headlights, removed trim pieces are shown separately, some of which are organized. Sheet metal looks to be in good shape with few apparent dents or dings, and the car wears wire wheels at all four corners with a spare included. \nRear hatch glass appears to be absent, and most trim panels and some carpet have been pulled from the interior as well. Aside from the wheel, seats, and center armrest, condition of remaining items is quite rough, notably the tattered dash pad and kick panels, although the passenger’s seat does wear some odd blemishes too. While we’d rather see the car paired with a manual gearbox, it’s cool that an E-type automatic shifter was used to control the Ford C6 fitted nearby. \nUnderneath the front clamshell, the Ford 302ci V8 is said to have been rebuilt, balanced, and blueprinted before its professional, “sanitary” installation. Said to run and drive well with functional, factory gauges, the car also features new headers and exhaust, a remote oil filter, radiator and electric fan, brakes including booster and master cylinder, ball joints and stub axles. \nEven considering the work and time that will be required to get the car right, it looks like it could be worth it provided the chassis isn’t heavily rotted or tweaked. We even dig the 302 swap, and with a T-5 5-speed in place of the automatic, it could be really fun to drive in addition to providing great looks with a nice soundtrack. Related Stories",

      "text": "Report: Ford F-150 Getting Next-Gen 4.8L V-8 Truck Trend 13 hrs ago Edward A. Sanchez Report: Ford F-150 Getting Next-Gen 4.8L V-8\nFor the last five years, Ford has been aggressively pursuing downsized, turbocharged engines across its vehicle lineup. However, a significant percentage of F-150 buyers still prefer the naturally aspirated 5.0L Coyote V-8 over the 3.5L or 2.7L EcoBoost V-6 engines. Although the Coyote is still fairly fresh, dating from just 2011 and producing a competitive 385 hp and 387 hp from its 302 cubic inches, Ford is not letting up on the innovation and development. In a Reuters report about Ford’s $447 million investment in its Windsor, Ontario, Canada, engine plants, a report about a next-generation 4.8L V-8 engine leaked out.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Little is known about the engine other than the fact it will replace the 5.0L at the Essex engine plant and is expected to be a “high volume” engine. An engine specifically made for the Super Duty is also planned, presumably replacing the current 6.2L gas engine. The 6.8L V-10 will also reportedly continue to be produced for applications such as the F-650 and the E-Series cutaway vans.\n© Truck Trend Network Staff 2015 Ford F 150 The 4.8L will likely top the current 5.0L in power and fuel economy and will almost certainly be paired to the new 10-speed automatic that debuted on the 2017 F-150 with the 3.5L EcoBoost V-6 . Direct or dual (direct and port) fuel injection will likely be part of the plan, as well as auto stop-start. Some sort of cylinder deactivation system could also appear to optimize economy at light loads. Taking the speculation a step further, it’s likely the 4.8L could be the basis for a future Mustang engine, either with or without forced induction. Interestingly, the 4.8L displacement translates to approximately 292 cubic inches, a displacement most commonly associated with the Ford Y-block V-8 from the ’50s.\nSource: Reuters\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "2012 Ford F-250 Grand Slam Truck Trend 13 hrs ago Monica Gonderman 2012 Ford F-250 Grand Slam Some guys build trucks for a living, pumping out more project vehicles than even they can keep track of. Knowing the right people and having the right hookups, they are the guys the newbies look up to. They are the industry leaders, the trendsetters who get business done—fast. They won't be caught driving the same truck for more than a year. They hit the show circuit hard, with eyes on the Best Of trophies—and for good reason. Their builds kick ass. Buy, build, sell. Buy, build, sell. Being the \"big fish\" in the pond is impressive and exhausting. For every one of these guys, there are thousands of others who work their tails off to build one truck, piece by piece, over the course of many years and who have no intention of selling or building another.\nOut of enthusiasm, passion, and hard work, these \"small fish\" build killer rides. They dream big, set goals, and plan accordingly to humbly and graciously make their mark on the truck hobby they love. One of these guys is Casey King of Odessa, Texas, who has transformed his ’12 Ford F-250 Super Duty into something we all wouldn't mind cruising around in for a few days, years, or, let's be honest—indefinitely.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Lead The enviable F-250 on these pages was a high school graduation gift to King from his parents. (Note that he has since taken over payments of the beast.) He had been looking for something in the ½-ton category, like a new F-150 to replace the one he had been driving. But, like we all know too well, once you glance at an HD truck like a Super Duty, there's no going back. Perceptive to their son's growing infatuation with the ¾-ton beauty, King’s parents insisted on the big boy, with the understanding that any mods would be out of King’s pocket. By working for a lawn mowing company while he was in high school—before he even had a driver’s license—King had some money saved up. He also had a growing wish list for the would-be truck. Eventually, King jumped at the opportunity to buy the lawn mowing service, while he was still in high school!\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo The purchase was made, and King found himself cruising in a brand-new Tuxedo Black Super Duty, using it to tow his trailer full of lawn mowers, as well as a water trailer. One of his first mods was a set of Ranch Hand bumpers. He started attending Texas Tech University. He sold the lawn business and switched to the oil field industry while he completed his college education. It was during this time that the truck transformation took place.\n© Brad Stillwell casey-king-f250-007.jpg Having his plate full with school and work, King enlisted the guys at Complete Customs to customize the F-250 to his standards. Several visits were necessary, as the build escalated from a leveling kit to an all-out show truck. After three sets of wheels and several years, King finally felt he had hit the jackpot with the current version of his Blue Oval.\nA walk around the truck leaves an eyebrow-raising impression thanks to the bumpers, grille, headlights, lightbars, badges, hooks, wheels, and tires. The in-your-face Road Armor Titan II front bumper houses 20- and 30-inch Trux Tech lightbars and protects an RBP RX-3 grille and Gold Standard Lighting custom headlights. Red F-250 badges add some accent color to the vast black canvas, as do an array of front and rear Monster Hooks products. Wrapped in massive 37-inch Interco tires, the 22-inch American Force Blade SS 8 wheels were painted by TC Customz; the black and red add tasteful style points.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Front End The exterior mods would look amiss were it not for the sleek-looking 6-inch Icon Vehicle Dynamics lift, complete with shiny remote-reservoir piggback shocks and complemented by PMF traction bars and an Icon steering stabilizer to keep the heavy truck road-worthy and controllable. Amp Research retractable steps makes entry and egress a breeze, and really, every lifted truck on 37s needs steps. As the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel puts plenty of power and torque to the ground, engine mods were kept modest with an S&B cold-air intake, H&S MiniMaxx tuner, and Flo-Pro exhaust. Likewise, interior mods were kept clean and classy, with a hydro-dipped carbon-fiber dash, Pioneer screen, a pair of 10-inch Memphis Car Audio subs, and WeatherTech floormats.\nKing graduated from Texas Tech University and now has a Bachelor of Arts degree to go along with a fine looking ride. Having left behind his lawn mowing company and oil field job, he's settled into a rewarding career and still has his whole life ahead of him. Some kids squander the gifts they've been given—both the material gifts like the truck and the immaterial gifts like perseverance, dedication, and support. Others, like King, make the best of them and reap the rewards.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Engine The front end get its menacing look from a trio of 50-, 30-, and 20-inch Trux Tech LED Lighting lightbars, an RBP RX-3 grille, and four Trux Tech LED pods and two Monster Hooks swivel hooks in the Road Armor Titan II bumper. There’s one more piece that makes the front end “pop,” so seamlessly integrated that it may go unnoticed: the Gold Standard Lighting custom headlights.\nKing never expected to be the proud owner of a 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, but he sure wasn’t going to turn down the opportunity. The dirt- and dust-free engine compartment sports an S&B cold-air intake and the trademark blue of Sinister Diesel products.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Wheel Tire The Super Duty’s rear wheelwells swallow the massive 22x14 American Force Blade SS 8 wheels wrapped in 37X13.5R22 Interco SS-M16 tires. The wheels, custom-painted by TC Customz, tie together the black from the truck’s body with the red accent color seen elsewhere on the truck—including the Complete Customs brake caliper covers sneaking out from behind the wheel.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Suspension Up, up, and away! Like so many other builds, King’s Super Duty went from stock to leveled before settling into its current height. Complete Customs installed the red powdercoated Icon Vehicle Dynamics 6-inch lift with those oh-so-pretty shocks stuffed under the wheelwells.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Rear I spy a bunch of aftermarket details on the tail of King’s Super Duty: a custom Ford logo, Recon taillights and a third brake light, a Road Armor bumper with Rigid Industries reverse lights, Monster Hooks hook and two swivel hooks, Mag-Hytec differential cover, and an RBP exhaust tip.\n© Brad Stillwell Casey King F250 Headlight There’s a big difference between the Super Duty’s factory headlights and the final version from Gold Standard Lighting. First, they’re color-matched red and black to the rest of the truck. Next, the projectors have custom-etched “KC” and “Ford” logos. Lastly, the projectors are surrounded by color-changing ORACLE Lighting LEDs with an endless selection of color options, all managed via a controller inside the cab.

      "text": "by Sean Adl-Tabatabai \nJust days after Trump’s election victory, Ford have moved their truck production assembly line from Mexico to Ohio. \nTwo months ahead of Trump being sworn in, the all-American car manufacturer announced the move which will no doubt lead to the creation of thousands of jobs in the area. \nCNN Money reports: \nThat’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \nIs this a positive sign of things to come? \nIs Trump really about to make America great again? 2 views",

      "text": "American automaker Ford recently unveiled the EcoSport facelift at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. A vital product for the company, the American market will get the new model sometime by early 2018, while here in India we might see it in 2017. Fresh reports have emerged which indicate that the new model will be exported to the US market from its production facility in India in 2018.\nThe design element of the new EcoSport does not take potential Indian buyers by surprise due to its familiarity and popularity in the market. The new EcoSport gets fresh cosmetic upgrades in form of a new grille, redesigned headlamps and a sportier bumper with faux skid plate and larger fog lamps. The rear also comes with a contrasting bash plate element which has been integrated into the bumper.\nFor the American automaker, the new Ford EcoSport will be the automaker’s smallest SUV to be introduced in its local market. The America-bound model will be powered by a 1.0-litre EcoBoost motor as well as a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine. Both the engines will come in six-speed AT and AWD options. As for the Indian market, we will get the 1.5-litre engine in petrol and diesel guise.\nThe interior offers refreshing changes in terms of features as well as design. The seats get offset body coloured stripes, while the door/dashboard get exterior colour coordinated inserts. The automaker has also revised the instrument cluster and introduced a new colour digital display. Moreover, it also features an eight-inch touchscreen with SYNC 3 system. In India, the new facelift version will help it strengthen its position in the compact SUV space, while in the US, customers might see it as an upgrade to a feature loaded crossover.",

      "text": "\"One thing I've learned spending a lot of time in Silicon Valley is the term vaporware,,\" Fields told Fortune at the LA Auto Show.\nAdvertisement Ford, like any other major company, does its own internal vetting of potential acquisitions. Fields told Fortune that the company is also investing in two venture capital firms that focus on mobility, autonomous technology, cloud computing, and automotive IT.\nFord doesn't have its own venture capital arm. Instead the automaker is investing in RPM Ventures, an early stage venture capital firm based in Ann Arbor, and Fontinalis Partners , the Detroit-based VC co-founded by Ford executive chairman Bill Ford.\nA look at what startups RPM Ventures and Fontinalis Partners are backing as well as Ford's more recent investments and partnership provides insight into what the automaker might target next.\nIn recent months, Ford has invested $75 million in Velodyne LiDAR, the leading supplier of technology that lets self-driving cars see and avoid what's around them and 3D mapping startup Civil Maps . The automaker also acquired Israel-based computer vision and artificial intelligence company SAIPS for an undisclosed sum, and signed an exclusive licensing agreement with machine vision company Nirenberg Neuroscience.\nFields says their approach to acquisitions and strategic investments focus on three questions: Where do we want to play? How do we want to win? And what are the capabilities that we need?\n\"And we have to be brutally honest about that,\" Fields said in reference to the last question.\nIt's difficult to determine precisely where Ford might be lacking since the automaker doesn't share every detail of its autonomous vehicle development program. But a startup that specializes in developing the artificial intelligence algorithms that become the brains of driverless cars is one hotly pursued area in automotive right now.\nFontinalis is backing more than 20 startups, including the real-time traffic information and driver services company Inrix and NuTonomy, the autonomous vehicle software startup and MIT spinoff. Inrix is the same company that earlier this year acquired OpenCar, a software startup that built an in-car app platform that could challenge Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.\nNuTonomy launched a self-driving taxi service in Singapore earlier this year that the public-not just test engineers-can use. The company says it's the first-ever public trial of a self-driving taxi service.\nOther Fontinalis-backed startups include Lyft, peer-to-peer car-sharing service Turo, Karamba Security, a company focused on protecting connected cars from cyber attacks, and Zendrive, which uses smartphone sensors to measure driver behavior.\nMeanwhile, RPM is backing about 16 companies including Automatic, which has created an app and plug-in adapter to turn vehicles into connected cars, as well as Portland-based PolySync, which has developed a middleware platform that lets automakers and other autonomous vehicle startups test, gather data, and eventually deploy driverless vehicle applications without spending an inordinate amount of time and resources. The system is designed to turn software algorithms and sensors into plug-and-play applications.\n ",

      "text": "Email Almost 40 years later the actress says she and Ford had an affair on the set of the now iconic 1977 film. \"It was so intense,\" Fisher told People magazine. \"It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.\" × Carrie Fisher writes of Harrison Ford affair Almost 40 years later the actress says she and Ford had an affair on the set of the now iconic 1977 film. \"It was so intense,\" Fisher told People magazine. \"It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.\" \nAccording to Carrie Fisher there was a reason she and Harrison Ford had such chemistry in “Star Wars.” \nAlmost 40 years later the actress says she and Ford had an affair on the set of the now iconic 1977 film. \n“It was so intense,” Fisher told People magazine. “It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.” \nFisher, 60, has a new book coming out based on her diaries from that time. \n“The Princess Diarist” is billed as “Carrie Fisher’s intimate, hilarious and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time, the first ‘Star Wars’ movie.” \nFisher was 19 when she landed the breakthrough role of Princess Leia for the 1976 filming. Ford, then 33, was married to Mary Marquardt, with whom he had two children. \nThe couple divorced in 1979. Harrison later married “E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial” screenwriter Melissa Mathison in 1983, and they divorced in 2004. \nHe’s been married to actress Calista Flockhart since 2010. \nFisher writes that she and Ford spent their first night together after a birthday party for director George Lucas. \n“I looked over at Harrison. A hero’s face — a few strands of hair fell over his noble, slightly furrowed brow,” she wrote. “How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me?” \n“I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him,” she added. “He was kind.” \nNaturally Fisher’s revelations have provided lots of fodder for social media. \nIn March, Fisher appeared on the British talk series “The Jonathan Ross Show” and denied she and Ford had been romantic. \nShe said she thought he looked like a movie star. “It wasn’t like you get a crush on that person.” \nHowever, Fisher said at the time that her recently found journals had more details. \n“I haven’t looked all the way through it, but I must say it seemed to be trending in that direction,” she said. “But it didn’t happen.” \nPressed by Ross, she said she was still poring through the diaries for details. \n“It might happen, it might now happen,” Fisher said. \nFord and Fisher reprised their roles last year in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” \nCNN has reached out to Ford for comment.

      "text": "CEOs usually avoid picking fights with incoming presidents, but Mark Fields is fired up. Eight days after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential race, the Ford Motor Co. ( F ) CEO told reporters at a trade show that Trump’s trade plans, if enacted, “would have a huge impact on the economy.” And he didn’t mean a positive impact.\nFields is feisty because Trump, while campaigning, singled out Ford for criticism over its plans to open a new factory in Mexico. Remaking the North American Free Trade Agreement is one of Trump’s top priorities during his first 100 days in office, and that could directly upend billions of dollars in investments Ford, GM and other automakers have made in Mexico during the last decade. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which could spur a damaging trade war just as China has become an important source of profits for Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler.\nRecent analysis of Trump’s economic plan by S&P Global Market Intelligence highlighted the American auto sector as the one industry most threatened under the new president. “We see autos as the only industry facing a high and negative impact from policies the new administration may adopt,” S&P said. That’s a bit ironic, since the auto industry still employs about 925,000 Americans in the kinds of decent-paying blue-collar jobs Trump wants more of. That number is lower than during the peak years of the early 2000s, but it has nonetheless recovered nicely since the last recession ended in 2009. Millions of additional Americans work in car dealerships, tire retailers and auto-repair shops that will all suffer if the broader auto industry does.\nTrump has no beef with automakers, per se, but his trade ideas happen to involve heavy manufacturers with a global footprint—which is exactly what carmakers have become. Ford has 3 production facilities in Mexico and another one planned, while GM ( GM ) has 4 and Chrysler ( FCAU ) has 2. Volkswagen and most Japanese automakers have plants in Mexico as well.\nMexico imports about 2 million vehicles to the United States per year, accounting for roughly 11% of the 17.5 million vehicles sold in the US in 2015. The Center for Automotive Research forecasts that Mexican auto production will increase by about 60% by 2022, with several automakers planning to expand there. Production in the United States and Canada should decline slightly during the same timeframe.\nMost automakers assemble smaller vehicles in Mexico, because such vehicles have smaller profit margins than pickup trucks or SUVs and labor is a larger portion of the total cost. Cheap labor, not surprisingly, is the biggest advantage of manufacturing in Mexico, where total hourly compensation including benefits averages just $8.24 per hour, according to CAR. That’s 82% lower than the US average of $46.35 per hour.\nLimiting Mexican imports \nTrump hasn’t spelled out how he wants to rearrange NAFTA, but the basic idea is to encourage or compel more production in the United States, which would mean less production in places like Mexico. But that would be highly disruptive and would penalize American automakers more than their foreign rivals. Trump could probably rewrite the rules in a way that limits Mexican imports to the United States, for instance. But that doesn’t mean automakers would simply move Mexican factories north of the border. They might look for other low-cost countries instead, such as South Korea, India or China. The Trump administration could pursue trade restrictions on those countries as well, but that becomes a game of free-trade whack-a-mole in which the government is trying to tell multinational companies where to invest their money—hardly the lightly regulated pro-growth environment Trump says he wants to create.\nIf Trump tries to stop US automakers from producing in Mexico, that doesn’t mean he can stop foreign automakers from operating there. So the government would essentially be raising costs for American firms by forcing them out of Mexico, but not for their global competitors. Trade protections can equalize the cost of selling foreign-made cars in the United States—but not in other markets. And Mexico actually has better trade deals in place with Europe and Latin American countries than the US does, which means it’s cheaper to export the same car to Italy or Spain from Mexico than from the United States. That’s one reason Mexico has wooed so many automakers. Moving production meant for export from Mexico to the United States wouldn’t make any sense.\nThreat to profits in China \nAutomakers also worry about Trump’s threat to remake the nation’s trade relationships with China, and impose tariffs on Chinese imports to the US if necessary. Only two automakers import vehicles from China to the United States—Volvo and General Motors—and volumes are tiny. But GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler earn significant profits in China, and those would be directly threatened if China retaliated against US companies by imposing tariffs of their own. Hard-fought market-share gains by US automakers in China would crumble as vehicles sold by Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan and China’s own automakers were suddenly much cheaper.\nTrump may bring better news for carmakers, in the shorter term. If Trump slashes taxes as promised and stokes the economy with big new infrastructure programs, that could boost growth and incomes for a while. Flush consumers could spend even more on cars than they are now, during a near-record year for sales. That’s the most likely reason GM and Ford shares have risen modestly since Trump’s election.\nBut new restrictions on trade could more than offset that short-term sales bump. All of the global automakers have spent decades refining their supply lines and seeking the slightest cost advantage over competitors. GM and Chrysler declared bankruptcy in 2009, and Ford nearly did, because they fell too far behind Toyota and other foreign rivals and couldn’t withstand a sharp downturn. The same automakers are now comfortably profitable and hoping to stay healthy. The question is whether President Trump will let them.\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success .

(Photo: David Paul Morris / Getty Images) \nFord Motor Co. on Thursday lowered its 2017 pre-tax profit estimate, citing an expected $300 million reduction to its Ford Credit business over previous guidance. \nFord, in a regulatory filing, said it expected Ford Credit pre-tax profits would total about $1.5 billion in 2017 due to lower auction values. That’s about a $300 million drop from prior guidance of “about equal to 2016.” \nThe automaker reaffirmed it expects the company’s adjusted pre-tax profit will fall in 2017 from the expected $10.2 billion it expects to earn this year as it invests in emerging opportunities. It expects profits to improve in 2018. \nFord stock was trading down more than 1 percent in early trading Thursday. \nFord Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks is scheduled to hold a “Let’s Chat” forum Thursday. \nmburden@detroitnews.com Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2fzPQWl TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Ford cuts 2017 profit forecast for credit arm 11/17/2016 9:47 \n(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co <F.N> on Thursday lowered the 2017 pretax profit forecast for its financial services arm by $300 million to about $1.5 billion, citing 27 risk factors in a securities filing. \nIn 27 bullet points outlined in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford said its products are receiving \"lower-than-anticipated market acceptance,\" adding there has been a decline of its sales as well as those of the entire industry in its major markets of the United States, China and Europe. \nFord affirmed that it expects full company pretax profit in 2017 to be down from 2016, and sees its core business to improve in 2018. In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by $600 million to $10.2 billion. (http://bit.ly/2fYYv2x) \nThe company expects Ford Credit to record a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion in 2017, down about $300 million from its prior estimate. \nFord expects its core automotive business to improve in 2017 and 2018. \nFord shares fell 1.1 percent to $11.86 in early trading. \n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru and Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Ted Kerr and Jeffrey Benkoe) 11/17/2016 9:47 © Copyright Reuters Ltd.

      "text": "Post by danthecapriman on Oct 16, 2016 12:06:13 GMT Having a clear out and could do with some extra £'s towards my Capri resto.Complete set of 5 mk3 Capri 13'' Laser four spoke alloys, with good tyres.All are in good original condition, no curb marks etc. they come with the 'Ford' branded centre caps. All wheels have good tyres with loads of tread left and no damage. The spare wheel has had the inner bits of the spokes painted grey for some reason but the wheel is still in good shape, it's tyre is brand new!The tyres are a matching set of 185/70/13T.These have come straight off my mk2 Capri so have been in use until recently. I was going to get them refurb'd and re use them but I've now got a brand new unused set of the deep dish dartboard steels for it instead!And also,A set of four 'dartboard' 5.5x13 Ford steel wheels. These are the deep dish style and getting hard to find now.These are in good condition, straight with no curb damage. They come with the stainless RS centre caps in the pics, the centres do have a few small dings and marks but they are ok.They have tyres but they look old and two of them are well worn.These wheels have been painted (not very well IMHO!) they look ok from a distance but up close the prep was poor and there's old peeling paint under the new. They could be used as is and still look alright but my intention was to get them blasted and powder coated in silver/grey like original.Price wise, I'm open to offers but looking for £150 ono for the Laser set and £200 ono for the dartboards.Collection preferred due to size and weight but I'm sure I could sort delivery at cost though. These are located in Waterlooville Hampshire (near Portsmouth).Any interest either PM me or leave a post on here.Thanks, Last Edit: Oct 16, 2016 12:17:31 GMT by danthecapriman 1985 Ford Granada 2.8 ghia x 1984 Ford Transit 100L",

      "text": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact of the election of Donald Trump U.S. president on its business over the next several years.\nShanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the \"change in tone\" in Trump's comments since his election last week.\nShanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. He said, however, that he is encouraged that the president-elect has said it wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be \"pro-growth, overall.\"\nThe Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow.\nThe market's reaction to Trump's election has not been overly dramatic, which tells him, Shanks said, that there are expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy.\n\"Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let's just wait and see,\" said Shanks.\n\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse)",

      "text": "sunsales333 via eBay Like us on Facebook \nMike Bowling had spent nearly 20 years working on a Ford automobile assembly line in Cincinnati, Ohio, never once thinking about inventing toys. During the 1983 holiday season, he bought his daughter a handcrafted doll that she took everywhere and doted on like it was her baby sister. Soon, inventing a toy—one that could be produced with the same efficiency as the cars rolling out of the factory—was all he could think about. \nWell over a decade before Beanie Babies caused pandemonium, Bowling issued tiny, pellet-stuffed creatures of his own dubbed Pound Puppies. With droopy ears and wide, expressive eyes, they came in cardboard “crates” and with adoption papers. Despite a total lack of experience in the highly competitive world of kid products, Bowling took his idea and turned it into a brand that would go on to gross hundreds of millions in sales and make TIME magazine’s list of the world’s top 100 toys. tiny-ribbons via eBay \nBecause he knew virtually nothing about toy development, Bowling first contacted an intellectual property lawyer, who told him that registering trademarks and filing for patents would help protect his ideas. He went to one designer to have his Pound Puppies template sketched out and another to fabricate the cardboard box that doubled as a carrier. \nArmed with a plan and mock-ups, Bowling was swiftly turned down by 14 different companies. One executive huffed that the Puppies were the ugliest things he'd ever seen. \nBowling’s persistence eventually landed him an audience with Irwin Toy, a distributor based in Canada that was still reeling from a partnership with Atari that had recently gone south; the video game craze, which was about to be reignited by Nintendo, had collapsed in a heap and left vendors with piles of unsold cartridges. Eager for a low-risk opportunity, they licensed the Pound Puppies and released them in Canada in 1984. \nThey were an immediate hit. As Bowling had predicted, children who wanted to nurture something adorable and parents who weren’t inclined to scoop dog poop found a perfect compromise in his plush animals, which came complete with a mock care guide. Walking and exercise were stressed; caregivers were advised that their chosen puppy had “had all the shots they need to stay healthy.” A bath was also recommended. Fortunately, the animals were machine-washable. \nBy December 1985, Tonka—like Irwin, a company that had been scorched by an ill-fated partnership with a video game company named Sega—was convinced Bowling was on to something, and brought the plush animals to the U.S. The Puppies were selling out across the country, creating a frenzy that had been rivaled in recent memory only by the Cabbage Patch Kids. In 1985, more than 2.5 million puppies were sold at the inflated retail price of $30. If kids wanted stickers and a personalized dog tag, Tonka would mail them both for an extra $3.50. \nLike any respectable ‘80s toy craze, Pound Puppies were also awarded their own animated series, which premiered on ABC in the fall of 1986. At the “Wagga Wagga Pound,” a cast of endearing dogs awaited their turn for adoption. Nancy Cartwright, who would soon after become the voice of Bart Simpson, played Bright Eyes. Another one of the dogs was named Whopper, a strange choice considering the Puppies were usually found as a promotional item at Hardee’s. He was a golden retriever who wore a diaper. morrbubb via eBay \nAs with any retail phenomenon, toy pundits predicted a short shelf life for the Puppies. And while they did eventually fade, it took several years and more than $300 million in sales before kids moved on to other obsessions. Their expected successor, a line of saggy plush dogs dubbed Wrinkles produced by Canadian toy company Ganz, failed to break through. \nIn 2011, Bowling sold the Pound Puppies IP to Hasbro for an undisclosed sum. Having long since retired from the Ford assembly line, he continues to brainstorm new toy ideas, including a line of plastic mermaids dubbed Splashlings. While they may catch on, it will be difficult to match the success Bowling had in marketing the idea of an imaginary dog adoption. In 2016, the inventor estimated more than 200 million Pound Puppies have been sold—nearly three times as many as there are actual dogs in the United States. More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Director/fashion superstar Tom Ford’s film Nocturnal Animals ‘ is essentially a polished indictment of polish, but it often seems too enamored with its exquisite mode of visual storytelling — and too inattentive to character nuance — to not feel aligned the vapid industry it condemns.\nNocturnal Animals is a film split into two worlds: a reenacted version of a work of brutal fiction within the film, and the “real” world of the person reading that work of fiction. The “reality” half of the movie follows Amy Adams’ character, Susan, as she confronts the memories of a relationship gone awry after receiving a McCarthy-esque desert horror novel, by her ex-husband (Edward, played by Jake Gyllenhaal), dedicated to her. In it, Edward casts himself as the husband/father seeking vengeance for horrific acts done against his wife and daughter. In the “reality” section, Susan is susceptible to the power of the book/call of her ex; she’s scared, her guilt and interest and romantic side all piqued — because we’re led to believe in their characters as dichotomized archetypes. When they were together, Edward was the impetuous, inspiring writer; Susan was the pragmatic connoisseur with entrepreneurial bent, who’s now fallen so deeply into that side of herself that she has no access to human warmth, or something. She ended their relationship because Edward couldn’t ensure financial stability.\n\nThe whole point of the “reality” section seems to be to depict Susan’s existence as one of surfaces and voids, to imply (or really, to scream) what her resurgence of interest in her ex’s hot blooded artistry is. Ford’s film is based on Austin Wright’s novel Tony and Susan , but in the book, the protagonist is a stay-at-home mom; Ford changed the nature of the character (played in the film by Amy Adams) apparently to reflect some of questions he has about his own existence within the art world. In the film, Susan is gallerist at a huge gallery.\nIn order to depict the superficiality of her existence as a member of the Los Angeles art world elite, Ford takes a visually satiric approach to the stereotypes of that world. The film does have some kitschy humor therein: Jenna Malone gives an amazing one-scene-long performance as another gallerist who brags about the surveillance camera over her baby’s bed so she can keep an eye on the nanny she “hates.” The footage of her baby sleeping looks like Paranormal Activity. In another scene, where Susan is in a meeting in what looks like an art-world spaceship, the camera suddenly cuts to a close-up of a face with a pair of recently filled lips:”Did you get a new doctor?” asks Adams. “Haircut,” says the lips. The opening credits of the film feature a surreal depiction of a performance art piece featuring naked, obese women dancing with American flags, a piece Adams later refers to as “junk.” And Susan’s friend dresses like this:\n\nA scene featuring John Currin’s Nude in a Convex Mirror , a painting of a traditional, tasteful nude whose butt just so happens to be blown to massive proportions, reaching as though it were a monster in a pandering 3D movie — offers up the comic/satiric potential the film could have had if it’d also gone deeper.\nBut throughout the film, Ford characterizes the world he’s critiquing through other expensive art world signifiers, specifically works by two particular mega-star artists who represent its mainstream. And as much as the film may satirically prod this art, it also seems to love and relish its emptiness, and becomes too unable to offer much beyond vacant, scary beauty, to not merely perpetuate the vacancies these two artworks engender.\nPerhaps hearing the words “vapid” “mega-star certain artists” and “expensive signifiers,” you’ve already guessed that the cameo performances from artworks in Nocturnal Animals are made by none other than pieces by Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. A silver version of one of Koons’ infinite supply of balloon doggies makes an appearance towards the beginning of the film, right around the time Susan laments the junkifying of her industry and the exhibits she puts on. The doggie shows up in a shot of the exterior of her house, looking sad, and surrounded by a thick fog, standing next to a wobbly crane. Later in the film, as she wanders around a chillingly austere museum space, she gazes at Damien Hirst’s Saint Sebastian, Exquisite Pain . \nIt should be mentioned that both of these works are of simulacral animals: the Hirst, a stuffed cow, prodded by arrows, immersed in a formaldehyde tank; the Koons, a giant metal balloon animal, a simulacral rendering of a simulacral rendering. Adams’ character’s world is depicted with such pretty coldness to suggest that she barely even feels human, let alone animal, anymore; by contrast, the desert vengeance story of the book she’s been given is all animalism — with its sexualized violence, its desperation-inducing climate, its setting even outside of modernity (part of the family’s predicament in the “story” part of the film is that they can’t get cell reception in the wilds of West Texas).\nBut while it may in many moments seem like Ford is trying to dig his teeth into the art world — not that those teeth would be particularly piercing, as no amount of bite marks from critics can ever seem to puncture the inflated commercial success of Koons’ mega-kitsch or Hirst’s creepy decorative nothings — his own work happens to bear many similarities to that of Koons and Hirst. It may come as a surprise after seeing the film, but Ford also seems to really, genuinely, like both of them.\nDespite the usage of a Koons in a portrait of a world evacuated of purpose beyond capital gain, in 2009, Ford did an episode of Iconoclasts about Koons, saying he’s one of his favorite artists. “In a certain way, he’s the contemporary artist,” Ford said. “There’s a chaotic quality, but very slick, surface-y, very designed.” In Vox, speaking of his decision to use the Hirst, he said that the pieces in the film are “works that really speak to [him].” If these two artists comment on the vacancy of commodified images, it is only in epitomizing it in the stoicism of their work’s ostentation.\nFord’s lipstick-caked vision of despair within the capitalist art-world seems prone to a type of self-reflexivity that undermines it: his over-aestheticization isn’t paired with characters rich enough to suggest a vision beyond aesthetics. For, take away the exquisite camera work, the costuming, the adoration of certain shades of lipstick, and the film’s textual commentary on the art world is built fundamentally on archetypes.\nPlastic surgery! Nanny cams! Bad art! All of this is shot with great comic timing, but not exactly the most trenchant commentary. Ford’s/Ford’s character’s fatigue of this world of polished surfaces is one that’s somewhat questionable, given that the film itself cannot exist without them. In a profile on Ford in The Hollywood Reporter , Gyllenhaal said that he was initially worried that Ford would “focus on the aesthetic over the heart of the story.” He then continued, “But he was so different than I expected. He had thousands of research photographs. He had a palette for each character. Everything was packed with thought and detail.”… none of which sounds all that different than a “focus on aesthetic” over heart. The film is exquisitely detailed when it comes to imagistic storytelling, and a beguiling watch because of it. But much like the critical questions perpetually surrounding the works of Hirst and Koons, it’s hard to see what a shiny balloon animal has to say about the nature of shiny balloon animals.\n",

      "title": "This 1956 Ford F-100 Pickup Rewrites the Book on Kustom",
      "text": "Email \nOne of the coolest things about taking on the build of a radical kustom is that the only rules that apply are the ones that you make. When original designers took their pens to paper to create vehicles for the public it was important that their visions would translate to a mass audience who would embrace their creativity. Simply put, great designs meant great sales for the manufacturers. Customizers have been at it since the beginning of time, adding their special styling to the mix to show off their vast talents to like-minded enthusiasts who embrace their creativity. \nSteve Wilson of Athol, Massachusetts, was lured into the hot rod and custom world by his dad Steve Sr. at an early age and never looked back. Between weekends at car shows, swap meets, and long nights in the family garage wrenching on the latest projects, his path had already been set. It wasn’t long till he saved enough to buy a 1954 Ford Customline to start honing his skills. Fascinated by the sculpting of classic ’50s- and ’60s-era customs he studied in vintage magazines, he also developed his fabrication skills hanging out at a local speed shop named Outlaw Motorsports. Before long he was on his way to WyoTech with a concentration in hot rod and chassis fabrication, collision and refinishing, and high-performance engines. \nAfter graduation his path led him to a number of local shops to get started, flexing his creativity till he made a big decision to move to California where the custom scene was hot. Wanting to continue to develop his skills as a craftsman led him to a job at Gambino Customs in San Jose where he worked for shop owner Alex Gambino. The job finally gave him the opportunity to work on the type of traditional customs he was passionate about as a builder and fabricator. \nOne afternoon he saw a wicked cool 1956 Ford F-100 pickup owned by Papa Joe who was a member of the Road Zombies Car Club. It had been chopped 3 ½ inches by Papa Joe and Eric Lamonas, featured a 16-inch shortened bed, was slammed to the ground on ‘bags, and coated in blue suede with red flames. Wilson wasted no time in trading his Harley chopper project for the truck and began immediately driving the hauler on a daily basis. Before long he decided to put his own spin on it and worked with his friends at Gambino’s, as well as members of the Road Zombies and Road Lords, to fine-tune the body and lay down a very distinctive green and gold panel-paint design to give it a perfect mid-’50s vibe. Steve continued to drive the wheels off the it, eventually moving back to Massachusetts with the truck to become co-owner of his very own shop, Wilson and Steely Kustom Coachworks in Athol. The truck was still wicked cool, but was becoming covered in road rash. Steve decided on a full teardown to bare bones and giving it a full rebirth, this time leaning heavily on the radical side of the Kustom house. \nHaving driven the truck thousands of miles, Steve wanted to freshen up the frame and suspension and got busy by blasting the spine clean to start. To slam the hauler lower to the ground, up front he Z’d the originally installed 1974 Chevy Nova subframe and fabricated a new rear frame from the cab back with new framerails while also incorporating new crossmembers. A fresh Currie Enterprises 9-inch Ford custom rear packed with matching 31-spline axles spinning 3.73:1 gears was hung in place by a custom triangulated four-link combined with Slam Specialties SS-Series ‘bags complemented by Bilstein monotube shocks. To bury the nose in the dirt a set of custom tubular upper and lower control arms meet 1-inch dropped spindles, Slam Specialties SS-Series ‘bags and Bilstein monotube shocks to get the job done in style. When the need to stop calls a chrome power master and booster from SSBC pushes juice through stainless lines to matching 11-inch drilled and slotted rotors with SuperTwin four-piston calipers out back and two-piston units at the front. Anchoring it all to the street you’ll find a set of nostalgic 15×7.5 Rocket Racing Strike model wheels capped with Diamond Back Classic wide white tires. \nIn order to bring plenty of bulletproof performance to the party Steve contacted Blue Print Engines of Kearney, Nebraska, for one of their stout 383ci small-block Chevy V-8s. A four-bolt main block was massaged and filled with a new cast steel crank linked to H-beam steel rods wearing hypereutectic pistons. For plenty of power Blue Print Performance’s exclusive aluminum heads breathe deep while a flat-tappet cam sets the beat and an MSD Pro-Billet ignition lights the fire. Up top is all business with an Edelbrock Performer dual-quad intake wearing a pair of their AVS Thunder-Series 500-cfm carbs. Exhaust exits through a pair of smoothed 1973 Camaro exhaust manifolds linked to a custom 2 ½-inch stainless exhaust with Pypes M-80 mufflers for an aggressive sound. Plenty of vibrance comes from high-polished bits by OTB Gear, including their valve covers and air cleaners, as well as a chrome alternator from Powermaster. To move the goods a TCI Automotive 700-R4 with their Street Fighter converter links to a custom driveshaft from Mitchell Drivetrain in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. \nTo bring new life to the truck, Steve looked deep into his bag of tricks and pulled out a stack of voodoo to get the project kicked into high gear. Getting started, he worked with his team to first clip an extra inch out of the roof, followed by finessing the A-pillars. From there the grille area was heavily reworked to fuse a flipped 1957 Chevy truck grille in place while also adding a set of canted-quad 1959 Impala headlights all melded to a freshly formed roll pan. The door bottoms were then rounded along with the fabrication of custom running boards and the bottoms of the front and rear fenders being sectioned 1 inch. With the bed being previously shortened 16 inches the team followed by reworking the tailgate along with infusing 1961 Buick Invicta taillights into the mix while also filling the bed stake holes and fabbing a new rear roll pan. The cab and bed was then shaved clean and made razor sharp to prepare everything for paint. This is where Steve goes straight to the head of the class for having the vision to bring his ideas for the final product to life. Team member Richard “Duck” Day laid down a flawless combination of Axalta Black Diamond metallic as a base color to cover the truck and followed with the flames in Little Daddy Roth Spinas black powder flake and then complemented the panels with scallops in a blend of Little Daddy’s Custard Pie and Ghetto Gold and topped them with a final coating of SEM California Gold candy. The final icing came from the brushes of Denis Day who laid down literally miles of pinstriping to complete the reawakening. \nIf you’re doing a radical kustom the interior had better match the rest of the build. To complete the look the factory dash was smoothed and filled with gauges from Classic Instruments to monitor the vitals while a neat steering wheel from CON2R carves a course and a Lokar mile-high shifter pulls gears. For comfort a pair of 1959 Nash metropolitan seats were re-covered in a very unique white pearl vinyl by Clint Morton who also covered the inside of the bed with the same material and fitted the classic gold loop carpet in place. Team member Jon Reed then followed covering the kick panels, custom console with the same vinyl and completed the job with plenty of Polar White fur accents. This is one custom pickup that will leave a lasting impression on you long after seeing it and we totally dig it! Facts & Figures",

      "text": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co <F.N> Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact of the election of Donald Trump U.S. president on its business over the next several years. Shanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the \"change in tone\" in Trump's comments since his election last week.\nShanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. He said, however, that he is encouraged that the president-elect has said it wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be \"pro-growth, overall.\"\nThe Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow.\nThe market's reaction to Trump's election has not been overly dramatic, which tells him, Shanks said, that there are expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy.\n\"Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let's just wait and see,\" said Shanks.\n\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse)",

      "text": "Matthew DeBord/BI \nFord Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact President-elect Donald Trump will have on its business over the next several years.\nShanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the \"change in tone\" in Trump's comments since his election last week.\nShanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. Shanks said, however, that he is encouraged that the President-elect has said he wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be \"pro-growth, overall.\"\nThe Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow.\nThe market's reaction to Trump's election has not been overly dramatic, indicating expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy, Shanks said.\n\"Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let's just wait and see,\" Shanks said.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse)\nNOW WATCH: Ford CEO responds to Trump’s criticism of the company \n",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. cut earnings expectations for its finance arm next year, the latest sign that falling used-car prices are hurting automotive businesses.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker cut Ford Credit's 2017 pretax profit forecast by $300 million to $1.5 billion amid sliding auction values on used vehicles, finance chief Bob Shanks told analysts Thursday.\nThe used-car values continued falling through September as vehicles coming off leases flooded back to dealerships. Ford previously had said it expected its financing arm to earn roughly the same amount as this year. Mr. Shanks said falling used-car prices are spreading beyond small cars and crossovers, both suffering sales slumps amid lower gasoline prices, and now also affecting larger pickup trucks and sport utilities.\nThe revised forecast further clouded Ford's financial outlook, though the auto maker reaffirmed expectations to earn $10.2 billion in adjusted pretax profits in 2016. Ford in September had lowered full-year profit expectations by $600 million to account for its recalling vehicles with faulty door latches.\nLast week, rental-car firm Hertz Global Holdings Inc. last week reported lower third-quarter profits and cut financial projections amid concerns over falling used-car prices, raising broader concerns for auto makers and dealers already struggling to match last year's auto sales record.\nCar companies are bracing for a significant influx of used cars in good condition coming off lease, which could further erode new-car sales by giving shoppers cheaper alternatives. Leased vehicles accounted for about 30% of all cars sold in the U.S. through October, according to J.D. Power.\nUnlike vehicles purchased by a buyer using a loan or cash, leased cars are owned by the finance company -- often controlled by an auto maker -- during the term of a lease, which is typically three years. Pricing is set on the expected value of the vehicle at the end of the term, but auto makers often subsidize the deal to lower the monthly payment.\n\"As an industry, we have to recognize what's happening with all these vehicles that are coming off lease in the next few years,\" said Mr. Shanks of Ford.\nFord's financing arm is one of the company's most profitable units and has been growing steadily as the auto industry recovered. But Ford Credit's operating profit fell 21% in the second quarter, driven by an increase in auto-loan defaults and deepening losses on off-lease cars resold at auction for lower values than projected. Ford Credit results improved in the third quarter but Mr. Shanks warned the decline in auction values has been sharper than expected.\nGM Financial, the financing arm for Ford rival General Motors Co., is less exposed to declining used-car prices as it only began leasing vehicles last year.\nThis latest cut to Ford Credit's guidance, meanwhile, comes as the Dearborn, Mich., car maker struggles to keep its profit momentum going after posting record pretax results in 2015. Ford's third-quarter profits tumbled 56% compared with the same period in 2015, hurt by hefty recall expenses, weaker U.S. sales and higher launch costs related to the rollout of a new heavy-duty truck.\nFord expects profits will continue to shrink through next year due to heavy investment in partnerships and acquisitions related to its expansion into transportation services.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch If your password is one of these phrases, change it now Apple MacBook Pro Review: Living With Tradeoffs Kellyanne Conway Discusses How to ‘Drain the Swamp’",

      "text": "Fisher clears up Ford gossip WENN - Nov 17, 2016 / 12:00 pm | Story: 181163 Photo: WENN - All rights reserved. Carrie Fisher \nActress Carrie Fisher has urged gossip-mongers to read her memoir before spreading lies about her one-time lover Harrison Ford's sex skills. \nThe 60-year-old details her three-month extramarital affair with Ford in her new book, The Princess Diarist, revealing they were more than just friends while shooting Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope in 1976, when she first portrayed Princess Leia and Harrison took on the role of Han Solo. \nAn excerpt purportedly from the upcoming release began circulating online on Tuesday (15Nov16), apparently suggesting Carrie, then 19, was left disappointed the first time she slept with her co-star. \nThe actress has since spoken out to dismiss the unfounded claims, telling People.com, \"Any reports claiming I said Harrison was bad in bed are utterly false. Perhaps people should read the book before they write their stories.\" \nShe has also taken to Twitter to address the reports, insisting her book makes no mention of Harrison's lovemaking skills. \n\"I would never talk about how someone was in any furniture - chair, bed, coffee table or otherwise,\" she joked. \nCarrie has only fond memories of her short-lived affair, admitting it was \"so intense\", and adding, \"It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend... I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him. He was kind.\" \nThe star also revealed she had called Harrison to warn him about her tell-all, but he didn't have much to say about the big reveal. \n\"He went, 'Lawyer!'\" Carrie recalled, admitting she sent him an advanced copy of the manuscript but never heard back. \nDespite his silence about the romance news, Carrie has no regrets about going public with her fling, even though it suggests Ford was unfaithful to his then-wife Mary Marquardt. \n\"It was 40 years ago,\" she said. \nHarrison and Mary filed for divorce in 1979. He went on to wed Melissa Mathison in 1983, and now he's married to actress Calista Flockhart. \nCarrie has only been married once - to singer Paul Simon from 1983 to 1984. \nHarrison and Carrie both reprised their roles for Star Wars: The Force Awakens last year.",

      "text": "Matthew DeBord/BI\nFord Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact President-elect Donald Trump will have on its business over the next several years.\nShanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the \"change in tone\" in Trump's comments since his election last week.\nShanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. Shanks said, however, that he is encouraged that the President-elect has said he wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be \"pro-growth, overall.\"\nThe Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow.\nThe market's reaction to Trump's election has not been overly dramatic, indicating expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy, Shanks said.\n\"Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let's just wait and see,\" Shanks said.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse)\nRead the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2016.

      "text": "CEOs usually avoid picking fights with incoming presidents, but Mark Fields is fired up. Eight days after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential race, the Ford Motor Co. ( F ) CEO told reporters at a trade show that Trump’s trade plans, if enacted, “would have a huge impact on the economy.” And he didn’t mean a positive impact. Fields is feisty because Trump, while campaigning, singled out Ford for criticism over its plans to open a new factory in Mexico. Remaking the North American Free Trade Agreement is one of Trump’s top priorities during his first 100 days in office, and that could directly upend billions of dollars in investments Ford, GM and other automakers have made in Mexico during the last decade. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which could spur a damaging trade war just as China has become an important source of profits for Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler.\nRecent analysis of Trump’s economic plan by S&P Global Market Intelligence highlighted the American auto sector as the one industry most threatened under the new president. “We see autos as the only industry facing a high and negative impact from policies the new administration may adopt,” S&P said. That’s a bit ironic, since the auto industry still employs about 925,000 Americans in the kinds of decent-paying blue-collar jobs Trump wants more of. That number is lower than during the peak years of the early 2000s, but it has nonetheless recovered nicely since the last recession ended in 2009. Millions of additional Americans work in car dealerships, tire retailers and auto-repair shops that will all suffer if the broader auto industry does.\nTrump has no beef with automakers, per se, but his trade ideas happen to involve heavy manufacturers with a global footprint—which is exactly what carmakers have become. Ford has 3 production facilities in Mexico and another one planned, while GM ( GM ) has 4 and Chrysler ( FCAU ) has 2. Volkswagen and most Japanese automakers have plants in Mexico as well.\nMexico imports about 2 million vehicles to the United States per year, accounting for roughly 11% of the 17.5 million vehicles sold in the US in 2015. The Center for Automotive Research forecasts that Mexican auto production will increase by about 60% by 2022, with several automakers planning to expand there. Production in the United States and Canada should decline slightly during the same timeframe.\nMost automakers assemble smaller vehicles in Mexico, because such vehicles have smaller profit margins than pickup trucks or SUVs and labor is a larger portion of the total cost. Cheap labor, not surprisingly, is the biggest advantage of manufacturing in Mexico, where total hourly compensation including benefits averages just $8.24 per hour, according to CAR. That’s 82% lower than the US average of $46.35 per hour.\nLimiting Mexican imports\nTrump hasn’t spelled out how he wants to rearrange NAFTA, but the basic idea is to encourage or compel more production in the United States, which would mean less production in places like Mexico. But that would be highly disruptive and would penalize American automakers more than their foreign rivals. Trump could probably rewrite the rules in a way that limits Mexican imports to the United States, for instance. But that doesn’t mean automakers would simply move Mexican factories north of the border. They might look for other low-cost countries instead, such as South Korea, India or China. The Trump administration could pursue trade restrictions on those countries as well, but that becomes a game of free-trade whack-a-mole in which the government is trying to tell multinational companies where to invest their money—hardly the lightly regulated pro-growth environment Trump says he wants to create.\nIf Trump tries to stop US automakers from producing in Mexico, that doesn’t mean he can stop foreign automakers from operating there. So the government would essentially be raising costs for American firms by forcing them out of Mexico, but not for their global competitors. Trade protections can equalize the cost of selling foreign-made cars in the United States—but not in other markets. And Mexico actually has better trade deals in place with Europe and Latin American countries than the US does, which means it’s cheaper to export the same car to Italy or Spain from Mexico than from the United States. That’s one reason Mexico has wooed so many automakers. Moving production meant for export from Mexico to the United States wouldn’t make any sense.\nThreat to profits in China\nAutomakers also worry about Trump’s threat to remake the nation’s trade relationships with China, and impose tariffs on Chinese imports to the US if necessary. Only two automakers import vehicles from China to the United States—Volvo and General Motors—and volumes are tiny. But GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler earn significant profits in China, and those would be directly threatened if China retaliated against US companies by imposing tariffs of their own. Hard-fought market-share gains by US automakers in China would crumble as vehicles sold by Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan and China’s own automakers were suddenly much cheaper.\nTrump may bring better news for carmakers, in the shorter term. If Trump slashes taxes as promised and stokes the economy with big new infrastructure programs, that could boost growth and incomes for a while. Flush consumers could spend even more on cars than they are now, during a near-record year for sales. That’s the most likely reason GM and Ford shares have risen modestly since Trump’s election.\nBut new restrictions on trade could more than offset that short-term sales bump. All of the global automakers have spent decades refining their supply lines and seeking the slightest cost advantage over competitors. GM and Chrysler declared bankruptcy in 2009, and Ford nearly did, because they fell too far behind Toyota and other foreign rivals and couldn’t withstand a sharp downturn. The same automakers are now comfortably profitable and hoping to stay healthy. The question is whether President Trump will let them.\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success .

      "text": "  Automakers, including BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, promoted their digital bona fides and extolled services like Android Auto or Apple CarPlay that are meant to allow the safer, hands-free use of smartphones in the car, even though safety experts say such features may be contributing to the sometimes fatal problem of distracted driving. \nAdvertisement   Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon that would enable the South Korean automaker’s cars to be remotely started, and the heater or air-conditioner to be turned on, by speaking to an Amazon Echo device inside the home. It was only the latest in a series of car-related apps that Amazon has introduced through Echo and the Alexis personal assistant. Other apps include one that enables Alexis to hail Uber rides. Uber, of course, and other ride-hailing services like Lyft, are potentially big disrupters of the automakers’ conventional business model of selling cars to individual consumers. And new variants are coming along, including See Jane Go, which had a booth at the conference. The company addresses a concern of many women by recruiting only female drivers and accepting only female passengers. Mark F. Fields, Ford Motor’s chief executive, spoke here of the opportunities he saw in selling vehicles to the ride-sharing industry, including, eventually, ones that would drive themselves. But optimism requires the car industry to reimagine itself. Instead of the worldwide automobile industry thinking of itself as the $2.3 trillion business it is now, Mr. Fields said, it should see itself as part of the much bigger global transportation industry. General Motors is already hedging itself in ride hailing, having taken a $500 million stake in Lyft. Under G.M.’s separate Maven car-sharing service, which offers by-the-hour rental to consumers, the company is also renting cars to Uber drivers . G.M. considers Maven a way to expose consumers to its various models, even if the people are not in the market to buy one. BMW has its own car-sharing venture, ReachNow, which operates in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and will soon be in Brooklyn. It allows members to drive a BMW or Mini vehicle for 41 cents a minute of operation. ReachNow’s chief executive, Steve Banfield, in an interview here, compared the concept to Netflix, the video service that has helped render ownership of DVDs superfluous. That might seem like a threat to BMW’s business of selling cars, but Mr. Banfield described it as more of a get-acquainted marketing approach. Some ReachNow members sign up simply for extended test drives of BMW cars like the electric i3, Mr. Banfield said. And younger members who cannot afford a vehicle early in their careers can become familiar with BMW’s products, making them more likely to become buyers once their salaries catch up with their tastes, he said. Photo AutoMobility LA, the trade show for the auto and tech industries, features presentations, such as the flood of data in autonomous vehicles. Credit Jules Bianchi For people who do own cars but who would not mind some help paying for them, there are mobile-app services like Turo, which enable car owners to rent out their cars. By renting their vehicles for nine days each month, owners could probably cover their entire car payments and maybe even turn a profit, David Stewart, Turo’s chief business officer, said in a presentation here. \nAdvertisement   Turo is good news for automakers, Mr. Stewart said, because it might help someone wary of owning a vehicle to afford to buy one, or to move up to a more luxurious model as the rental income made it affordable. But the question of who does or does not own a car now might one day seem a quaint distinction when cars start driving themselves. And when that time comes, the companies with the biggest identity crises may be ones like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that have persuaded the public to spend big money on the thrill of taking the wheel. Detlev von Platen, president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America, views it as an evolution. “Our cars will always be about the driving experience because that’s what we sell — experiences,’’ Mr. von Platen said. “But we must provide options for our owners and self-driving technologies that can be activated when desired must be considered.” And a self-driving Porsche might be more than a robotic tram. Imagine experiencing the throttle, braking and steering inputs of a professional driver on a racetrack. That could be programmed into the car, said Oliver Blume, Porsche’s chief executive. Porsche might also experiment with new types of sales or leasing options to cultivate loyalty. Mr. von Platen said the company might consider a “flex lease,” under which someone leasing a two-seat 718 Cayman would gain access to a Cayenne S.U.V. for seven days a year, which could be handy for when five seats are needed. The other big technology topic was electric vehicles , which all carmakers have been pursuing as a way to address concerns about the climate, as well as government-mandated rules and targets for lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency. Jaguar announced its I-Pace all-electric S.U.V., a concept car that the company said would be available in 2018. \nAdvertisement   And yet the election of Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic who is widely expected to scale back automotive emission and fuel-efficiency regulations, could alter the industry’s planning for environmentally friendlier cars. The possible relaxation of those regulations was an undercurrent here. And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, recently wrote to the Trump transition team urging a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a “substantial challenge” to the industry. Mr. Blume of Porsche said his company would stay on its current technology track, even if fuel-economy and emissions standards were relaxed. “When we think of new technology, we don’t concern ourselves with political changes,’’ Mr. Blume said. “We think electrification is a technology of the future, and we have a responsibility to the environment.’’ That debate simply reinforces a characteristic that was fully apparent at AutoMobility LA: The automotive business is not just about moving vehicles; it’s about moving targets.",

REUTERS/Chris Helgren A \nREUTERS: Ford Motor Co on Thursday lowered the 2017 pretax profit forecast for its financial services arm by US$300 million to about US$1.5 billion, due to lower auction values for used vehicles. \nFord affirmed that it expects full company pretax profit in 2017 to be down from 2016, and sees its core business to improve in 2018. In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by US$600 million to US$10.2 billion. (http://bit.ly/2fYYv2x) \nThe company expects Ford Credit to record a pretax profit of about US$1.5 billion in 2017, down about US$300 million from its prior estimate. \nFord expects its core automotive business to improve in 2017 and 2018. \nFord shares fell 1.1 percent to US$11.86 in early trading. \n(This story corrects in first paragraph to clarify that lower profit due to lower auction values of its products, not risk factors) \n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru and Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Ted Kerr and Jeffrey Benkoe) - Reuters",

      "text": "Latest News Recent News If Kyle Busch is able to defend his 2015 Ford EcoBoost 400 victory, he will also defend his championship. Last year Busch made history by being the first driver in the Modern Era to win a championship without competing for the entire season. The criticism about him has been that historically he could not put 10 strong runs together, but that was disproved in 2015 as well. This year, his only poor finish came by choice at Talladega SuperSpeedway, but there have been moments in most races when he seemed like a longshot to finish in the top 10. Nov 17 - 2:54 PM Kyle Busch finished second in the Can-Am 500 at Phoenix International Raceway and earned enough points to advance to Homestead-Miami Speedway as one of the Chase contenders. Notably, the four Chase contenders were predicted by Rotoworld Fantasy NASCAR earlier this week. Busch was running third with two laps remaining and might not have advanced to the finale if not for a late-race caution, because it appeared Joey Logano would be able to win the tiebreaker on points. When Matt Kenseth spun on the next-to-last restart, it opened up the points and allowed Busch to advance. He now has an opportunity to defend his 2015 Championship. This was Busch’s third consecutive top-five. Nov 13 - 6:22 PM Source: Rotoworld Fantasy Sprint Cup regular Kyle Busch, driving the No. 18 NOS Energy Drink Toyota, won the Ticket Galaxy 200, his 86th victory in 328 NASCAR XFINITY Series (NXS) races. This is his 10th victory and 14th top-10 NXS finish in 2016 and his 10th victory and 17th top-10 finish in 21 NXS races at Phoenix International Raceway (PIR). Sprint Cup driver Austin Dillon (finished second) posted his seventh top-10 finish in nine NXS races at PIR and his 15th top-10 NXS finish in 2016. Sprint Cup driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (third) posted his seventh top-10 finish in seven NXS races at PIR. Erik Jones (10th) was the highest finishing rookie. Nov 12 - 10:48 PM Kyle Busch posted the fastest single lap in final practice for the Can-Am 500k at Phoenix International Raceway with a speed of 136.358 mph. Busch was not particularly fast in qualification. He made two runs in the second session, but could only find the 19th-fastest lap and will roll off the pack from the middle of the grid. In the second practice session, he was mid-pack in regard to 10-lap averages as well. Busch needs a top-five finish in order to advance to the Chase Finale. Nov 12 - 6:54 PM",

Ford, then 33, was married to Mary Marquardt, with whom he had two children. \nThe couple divorced in 1979. Harrison later married “E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial” screenwriter Melissa Mathison in 1983, and they divorced in 2004. \nHe’s been married to actress Calista Flockhart since 2010. \nFisher writes that she and Ford spent their first night together after a birthday party for director George Lucas. \n“I looked over at Harrison. A hero’s face — a few strands of hair fell over his noble, slightly furrowed brow,” she wrote. “How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me?” \n“I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him,” she added. “He was kind.” \nNaturally Fisher’s revelations have provided lots of fodder for social media. \nIn March, Fisher appeared on the British talk series “The Jonathan Ross Show” and denied she and Ford had been romantic. \nShe said she thought he looked like a movie star. “It wasn’t like you get a crush on that person.” \nHowever, Fisher said at the time that her recently found journals had more details. \n“I haven’t looked all the way through it, but I must say it seemed to be trending in that direction,” she said. “But it didn’t happen.” \nPressed by Ross, she said she was still poring through the diaries for details. \n“It might happen, it might now happen,” Fisher said. \nFord and Fisher reprised their roles last year in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” \nCNN has reached out to Ford for comment.

      "text": "MINNEOLA, Kan. (KSNW) — A new wind farm is being built near Dodge City. The 178 megawatt facility will provide enough energy to power about 54,000 homes for a year.\nIt will be built near Minneola but will bring an economic boom to both Ford and Clark counties.\nConstruction is about a fourth of the way complete on Bloom Wind farm.\nCapital Power, the company building and operating the wind farm, says it will have a significant impact on the local economy.\n“So the benefits to the counties Ford and Clark as well as to Minneola school board is quite significant with more than 1.2 million per year in direct payments to those counties, local landowners, and the school district,” said Michael Sheehan, a representative with Capital Power.\nThe money doesn’t come as taxes. Instead, Capital Power gives an agreed-upon contribution, which is then divided out among local counties, school districts, landowners, and other entities.\n“[It’s] very helpful, especially in these hard economic times for people,” said Ford County Treasurer Debra Pennington, “and I don’t think that people realize the impact that it does give to our community and the benefits that it does give us.”\nIt also brings short-term jobs to the community, during construction.\n“So currently there’s as many as 130 construction workers on site,” said Sheehan. “It would be a mixture of people. So some people would definitely be hired local, from within the counties, from within the state.”\nThe Minneola School District isn’t sure yet how much money it will receive from the deal. They’re still working out the specifics.\nIt does have a plan for how it will spend it. They’ll use the funds to pay down the bonds used to build the high school.\nThe district expects the money to start rolling in late in 2017.",

      "text": "Ford made snaps late Monday when it used Snapchat to reveal the EcoSport subcompact crossover in advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show .\nThe use of Snapchat, a social media messaging app popular with millennials and the subsequent Generation Z, to reveal a vehicle was a first, according to Ford, and a clear indictor of the vehicle's intended demographic.\nThe launch was headlined by DJ Khaled—a Miami-based hip-hop producer who has become famous for mini-esoteric discussions on Snapchat.\nIt's also the first time in it's 13-year history the EcoSport will be sold in America.\nFord's decision reflects the growing trend in the U.S. of consumer preferences for crossovers and SUVs. The EcoSport has long been rumored as a vehicle the automaker would eventually bring to the U.S. as fuel economy standards get tougher and the popularity of small crossovers continues to grow.\nThe Dearborn automaker also said the EcoSport is part of four all-new SUVs it plans to launch globally over the next four years. Due up for redesigns are the Ford Explorer, Ford Escape and the return of the Ford Bronco, a nameplate the automaker plans to revive in 2018 .\nFord refuses to confirm what workers know: Bronco, Ranger returning to U.S. Robert Duffer If there's one thing auto lovers can take from this (insert adjective here) election cycle, it's confirmation that Ford is resurrecting the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup truck.\nThe news break comes from an unlikely source: A plant chairman for United Auto Workers Local 900 responding to Republican...\nIf there's one thing auto lovers can take from this (insert adjective here) election cycle, it's confirmation that Ford is resurrecting the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup truck.\nThe news break comes from an unlikely source: A plant chairman for United Auto Workers Local 900 responding to Republican...\n(Robert Duffer) EcoSport is Ford's entry to the hot-selling subcomact crossover space that includes the Chevy Trax, Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X and so many more. Ford said without irony that EcoSport suits people who are “choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff.”\nRanking the best subcompact crossovers Patrick Olsen The subcompact SUV category is nearly a brand-new car segment made up of a collection of compromises. While they offer more space than subcompact cars and better fuel economy than compact SUVs, there are trade-offs to these tall hatchbacks. Still, automakers have high hopes for this segment, and...\nThe subcompact SUV category is nearly a brand-new car segment made up of a collection of compromises. While they offer more space than subcompact cars and better fuel economy than compact SUVs, there are trade-offs to these tall hatchbacks. Still, automakers have high hopes for this segment, and...\n(Patrick Olsen) It comes loaded with convenience and safety technology, including two USB ports, a 12-Volt outlet, Sync 3 infotainment, up to 30 storage areas and more. The \"floating\" touchscreen sits in front of the dash instead of embedded in it, and Ford suggested you don't have to touch it as much as put your finger near it.\nIt won't be run on connected car power alone. Two engines will be offered, including the 1.0-liter three-cylinder and 2.0-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost. EcoSport will have four-wheel drive, six-speed automatic transmission, and will be offered in four trim levels. It's expected in dealerships early in 2018.\n2016 Honda HR-V grows into Fit crossover Jim Mateja Based on the success of its CR-V compact crossover, Honda has added a smaller companion to the lineup for 2016 called the HR-V. The subcompact crossover that's 10 inches shorter than the CR-V is part of a new breed of automobile that includes the Chevy Trax, Mazda CX-3, Nissan Juke, Subaru Crosstrek...\nBased on the success of its CR-V compact crossover, Honda has added a smaller companion to the lineup for 2016 called the HR-V.

A second generation of the small utility vehicle launched in Brazil and other global markets in 2012. Ford did not say where it would build the EcoSport that it will sell in the U.S.\nThe EcoSport is built on Ford's global subcompact platform, which is the basis for the Ford Fiesta in the U.S. and Europe. The Dearborn automaker currently makes the Fiesta at its assembly plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The EcoSport also is produced at plants in Brazil, India, Thailand and Russia.\n2016 Mazda CX-3 crossover is small but full of features Jim Mateja Add yet another entry in the segment du jour of the auto industry, the 2016 Mazda CX-3 subcompact crossover utility vehicle (CUV).\nThe CX-3 joins the Fiat 500 X, Honda HR-V, Chevy Trax, Buick Encore, Jeep Renegade, Nissan Juke and Subaru Crosstrek in the small CUV segment, which some estimate will...\nAdd yet another entry in the segment du jour of the auto industry, the 2016 Mazda CX-3 subcompact crossover utility vehicle (CUV).\nThe CX-3 joins the Fiat 500 X, Honda HR-V, Chevy Trax, Buick Encore, Jeep Renegade, Nissan Juke and Subaru Crosstrek in the small CUV segment, which some estimate will...\n(Jim Mateja) In March, Ford said it would spend $217 million to make the Ford EcoSport at its Craiova Assembly Plant in Romania starting in the autumn of 2017.\nBrent Snavely of The Detroit Free Press contributed.\n Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Ford Motor Co.",

      "text": "EV Demand Lags \nFord Motor Co., cutting its 2017 profit forecast for the second time in three months, said it sees a bumpier future as President-elect Donald J. Trump translates his campaign promises into new policies on trade, tariffs and regulation. \n“It feels like a world that’s even more volatile,” Bob Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, said in a presentation to analysts today. The Trump administration “is going to be an opportunity for substantial change.” \nComplicating matters, those changes are coming just as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a record six straight years of growth--meaning there’s now a glut of used cars that is hurting profit at its Ford Credit unit. On an optimistic note, Shanks said the automaker does expect Trump to have a “pro-growth” strategy for the economy. That might include easing tough fuel-economy regulations to reflect consumers’ preference for trucks and sport utility vehicles--instead of electric cars--in an era of cheap gasoline. Related \nTrump Presidency Won't Kill the Electric Car \n“If the new government is serious about accelerating and growing in a very healthy way the U.S. economy--and I believe it is--I think it will take measures that will enable that,” Shanks said. Hitting Ford with a 35% duty on cars it makes in Mexico and brings back to the U.S., as Trump threatened during the campaign, “would be contrary to that.” \nShanks said he noticed a \"change in tone post-election\" from Trump that \"is very encouraging.\" \n\"When Mr. Trump met President Obama, the tone, the dialogue, the mutual respect, the desire to work together, I thought was very, very positive,\" Shanks said. \nFord is talking to Trump’s transition team, while also speaking with federal regulators about how low gas prices are undermining efforts to get Americans to buy electric cars and hybrids so that automakers can achieve a goal to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. 1",

      "text": "— Nov 17, 2016 Sponsored Links \nUnsurprisingly, it was crossover craze at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. Multiple crossover vehicles shared the spotlight in the city of angels, but there was an important vehicle in attendance for Ford. \nThe Ford EcoSport will plug a major void in the portfolio and has slapped a target square on the back of the 2017 Chevrolet Trax . How do they stack up on paper? \nOne of the most important aspects of this segment is a small overall footprint with plenty of space for cargo. Ford states the 2018 EcoSport will arrive with 11.76 cubic-feet of cargo space. That figure is utterly minuscule compared to the 2017 Chevy Trax, which can house 18.7 square feet of junk in the trunk. Interestingly, the EcoSport’s hatch also opens outward inside of up. \nWhere the two subcompact crossovers differ is in the powertrain department. Ford Authority reports EcoSport will arrive with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbo; the Trax rolls with just a 1.4-liter four-cylinder turbo engine. \nUltimately, these two crossovers have identical buyers in their sights. Whether one will be more successful than the other remains to be seen. Don’t forget, though, the Trax has had quite the head start and sales continue to climb for the crossover.

      "text": "Mazda Plans to Move Upmarket \nLOS ANGELES – FCA U.S. and Ford join the burgeoning Small CUV segment with all-new entries for the North American market introduced here at the Los Angeles auto show – the Jeep Compass for FCA and the EcoSport for Ford. \nBoth the Compass and EcoSport already are on sale elsewhere in the world, so few modifications are necessary to add them to the automakers’ growing CUV portfolios. The Compass went on sale in South America in September, while the EcoSport has been sold in Europe, Asia and South America since 2013. \nThe vehicles represent additions to a segment flooded with 16 entries, including the reigning sales leader Jeep Patriot/Compass twins that will be replaced by the all-new Compass. Other strong players in the segment include the Buick Encore, Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, the Hyundai Tucson/Kia Sportage pair and the Subaru XV Crosstrek. \nThe Small CUV segment is soaring, gaining 30.4% year-over-year through October to nearly 796,000 units, WardsAuto data shows, making it one of the fastest-growing slices of the automotive market. \nThe Compass hits the U.S. market in first-quarter 2017, but the EcoSport won’t make its debut until 2018. FCA launched Compass production in September at its Goiana assembly plant in Pernambuco, Brazil, but the U.S. model will be built at FCA’s plant in Toluca, Mexico. \nThe U.S.-bound EcoSport will be built at Ford ’s plant in Chennai, India. \nEcoSport powertrains include a 1.0L EcoBoost turbocharged 3-cyl. and a 2.0L naturally aspirated 4-cyl. Final ratings are unavailable for the U.S. powertrains in the EcoSport, but in other applications such as the ’17 Focus the 1.0L produces 123 hp and 125 lb.-ft. (169 Nm) of torque and the 2.0L makes 160 hp and 146 lb.-ft. (198 Nm). Fuel-economy estimates also aren’t available, but combined fuel economy for the 1.5L front-drive EcoSport sold in Europe with a 6-speed automatic is listed at 25 mpg (9.4 L/100 km). \nThe EcoSport headed to the U.S. gets an extensive makeover including a new front fascia, new seats, Sync 3 and optional uplevel B&O Play audio, along with revised suspension for the U.S. market, says Eric Loeffler, chief engineer. An unusual feature carrying over to the U.S. model is the side-hinged swing gate providing access to the rear cargo area. \nFour trim levels will be offered: S, SE, SES and Titanium. The SE is expected to be the volume model while the SES offers an active alternative with a sport-tuned suspension and paddle shifters. \nFord believes the smaller-than-Escape CUV will attract Millennials as well as empty-nest Baby Boomers looking for functionality and capability along with more efficiency and easier parking. \n“These are people interested in bringing in a lot of experiences instead of a lot of things,” says Christina Aquino, marketing manager-small/medium SUVs.",

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport Video Review \nBy Kelsey Mays November 17, 2016 \nCARS.COM — Subcompact SUVs are a hot segment and Ford is finally joining the crowd. The 2018 EcoSport has been on sale in global markets for years and will be available in U.S. dealerships early next year. Shoppers will likely be impressed by the tiny ute's large floating multimedia control panel, but one quirk in back is likely to annoy: The EcoSport has a swing-out tailgate instead of traditional cargo hatch — the setup is not very city-friendly. We checked out the EcoSport at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show ; watch the video for more. \nSenior Consumer Affairs Editor Kelsey Mays likes quality, reliability, safety and practicality. But he also likes a fair price. Start Shopping",

      "text": "\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – Their white Ford truck was stolen, with their two dogs inside and the Albuquerque couple thought they’d never see the duo again.\nKRQE News 13 first told you about Pete and Sue Hedrick’s plea Tuesday night to get their dogs back from thieves.\nSue said it’s common for her two pups, Peña Blanca and Mocha to go to work with her husband. Pete works for Budget Blinds. Tuesday, he was working at a home near Unser and Montono. He left the doors to his truck open, with the two dogs in the back seat.\nPete said he was just about 15 feet from the truck when he looked up and saw thieves taking in it; dogs and all.\n“We were crying and crying and wondering where dogs are were,” Sue said.\nWednesday morning Sue got a call.\n“Both dogs are micro-chipped,” she said. “They told us that our digs had just been turned into a Veterinarian hospital less a mile from our house.”\nSomeone turned the two dogs into one of the VCA Animal Hospital locations in Albuquerque. The clinic said a good Samaritan found Mocha and Peña Blanca wandering in in the Winrock parking lot.\nBoth dogs were found unharmed.\n“I don’t know if maybe they heard the story from the night before and had a change of heart or what but there they were both of our dogs in perfect condition. They weren’t dirty or hurt in anyway,” Sue said.\nThe couple said they filed a police report, but their truck has yet to be found.",

      "text": "Mom Starts Non-Profit Inside Home Where She Found Daughter Dead Hope Ford, WFMY 8:17 PM. EST November 17, 2016 Tristan Thompson's family prays outside of the home where she died. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nTHOMASVILLE, NC –“It’s a nightmare. The day I found my daughter dead, EMS wanted me to do CPR. So, my 16-year-old had to come in and help me flatten her out so I could do CPR. When I turned her over, I’ll never get that image out of my head.” \nHope Thompson’s described the daughter she found her 18-year-old daughter dead of a heroin overdose multiple times to me, Hope Ford, a reporter with WFMY. Each time Hope relives that moment, the heart-wrenching pain on her face is strong and evident. \nWATCH: Mom Relives Nightmare of Finding Daughter Dead \nIt hasn’t been long enough for the Thompson family to heal. At the time I’m writing this article, it’s only been about four months since Hope found Tristan on the bathroom floor in the family guest house. \n“I still come in here and talk to her sometimes,” said Hope, standing inches away from the sink where she found Tristan slumped over. \"Sometimes I'm mad at her and sometimes I just want to tell her what's going on with my day.\" \nHope Thompson stands in the bathroom where she found Tristan. \nBut, Hope, her husband David, oldest daughter Stephanie Lane and Hope's youngest daughter, have been taking action in those four short months; transforming the house where Tristan died, into a safe place for teens struggling with drug addiction. \nIt’s appropriately named, Tristan’s Haven. \nREAD: 3 Moms Shares Stories of Losing Children to Heroin \nHope said, “We wanted Tristan’s death to mean something. I know she would want this.” \nFor at least two months, Tristan’s family, friends and people the Thompson family met after her tragic death, came together to clean the house and help with renovations. \n“We want this house to be a blessing to others,” said David. \nFamily and friends work on Tristan's Haven. \nHope gave me a tour of the house, stopping in the living room to pick up a folder. \n“We’ve got some packets that we’ve started so people can come and get information on where the resources are. We want to focus on ages 11-18.” \nHope Thompson talking with friends about Tristan's Haven. \nA National Institute on Drug Abuse released a study showing 23 percent of 12th graders admit to using illegal drugs. The same study shows in 2013, 13 percent of 8th graders admitted to using drugs at least once. The average 8th grader is 13-years-old. \nThe non-profit aims to educate teens, provide support groups inside the home and act as an emergency shelter for teenagers. \n“This is the bedroom,” said Hope as she continued the tour into what was once Tristan’s bedroom. “We want this to be for the mom and dad to have a place to rest and hopefully we’ll have someone here to help with their child until we can get them a permanent placement. \nTristan's final resting place (Photo: Hope Thompson) \nThose seeking a rehab for their child or teen will be able to stay in the home for three days, while a social worker looks for long-term placement. \n\"They are going to make a huge impact on people in our community that are struggling with addiction,\" said Taylor Greene. \nBradley Greene, Taylor's brother, died in April of 2016 due to a drug overdose. \n\"He struggled with addiction. Not just heroin and it began when he was a teenager. Still to this day, it feels like there is a part of my heart missing,\" said Taylor, who now serves on the board of the Tristan's Haven. \nWhile the non-profit is still in the beginning stages, Hope wants to staff the house with social workers or volunteers. \nTristan Thompson (Photo: Hope Thompson) \nThe Thompson family is still working to get funding but Tristan’s former employer, Legend’s restaurant, donated 600 dollars to the family, which helped start the non-profit. Two months after Tristan’s death, Hope met Louise Vincent during an interview with News 2. Louise runs Urban Survivor’s Union, a safe space for people struggling with addiction. Louise has offered to help Hope write grants to receive funding and help Tristan’s Haven get off the ground. \nA mission statement for non-profit reads most services will be provided for people in Davidson County. The Thompson’s hope to have Tristan’s Haven up and running in 2017. \nCopyright 2016 WFMY ",

      "text": "Western NC High School Football Playoffs On for Friday Despite Wildfires Hope Ford, WFMY 8:09 PM. EST November 17, 2016 NW Guilford Vikings practicing for playoffs. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nGREENSBORO, NC – The North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA) said the High School Football Playoffs will take place in Western North Carolina this weekend despite the wildfires. \nThe association held a conference call on Thursday and issued a statement on the current decision. Athletic leaders consulted with the National Weather Service and local emergency management officials and school leaders. \nThe National Weather Service said the forecast calls for winds that will help disperse some of the smoke where games are being held. \nThe NCHSAA said they will continue to monitor the situation with schools hosting games in affected areas. Eleven Triad high school teams will travel to Western North Carolina on Friday for football playoff games. \nTen of those teams will play in areas affected by raging wildfires. \nThe NCHSAA released the following statement: \n\"With widespread wildfires and smoke in several areas of Western North Carolina, many of you have inquired about the football playoffs scheduled to begin on Friday night across the state. All games are still on as originally scheduled. After consulting with experts at the National Weather Service as well as local emergency management officials and local school personnel at affected member schools, the decision to proceed as planned was affirmed. The forecast calls for winds that experts say will help disperse some of the smoke in the area tomorrow. Commissioner Que Tucker had a conference call this afternoon with involved parties and announced the decision to move forward as planned. The NCHSAA will of course continue to monitor the situation and remain in contact with schools hosting games in the affected areas. If any unexpected adjustments need to be made, we will keep you apprised of those decisions.\" James Alverson \nUnless noted, all kickoffs are at 7:30 p.m. Friday’s games \nNo. 5 NORTH DAVIDSON (7-4) at No. 4 ROBERSON (8-3) \nThe winner plays: No. 8 Harding (5-6) or No. 1 East Forsyth (10-1). Last playoff win for Roberson: 2007. Notes: Homefield advantage for a first-round playoff game has been a given for Roberson in the Mountain Athletic Conference 4-A division. This year, it feels like a just dessert for the biggest turnaround in Buncombe County football. Shrine Bowl lineman DayQuan Watkins lays down blocks for Ty Gossett (2,170 yards and 18 touchdowns with 15 interceptions), who has completed 72 combined passes to Micah Jenkins (41 receptions for 644 yards and four touchdowns) and Barshia Young (31 receptions for 541 yards and six touchdowns). LeJuan Rush (416 yards, eight touchdowns) gains 6.5 yards a carry. Logan Wells (192 tackles), Greg Johnston (113) and Jordan McNeill (93) fortify things on the other side of the ball. North Davidson averages 454.8 yards a game with such playmakers as Joe Butts (2,952 yards and 34 touchdowns with 10 interceptions) and T.J. Boyce (1,482 yards, 13 touchdowns) and Zi Russell (54 receptions for 998 yards and 11 touchdowns). \n3-AA \nNo. 8 CENTRAL CABARRUS (5-6) at No. 1 REYNOLDS (9-2) \nThe winner plays: No. 5 Erwin (6-5) or No. 4 Sun Valley (8-3). Last playoff win for Reynolds: 2015. Notes: Be careful what you wish for. Opposing teams were more than ready to see Rico Dowdle graduate after he scored a WNC-record 63 touchdowns for Reynolds in 2015. Shutting down the Rockets offense isn’t as simple as stopping one player this season. Nathan St. Onge (1,259 passing yards, 936 rushing yards and 25 combined touchdowns) has come into his own at quarterback with Rmani Lynch (36 receptions for 485 yards and five touchdowns), Keyal Talbert (29 receptions for 390 yards and one touchdown) and Kaedin Robinson (25 receptions for 450 yards and seven touchdowns) running routes for him. Talbert (647 yards, eight touchdowns) and Sean Jones (638 yards, nine touchdowns) have lent ground support. Finally, the two-time defending Mountain Athletic Conference 3-A champions have been led in tackles by Frank Torres (123), Conor Sullivan (101) and Charlie Lehman (94). Central Cabarrus is coached by Donnie Kiefer, who resigned from Tuscola in 2012 after going 39-24-1 record in five seasons with the Mountaineers. He was also previously the coach at Andrews. \nNo. 7 POLK COUNTY (5-6) at No. 2 SURRY CENTRAL (10-1) The winner plays: No. 6 Lexington (5-5) or No. 3 Hendersonville (8-3). Last playoff win for Polk County: 2014. Notes: Don’t get used to it. Uncharacteristically, Polk County struggled to compete with the upper-echelon teams in the Western Highlands Conference this season, losing to Hendersonville, Mitchell and Mountain Heritage all by double digits. The Wolverines can feel good about the future with junior Dillon Overholt at quarterback. He threw his sixth touchdown of the season to Jaymes Wingo in a 52-13 loss at Hendersonville on Nov. 4. Surry Central is the Western Piedmont Conference champion and enters the postseason with a six-game winning streak. The Golden Eagles brought back 18 starters from last year’s 4-7 squad. \n2-A No. 6 LEXINGTON (5-5) at No. 3 HENDERSONVILLE (8-3) The winner plays: No. 7 Polk County (5-6) or No. 2 Surry Central (10-1). Last playoff win for Hendersonville: 2015. Notes: Replacing the top passer in school history is nowhere near as easy as Alex Williford has made it look. Williford took the reins of the Hendersonville offense after Michael Schmidt (6,923 yards) graduated and went on to Air Force. The Bearcats haven’t missed a beat with Williford (2,386 yards and 26 touchdowns with 14 interceptions) slinging the ball around to fellow junior Tykel Landrum (69 receptions for 1,188 yards) as well as seniors Leon Cooks (40 receptions for 775 yards and 11 touchdowns) and Demetrius Smith (25 receptions for 200 yards and two touchdowns). Ty’rese Hunt (688 yards, 12 touchdowns) is only a sophomore. Shaq Rospel (7.6 tackles a game) and Jhon Salguero (7.1) both average more than seven tackles a night. Kicker Drew Eudy has made all seven of his field-goal attempts with a long of 37 yards. Lexington quarterback Saafir Craven (1,649 passing yards, 580 rushing yards and 21 combined touchdowns) is a two-way threat for the Yellow Jackets. \nNo. 8 MADISON (5-6) at No. 1 REIDSVILLE (11-0) The winner plays: No. 5 West Stanly (7-4) or No. 4 Mountain Heritage (10-1). Last playoff win for Madison: 2012. Notes: First-year coach Ben Rhodarmer and Madison are on the right track. Unfortunately, that track leads to top-seeded Reidsville on Friday. The unbeaten Rams were third in the season’s final Associated Press poll for NCHSAA 2-A. Rhodarmer’s team is back in the state playoffs for first time since 2013 and will try to pull an upset with the varied skill set of senior Colby Edwards (1,868 passing yards, 1,132 rushing yards and 33 combined touchdowns). His favorite receivers have been Dawson Coates (60 receptions for 740 yards and eight touchdowns) and Elan Littrell (50 receptions for 654 yards and two touchdowns). Ty Snelson (550 yards, six touchdowns) is another productive back in the Patriots’ offense. On the other side of the ball, Madison is led by Logan Roberts (10.5 tackles a game), Dakota Surrett (9.3), Keegan Foley (8.7) and Austin Shelton (8.7). \nNo. 7 WINSTON-SALEM CARVER (5-6) at No. 2 BREVARD (9-2) The winner plays: No. 6 North Wilkes (7-4) or No. 3 North Rowan (9-2). Last playoff win for Brevard: 2007. Notes: Flip the script? Brevard and Tanner Ellenberger (1,811 passing yards, 565 rushing yards and 38 combined touchdowns) were a 2-9 team a year ago. The co-WNC Athletic Conference champions are back in the state playoffs for the first time in three years thanks to Ellenberger as well as Tanner Pettit (926 yards, six touchdowns), Ari Williams (37 receptions for 725 yards and 12 touchdowns) and Jesse Lowery (21 receptions for 264 yards and five touchdowns). The defense has fed off of Ethan Shook (12.5 tackles a game), Pettit (7.9) and Estevian Benjamin (7.2). Carver enters the postseason with a four-game winning streak but lost 34-12 at Asheville High on Sept. 23. \nNo. 5 ROBBINSVILLE (4-6) at No. 4 WINSTON-SALEM PREP (4-6) The winner plays: No. 8 South Robeson (2-9) or No. 1 Murphy (10-1). Last playoff win for Robbinsville: 2015. Notes: Facts are facts. Two-time defending 1-A Western Regional champion Robbinsville is still that until someone else hoists the trophy next month. The Black Knights will try to make some noise in this postseason with the rushing of Ian Wiggins (658 yards, two touchdowns) and Colby Hemphill (625 yards, seven touchdowns). Robbinsville was without Alex Bridges (668 yards and eight touchdowns with five interceptions) for its last game – 14-0 loss on Nov. 4 at Swain County. Leading tackler Elijah Wachacha (8.1 a game) stood in at quarterback that evening. Winston-Salem Prep has been outscored 267-155 this season and one of its wins was a forfeit (Oct. 21 over North Stokes). \nNo. 7 ANDREWS (2-9) at No. 2 MOUNTAIN ISLAND CHARTER (8-3) The winner plays: No. 6 Bishop McGuinness (4-7) or No. 3 Thomas Jefferson (9-2). Last playoff win for Andrews: 2015. Notes: All in? Yes. All seven teams in the Smoky Mountain Conference are playoff bound despite it being a down year for the league – only Murphy (10-1) and Cherokee (7-4) have winning records. Andrews won its two games (Rosman and Tellico Plains, Tenn.,) for first-year coach James Phillips by single digits. The Wildcats will obviously be looking for No. 3 behind Matt Barton (413 yards and one touchdown with seven interceptions), Andrew Horton (356 rushing yards) and Cody Mathis (15 receptions for 145 yards). Mountain Island Charter forfeited two wins a week ago due to an ineligible player – 31-13 over Thomas Jefferson on Sept. 2 and 48-20 over Pine Lake Prep on Sept. 16. \nNo. 6 HAYESVILLE (2-8) at No. 3 ALLEGHANY (5-6) The winner plays: No. 7 Chatham Central (3-8) or No. 2 Mitchell (10-1). Last playoff win for Hayesville: 2013. Notes: No more Smoky Mountain Conference tournament? SMC coaches have bemoaned the fact that there have been so many rematches in the playoffs between their teams in recent years. No team knows that better than Hayesville – the Yellow Jackets have played eight such games since 2010 and this is their first non-SMC opponent since 2009. Sophomore Alan Gillis (987 passing yards, 734 rushing yards and 18 combined touchdowns) has been a bright spot for rookie coach Kenneth Dockery. Payton Krieger (27 receptions for 365 yards and three touchdowns) is the only Hayesville receiver who has played in all 10 of its games. Likewise, Thomas Cothren has made a team-high 69 tackles and started all season long. Devin Boykin has 65. Alleghany’s Tristen Villarruel (1,120 yards, 14 touchdowns) hasn’t played since Oct. 14, leaving Brett Pope (944 yards and six touchdowns with eight interceptions) and the rest of the offense to pick up the slack. \nNo. 2 CHRIST SCHOOL (10-1) at No. 1 HIGH POINT CHRISTIAN (9-1), 7 p.m . How they got here: Christ School beat SouthLake Christian by forfeit and Ravenscroft, 34-16; High Point Christian beat North Raleigh Christian, 49-0 and Cannon School, 25-0. Notes: Christ School coach Mark Moroz is only mildly joking when he says he’d put his defense up against the Carolina Panthers right now. Junior linebacker Seth Griswold (530 career tackles) is averaging a team-high 10.6 a game this fall. Griswold began his career at Roberson and made 162 tackles for the Rams as a junior, 132 as a sophomore and 130 as a freshman. Griswold reclassified with the transfer to an NCISAA school. Some of his teammates are Carson Jones (85 tackles) and Sage Holley (80). Drew Johnson has thrown for a career-high 2,520 yards and 32 touchdowns and four interceptions with the help of Keyvaun Cobb (58 receptions for 710 yards and 10 touchdowns), Jared Letman-Gash (36 receptions for 505 yards and 13 touchdowns), Gabe Blevins (33 receptions for 488 yards and four touchdowns), Kokayi Cobb (23 receptions for 510 yards and one touchdown), Tyler Redmond (21 receptions for 342 yards and five touchdowns) and Kevin Snyder (17 receptions for 146 yards). Christ School has been playing football for 101 years and is 0-for-5 in all-time state championship appearances. High Point Christian and Copeland Petitfils (15.9 tackles per game) have not allowed any points in the NCISAA playoffs. Senior De’shaun Taylor (1,228 yards and 15 touchdowns with six interceptions) is a 1,000-yard passer. \n\nStay on top of News, Weather, Sports by downloading WFMY News 2 apps or signing up for our text alerts.

      "text": "Iconic Le Mans-Winning 1966 Ford GT40 Stuns In LA | By Share Alongside the current Ford GT GTE race car, a particularly special Ford GT40 is on display at the Los Angeles Auto Show . This GT40 is owned by RK Motors Charlotte and was recently restored by Rare Driver, making its public debut at August’s Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. The car is a true icon for the American automaker as it claimed an historic victory at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours. Given how priceless it is, it is fitting that the restoration took 20 months and almost 4,000 hours to complete. Rather than making the vehicle absolutely pristine and faultless, the restoration has actually perfectly mimicked how the car was first produced, complete with all its little faults. That includes the unequal length exhaust pipes and the dripping paint the car had in the mid-1960s. In a flood of impressive new concepts and production vehicles, it is refreshing to see such a motoring icon in LA. PHOTO GALLERY",

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo \nWASHINGTON U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Chairman Bill Ford had just told him the automaker had decided not to move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump said on Twitter. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Sandra Maler) Next In Politics Ohio congressman Ryan challenges Pelosi for House Democratic leader \nWASHINGTON U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on Thursday he was challenging House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who has led the party in the chamber for 14 years, as Democrats question their strategy and leadership after a stinging general election defeat. Japan's Abe says after meeting with Trump that he is confident of building trust \nNEW YORK Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday he was confident of building trust with Donald Trump following a meeting in which he sought clarity on campaign rhetoric from the U.S. president-elect that cast doubt on long-standing U.S. alliances. \nWASHINGTON The U.S. Congress could as soon as January start to dismantle President Barack Obama's transformation of student loan rules by blocking freshly minted regulations designed to help students who say they were defrauded by for-profit colleges.
