      "text": "| 0 Comments \nOnline e-commerce giants Amazon India and Flipkart were neck and neck in terms of ranking, with the latter a few points ahead in RedSeer Consulting’s E-tailing Leadership Index (ELI). \nOn overall rankings for October 2016, Flipkart was placed at 97, while Amazon India came in at 94. \nAmazon India lost out to Flipkart as the most trusted brand garnering a ranking of 21 versus the latter’s 23. However, both scored equally on best value and buying experience—25 and 49. \nAmazon India has gained thanks to high marketing spend, while Flipkart benefitted from its already strong position as the top e-commerce player. \nAmazon’s founder and CEO Jeff Bezos had committed $3 billion into India operations, taking the global e-commerce firm’s total investment in the country to $5 billion. Amit Agarwal, Amazon India’ head, has stated that the Amazon Prime membership programme was the top seller in October and the firm saw its sales increase by 2.7 times during the Diwali sale versus the same period the previous year. The company even put in Rs 7,463 crore in 2015-16 into Amazon Seller Services, as compared to the investment in FY 2014-15, which was at Rs 1,888 crore. \nDuring its Big Billion Days sale, Flipkart sold more units, 15.5 million as compared to Amazon India, which sold 15 million units during its five-day Great Indian Festival; however, the difference is marginal. Snapdeal sold 11 million units during its Unbox Diwali Sale. \nThe NPS (net promoter score) metric for the current quarter, 25%, was an improvement over previous quarters, 29% in Q2 and 17%, Q1, thanks to the festive sales. However, increased customer expectations impacted the metric. \nNPS refers to the likelihood of a customer recommending the services or products of a company to others. This is determined on the basis of customer satisfaction and loyalty to a brand. \nPaytm followed Flipkart and Amazon with an overall ranking of 75 for the quarter ended September 2016 and a ranking of 71 for the month. The company has seen significant gains in the current quarter thanks to improved overall experience and marginal gain in NPS. \nSnapdeal was close on the heels of Paytm with a Q3 ranking of 74 and a monthly ranking of 75. While Snapdeal came ahead of Paytm on most trusted brand (10 versus 7), it fell behind the wallets firm on buying experience (40 versus 44). However, the two scored equally on best value (24). \nShopclues received an overall Q3 ranking of 58 and was ranked 59 for October 2016. The unicorn firm came ahead of eBay, which was ranked 56 for the quarter and 55 for the month. Both firms have maintained their previous positions. While Shopclues gained from enhanced post-delivery experience, it suffered on brand recall. eBay saw its NPS improve, but its buyer experience declined. \nShopclues became a unicorn earlier this year after it secured Series E funding led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pvt Ltd. In an interaction with Techcircle, ShopClues co-founder and chief executive Sanjay Sethi said that the e-commerce firm will attain EBIDTA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) profitability in the second quarter of next year thanks to higher margins, increasing demand, larger pool of merchants and affordable price points. \nRedSeer’s E-tailing Leadership Index measures an e-tailer’s overall performance on the basis of customer satisfaction. The metrics on which this is based are most trusted brand, best value and buying experience. The most trusted brand is based on a brand’s recall frequency, and best value refers to price competitiveness, quality, variety and availability of products; buying experience was measured on the basis of an e-tailer’s delivery service, exploring and ordering experience on the website and app, post-delivery experience of consumer and overall NPS. \nThe survey was conducted across 30 cities (Metros, Tier I and Tier II) on 6,000 customers between August and October 2016. All respondents were e-commerce customers who made purchases in the last three months. \nLike this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.",

      "text": "  This may be last minute, but I think we’ve found the Cyber Monday deal of the day over at Amazon. The <a href=\"/tag/onhub\"><strong>ASUS OnHub</strong></a>, Google’s Nexus-like take on a WiFi router that likely helped birth the idea behind Google WiFi, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asus-Onhub-Dual-band-wireless-AC1900-router/dp/B017C0HZEO/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1480396047&sr=1-2&keywords=onhub\" target=\"_blank\">can be yours for just $89.99</a>. That’s $110 off.\nWhat is OnHub? It really is like the Nexus of routers in that Google created this smart WiFi platform, but had other people build the hardware. In this case, it was ASUS, but TP-Link also created one for Google. These routers are controlled via app, are dead simple in terms of control and setup, offer help and solutions when thinks get wonky with your internet, get smarter with automatic software updates, can automate parts of your home through IFTTT, and will work with Google WiFi units to turn your home into the ultimate mesh WiFi network. <span id=\"more-194163\"></span>\nIf you are in need of a modern router that will get better through software updates and by being expandable with Google WiFi, this is a great deal. In fact, this should almost be your Google WiFi network starting point, since at $90, it’s cheaper than a single Google WiFi unit ($129). OnHub routers can also act as WiFi points to create a Google WiFi-like mesh network (by December 9, Google says). The full details on that can be found <a href=\"https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/7168220\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\nYou better hurry.\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asus-Onhub-Dual-band-wireless-AC1900-router/dp/B017C0HZEO/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1480396047&sr=1-2&keywords=onhub\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Link</a>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Cheers Marco!</em></h6> </div>",

      "text": "Amazon's New Xbox One Discounts Are $38-$45 Better Than Black Friday By Aadil | Nov 29, 2016 12:36 AM   Chesnot/Getty Images) Children play the video game 'Minecraft' on Microsoft Xbox One console during the 'Paris Games Week'on October 27, 2016 in Paris, France. \nOn the auspicious occasion of Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday , Amazon made a fortune with totals up to about $771 Million in revenue combining all major eCommerce websites and other retail chains. Especially on Amazon which saw millions of orders being placed by people and hence, Amazon regarded the Thanksgiving day as the busiest shopping days in the United States. Amazon is back with Cyber Monday 2016 Deals. Advertisement During Black Friday deals at Amazon, a great volume of traffic flowed from across the United States making Amazon as one of the major e-commerce websites. On the other hand, Amazon furnish thousand of offers to attract more people to buy stuff and which actually worked and Black Friday was made a hot topic almost instantly with shopping crossing all earlier records. Last Black Friday , Amazon offered 500GB Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle at $249.00 and Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Bundle was being sold at $299 which is one of the most lowest price quoted by any other retail website in the United States. However, with the commencement of Cyber Monday, Amazon has literally dragged the prices so low that traffic for Xbox One S consoles has magnified over the course of few hours. Advertisement Amazon marked the Cyber Monday 2016 as per which it is offering Microsoft Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Bundle at a mind-boggling $212 which is $38 less than Black Friday and similarly the price for Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Bundle is $255 which is $45 less than Black Friday sale. That's not all. Apart from the Microsoft's $50 discount by purchasing any of the Microsoft Xbox S consoles, the customers will get $25 gift card and bonus game offer which is fairly the best deal one could get online. \nThe only backlog is the scope for selection of preferred games which is limited, however, games like Far Cry Primal and Forza Horizon 2 are available with the bundle. Buy Microsoft Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Bundle at $212 and Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Bundle at $255 only on Amazon . Advertisement © 2016 Mstars News, All rights reserved.

      "text": "World | Spencer Soper, Bloomberg | Updated: November 29, 2016 11:40 IST EMAIL COMMENTS The Amazon corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. (File Photo) An Amazon.com Inc. employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company's Seattle headquarters in what police characterized as a suicide attempt.The man, who wasn't identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon's 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said.The man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn't improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon's headquarters.\"Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"He's receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.\"In the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person.Suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company.ÂŠ 2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Amazon’s Battle with Fake Reviews & Counterfeit Products November 28, 2016 6:00pm by Barry Ritholtz \nBloomberg : \nThe world’s biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon’s lack of control over fakes, the person said.",

      "title": "Amazon employee reportedly injured after jumping off company building in Seattle",
      "text": "An Amazon employee was injured after he reportedly jumped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters campus Monday morning.\nThe Seattle Fire Department told SeattlePI.com that the man leapt from a rooftop about four stories high at the 12-story Apollo building at Ninth Avenue North and Thomas Street, and he fell about 20 feet to a balcony below. He was taken to Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center with non life-threatening injuries.\n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon told GeekWire in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.”\nCiting an anonymous source, Bloomberg reported that the man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but he was put on an employee improvement plan. These plans can put employees at risk of termination if they don’t improve performance. The source told Bloomberg that the man sent an email visible to many in the company, including CEO Jeff Bezos, where he criticized how Amazon dealt with his transfer request. In the message, the man reportedly hinted that he might harm himself.\nAmazon’s culture was put under a microscope last year, when the New York Times published a controversial report depicting the company as a “bruising workplace.” Amazon has since refuted many of the allegations in the report, and the company has been working to further improve its workplace culture in a bid to recruit and retain top tech talent.\nAmazon is significantly changing how it assesses the performance of its employees each year — shaking up a tradition that emerged as an emblem of the technology giant’s exacting standards and hard-charging workplace. The new performance review program, which will go into effect next year, will be “radically simplified and focuses on our employees’ strengths, not the absence of weaknesses,” Amazon said in a statement earlier this month.\nLast fall, the company expanded its parental leave benefits , which had been another target of criticism at the company. This summer, Amazon began testing a new program that creates technical teams consisting entirely of part-time employees who are still eligible for the same benefits as Amazon’s full-time employees.",

      "text": "Amazon Gets Real About Fake Products on Its Marketplace Spencer Soper Nov 29, 2016 1:37 am ET (Bloomberg) -- Randy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System-- an exercise kit of suspension straps-- on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal. But new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, \"We realized this was an epidemic,\" said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales. Amazon's Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences. Amazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action. It's the subject of the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast (subscribe here on iTunes). SoundCloud: The Fake Reviews and Counterfeits That Amazon's Trying to Quash by Bloomberg Now, the world's biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon's lack of control over fakes, the person said. “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" Amazon said in a statement. The company said it was \"aggressively pursuing bad actors.\" In a statement, the MLB said: “It is our responsibility to provide our fans with reliable and secure marketplaces to purchase officially licensed merchandise. Given the rampant growth of online-only retailers supplying counterfeit merchandise, our policies must hold every distribution partner to that same level of commitment.” The NFL declined to comment. The new Amazon teams will encourage brands -- even those that don't sell on Amazon -- to register with the online store, the person said. Once registered, Amazon requires any marketplace merchants listing those products to prove that they have the brand's permission to sell them online. Amazon began experimenting with the registry earlier this year with Nike and other companies. The bigger push in 2017 will target thousands of large companies, including those that have been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of knock-offs. In addition, this month Amazon teamed up with Hetrick's business to sue three people, accusing them of selling fakes on its site. It filed another similar suit the same day against an alleged counterfeit ring. Moving the battle to a courtroom is an acknowledgment that despite spending tens of millions of dollars a year and employing an army of software engineers, investigators and research scientists tasked with fighting copycats, Amazon is not winning the war against counterfeiters. \"The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,\" said Hetrick, who is encouraged by Amazon's new vigilance. \"You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm for these shysters selling illegal goods.\" Amazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they're detected, and then vanish. Amazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late. The shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it's tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba and Ebay are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5 percent, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies. Despite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products -- some of them unsafe -- on Amazon. \"Online counterfeiting is never going to go down,\" said Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations at NetNames, which helps brands identify marketplaces and websites where counterfeit products are sold. \"Amazon is the most trusted marketplace in the world. That in and of itself attracts this nefarious element because they know shoppers go there and trust what they are buying is genuine.\" Bret Rosenzweig is another inventor who has felt the sting of counterfeits on Amazon. His company, DC Innovations, makes the Urban Shelf, a collapsible plastic nightstand that wedges between a mattress and box spring. Bachelors and college students are the target market, and Amazon was the perfect place to introduce the product to the masses in 2009. Once his sales on Amazon started picking up around 2015, counterfeiters took notice, mimicked the design with cheaper materials and offered it for less. That's a double-blow to Rosenzweig, who loses a sale and now has a potential customer unimpressed with his brand (or what the customer thinks is his brand). Rosenzweig checks Amazon each day, scouring the marketplace for counterfeiters selling his product. The process of reporting the fakes to Amazon has been a time-suck. He spots a knock-off, buys the item and when he receives it, he takes photos and submits a report to Amazon. The company is usually quick about suspending the counterfeiters, but new accounts quickly spring up in their place and the game of whack-a-mole continues, Rosenzweig said. He can no longer order phony items to his home address because his adversaries know he is conducting a test purchase, so he has his business partner order them. Rosenzweig said he’d welcome any new effort from Amazon to crack down. \"Buying the fakes and reporting them is a waste of my time,\" he said. Amazon, EBay and Alibaba are largely shielded from legal liability as long as they have processes in place for brands to report fake goods and take timely action to suspend their sale once notified. The online marketplaces often don’t have the inventory, so there is nothing to seize. The result is an endless loop with brands buying and reporting fakes, marketplaces suspending accounts, and the fraudsters creating new accounts to hawk the same fake goods under new pseudonyms. EBay lets registered brand owners report suspected counterfeit listings for removal, as does Alibaba. But the retailers can only do so much. Shoppers worried about buying fakes during the holidays have to bear some responsibility, said Akino Chikada, senior brand protection manager at the firm MarkMonitor, which helps brands find online sources of counterfeits. She suggests looking closely at web addresses for subtle variations from brand names and probing websites for sloppy privacy and return policies, which can signal a phony. Bargain basement prices are another tell-tale sign, though sophisticated counterfeiters try to make the price difference less suspicious by coming in at 10 or 20 percent below other offers rather than half price, she said. \"Counterfeiters do a good job mimicking the look and feel of a brand,\" she said. \"It's so easy for people, in just a few clicks, to unknowingly buy counterfeit goods.\" Want more stories like this every week?

I like that it's less conspicuous than the larger Echo. As far as sound, of course it doesn't sound nearly as good as the Echo but it works well for hearing Alexa's voice. I use it with my Samsung SmartThings Hub along with my Nest and Logitech Harmony Home Hub. All these work together quite well for home automation. I can control a bunch of devices in my house just by talking to Alexa. \nBy Joe, on November 25, 2016 There are times when Alexa surprises me, and I think to myself, \"Best Purchase Ever.\" However, there are so many minute things that annoy me, where I think that it's a piece of junk. One thing that happened recently was that it wasn't responding to setting an alarm, and I have done this many times. The Echo Dot would light up, but do nothing. I have noticed this multiple times. Nothing a good unplugging and plugging back in would fix, but it has come to the point that I have to do this every few days, and I shouldn't have to (I've only had this for about a month). \nFor more information, please visit http://hd24tv.com/ \nContact Info:",

The pants have a elastic-free high-waist design that make them very comfortable to wear. They are made of 79% recycled P.E.T bottles and 21% Spandex. \nLos Angeles, United States - November 28, 2016 /PressCable/ — \nElektrix Love announces the launch of their line of Voltage Pants on Amazon. The line consists of breathable yoga pants and the entire catalog is available at the e-retail site. The pants are made in the USA and conform to high standards of quality and comfort. \nFor more information, visit the Amazon link at https://www.amazon.com/Eco-Friendly-Yoga-Pants-Breathable-Athletic/dp/B01MXIOIXW \nYoga and exercise pants need to deliver very high standards as they are put through a lot of wear and tear on a daily basis. The fabric must absorb sweat while drying quickly at the same time. The style must not pinch, sag or bunch up anywhere, causing the wearer to be distracted from the workout. \nElektrix Love’s new range of yoga pants is made of 79% recycled P.E.T bottles, in Southern California. The remaining 21% is made of high-quality Spandex. This combination makes the fabric very quick drying and stretchable with a 4-way stretch feature. The waistband is elastic-free and the gusset at the crotch adds more freedom of movement to even the most difficult yoga poses. \nThe pants have a high waist design which will not slip and provides a flattering and contouring fit. They have flatlock stitching which makes them durable and prevents chafing against the skin. The unusual combination of materials gives the pants a silky and expensive-looking finish which is not shiny and synthetic in appearance. They keep the wearer warm in winter and cool in summer. \nAlthough the pants are high-waist, they are long enough for tall women and girls. They are available in a range of bright and edgy designs. Elektrix Love’s pants can also be worn on casual trips outdoors or to dance parties. The Elektrix Love eco-friendly yoga pants are available in a range of sizes and can be washed in the machine, in a cold cycle and hung to dry.

      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 21:01 PM EST Dog Treats from Nootie Average 5 Stars on Amazon \n​Nootie is pleased to announce that they have achieved an average rating of 5 stars for their dog treats on Amazon. \nJersey City, United States - November 28, 2016 /PressCable/ — \nNootie is pleased to announce that they have achieved an average rating of 5 stars for their dog treats on Amazon. \n“We threw a party as soon as we heard,” comments a Nootie representative. “We wanted to celebrate such a momentous occasion. The Nootie Progility Hip And Joint Supplement For Dogs was created by our team of experts, and the results have been amazing. The team is very excited to be able to create a better quality of life for dogs that have mobility issues, as well as senior dogs who need some extra nutrients.” \nCurrently these dog supplements are one of the few on the market that contain hyaluronic acid. Typically used by humans, Nootie decided to expand their product line and create a dog product with hyaluronic acid and pet owners are rejoicing about how well the product works. \nOne happy consumer writes, “I have seen a vast improvement in my 15 year old dog while she has been taking Progility Chewable Hip and Joint Supplement. My old girl has a very hard time getting up and down, but it has become much easier with the use of this supplement. I accidentally forgot to give it to her one day and noticed by just missing that one day she struggled more to move. It was so obvious the change that that is when I realized I had forgotten to give it to her. I plan on continuing to use this supplement for my old girl and will order more when the time comes.” \nAnother customer wrote, “I have a 4 year old Great Dane that I rescued and I wanted to try this product because she is getting up there in years for a great dane and they are know to have hip/joint issues due to their size. I have been using this product daily and my first observation is that she takes it willingly and loves the taste. She even thinks it is a treat. Other supplements I have tried she would spit out and not want to take, so the ease of use is really amazing. After a few weeks on the supplements I have noticed an improvement in her walk and she enjoys going for walks with the family. I really feel she is getting benefits from this supplement and I will continue to use it with her.” \nThose interested in seeing more information can visit http://www.amazon.com/dog-treats/dp/b01g7gyagk/ . \nFor more information, please visit http://www.nootie.com \nContact Info:",

      "text": "Amazon imposes limits on reviews  04 am Online marketplace Amazon has placed a limit on the number of reviews shoppers can leave on the site. \nIn a bid to put a stop to false feedback, people can now write only five reviews a week of items not bought via the online store. \nThe change applies to most products and is part of efforts to clamp down on people selling positive comments. \nThe change is Amazon’s latest step in its battle to ensure users trust its listings. \nEarlier this year, Amazon began suing sellers for buying fake reviews and then imposed tougher restrictions on companies that offered free products in return for customers’ ratings. \nUsers can still review as many items as they like if the goods are purchased via the website. \n“The change makes a lot of sense. There has been a massive clampdown on fake, bogus and heavily influenced reviews recently,” said Patrick O’Brien, retail analyst at Verdict Retail. \nIn October, Amazon announced the end of ”incentivised reviews”. \nWhile direct compensation for reviews had never been allowed, there was an exception – reviewers could until last month post a review in exchange for a “free or discounted product as long as they disclosed that fact”, according to Amazon’s website. \nNow, that has changed. Such reviews can appear on the site only via Amazon’s own program, Vine. \nFive’s the limit \nAmazon published its updated rules in its Customer Service section. \n“You can submit five non-Amazon verified purchase reviews each week, starting on Sunday,” it says. \nAmazon also reserves the right to restrict reviews of certain products to users who have bought it via the site if “unusually high numbers” of reviews are submitted in a short period of time. \n“Amazon’s review system is very impressive in terms of the volume of reviews there, it’s far superior to those of competitors,” said Mr O’Brien. \n“The new rules will make it very difficult for people who are trying to make money by selling fake reviews. It does show Amazon is taking this matter seriously.” \nThe new rules will not apply to books. \n–",

      "text": "Anti-Trump trolls take aim at Amazon on Cyber Monday CNBC 2 hrs ago Ari Levy Shoppers run to Amazon for holiday shopping CNBC See Donald Trump supporters perusing Amazon.com (AMZN) for \"Make America Great Again\" holiday ornaments will encounter some not-so-great reviews on Cyber Monday.\nThey're jokes, for the most part. But they hurt a product's rating.\nFor example, a Christmas tree ornament from FunnyShirts.org promoting Trump's iconic slogan has a two-star rating out of a possible five, thanks to 90 one-star reviews left during the preceding five days. Some comments with respect to the president-elect are far too offensive for print.\nHere are some of the safer nonreviews:\n\"As soon as I hung it on my tree, it started insulting all the other ornaments,\" wrote one critic.\n\" My Christmas tree is leaning far, far to the right, to the point of tipping over and self-destructing,\" according to another commenter.\nAnd yet another added, \" Turns orange the higher you put it on the tree.\"\n© Provided by CNBC\nNone of the 119 reviews is marked \"verified purchase,\" meaning Amazon can't confirm that the person writing the review bought the item on the site. Unverified reviews are still posted because Amazon assumes that reviews of items purchased elsewhere have value to consumers.\n\"We feel like we make a great product, so it's frustrating to have negative reviews when people clearly haven't even seen the item,\" said Jeff Benzenberg, director of new development at eRetailing, which owns FunnyShirts.org .\nBenzenberg isn't asking that the reviews be removed — he even finds some of them funny — but he wants Amazon to somehow note that they may be left by pranksters. More importantly, he'd like to see the two-star overall rating removed from the results page.\nIt's not all bad for Trump gear. Fans shopping for the president-elect's signature red hat or a campaign T-shirt will still find plenty of positive reviews.\nAn Amazon representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Cyber Monday pranks represent just another chapter in the bizarre relationship between Trump and the e-commerce giant.\nTrump took several jabs at Amazon while on the campaign trail, claiming that the company is a monopoly, doesn't pay its fair share of taxes and would have \"such problems\" in a Trump presidency. He also said that CEO Jeff Bezos , who owns The Washington Post , uses losses from the newspaper to create a tax shelter for Amazon.\nBezos tweeted a reply to Trump in December, telling the then-candidate that he'd save him a seat on his rocket to space.\nFinally trashed by @realDonaldTrump . Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015 Following Trump's victory, Bezos sent a congratulatory tweet and offered the president-elect his \"most open mind.\"\nCritics on Amazon are taking a different approach.\nAmong the holiday items the Trump store is selling on Amazon is a red Christmas ornament emblazoned with the Make America Great Again slogan. The product has a rating of 1.5 stars, including 81 one-star reviews left during the past six days.\nOne reviewer even found a way to reference Trump's criticism of how Vice President-elect Mike Pence was treated at a recent Broadway performance of \"Hamilton.\"\n\"This ornament keeps tweeting at 3 a.m., demanding apologies from the casts of various Broadway musicals.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg   4:28   \nSEATTLE (Nov 29): An Amazon.com Inc employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police characterized as a suicide attempt. \nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-storey Apollo building at about 8.45am local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon’s headquarters. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nIn the email, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person. \nSuicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the US in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead.

      "text": "How to Get Free Stuff as an Amazon Reviewer November 28, 2016 Via @fredasphotos , @thechocolatepriestess , @shawzborne \nWait, what? Amazon will send me free products to review? \nSelectively, yes. In 2007, Amazon launched Amazon Vine as an internal service allowing vendors to solicit honest reviews from consumers–and Amazon acts as the go-between so things don’t get all awkward. \nWhy would Amazon do that? \nBasically, reading reviews has become the main deciding factor for online purchases. If a product lacks reviews on Amazon, most people will shy away from it. \nSo, to increase reviews, companies say, “Hey Amazon, I’ll give out 100 free products to 100 people who have a history of writing solid reviews.” Then Amazon holds up those 100 free products and asks their Vine community (made up of seriously dedicated reviewers) to call dibs. Reviewers jump at the chance to review the product because they get to keep it. \nSo, here are answers to all your questions about Amazon Vine : \n1. Where do I sign up? \nIt’s a little more complex than simply singing up, but I’ll explain how to give yourself the best chance of becoming an Amazon Vine Voice . If you want to start collecting freebies of your choosing straight from Amazon, you’ll have to do a bit of work and send good vibes out to the almighty Amazon Vine god because this program is by invitation only. \n2. How do I get an invite? \nIn short, become a good reviewer! \nVine members are invited based on the quality (not necessarily quantity) of their Amazon reviews. Each review on Amazon receives a ranking based on how helpful it is to other buyers. \nIf you are consistently posting helpful, substantial, detailed reviews of Amazon products that are ranked as “highly helpful” by other shoppers, you could be chosen. \nSet a goal to land on Amazon’s top 10,000 reviewer list . The list shows that many top reviewers have only posted 100-200 reviews (some have hundreds more), but those reviews have rendered thousands of “helpful review” votes. Again, quality over quantity here is key. \nExpertise in a certain product category may render an invitation faster. For example, if you have better-than-average knowledge in photography equipment, and your reviews reflect that, you may receive a higher ranking for that particular category. If that category needs more Vine Voices, you may be invited faster. \nTip: To find out how your reviews are ranking and check on your Vine potential, visit www.amazon.com/profile . To kick your profile up a notch, add a professional-looking headshot and a short bio that entails your interests–companies will want to know! \n3. I’m ready to review like a krazy person, but is there a catch? \nTaxes! In 2015, Amazon Vine started collecting 1099 tax forms from any product reviewer that received over $600 in free products over the course of one year. \nThis means you’ll have to pay taxes on the retail value of any products you receive if the total combined retail value reaches over $600 that year. So, even if a gadget you receive is on sale for $500, but the retail value is $1,000, you’ll still owe taxes on $1,000. \nAlthough there was a bit of pushback from the Vine community, plenty of ravenous reviewers held on and figured that paying taxes on items that would have otherwise cost them hundreds of dollars was well worth it. \nPlus, you choose the items you’re sent, so you aren’t paying taxes on five microwaves and two vacuums you never needed in the first place.",

      "text": "Amazon Worker Jumps Off Company Building After E-Mail Note Bloomberg 5 hrs ago Spencer Soper © Spencer Soper An Amazon.com Inc. employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police characterized as a suicide attempt.\nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said.\nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon’s headquarters.\n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.”\nIn the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person.\n© Spencer Soper Suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company.\n(Updates with detail from e-mail in fifth paragraph.)\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.net.

      "text": "Amazon to close North Charleston warehouse, cut 149 jobs Published 12:49 am, Tuesday, November 29, 2016 NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Amazon will be closing a book-making warehouse in North Charleston, taking 149 jobs with it. The Post and Courier ( http://bit.ly/2gczwLs ) reports that Amazon told the state labor department that it would close the facility permanently on Feb. 15, 2017. The company also said it would give the employees affected a chance to take a job elsewhere before the warehouse closes. Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Bond says the warehouse prints and ships books and has hundreds of employees who handle shipments in the area. The warehouse will move to the Midlands to be closer to the company's West Columbia distribution hub. The South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce disclosed the layoffs on Monday. ___ Information from: The Post and Courier, http://www.postandcourier.com Most Popular",

      "text": "Posted: Nov 29 2016, 1:24am CST | by IANS , in News | Technology News \nShop Now: Amazon's Best Cyber Monday Deals \nIf you are among those who pre-booked the world's cheapest smartphone at Rs 251 (less than $4) and are yet to hear from its Noida-based makers, you are not alone. The promise of delivering \"nearly 200,000 Freedom 251 handsets\" has fallen flat and most people who booked the handset are yet to see one. Don't Miss: The Best Cyber Deals on Amazon.com \nAfter announcing that it has delivered 5,000 Freedom 251 smartphones in July, Ringing Bells Pvt Ltd said it would deliver 65,000 more to those who had booked the device in cash on delivery (COD) mode. \nAfter that, no new numbers have been shared and it appears the initial hype has fizzled out. The company has since forayed into making TVs and other smartphones, burying the Freedom 251 dream. \nIs this the biggest tech disappointment of 2016, despite Freedom 251 making national and global headlines throughout the year? \n\"I think we could have called it the biggest disappointment only if there had been great expectations attached to it. Every educated person, or those having fair understanding of technology, doubted it. Some may have booked one just out of curiosity but that never meant they took it seriously,\" Faisal Kawoosa, Principal Analyst (Telecoms) at CyberMedia Research (CMR), a market research firm, told IANS. \nThe company in mid-February this year had planned to deliver 2.5 million handsets before June 30. Ringing Bells received mammoth -- over 70 million -- registrations before its payment gateway crashed. \n\"I wouldn't call it biggest tech disappointment. But yes, it could be looked at as one of the biggest cheats in the digital age,\" Kawoosa added. \nWhen reached, a Ringing Bells spokesperson told IANS that the company is working on improving its reach through distributor networks but did not say a word about Freedom 251's disappearance. \n\"Last six months have been phenomenal as we have reached 200 cities with a distributor network of 230. In this period, we have been able to widen our product base, including high-end mobiles and televisions. This year, we have sold 150,000 products and expect to get a 25 per cent increase in the coming months,\" the spokesperson said, declining to be named and without mentioning Freedom 251. \nIn an earlier interview with IANS, Ringing Bells CEO Mohit Goel said if the government was willing to dole out Rs 50,000 crore (about $7.5 billion), he can ensure that 750 million of our population would become part of digital India by owning a smartphone at Rs 251. \n\"The government can make the phone -- under our Freedom brand -- from some other vendor. I have no objection to it. To make such phone for every Indian citizen, the government needs to allocate funds from its Digital India initiative,\" Goel had said. \nAccording to Parv Sharma, Research Associate at New Delhi-based Counterpoint Research, Freedom 251 raised false hopes in the people about owning a cheap smartphone. \n\"A massive shift in India is happening from feature phones to smartphones but that shift brings with itself a level of expectation -- expectation of consuming content, of watching videos and listening to music for a longer time and, hence, there is a need for better hardware features,\" Sharma told IANS. \nTo accommodate these features, the industry has reached a certain price point which is currently $50-$60, but packing something similar in a $4 device is not possible as of now. \n\"Thus, Freedom 251 failed to meet the demands of the consumers and had to cancel the pre-orders and refund the money to consumers,\" Sharma pointed out. \nThe world's cheapest phone made a splash across the globe, with almost every big media house writing about the \"miracle device\". \n\"But rather than improving our country's image, the long delay has tarnished our image globally. It is also a setback for the government which is pushing the 'Digital India' and 'Make in India' initiatives,\" noted Vishal Tripathi, Research Director at global market consultancy firm Gartner, adding that the government must ensure the veracity of such tall claims. \nBut according to Kawoosa, if the government starts imposing stricter controls over propositions like Freedom 251, that could mean disrupting the enabling start-up ecosystem and environment. \n\"In the end, the government support has to be positive to promote innovations and it will be very challenging to decide beforehand whether the innovation would be a success or failure. So one has to give a fair chance to all,\" Kawoosa told IANS. \n\"But yes, some basic-level evaluation needs to be put in place to check the business viability of such propositions, especially when it has the potential to affect everyone's lives,\" Kawoosa explained. \n\"The government should be highly concerned about the companies which do not give realistic promises and must not support such companies. We have various laws in our country to protect consumers from Ponzi companies,\" Sharma added. \nDoubts were initially raised over Ringing Bells' handset after some experts said no smartphone could be manufactured for less than Rs 2,000. \nCyber Monday 2016 is Here.

      "text": "View Comments Print By   \nNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - Amazon will be closing a book-making warehouse in North Charleston, taking 149 jobs with it. \nThe Post and Courier (http://bit.ly/2gczwLs ) reports that Amazon told the state labor department that it would close the facility permanently on Feb. 15, 2017. The company also said it would give the employees affected a chance to take a job elsewhere before the warehouse closes. \nAmazon spokeswoman Sarah Bond says the warehouse prints and ships books and has hundreds of employees who handle shipments in the area. The warehouse will move to the Midlands to be closer to the company’s West Columbia distribution hub. \nThe South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce disclosed the layoffs on Monday. \n___ \nInformation from: The Post and Courier, http://www.postandcourier.com \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

      "text": "  Amazon recruiter, a former US Army captain, eager to open door to veterans By ANGEL GONZALEZ The Seattle Times   \nSEATTLE - Ardine Williams, one of the lead recruiters for Amazon.com's fast-growing cloud computing unit, knows well the technical skills and can-do attitude veterans bring to the table. \nBut she also knows, first hand, how hard it is to make those first steps in the civilian world. \nAs a captain in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during the 1980s, she had done specialized telecommunications work and data analysis. \nBut in her first real foray into the private sector she found herself selling clothes at Gymboree, which as a young mother returning from Kuwait she joined \"because they had a great discount in kids clothes.\" \n\"I really felt like I was lost,\" Williams, 55, said in an interview. \nNow, after three decades and a successful career in pharmaceuticals and technology, she leads efforts to staff up Amazon Web Services, an Amazon division that has more than 6,000 jobs open worldwide, in the midst of a veritable war for talent among technology titans. \nShe wants to open the door to as many veterans as she can who are a \"great fit,\" she says, for the company. \nIn a speech last month at Joint Base Lewis-McChord outside Seattle, Williams, who is AWS' vice president for global talent acquisition, told attendants that \"you and those you lead have built skills in the military that companies like mine are after.\" \n\"They find careers at Amazon, and add incredible value,\" she said. \"Your mission-driven, results-oriented approach is exactly what my team seeks in candidates.\" \nSeattle-based Amazon says it has hired more than 10,000 veterans in the past five years, and vows to hire more than 25,000 veterans and military spouses in the next five. If Amazon keeps growing at the pace it's led in the past few years, there'll be plenty of space to absorb them, not only in cloud computing, but also in logistics and warehouse operations. \nThere's what a company spokeswoman calls a \"very active\" affinity group of veterans dubbed Amazon Warriors; and there are even a sizable number of recruiters with military backgrounds who make incorporating former service members a priority. \nAbout two dozen of these recruiters met recently at a happy hour, a monthly event that they have baptized \"Commander's Call,\" in honor of the gatherings they saw in service. There they socialize, reinforcing what is a growing community of Amazonians with military experience, and exchange tips on how to help new hires adapt to life in corporate America. For example, some veterans making the transition are confused by health care, 401(k) options or that they can negotiate a salary, one of the recruiters said. \nThe company's pledges come against a backdrop in which many large U.S. businesses have made incorporating veterans a top priority, a policy that has resulted in relatively low unemployment levels for former military. \nExamples abound, from software giants Microsoft and Uber to Starbucks. The coffee behemoth's CEO, Howard Schultz, even co-authored a book about veterans. \nBut a divide remains between those emerging from the armed forces and their new civilian employers and co-workers, given the small percentage of the U.S. workforce that has any experience in the military. \nA survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that human-resources staffers \"often lack sufficient knowledge about military service or the skills acquired during that time,\" and that 44 percent of veterans left their first civilian job within the first year, which they often took hurriedly to make ends meet. \nWilliams managed to overcome the difficulty of the transition to military life because, as she puts it, her father goaded her into leaving her retail gig for \"a real job.\" His advice: Take a job that you know how to perform and take it from there, even if you feel you're overqualified for it. \nShe found a spot as a technical writer at a pharmaceutical company. That soon opened the door to marketing, venture-capital work, executive roles in mergers and acquisitions, then to the top echelons of Intel's human-resources department. \nIn 2014, a few months after retiring from the chipmaker, she was lured by AWS to help lead its gargantuan recruiting operations. \n\"It's incredibly difficult,\" she said of that first step into a civilian life. \"There are jobs in the military that very easily match civilian jobs. There are others who have no translation at all. How do you navigate the first transition is key.\" \nAmazon has several initiatives in the works to help with that first move. AWS works with Camo2ï¿½Commerce, an organization that seeks to connect veterans transitioning out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord with jobs and career development. \nIn May, the company said it would train, free, 10,000 active-duty service members, as well as veterans and military spouses, in cloud-computing skills through online courses that can lead to certifications. \nThe company also offers a 10-week internship to armed-forces personnel on active duty about to transition out of the service. \nAs Williams puts it, not everyone will be able to luck into a satisfying career path the same way she did. \"Times are different now. Helping transitioning service members bridge that gap is important, rather than leaving it to happenstance,\" she said. Related content",

      "text": "20 shares \nBack in 2015, Amazon came under fire following a shocking piece from the New York Times exposing the company’s toxic cut-throat working environment. While CEO Jeff Bezos was quick to deny the claims , it seems not all is calm behind the curtain. \nA distressed Amazon employee has jumped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police have described as a suicide attempt, Bloomberg reports . The incident occurred on Monday around 8:45AM local time. The man has survived the fall and has since been taken to a hospital in Seattle, police said. \nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, the employee, whose name wasn’t revealed by authorities, sent a distraught email note to CEO Jeff Bezos and co-workers prior to leaping off. Bloomberg writes: \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. \nThe anonymous source further said that, in the email, the employee voiced his frustrations with how Amazon handled his transfer request and hinted that he might harm himself. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nAmazon isn’t the only company that has faced accusations over its exploitative working conditions. Back in 2009, Chinese Foxconn factory employee Sun Danyong committed suicide after his house was raided following the disappearance of an iPhone prototype. \nWhat’s worrying is this isn’t an isolated case. More recently, another Foxconn factory employee jumped to his death from one of the company’s buildings after only one month at the job. \nTo come back to Amazon: While last year Bezos brushed off the incidents brought to light by the New York Times as “isolated anecdotes”, I’m not so sure this sort of excuse will fly this time around – and nor should it.",

I like that it’s less conspicuous than the larger Echo. As far as sound, of course it doesn’t sound nearly as good as the Echo but it works well for hearing Alexa’s voice. I use it with my Samsung SmartThings Hub along with my Nest and Logitech Harmony Home Hub. All these work together quite well for home automation. I can control a bunch of devices in my house just by talking to Alexa.\nBy Joe, on November 25, 2016\nThere are times when Alexa surprises me, and I think to myself, “Best Purchase Ever.” However, there are so many minute things that annoy me, where I think that it’s a piece of junk. One thing that happened recently was that it wasn’t responding to setting an alarm, and I have done this many times. The Echo Dot would light up, but do nothing. I have noticed this multiple times. Nothing a good unplugging and plugging back in would fix, but it has come to the point that I have to do this every few days, and I shouldn’t have to (I’ve only had this for about a month).\nFor more information, please visit http://hd24tv.com/\nContact Info:\nName: Ricky van\nOrganization: iMarketers\nSource: http://marketersmedia.com/cyber-monday-deals-2016-amazon-echo-dot-discount-revealed-on-amazon/150163\nRelease ID: 150163\n ",

Perhaps the closest historical parallel you’ll find is the British East India Company; that trading combine chartered in 1600 that grew into a global colossus that controlled vast swaths of the earth’s surface and governed entire nations with its own laws and courts. Standing up to Amazon today can be roughly akin to a small spice trader trying to carve out their own niche during the days when the East India Company controlled the mechanisms of global trade. In light of that fact, just how does a small brand succeed in a marketplace dominated by such a behemoth? Below we’ll provide some tips that should afford you a decent chance of success. Accept the Situation \nRailing against the presence of the giant isn’t going to make the giant go away. Nor is it going to result in an effective strategy for dealing with the giant. Before you can take on the giant, you must accept its existence. You must accept that you are at a disadvantage from the get-go and that the road won’t be easy. Once you’ve accepted that without qualification, you’re ready to step up to the challenges ahead. Love Yourself \nYou’re not Amazon but so what? You’re still pretty darn special in your own right. Embrace those things that make you who and what you are and make your product what it is and then focus on your strengths. Make sure the “about” page on your website tells a story that will click with users. Tout the first-class materials that go into your product, the world-class designers who have toiled long and hard to make it unique or the fact that your product is produced by people that earn a fair wage. If you have a feature that a user could never expect at Amazon or Ebay , flaunt it. \nHere is an example. FineCigars is an e-commerce site retailing premium cigars in Australia and around the world. They started accepting Bitcoin as payment from 2014, and since then they have been experiencing a growing stream of revenue in the Bitcoin denomination. Better yet, most of these customers proved to be very loyal as FineCigars remains one of the very few cigars retailing sites accepting Bitcoins. The news (of them now accepting Bitcoin) itself received a lot of exposure as Fine Cigars got featured on many sites covering cryptocurrency and finance news. Create a Personalized Experience \nAmazon has the most boring website since Google. But it works because Amazon isn’t selling a high end ‘experience’. They’re selling variety, low prices, free shipping and no hassle returns. If you want to have any chance of tearing people away from all that practicality, you’ll need to offer them something they can’t get on Amazon. Part of that is your product to be sure, but the another part is about making the customer feel like they’re personally critical to the success of your business. Loyalty programs, personalized emails, and handwritten holiday cards go a long way toward offsetting free shipping. It’s not Important to Beat Amazon on Price \nAmazon has such clout, and as a result, companies are so desperate to take advantage of their millions of customers; they’ll cut margins right to the bone in the hope of winning “buy box” status. Because of this, it’s a foolish business owner indeed who tries to compete with Amazon by undercutting their prices . Instead of trying to out discount Amazon just offer the best price you can and earn the extra, you charge by providing those personal touches mentioned above. Demonstrate Your Expertise \nDemonstrating knowledge is a good way to build trust among customers that aren’t already familiar with you or your product. There are a number of ways to demonstrate expertise including frequent blog posts that cover different aspects of your product and/or process, an FAQ section that anticipates questions customers may have and provides clear answers that tout your depth of knowledge and soliciting questions through a contact form. (Just be sure you respond in a timely fashion or people will feel like they’re being played.) Give Something Back \nPeople appreciate when business entities give something back to the communities they serve. Such community engagement most often takes the form of supporting a charity. It’s helpful if you can find one that has some sort of connection to your product. For instance: if you sell bespoke shoes you may want to sponsor a shoe drive to provide footwear to the less fortunate. Whatever cause you choose you’ll need to be consistent in your support and provide regular updates on your website regarding your efforts and how your customers can get involved. Don’t Stop Believing \nCompeting with behemoths, whether the British East India Company or Amazon, isn’t ever easy. There are likely to be as many setbacks as there are successes. Perhaps the most valuable tool you can have at your disposal than is an ironclad belief in yourself and your product. Find the fun in the challenge, take a deep breath and put one foot in front of the other. Conclusion \nBeing small in the land of giants doesn’t have to be a death sentence. Even today there are plenty of seats at the table for those that really want them. By focusing on creating the best possible product and then cultivating robust customer engagement , you’ll be well on your way to long-term success.

      "text": "Counterfeit products have been a big problem on Amazon for years, and even a recent lawsuit claimed 90 percent of “official” chargers sold on the site are actually fake . Amazon is now finally taking action against scammers in a bid to clean its marketplace up. Bloomberg News reports that Amazon has acknowledged internally that the counterfeit problem is getting worse, and that it has made fighting fakes a “major goal” for next year. \nAmazon is reportedly preparing a registry to prevent fakes, and working with brands to register with the site even if they don’t plan to sell goods. Amazon will then require any marketplace merchants to obtain brand permission before they can sell products from that company. Amazon has even been experimenting with Nike and others companies to build the registry, but the e-retailer will target thousands more brands next year to try and convince them to sell products on Amazon’s marketplace.\nA number of brands have been reluctant in the past to sell goods through Amazon, deterred by the large amount of fake goods. Bloomberg News reports that Amazon tried to convince the NFL and MLB to sell merchandise through its online store, but that the talks stalled due to the lack of control over existing fake products.",

I bought one for £50 from homebase eBay when you had their double discount glitch ages ago. Warehouse were doing £50 off a £200 spend but they had non of these in stock. This is best price i've seen for a while.cheaper than wickes and homebase. It's 20% off all warehouse ATM until 4th December. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Warehouse-Deals/b?ie=UTF8&node=3581866031 Still not available in Amazon warehouse though. I purchased 3 at the reduced price so im happy That message was for any people that miss out on this deal as another avenue to explore.",

By: FE Online  35 PM Due to several lawsuits and criticism, Amazon has known the problem since a long time now, but have been largely silent on the issue, which has, in turn, led to a cost increase for brands and sellers.(Reuters) \nWorld’s biggest online retailer, Amazon has long been suffering from the problem of fake products on its e-commerce marketplace. Recently, tech major Apple had pointed out that most of the iPhone and iPad charging cables and adapters available on Amazon’s website were fake, even if the sellers claim them to be real. The case of counterfeit products went so far ahead that Apple went on to file a lawsuit against Mobile Star, a supplier to Amazon and had accused the company of trademark and copyright infringement, according to Patently Apple. Due to several lawsuits and criticism, Amazon has known the problem since a long time now, but have been largely silent on the issue, which has, in turn, led to a cost increase for brands and sellers, Bloomberg reported. \nThe global e-commerce giant has reportedly decided to take action against scammers with and aim to clean up its marketplace. According to Bloomberg news, Amazon has made it a ‘major goal’ for the next year ti tackle the fake products issue as it has realised that the problem of counterfeit products have been growing exponentially. The company is said to make a register to avoid fake products brands will be working with the website even if they do not sell their products there. “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” Amazon said in a statement. Amazon added that it is “aggressively pursuing bad actors.” \nAlso read | Amazon’s ugly truth: 90 percent Apple power products fake; Here’s all about the lawsuit \nMarketplace merchants will now have to get permission for the brands before the can sell products on Amazon. Amazon reportedly had been trying out the process with Nike and a few others, but by next year it will be aggressive towards building the registry and target more and more brands so that they could sell their products on the website. \nAlso read | How Jeff Bezos reacted to Amazon’s big ‘expose’, and what it teaches us \nApprehensive with the huge amount of fake products, many brands have been said to be reluctant in recent times to sell their products on Amazon. A few companies like MLB and NFL were in talks with Amazon, but they pulled out owing to the lack of control over fake items.  ",

The Alexa App is also where you discover third-party skills.\nReviews from user are given below for your consideration,\nChris Majestic, on October 26, 2016\nI have the Dot and the Echo and the only thing you’re missing with the Dot is the large speakers in the Echo, but your’e gaining a Aux output which makes this thing awesome! I like that it’s less conspicuous than the larger Echo. As far as sound, of course it doesn’t sound nearly as good as the Echo but it works well for hearing Alexa’s voice. I use it with my Samsung SmartThings Hub along with my Nest and Logitech Harmony Home Hub. All these work together quite well for home automation. I can control a bunch of devices in my house just by talking to Alexa.\nBy Joe, on November 25, 2016\nThere are times when Alexa surprises me, and I think to myself, “Best Purchase Ever.” However, there are so many minute things that annoy me, where I think that it’s a piece of junk. One thing that happened recently was that it wasn’t responding to setting an alarm, and I have done this many times. The Echo Dot would light up, but do nothing. I have noticed this multiple times. Nothing a good unplugging and plugging back in would fix, but it has come to the point that I have to do this every few days, and I shouldn’t have to (I’ve only had this for about a month).\n //hd24tv.com/\nContact Info:\nName: Ricky van\nOrganization: iMarketers\nSource: http://marketersmedia.com/cyber-monday-deals-2016-amazon-echo-dot-discount-revealed-on-amazon/150163\nRelease ID: 150163\n ",

      "text": "Amazon to Crack Down on Counterfeit Goods Sold on its Marketplace Tuesday November 29, 2016 4:14 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Amazon has acknowledged a worsening counterfeit problem on its site and says it has made fighting the fake products a \"major goal\" for next year (via The Verge ). Last month Apple filed a lawsuit against Mobile Star LLC which it accused of infringing upon its trademarks and copyrights by selling counterfeit power adapters and cables on Amazon. Apple claimed the fake products posed a risk to life, and said it had found that almost 90 percent of so-called genuine Apple products and accessories it purchased from Amazon over the last nine months were actually counterfeit. Following the lawsuit, Amazon said it had \"zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits\" on its website and said it was working closely with manufacturers and brands to aggressively pursue the wrongdoers. Bloomberg reports that Amazon now says it plans to create a registry to prevent fakes and wants legitimate brands to register even if they don't plan on selling products on the site. Merchants then have to obtain official brand permission before they can sell goods from the company. Amazon has reportedly been experimenting with Nike and other brands to build the registry, but the company says it will target more brands in 2017 in an attempt to get them to sell their products on Amazon's marketplace. According to the report, Amazon tried to get the NFL and MLB to sell merchandise through its online marketplace, but the negotiations stalled because of a perceived lack of control over existing fake goods.",

      "title": "Le Pro3 review: Flagship specs, low cost, and a horrible user experience",
      "text": "on Amazon The LeEco Le Pro3 is so close to being great, but ultimately gets in its own way. \nLook at the LeEco Le Pro3’s spec sheet and you will find a phone that rivals Google’s very own flagship Pixel lineup. \nThe latest and greatest Qualcomm processor? Check. Massive battery? Check. 64GB of storage? Check. 4GB of RAM? Unlocked and compatible with GSM carriers? An impressive design? Check, check, and check. \nThen you look at its $399 price tag, and begin to question if it’s too good to be true. Heck, at one point the Le Pro3 was priced at $299 during a flash sale promotion to kick off its availability in the U.S. market. \nHow can a phone on paper look so good, while at the same time requiring you to hand over so little of your hard earned money? \nThe answer: LeEco. \nLeEco made a splash in October with an extravagant launch event here in the US. The Chinese company purchased popular TV manufacturer Vizio last year, and is now ready to take on the U.S. market. Or so it thought, with the company’s CEO stating just last week that it was growing too fast and running out of money . \nNonetheless, LeEco will continue to sell products in the U.S., starting with the Le Pro3 smartphone. It looks the part Jason Cipriani \nFrankly, there’s no other way to say it: The Le Pro 3 is a good looking device. \nThere’s no denying the LeEco Le Pro3 is one well-designed phone. Continuing the 2016 trend of a brushed metal housing with antenna lines at the top and bottom of the device, it looks familiar as well. The housing is a bit on the smooth side, almost to the point of being slippery, but ultimately feels good in the hand. \nOn the back of the phone you find a fingerprint reader just below the camera lens and two-tone flash. On the right side are volume and power buttons, which have loud click to them. \nOn the bottom is a USB-C port, used for charging, data transfer, and audio. That’s right, the Le Pro3 lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. Fear not, included in the box is a set of USB-C headphones. \nThe display isn’t QHD, but I won’t complain. It’s bright and vivid, and offers good color reproduction even if it is only 1080p. It plays the part Jason Cipriani \nA USB-C port that doubles as a headphone jack, kind of like the iPhone. \nRunning benchmarks on the Le Pro 3, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Time after time, it beat even the most expensive devices, and in some cases it wasn’t even close. \nBut as we all know, benchmarks don’t tell the full story. That’s what real-world testing is about, and I can confirm the performance of the Le Pro3 is smooth, responsive, and without hiccups. \nA centerpiece of the sales pitch from LeEco is its vast ecosystem of media and shows available across the company’s TVs and phones. As such, the Le Pro3 comes with a Live streaming app built in. \nYou can’t miss it, as its icon is placed where you would normally find the app drawer button on most Android devices. Oh, and you cannot move it. You can’t disable it. It’s there, and always will be. \nIn the streaming app you have the option to use a picture-in-picture mode as you watch one of the available shows, allowing you to continue to use your phone for Facebook or emails. \nI watched Food Network for about 30 minutes, resizing the window and moving it around the screen in an effort to push the Le Pro3 to its limit. Not once did I experience any lag or delay. \nBattery life is exceptional, thanks to the huge 4,070 milliamp-hour battery. I was able to use the Le Pro3 as a dedicated navigation unit, letting it run Google Maps for 11 hours straight with the screen on, and still had battery left over during a recent road trip. \nThis wasn’t a well lit room, but it wasn’t horrible. And yet, the amount of grain in the photo is far too high. \nCamera performance was a bit mixed, with the 16-megapixel rear camera capturing quality photos in well-lit environments but struggling in harsh or low-light scenarios. Yet, fails to get the part Jason Cipriani \nThere are far too many tools for one phone. \nIt has the looks, it has the performance… what gives? \nIt comes down to software. LeEco has taken a strong hand in customizing Android, and the end result is a confusing mess. The Le Pro3 ships with Android 6.0.1, with LeEco’s proprietary EUI interface running atop it. \nFrom the moment you set up the phone, you’re reminded of the changes. Between the constant permission dialogs that pop up the first time you launch even the most basic system apps, such as Music. (Why does the Music app need to request access to the Phone?) Jason Cipriani \nBrowsing through my favorite Android news site while watching some people play soccer golf. \nConsider that, instead of a tiered window multitasking view, you’re shown a row of thumbnails along the bottom of the display with a series of rows that are part of the “Control Center” above it. Jason Cipriani \nThe days of too many redundant options were behind us, right? \nThe pull-down quick settings shade, where you typically find shortcuts to settings and a list of notifications, only shows notifications. It’s jarring and downright confusing, even after a week of use. Maybe with a few more weeks of exposure, muscle memory and expectations would subside. \nThe settings menu is just as messy, with different options to white-list apps for increased performance, to a lock-screen cleanup mode that aggressively kills apps when your phone is locked, to an “align wakeup” setting that is supposed to reduce the number of times the phone wakes up during the course of a day to save battery life. I don’t understand that last setting, as the phone doesn’t offer any sort of active display or raise-to-wake feature. You have to press a button or touch the fingerprint sensor to wake the phone. \nGoogle has put a tremendous amount of work toward improving Android battery life and performance in Marshmallow and Nougat, yet LeEco has spent a lot of time adding duplicative, unnecessary features that clutter the interface and confuse the end user. It’s worth the cost, but is it worth the headache? Jason Cipriani \nYou can swipe up on an app’s thumbnail to close it. \nI can say I wouldn’t want to use the Le Pro3 as my daily phone. It’s so close to being one of the best Android phones available at the $399 price point, but then you open another app for the first time and are reminded just how bad the software experience is. \nMy initial reaction after using the Le Pro3 for a few days was: Well, eventually custom ROMs will come out, right? \nAnd that sums up the Le Pro3. It’s a good phone — superb, even — when it comes to performance and design. That’s why it’s getting a score of 3.5, and not lower. \nUnfortunately, the software gets in its way and stops it from being one of the best phones on the market.

      "text": "Jeff O'Neal 11-29-16 \nNo need to mince words here: we are giving one lucky Book Riot reader $250 to blow at Amazon. Overstuff those stockings or get a jump on your New Year reading pile–up to you. \nTo enter, just try one (or more…) of our email lists, designed to help you get more out of your reading life, from finding out about cheap ebooks or keeping up with new releases. If you don’t like what you signed up for, unsubscribing is easy. No worries. (And if you already get these, go ahead and enter. Our email system won’t send duplicates to the same email address) \nThis giveaway is open internationally, and will be open to entries until midnight Eastern on December 8th, 2016. One entry per email address. I will randomly select a winner and email them for mailing info. The winner will have 48 hours to respond before I pick someone else, so use an email address that you actually check. \nTo help you pick, here is a quick summary of your newsletter choices: \nThe Riot Rundown (3x a week) This is the best of Book Riot. Three times a week, we send you an email rounding up our best stuff, from lists to opinion to news to humor. Probably the easiest way to keep up with what’s going on around here. \nNew Books! (1x a week) Every Tuesday, our resident velocireader Liberty Hardy tells you what books coming out that week should be on your radar. It’s a TBR-buster, and it hurts so good. \nBook Riot Deals (daily-ish) Everyday we scour the internet for the best ebook deals (and the occasional print deal) and send it out in an email. Just one pick from us of something we think worth mentioning. And if we don’t find anything interesting, we don’t send an email that day. You can browse recent selections here. \nThis Week in Books (weekly) Get the scoop on the latest literary news, all summed up and put into context. It’s the easiest way to keep up with the reading world without…well…really trying all that hard. \nBook Riot Giveaways (2-3x a week) We giveaway a whole bunch of stuff every week, from books to giftcards to cool bookish stuff. Make sure you don’t miss any chance to throw your hat in the ring with our dedicated newsletter that notifies every time we post a new giveaway. \nOk, ready to enter? Here’s the entry form. Good luck! \nLoading&#8230; Never miss a giveaway! Sign up to get notified with our giveaways newsletter. Get socks and mugs for $7, totes for $13, tees for $17, and more great deals. Cyber Monday is 30% off sitewide in the Book Riot Store .",

      "text": "Amazon is working on a new, Alexa-enabled speaker that would include a seven-inch touchscreen display, according to a report from Bloomberg. Citing sources close to the company, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the speaker will be larger than Amazon’s Echo, and that it will be “tilted upwards” so that users can read the display. The device could be announced as early as the first quarter of 2017, according to Bloomberg.\n\nLike the Echo, the new device can be controlled using Alexa, Amazon’s digital assistant, though users would also be able to pull up weather forecasts, news, and other content through the touchscreen display.

      "text": "CBS/AP November 29, 2016, 8:16 AM Amazon stock drops amid big discounting Stumble \nOnline retail giant Amazon ( AMZN ) touted its Cyber Monday sales traffic as its best in history, but that didn’t help its share price: The stock slid as investors balked at the company’s large discounts. \nAmazon fell $13.60, or 1.7 percent, to $766.77 on Monday after Citigroup ( C ) analysts cut their price target on the stock, citing the retailer’s deep discounting to compete during the holiday shopping season. The shares have tumbled 9 percent from the recent high in early October. Amazon is reportedly laying the groundwork for its own shipping service. Sources tell the Wall Street Journal the internet giant's goal is to hau... \nAmazon has achieved its goal of scoring ever-higher revenue, but its profitability has been another story. It was in the red in 2012 and 2014, and this year earnings have been erratic. \nTo Wall Street’s dismay, Amazon has long given short shrift to boosting its earnings. Instead, it diverts capital to build out its infrastructure, most recently with a series of new warehouses, which it calls fulfillment centers. \nAs the final day of the Thanksgiving weekend selling spree ended, the e-commerce giant was offering 15 percent off a Kindle Voyage e-reader, 84 percent off on an Alpine Swiss Jake pea coat, 33 percent off a Fire HD 8 tablet and half off a Sony Blu-ray streaming disc player. \nAmong retail stocks in general, skepticism was widespread about what good all that discounting was doing for the bottom line. The SPDR S&P Retail ( XRT ) exchange-traded fund dropped 1.2 percent on Monday. This was a down day for Wall Street as a whole, although the large indexes’ descent was less steep than Amazon’s: Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were about a half percent lower. \nOverall, consumer discretionary stocks were among the hardest hit, following the closely watched post-Thanksgiving sales push. Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) fell 30 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $12.50 on reports the bookseller is also slashing prices to attract customers. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Amazon said to plan Alexa speaker with 7-inch touchscreen for 2017 Posted Starburst Ventures closes $200 million debut fund to back space tech startups \nAmazon could follow-up the early success of the Echo and Echo Dot with a new Alexa-powered premium speaker that includes a 7-inch touchscreen that can be tilted to different viewing angles for easier use in the kitchen, according to a new Bloomberg report . \nThe speaker would include voice-based assistant Alexa, just like the existing Echos, but the inclusion of the screen is designed to make accessing information like weather, upcoming appointments, news – and likely recipes – easier when using the device while it’s positioned on a counter and the owner is engaged in other tasks. \nAmazon creating an Echo with a screen would be a departure from its current approach to Alexa devices. Third-party device Nucleus is a touchscreen enabled Intercom that includes Alexa, but it’s made using Amazon’s API, not by the company itself. \nThe Bloomberg report says that the visual OS powering the display will be a modified version of Fire OS, the Android fork it uses to power its Fire tablets. Users will be able to pin items to the device screen, sort of like using a digital magnet board or refrigerator notepad, according to Bloomberg’s sources, and the device will cost more than any of the current Echo speakers. \nA display on an Echo will be interesting, in terms of user experience. Many observers of Echo’s success thus far, myself included, have suggested that part of the reason Alexa’s voice interaction works so well is because it’s really the only option – people don’t consistently use Siri or Google Now because they don’t have to; manipulating the touch screen has a much lower error rate in terms of accomplishing what you intended to do. \nStill, a single, premium device with a tablet isn’t going to tank Alexa’s fortunes overall, even if it doesn’t work out as a blended experiment of mixed interaction modes. There’s no guarantee this will ever ht the light of day, but it makes sense that Amazon would be working on ways to capitalize on the promise of Alexa. 0",

      "text": "Amazon Developing Echo Speaker With 7-Inch Touchscreen to 'Fend Off Competition' From Apple and Google Tuesday November 29, 2016 5:14 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Amazon's next iteration of the Echo speaker will be a \"premium\" model that includes a touchscreen measuring around seven inches, marking \"a major departure\" from the tall, cylindrical design of the Echo currently on sale. The company is said to be upgrading Echo for two reasons: to capitalize on the device's success, and as early preparation to \"fend off competition\" from Google Home and Apple's rumored entry into the smart home speaker market (via Bloomberg ). The logic behind adding a touchscreen to Echo is reasoned as a way \"to make it easier to access content,\" like the weather and upcoming calendar events. Currently, Echo is a voice-activated device with limited volume and mute buttons on its topside. While the exact design of the speaker wasn't pinned down, people familiar with the plans said it will be larger and \"tilt upwards\" so users can read the screen when the Echo sits on a kitchen counter or desk. The new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced. Amazon’s planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speaker and Apple Inc.’s interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant. The upgraded Echo is also believed to get a major boost to speaker quality and \"sound much better\" than the current line of Echo speakers. One version of Amazon's prototype of the upcoming device placed the speakers below and behind the screen, which is said to help the new generation of Echo \"play high-quality audio at all volume levels.\" The current Echo was designed to sound better at only moderate volume levels. In total, Amazon is now selling the Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, and Amazon Echo, for $50, $130, and $180 respectively, and the upcoming speaker -- believed to be announced as early as Q1 2017 -- is expected to be the most expensive Echo in the line. On Apple's side, the most recent reports placed the Cupertino company's Siri-fueled, Echo-like device in the prototype phase . The Siri speaker is expected to include the usual support for music playback, search queries, and dictation, with additional potential for new technology, like facial recognition .",
