      "text": "Australia says IBM settles over online census failure November 25, 2016 by Rod Mcguirk \nGlobal technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver. Australian census back online 2 days after cyberattack August 11, 2016 \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online resumed Thursday almost two days after it shut down due to what an angry prime minister described as system failures that left it vulnerable to cyberattack. Australia admits government hack attacks, boosts cyber security April 21, 2016 \nAustralia unveiled a multi-million-dollar cyber scheme to combat hacking on Thursday, as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged an attack on the country's weather bureau but stopped short of blaming it on China.

Australia boosts climate science research in u-turn August 4, 2016 \nAustralia made an abrupt climate change u-turn Thursday, with the issue set to again become a key focus of the national science agency just months after it saw hundreds of jobs cut in a heavily criticised move. You don't need to be an IT expert to mastermind cyber-attacks August 10, 2016 \nAnyone with a sinister mind and some dollars to spare could mastermind a cyber-attack such as the one the Australian Bureau of Statistics is claiming hit the Census website last night, according to a Deakin University cyber ...

      "text": "Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By ROD McGUIRK Associated Press Updated 5 hrs ago \nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

      "text": "International Business Machines: IBM Stock Is Setting up to Run By Patrick Brik, BAS   25, 2016 Photo: Sean Gallup / Staff / GettyImages IBM Stock : Bullish Tailwind \nI have been watching International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) stock for some time, waiting for a new bull market to develop. The reason why I believe that a bull market is on the horizon for IBM stock is that the price has fulfilled a number of criteria that are indicating that a new bull market is ready to begin. \nBut there is still one obstacle that stands in the way. This obstacle comes in the form of a trend line, and it is the same trend line that I highlighted in my previous report on International Business Machines stock. \nSince that last report, a brief sell-off hit IBM stock, but the price has once again returned to test the trend line. A break above this trend line would be tremendous news for the bullish camp, and it would suggest that the bear market that has plagued IBM stock since 2013 has finally ended, and that a new bull market is upon it. \nInternational Business Machines stock has lagged the major market indices, as those indices have gone on to make new all-time highs. There is a lot of ground that IBM stock needs to make up, and surpassing this last hurdle would set the wheels in motion to achieving this. \nThe following International Business Machines stock chart illustrates a reason why I believe that a new bull market is on the horizon. \nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com \nFibonacci retracement numbers (highlighted in green) are a very popular tool used by many technical traders. This tool is used to identify countertrend price objectives. In theory, when a stock pulls back from a primary trend, shares will retrace approximately 50-62% of the primary move. Traders refer to this zone as “the box,” and they will be eyeing this area as one in which to enter long positions, and/or cover short positions. \nInternational Business Machines stock was trending down for approximately three years until this retracement was finally complete. Now that the pullback in IBM stock is complete, the groundwork for a resumption of the bull market has now commenced. \nThe following International Business Machines stock chart illustrates the hurdle that needs to be crossed. \nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com \nThe downtrend (highlighted in blue) is the trend line that is acting as a hurdle that IBM stock must cross in order for the bulls to fully rejoice. This trend line is created by connecting the peaks on a price chart. This trend is identified by lower lows and lower highs. \nThere should be no mistaking a downtrend, as it can easily be identified as the price moves from the upper left to the lower right of the chart. These trends persist until the price gathers enough momentum to finally break above it. \nA break above this level will be the signal that the bulls are waiting for. This act will finally indicate that the bear market is over. This breakout will be confirmed when IBM stock can close above it over two consecutive trading days. A confirmed breakout would open up the all-time high of $193.69 as the next level that could be tested in this new bull market. \nThe moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator has just crossed in a bullish manner. MACD is a simple and effective trend-following momentum indicator. Signal-line crossings are used to distinguish between bullish and bearish signals. \nIn my previous report on IBM, I mentioned that a bearish MACD cross meant that current bearish headwinds would add pressure to a potential breakout and that IBM would have to return on a later date when the signal was aligned in a bullish manner. This is the scenario that is now in play and, as a result, the odds have increased that the trend line will break as bullish tailwinds are now supporting at a price advance. Bottom Line on International Business Machines Stock \nIf International Business Machines stock can break above the downtrend line, it will signal that the bull market has fully resumed, and that higher prices in IBM stock are likely. \nEditor’s Note: Hi, Patrick Brik here.

      "text": "Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By ROD McGUIRKAssociated Press \nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

      "text": "FRIDAY, NOV. 25, 2016, 7:34 A.M. Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By Rod Mcguirk Associated Press Twitter \nCANBERRA, Australia – Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia’s online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia’s first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic’s head contractor, had reached a “very substantial” confidential settlement with the government over the failure that “absolutely” covered costs. \n“It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM’s performance here and they have ‘fessed up (confessed), they’ve paid up and we’re going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,” Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n“Overwhelming the failure was IBM’s,” he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website’s denial-of-service protections as “inadequate.” \nThe bureau’s “close and trusting relationship” with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a “Cyber Boot Camp” where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government’s ability to deliver.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson by Reuters Close icon Reuters \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp failed in its handling of the A$10 million ($7.4 million) IT contract for Australia's first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday. \nIBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks. \n\"This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,\" Turnbull told Melbourne's 3AW radio on Friday. \n\"IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,\" he said. \nThe style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was \"common\" and \"utterly foreseeable,\" Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it. \nAn IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologized last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks Pty Ltd. \nIBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia's minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement. \nThe Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown. \nThe inquiry's report, released on Thursday, also criticized the ABS for favoring IBM during the tender process. \n\"There used to be a saying: 'No-one got fired for buying IBM',\" Turnbull said. \n\"I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,\" he said. \n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Paul Tait) Published: November 24, 2016 — 7:44 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "The main indexes were higher at midday Monday, as the Nasdaq pushed its way into new highs.\nThe composite led with a 0.7% gain. Facebook ( FB ), one of its principal components, climbed more than 3% in heavy trading, rising from support around the 200-day moving average. The social media company announced it will add 500 workers in its Britain operations, from about 1,000 currently, showing confidence in the U.K. despite Brexit. Facebook also set a stock buyback.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. Volume was tracking lower across the board. Small caps were flat, though, as the Russell 2000 showed a fractional gain.\nAmazon.com ( AMZN ), another big Nasdaq stock, rose 2% as it continued a bounce from a post-earnings sell-off. It was among the stocks with highest relative volume .\nThe energy sector was strongest in today's trading , after the price of crude jumped $1.72 to $48.08, the highest price since the end of October. The SPDR Energy ETF ( XLE ) moved above a 72.08 buy point.\nRetail, chemicals and some internet industry groups also were among Monday's best performers.\nIBM ( IBM ) inched above the 161.96 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was tracking 40% above average, which was a good sign. Still, the price move was relatively limp for a breakout, and the handle in the pattern was short and had a wedging shape. Those characteristics make the breakout suspect, and IBM's fundamentals aren't exactly sparkling. The Composite Rating is 54.\nIdexx Laboratories ( IDXX ) broke out of a cup-shaped base with a 117.94 buy point. Volume was on pace to more than double its average. The company — which makes diagnostic products and services for veterinary, livestock and poultry in addition to water testing — has posted earnings gains of 2% to 23% the past four quarters. That's not impressive for growth companies, but enough for a decent 89 EPS Rating.\nCirrus Logic ( CRUS ) rose past the 58.18 buy point of a flat base, but the stock reversed lower. Not only was the price move disheartening, but volume also was not strong enough for a good breakout.",

      "text": "Tweet \nCern is currently searching for a potential supplier for its €5.3 million Helix Nebula hybrid cloud platform and T-Systems, IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have made it to the last round. \nInitially, 28 different firms from 12 countries submitted bids for the lucrative contract to develop a hybrid cloud platform that will be built upon commercial cloud services, publicly funded infrastructures and each firm's own IT resources. Cern has narrowed down its list of bids down to the four firms based on the design ideas they have submitted for the project. The scientific organisation will eliminate one more firm and the remaining three will be required to build a prototype platform. \nIBM has decided that it will develop its platform independently, whilst T-Systems will be partnering with the Chinese firm Huawei and several others to create its platform and will also be working alongside Rhea Group in its bid. HPE, Advania, Sixsq and Indra will all make up the fourth group. \nCern is just one of 10 European research organisations that have come together to back the Helix Nebula hybrid cloud platform with the aim of the project being to provide scientific researchers throughout the continent with access to both big data and high performance computing (HPC) capabilities. \nThe leader of the Helix Nebula initiative at Cern, Bob Jones, said: “We are very pleased with the response to the tender and we would like to thank all the organisations that took the effort of submitting a bid. We realised it was a lot of work for those companies and we want to acknowledge it.” \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication. All rights reserved.",

      "title": "DB2 Integrity Checks and Exception Tables",
      "text": "I am working on planning a migration of a DB2 8.1 database from a horrible IBM encoding to UTF-8 to support further languages etc. I am encountering an issue that I am stuck on. \nA few notes on this migration: We are using db2move to export and load the data and db2look to get the details fo the database (tablespaces, tables, keys etc). We found the loading process worked nicely with db2move import, however, the data takes 7 hours to load and this was unacceptable downtime when we actually complete the conversion on the main database. We are now using db2move load, which is much faster as it seems to simply throw the data in without integrity checks. Which leads to my current issue. \nAfter completing the db2move load process, several tables are in a check pending state and require integrity checks. Integrity checks are done via the following: \nset integrity for . immediate checked \nThis works for most tables, however, some tables give an error: \nDB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command. During SQL processing it returned: \nSQL3603N Check data processing through the SET INTEGRITY statement has found integrity violation involving a constraint with name \"blah.SQL120124110232400\". SQLSTATE=23514 \nThe internets tell me that the solution to this issue is to create an exception table based on the actual table and tell the SET INTEGRITY command to send any exceptions to that table (as below): \ndb2 create table blah_EXCEPTION like blah db2 SET INTEGRITY FOR blah IMMEDIATE CHECKED FOR EXCEPTION IN blah USE blah_EXCEPTION \nNOW, here is the specific issue I am having! The above forces all the rows with issues to the specified exception table. Well that's just super, b t I can not lose data in this conversion, its simply unacceptable. The internets and IBM has a vague description of sending the violations to the exception tables and then \"dealing with the data\" that is in the exception table. Unfortunately, I am not clear what this means and I was hoping that some wise individual knows and could help me out and let me know how I can retrieve this data from these tables and place the data in the original/proper table rather than these exception tables. \nLet me know if you have any questions. Thanks!",

      "text": "By ROD McGUIRK\nAssociated Press CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday.\nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs.\n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW.\n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said.\nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure.\nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure.\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million).\nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\"\nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said.\nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million.\nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals.\nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "IBM Security Offers Tips To Shop Safely on Cyber Monday Cybercriminals Gear Up For Largest Shopping Holiday With Enticing Spam Campaigns News provided by Nov 26, 2016, 08:44 ET Share this article CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As consumers gear up for Cyber Monday, the largest online shopping day of the year, cybercriminals are also preparing to take advantage of deal-seekers. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) X-Force researchers are monitoring malicious activity closely to help organizations and consumers stay safe during the holiday shopping season. With 36 percent of consumers planning to shop online[1] on Cyber Monday, it's critical for consumers to be on high alert. IBM X-Force researchers have already seen cybercriminals actively masking malicious malware in emails to consumers disguised as major retailers sending out Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals and package shipment tracking details. When a user clicks on the package tracking URL, instead of going to the retailer, they download a malicious malware such as Locky Ransomware , which can lock a user out of their computer and encrypt all of their files, requiring them to pay a ransom to regain access. At one point, this phishing campaign comprised more than 45 percent of all spam activity monitored by IBM X-Force. In preparation for Cyber Monday, IBM Security has created some tips for consumers to follow to stay secure while shopping online. Security Tips for Cyber Monday Shopping: Beware of Unexpected Package Tracking Emails: Be cautious of unsolicited emails. IBM X-Force has identified massive campaigns distributing Locky Ransomware. At one point, the campaign was 45% of all spam activity analyzed by the team. Caution with Coupon Codes: If the discount looks too good to be true, it likely is. Promo codes from untrusted sources require caution. Don't click links to copy the code, instead copy it and use it directly on the retailer's website (even if it's a retail brand you trust). If you MUST click a link in your email, before doing so, hover over the URL and make sure it's taking you to the website. Opt for Credit Over Debit Cards: Use credit cards instead of debit card, when possible. Credit cards offer consumers more protections if the card is compromised, and won't impact your checking account during the holiday season if there's an issue. Use Unique Passwords for EACH Online Store: Never reuse the same password on different websites, especially retailers. Instead, create a unique passphrase for each website you shop on, for example, something like \"longpassword123\". Same goes for loyalty cards, create a unique password for these accounts too. Shopping From The Office? Don't use your corporate email address when making online purchases, and never ever use the same password you do for your corporate login. It will put your employer at risk. Only Use Trusted Apps: Only download shopping apps directly from the trusted app stores such as iTunes and Google Play. Be especially careful of discount deal apps, especially ones you've never heard of. Before downloading the app, check the number of reviews and ratings. If it doesn't have any reviews or ratings, or a very low number, don't download it. It might be fraudulent. Use A Special Shopping Email Address: Have a separate email address for shopping or deal websites. It'll help you identify sneaky spam that might bypass spam filters and protect your trusted account. Don't Save Your Info : Never save your credit card information in retail sites and web browsers. It might make purchases faster, but it could put your card number at risk if the retailer is compromised. Consider One-Time Use Credit Cards : When buying from a non-trusted or entirely new retailer, you can avoid putting your personal credit card data at risk by acquiring one-time use credit cards from your bank or pre-paid credit cards. You could also purchase gift cards directly from the retailer you're planning on shopping with. Get Creative With Password Reset Questions: When filling out account information, opt for the password reset question that isn't public. For example, don't use the street you grew up on, as it could be found online. Instead pick something that can be an opinion question (favorite movie, food, etc).

      "text": "IBM Security Offers Tips To Shop Safely On Cyber Monday Cybercriminals Gear Up For Largest Shopping Holiday With Enticing Spam Campaigns PR Newswire Nov26,20168:44AMEST CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As consumers gear up for Cyber Monday, the largest online shopping day of the year, cybercriminals are also preparing to take advantage of deal-seekers. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) X-Force researchers are monitoring malicious activity closely to help organizations and consumers stay safe during the holiday shopping season. With 36 percent of consumers planning to shop online[1] on Cyber Monday, it's critical for consumers to be on high alert. IBM X-Force researchers have already seen cybercriminals actively masking malicious malware in emails to consumers disguised as major retailers sending out Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals and package shipment tracking details. When a user clicks on the package tracking URL, instead of going to the retailer, they download a malicious malware such as Locky Ransomware , which can lock a user out of their computer and encrypt all of their files, requiring them to pay a ransom to regain access. At one point, this phishing campaign comprised more than 45 percent of all spam activity monitored by IBM X-Force. In preparation for Cyber Monday, IBM Security has created some tips for consumers to follow to stay secure while shopping online. Security Tips for Cyber Monday Shopping: Beware of Unexpected Package Tracking Emails: Be cautious of unsolicited emails. IBM X-Force has identified massive campaigns distributing Locky Ransomware. At one point, the campaign was 45% of all spam activity analyzed by the team. Caution with Coupon Codes: If the discount looks too good to be true, it likely is. Promo codes from untrusted sources require caution. Don't click links to copy the code, instead copy it and use it directly on the retailer's website (even if it's a retail brand you trust). If you MUST click a link in your email, before doing so, hover over the URL and make sure it's taking you to the website. Opt for Credit Over Debit Cards: Use credit cards instead of debit card, when possible. Credit cards offer consumers more protections if the card is compromised, and won't impact your checking account during the holiday season if there's an issue. Use Unique Passwords for EACH Online Store: Never reuse the same password on different websites, especially retailers. Instead, create a unique passphrase for each website you shop on, for example, something like \"longpassword123\". Same goes for loyalty cards, create a unique password for these accounts too. Shopping From The Office? Don't use your corporate email address when making online purchases, and never ever use the same password you do for your corporate login. It will put your employer at risk. Only Use Trusted Apps: Only download shopping apps directly from the trusted app stores such as iTunes and Google Play. Be especially careful of discount deal apps, especially ones you've never heard of. Before downloading the app, check the number of reviews and ratings. If it doesn't have any reviews or ratings, or a very low number, don't download it. It might be fraudulent. Use A Special Shopping Email Address: Have a separate email address for shopping or deal websites. It'll help you identify sneaky spam that might bypass spam filters and protect your trusted account. Don't Save Your Info : Never save your credit card information in retail sites and web browsers. It might make purchases faster, but it could put your card number at risk if the retailer is compromised. Consider One-Time Use Credit Cards : When buying from a non-trusted or entirely new retailer, you can avoid putting your personal credit card data at risk by acquiring one-time use credit cards from your bank or pre-paid credit cards. You could also purchase gift cards directly from the retailer you're planning on shopping with. Get Creative With Password Reset Questions: When filling out account information, opt for the password reset question that isn't public. For example, don't use the street you grew up on, as it could be found online. Instead pick something that can be an opinion question (favorite movie, food, etc). OR alternatively, you can even make up your answers, so only you know. \"Consumers needs to be diligent during the holiday shopping season,\" said Caleb Barlow , Vice President, IBM Security. \"Cybercriminals are trying to entice consumers to click suspicious links by offering deals and tapping into their curiosity. It's all about following some security basics to keep shoppers safe this shopping season.\" IBM Security's intelligence is gathered by hosting one of the world's largest URL databases with 25 billion+ web pages and images, collecting 1,000 financial malware samples daily, leveraging intelligence from 270M+ endpoints, and processing 1 trillion security events every month for more than 4,500 clients across 133 countries.

      "text": "  08:44 AM EST IBM Security Offers Tips To Shop Safely on Cyber Monday \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As consumers gear up for Cyber Monday, the largest online shopping day of the year, cybercriminals are also preparing to take advantage of deal-seekers. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) X-Force researchers are monitoring malicious activity closely to help organizations and consumers stay safe during the holiday shopping season. With 36 percent of consumers planning to shop online[1] on Cyber Monday, it's critical for consumers to be on high alert. \nIBM X-Force researchers have already seen cybercriminals actively masking malicious malware in emails to consumers disguised as major retailers sending out Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals and package shipment tracking details. When a user clicks on the package tracking URL, instead of going to the retailer, they download a malicious malware such as Locky Ransomware , which can lock a user out of their computer and encrypt all of their files, requiring them to pay a ransom to regain access. At one point, this phishing campaign comprised more than 45 percent of all spam activity monitored by IBM X-Force. \nIn preparation for Cyber Monday, IBM Security has created some tips for consumers to follow to stay secure while shopping online. \nSecurity Tips for Cyber Monday Shopping: Beware of Unexpected Package Tracking Emails: Be cautious of unsolicited emails. IBM X-Force has identified massive campaigns distributing Locky Ransomware. At one point, the campaign was 45% of all spam activity analyzed by the team. Caution with Coupon Codes: If the discount looks too good to be true, it likely is. Promo codes from untrusted sources require caution. Don't click links to copy the code, instead copy it and use it directly on the retailer's website (even if it's a retail brand you trust). If you MUST click a link in your email, before doing so, hover over the URL and make sure it's taking you to the website. Opt for Credit Over Debit Cards: Use credit cards instead of debit card, when possible. Credit cards offer consumers more protections if the card is compromised, and won't impact your checking account during the holiday season if there's an issue. Use Unique Passwords for EACH Online Store: Never reuse the same password on different websites, especially retailers. Instead, create a unique passphrase for each website you shop on, for example, something like \"longpassword123\". Same goes for loyalty cards, create a unique password for these accounts too. Shopping From The Office? Don't use your corporate email address when making online purchases, and never ever use the same password you do for your corporate login. It will put your employer at risk. Only Use Trusted Apps: Only download shopping apps directly from the trusted app stores such as iTunes and Google Play. Be especially careful of discount deal apps, especially ones you've never heard of. Before downloading the app, check the number of reviews and ratings. If it doesn't have any reviews or ratings, or a very low number, don't download it. It might be fraudulent. Use A Special Shopping Email Address: Have a separate email address for shopping or deal websites. It'll help you identify sneaky spam that might bypass spam filters and protect your trusted account. Don't Save Your Info : Never save your credit card information in retail sites and web browsers. It might make purchases faster, but it could put your card number at risk if the retailer is compromised. Consider One-Time Use Credit Cards : When buying from a non-trusted or entirely new retailer, you can avoid putting your personal credit card data at risk by acquiring one-time use credit cards from your bank or pre-paid credit cards. You could also purchase gift cards directly from the retailer you're planning on shopping with. Get Creative With Password Reset Questions: When filling out account information, opt for the password reset question that isn't public. For example, don't use the street you grew up on, as it could be found online. Instead pick something that can be an opinion question (favorite movie, food, etc). OR alternatively, you can even make up your answers, so only you know. \n\"Consumers needs to be diligent during the holiday shopping season,\" said Caleb Barlow , Vice President, IBM Security. \"Cybercriminals are trying to entice consumers to click suspicious links by offering deals and tapping into their curiosity. It's all about following some security basics to keep shoppers safe this shopping season.\" \nIBM Security's intelligence is gathered by hosting one of the world's largest URL databases with 25 billion+ web pages and images, collecting 1,000 financial malware samples daily, leveraging intelligence from 270M+ endpoints, and processing 1 trillion security events every month for more than 4,500 clients across 133 countries. \nFor retailers looking for security insights and recommendations, download the Security Trends In The \nRetail Industry report from IBM X-Force http://ibm.co/2gIcUmX or check out the X-Force Exchange collection on spam research at http://bit.ly/2fCTg7U . \nAbout IBM Security IBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

      "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As consumers gear up for Cyber Monday, the largest online shopping day of the year, cybercriminals are also preparing to take advantage of deal-seekers. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) X-Force researchers are monitoring malicious activity closely to help organizations and consumers stay safe during the holiday shopping season. With 36 percent of consumers planning to shop online[1] on Cyber Monday, it's critical for consumers to be on high alert. \nIBM X-Force researchers have already seen cybercriminals actively masking malicious malware in emails to consumers disguised as major retailers sending out Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals and package shipment tracking details. When a user clicks on the package tracking URL, instead of going to the retailer, they download a malicious malware such as Locky Ransomware , which can lock a user out of their computer and encrypt all of their files, requiring them to pay a ransom to regain access. At one point, this phishing campaign comprised more than 45 percent of all spam activity monitored by IBM X-Force. \nIn preparation for Cyber Monday, IBM Security has created some tips for consumers to follow to stay secure while shopping online. \nSecurity Tips for Cyber Monday Shopping: Beware of Unexpected Package Tracking Emails: Be cautious of unsolicited emails. IBM X-Force has identified massive campaigns distributing Locky Ransomware. At one point, the campaign was 45% of all spam activity analyzed by the team. Caution with Coupon Codes: If the discount looks too good to be true, it likely is. Promo codes from untrusted sources require caution. Don't click links to copy the code, instead copy it and use it directly on the retailer's website (even if it's a retail brand you trust). If you MUST click a link in your email, before doing so, hover over the URL and make sure it's taking you to the website.  Opt for Credit Over Debit Cards: Use credit cards instead of debit card, when possible. Credit cards offer consumers more protections if the card is compromised, and won't impact your checking account during the holiday season if there's an issue. Use Unique Passwords for EACH Online Store: Never reuse the same password on different websites, especially retailers. Instead, create a unique passphrase for each website you shop on, for example, something like \"longpassword123\".  Same goes for loyalty cards, create a unique password for these accounts too. Shopping From The Office? Don't use your corporate email address when making online purchases, and never ever use the same password you do for your corporate login. It will put your employer at risk. Only Use Trusted Apps: Only download shopping apps directly from the trusted app stores such as iTunes and Google Play. Be especially careful of discount deal apps, especially ones you've never heard of. Before downloading the app, check the number of reviews and ratings. If it doesn't have any reviews or ratings, or a very low number, don't download it. It might be fraudulent. Use A Special Shopping Email Address: Have a separate email address for shopping or deal websites. It'll help you identify sneaky spam that might bypass spam filters and protect your trusted account. Don't Save Your Info : Never save your credit card information in retail sites and web browsers. It might make purchases faster, but it could put your card number at risk if the retailer is compromised. Consider One-Time Use Credit Cards : When buying from a non-trusted or entirely new retailer, you can avoid putting your personal credit card data at risk by acquiring one-time use credit cards from your bank or pre-paid credit cards. You could also purchase gift cards directly from the retailer you're planning on shopping with. Get Creative With Password Reset Questions: When filling out account information, opt for the password reset question that isn't public. For example, don't use the street you grew up on, as it could be found online. Instead pick something that can be an opinion question (favorite movie, food, etc). OR alternatively, you can even make up your answers, so only you know. \n\"Consumers needs to be diligent during the holiday shopping season,\" said Caleb Barlow , Vice President, IBM Security. \"Cybercriminals are trying to entice consumers to click suspicious links by offering deals and tapping into their curiosity. It's all about following some security basics to keep shoppers safe this shopping season.\" \nIBM Security's intelligence is gathered by hosting one of the world's largest URL databases with 25 billion+ web pages and images, collecting 1,000 financial malware samples daily, leveraging intelligence from 270M+ endpoints, and processing 1 trillion security events every month for more than 4,500 clients across 133 countries.",

      "text": "Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By ROD McGUIRK, Last Updated: Thursday, November 24, 2016 CANBERRA, Australia -- \n(AP) Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver. \nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.

      "text": "\nIBM’s cyber range borrows tactics from military simulations. Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg Training Companies to Handle a Hack November 23, 2016 By Michael Riley , BloombergBusinessweek \nDespite billions of dollars invested in antihacking technology over the past 10 years, companies appear to have little idea of how to respond to a cyber attack. When Target was hacked during the busy 2013 Christmas season, investigators found the company had missed early warnings that might have prevented the loss of data belonging to 70 million customers. When the news came out, lawsuits were filed, and Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel resigned. Sony Pictures Entertainment’s fumbling response a year later to North Korean hackers turned a bad situation into a terrible one, costing Amy Pascal, one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, her job as co-chairman. \nIBM, which has spent five years buying companies to make itself the world’s third-largest cybersecurity provider, wants to train corporate security teams, CEOs, and PR departments to handle those kinds of crises. Shortly after Election Day, the company unveiled a facility that combines gaming techniques and millions of dollars of sophisticated hardware to re-create scenarios like Target’s and Sony’s in white-knuckle, stock-plunging detail. \nThe idea is borrowed from the Pentagon, which uses a similar approach to train soldiers for cyberwar. Instead of the pressure of combat, the facility at IBM’s security division headquarters on the Charles River in Cambridge, Mass., wants to re-create a postbreach pressure cooker that can move rapidly from a regulatory investigation to a call from the FBI to whatever else the range’s multimedia producers can conjure. “We don’t want to scare the crap out of people,” says Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security. “We do want people to feel a little of the adrenaline burst and the pressure.” \nBy the time IBM’s cyber range is fully operational in January, it will offer 12 training programs. Think of them as plays, Barlow says, with settings, acts, and an unusually wide range of actors, including general counsels, marketing teams, and C-suite executives. \nThe staging area is a bit like a flight simulator built for two dozen. Theater-quality video panels cover the front wall, and the ceiling is studded with the same sensors that allowed Tom Cruise to manipulate data with his hands in the movie Minority Report . (The ceiling array, made by Oblong Industries in Los Angeles, is the most expensive thing in the room.) Racks of servers located a floor below simulate the data stream of a full-size corporate network. \nDuring a recent afternoon demo, the training program began with a phishing e-mail sent to a fictitious HR rep. The hackers made off with a cache of data before the IT crew could isolate the source of the breach. Then an insider leaked news of the breach, and the pressure mounted. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation. More pressure. \nAs the afternoon wore on, events spun out of control. The security team discovered that the hackers hadn’t just stolen information, they’d also altered the company’s financial data shortly before its quarterly earnings report. Uh-oh. $200 million: IBM spending on its cyber range and teams for intel and incident response \nAll this realism doesn’t come without risks. The range is designed to test out some of the most virulent malware, so the whole thing is air-gapped, which means it’s not connected to the real internet. Instead, developers collected data from thousands of web pages to create a miniature, self-contained internet. \nLike many of the range’s features, that idea came from Joe Provost, the project’s threat modeling and simulation architect and a former master hacker for the National Security Agency. Two days after hackers took some of the world’s most popular websites offline in October with a botnet of infected home routers, TVs, and other internet-connected devices, Provost figured out how to replicate the attack so he could add it to one of the range’s scenarios. In the simulations, he also plays the main bad guy. \nThe facility is expensive, and IBM wouldn’t say exactly how much it costs to run. Barlow says the company had spent a combined $200 million on the range and the development of cyber intelligence and incident response teams for on-site investigations of major hacks. He may be reticent to break out spending on the facility, because there’s no guarantee the investment will pay off. IBM says it’s not planning to charge people who come in for the training sessions; it’s more of a marketing tool, an effort to convince companies there’s enough value in IBM’s various cybersecurity technologies to make them worth buying. “This is in some ways a grand experiment,” Barlow says. \nRoland Cloutier, chief security officer of payroll-services provider ADP, says that based on what he knows of the gaps in traditional cybersecurity training, IBM’s plan should work. “What IBM has been able to do is take two very different processes and combine them into a single training,” he says. “One is technology-based — I have an attack going on, and I have to stop it. But then you have crisis management, which is about leadership in tough situations. That’s a whole different skill set.” \nThe bottom line: IBM has built a cybersecurity training center to test corporate readiness. Now it has to persuade customers to buy its gear. \nFor more news, visit Bloomberg . Authors ",

      "text": "Summary \nIBM has outperformed post-election. \nEarning the majority of its sales overseas, IBM will be hurt by a stronger dollar and weakened international trade. \nHigher interest rates will directly impacted moderately levered IBM ($42 billion in debt against $17 billion in equity). International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) is perhaps the original American tech icon. The Company, boasting a $589 billion market cap continues to be, despite being down 6.4% in the past year, the largest public company. Since November 8 (immediately prior to the US election), IBM has outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 1%, advancing 4.7%. Source: TDAmeritrade While the market as a whole, including IBM, has increased post-election, other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) have underperformed. While, 11.7x forward PE certainly does not imply a rich multiple, investors need to be cognizant of the estimates that have regularly been lowered since 2014. Despite appreciation in recent weeks, owners need to cognizant of various risks the Trump Presidency will/may pose for IBM. The average estimate of $13.97/share reflects only a 3.5% increase over 2016 earnings and is down 1% over the last 90 days. The minimal adjustment in the 2017 estimate suggests, as outlined below, the impact of the new administration is unlikely to have been fully assessed in IBM's forecasts. Trade Barriers and Tariffs Trump's platform loudly called for tariffs and competitive retaliation against both countries and companies. In 2015, IBM derived over 50% of its sales revenue from outside the \"Americas\". The Company operates in 175 countries, with Europe and Asia/Pacific representing 32% and 21% of revenues, respectively. IBM has done a good job of being a \"local\" American company in many of the markets in which it operates. That means the Company is less vulnerable from retaliation if President-elect Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners. For example, President-elect Trump has vowed to name China a \"currency manipulator\" and has threatened to impose 45% tariffs on imports from the country. China, would almost certainly retaliate against the US in general, and iconic brands like AAPL (and Boeing (NYSE: BA ) in particular). The China Times , as reported in HotHardware.com, noted \" China is willing to use the nuclear option with regards to trade . . . a batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus . . . US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback. \" These are not idle threats, in 2014, amid charges of hacking, China retaliated against Cisco and IBM. IBM, which has a material (but not dollar specified) enough presence in China that it noted weaknesses in that market in previous earnings discussions , would suffer from retaliation, but perhaps to a lesser extent than non-local American firms. As IBM has always been a highly international company, an environment where trade is limited, and/or cross-border transactions discouraged, would be a powerful headwind for the tech giant. Further, the current iteration of IBM, which revolves around services provided by highly trained, hard to acquire and talented personnel, cannot easily shift resources to the US (or other markets) to satisfy protectionist sentiment. Currency While not as dramatic, as the rise of the US dollar in in 2014, the US dollar has appreciated about 4% and 6% against the Euro and Yen, respectively, as well as against other relevant currencies in the post-election period. As IBM derives the majority of its sales internationally, it would be a loser if the dollar stays at current levels or continues to appreciate. As IBM's costs are often local, it will be less impacted from a strong dollar than either very high margin companies like Apple or US-manufacturing concerns like Boeing ( BA ). Source: Investing.com In 2015, when the dollar surged 15% against the Euro (and increased against other currencies), IBM noted a $1.35 billion impact on profitability. At an effective 20% tax rate , a comparable hit would cost the Company about $0.49/share in annual earnings. As noted in the Wall Street Journal , multiple analysts, including Citibank and Brown Brothers Harriman, are projecting the US dollar to reach parity with the Euro within six-to-twelve months. IBM does make extensive use of hedges, including foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. However, as the dollar appreciates (or appreciation is anticipated), it will be more expensive to hedge causing a combination of hedging costs and an appreciating dollar to yield a similar financial statement outcome. The value of investments in foreign subsidiaries would be negatively impacted by an appreciating dollar. For example, investment in plant in Europe, valued at €100 million would be worth only about $106 million today, compared to about $118 million at the beginning of the year. Assuming no offsetting hedges, the income statement would reflect the $12 million reduction in value. At December 31, 2015, IBM had net investment hedges of $5.5 billion, up from $2.2 billion the preceding years. To reiterate, hedging is costly, and the cost increases as 1) the expectation for an appreciation dollar increases and 2) the dollar appreciates (relative to an opening position). Interest Rates As readers know, we have been in a period of historically low interest rates. Post-election, the yield on the US 10 year has increased by about 50 basis points. During the first nine months of 2016, IBM borrowed $8.3 billion to repay maturing debt as well as fund dividends and buybacks. If IBM were to borrow $10 billion in 2017 (2016 annualized), an incremental 0.5% would cost about $0.02/share (assuming a 20% tax rate in 2017 and 2.2 billion shares). Potential Positives There are of course, potential positives from Trump's likely legislative agenda. Higher Interest Rates IBM would benefit from lower liabilities from the approximately $8 billion of foreign issued debt on its balance sheet. The company may also have a significant benefit from lower pension costs, if it can justify higher expected future plan returns (reducing the obligation in today's dollars). Reduction in Corporate Tax Rate A decrease in the US tax rate would also benefit IBM, principally on US generated profits. The Company's effective tax rate was varied widely in recent years. A 5% reduction (net of deductions), assuming 50% of profits are US sourced would be worth about $0.35/share. Conclusion IBM continues to struggle to reinvent itself. While I am long to the stock, I am concerned the current price (especially given the recent run-up) fails to consider the negatives associated with the Trump Presidency. Specifically, a stronger US dollar, higher interest rates and trade restrictions will all have non-insignificant impacts on IBM's future earnings and hence its stock price. In the risks to earnings section of its analysis, S&P does not mention the above, only noting, \"considerable competition and pricing pressures . . . considerable exposure to uncertain emerging markets, and difficulty in IBM adapting to a rapidly changing IT marketplace.\" It is my opinion that the market has not properly considered the Trump negatives in the wake of euphoria about lower US tax rates and a more favorable domestic environment.

      "text": "IBM Security Offers Tips To Shop Safely on Cyber Monday Cybercriminals Gear Up For Largest Shopping Holiday With Enticing Spam Campaigns November 26, 2016 08:44 AM EST Blog This \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As consumers gear up for Cyber Monday, the largest online shopping day of the year, cybercriminals are also preparing to take advantage of deal-seekers. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) X-Force researchers are monitoring malicious activity closely to help organizations and consumers stay safe during the holiday shopping season. With 36 percent of consumers planning to shop online[1] on Cyber Monday, it's critical for consumers to be on high alert. \nIBM X-Force researchers have already seen cybercriminals actively masking malicious malware in emails to consumers disguised as major retailers sending out Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals and package shipment tracking details. When a user clicks on the package tracking URL, instead of going to the retailer, they download a malicious malware such as Locky Ransomware , which can lock a user out of their computer and encrypt all of their files, requiring them to pay a ransom to regain access. At one point, this phishing campaign comprised more than 45 percent of all spam activity monitored by IBM X-Force. \nIn preparation for Cyber Monday, IBM Security has created some tips for consumers to follow to stay secure while shopping online. \nSecurity Tips for Cyber Monday Shopping: Beware of Unexpected Package Tracking Emails: Be cautious of unsolicited emails. IBM X-Force has identified massive campaigns distributing Locky Ransomware. At one point, the campaign was 45% of all spam activity analyzed by the team. Caution with Coupon Codes: If the discount looks too good to be true, it likely is. Promo codes from untrusted sources require caution. Don't click links to copy the code, instead copy it and use it directly on the retailer's website (even if it's a retail brand you trust). If you MUST click a link in your email, before doing so, hover over the URL and make sure it's taking you to the website. Opt for Credit Over Debit Cards: Use credit cards instead of debit card, when possible. Credit cards offer consumers more protections if the card is compromised, and won't impact your checking account during the holiday season if there's an issue. Use Unique Passwords for EACH Online Store: Never reuse the same password on different websites, especially retailers. Instead, create a unique passphrase for each website you shop on, for example, something like \"longpassword123\". Same goes for loyalty cards, create a unique password for these accounts too. Shopping From The Office? Don't use your corporate email address when making online purchases, and never ever use the same password you do for your corporate login. It will put your employer at risk. Only Use Trusted Apps: Only download shopping apps directly from the trusted app stores such as iTunes and Google Play. Be especially careful of discount deal apps, especially ones you've never heard of. Before downloading the app, check the number of reviews and ratings. If it doesn't have any reviews or ratings, or a very low number, don't download it. It might be fraudulent. Use A Special Shopping Email Address: Have a separate email address for shopping or deal websites. It'll help you identify sneaky spam that might bypass spam filters and protect your trusted account. Don't Save Your Info : Never save your credit card information in retail sites and web browsers. It might make purchases faster, but it could put your card number at risk if the retailer is compromised. Consider One-Time Use Credit Cards : When buying from a non-trusted or entirely new retailer, you can avoid putting your personal credit card data at risk by acquiring one-time use credit cards from your bank or pre-paid credit cards. You could also purchase gift cards directly from the retailer you're planning on shopping with. Get Creative With Password Reset Questions: When filling out account information, opt for the password reset question that isn't public. For example, don't use the street you grew up on, as it could be found online. Instead pick something that can be an opinion question (favorite movie, food, etc). OR alternatively, you can even make up your answers, so only you know. \n\"Consumers needs to be diligent during the holiday shopping season,\" said Caleb Barlow , Vice President, IBM Security. \"Cybercriminals are trying to entice consumers to click suspicious links by offering deals and tapping into their curiosity. It's all about following some security basics to keep shoppers safe this shopping season.\" \nIBM Security's intelligence is gathered by hosting one of the world's largest URL databases with 25 billion+ web pages and images, collecting 1,000 financial malware samples daily, leveraging intelligence from 270M+ endpoints, and processing 1 trillion security events every month for more than 4,500 clients across 133 countries. \nFor retailers looking for security insights and recommendations, download the Security Trends In The \nRetail Industry report from IBM X-Force http://ibm.co/2gIcUmX or check out the X-Force Exchange collection on spam research at http://bit.ly/2fCTg7U . \nAbout IBM Security IBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

      "text": "Answering a robust demand in the marketplace, CM First Group, a provider of IBM mainframe and midrange legacy modernization solutions, has released version 10.1 of CM evolveIT http://cmevolveit.cmfirstgroup.com/ . The CM evolveIT COBOL analysis solution is used by enterprise customers worldwide as an integral part of the DevOps cycle. The solution automates the analysis that many shops still do by hand. New features include clone detection, an important factor in technical debt remediation. CM evolveIT uses an industry-leading, semantic analysis algorithm and parallel processing to identify and manage similar code fragments across large code bases. This feature enables dramatic savings on maintenance budgets by reducing duplication in the code base. It also addresses a common cause of runtime defects – cut and paste errors and missed duplication.\nOther version 10.1 enhancements include improved data impact analysis, DB2 and CICS parsing improvements, Java parsing, and a configuration utility.\n“The enhancements respond to customer demand for these capabilities,” said Roger Hammer, CM evolveIT product owner. “CM First strives to stay ahead of the pack, offering advanced capabilities needed now and for the future. The CM First ‘secret sauce’ is the depth of evolveIT code analysis and clarity of the visualization around code slicing, clones, and business rules. CM First has long understood that shallow analysis has limited value to architects working in increasingly complex software environments.”\nUnderstanding legacy code and business rules is vital to improving code quality, reducing development cycles, and modernizing applications. Without a deep understanding of application code, it is expensive and risky to take legacy applications into the 21st century by reducing maintenance costs or re-platforming these applications, where critical business rules and dependency information is typically buried in millions of lines of legacy code.\nCustomers use CM evolveIT to perform the following functions:\nHarvest business rules for system modernization Perform detailed impact analysis for mass change, for example, increasing a column size Visualize data flows and lineages Improve code quality by managing complexity and removing dead and cloned code Automatically document legacy systems\nCM First customers experience significant savings in analysis efforts, reducing months-long projects to weeks.\nTo learn more about the solution, please view the CM First website at: http://cmevolveit.cmfirstgroup.com/ or view a recorded webinar. Register here to view “CM evolveIT - Changing the way we view Legacy Applications.” https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2447864004796303362 .\nAbout CM First\nCM First is a global software and services company established in 1999 with a focus on modernizing applications, managing technical debt and the agile development of enterprise apps.

      "text": "Nov 10 Empowering the in-house digital marketer With Nanigans software running on IBM Bluemix infrastructure, internal marketing teams optimize online advertising and save big By: Ben Tregoe , Senior Vice President of Business Development, Nanigans In the world of digital marketing, change is the constant. But at Nanigans, we see one clear trend among today’s top performance marketers: bringing online advertising efforts in-house . Our customers believe that advertising performance is critical to their business success and too important to be left to third parties. When a marketing organization outsources its online advertising efforts, ad spend can be quickly eaten up by agency fees and the ad tech tax, which can range from 15 percent to as high as 70 percent. Plus, engaging external parties means funneling data to any number of third-party players, introducing concerns about data leakage and an overall lack of reporting transparency. But, most importantly, no one knows a company’s products and services like the internal team involved in marketing them on a daily basis. Our customers want to be able to capitalize on their in-house expertise, channeling it into an online advertising strategy that’s agile, responsive and highly effective in driving revenue. Nanigans created a comprehensive suite of software tools to help in-house marketing organizations do just that. To deliver these services to customers worldwide, we needed support from a cloud partner we could count on for performance, scalability and international reach. When we initially began hosting data-intensive workloads for our e-commerce and performance advertising customers, we quickly hit capacity with our data center services provider. We subsequently turned to an IBM Bluemix cloud hosting solution, which has been a tremendous asset as our company has grown over the years. The switch to Bluemix has allowed us to accommodate our workloads and scale internationally as our business demands. And we don’t have to worry about low-latency service delivery in an industry where every fraction of a millisecond matters. As one of the largest ad-buying partners within the Facebook Marketing Partner ecosystem, that confidence is essential for us. For example, an iconic apparel retailer wanted to drive new and repeat online purchases by deploying its Facebook ad spend more strategically. Such large global companies may be investing hundreds of millions of dollars in online advertising, but without tools to help them understand how to turn ad spend into revenue, these investments can be largely ineffective. With cloud-based Nanigans software, including functionality designed to dynamically test, identify and scale top-performing ad units across target audiences, the retailer increased its Facebook return on ad spend (ROAS) by a whopping 801 percent in just two years. While the marketer is always in control, these kind of results are a credit to Nanigans’ best-in-class engineering and data infrastructure. Backing our offerings with IBM Bluemix means that we can deliver the services our customers need to take control of their online advertising efforts and drive success. ",

      "text": "Cyber Monday is the day that sees the largest volumes of online purchases in the US every year. The increased volume in transactions means that consumers have to be extra alert for scams, phishing attacks, and other kinds of malicious activity that spike during the sales. A common modus operandi by cybercriminals is to send spoofed emails that appear to be tracking orders. On clicking the link to tracking the package, a ransomware gets installed on the system, that encrypts the files till a fees is paid to the hackers.\nIBM Security has released a list of safety tips for Cyber Monday, but the tips are as relevant and applicable during all online shopping events, and basically any time as well.\nCaleb Barlow, Vice President, IBM Security, says, “Cybercriminals are trying to entice consumers to click suspicious links by offering deals and tapping into their curiosity. It’s all about following some security basics to keep shoppers safe this shopping season.”\nConsumers are advised to be aware of unexpected tracking emails. Cross check the originating email id with previous emails to make sure it is from the actual site. If you suspect that you have received a mail for a package that you have not ordered, do not click on any mails within the email. Buyers are advised to be wary of links to coupon codes, and copy-paste the codes themselves instead of clicking on links to copy. If a url has to be clicked through to access the code, hover over the url to identify the target website before proceeding.\nConsumers are also advised to use credit cards over debit cards, because credit cards have more safety checks in place. This means that users will not be unduly affected even if a credit card is compromised, but the damage can be more if a debit card is compromised. Although it means more usernames and passwords to keep track of, consumers are advised not to use the same login credentials across shopping web sites.\nShoppers who do not want to put their employers at risk, should use personal email addresses for credentials and transactions. Having different passwords for professional and personal email addresses is a necessary security measure. In fact, shoppers are better off using a special email address created just for use for online shopping platforms. Users are advised not to save credit card information on the browser or the website of the retailer. Although saving the information allows for faster shopping and speedy transactions, it increases the exposure to security risks. Consumers are encouraged to use trusted applications only, and use a one time credit card available at banks to process transactions with unknown sources.\nFor password reset questions, it is a good idea to come up with creative questions, lie in the answers, or choose questions that are based on opinions, and not personal information that someone who knows you can find out.\nThe post Cyber Monday security tips from IBM are effective safety measures during online shopping festivals appeared first on Tech2 .",

It has also predicted that overall 2016 online sales for retailers in the period during November and December will increase by 13.89 percent over 2015. \nThe company noted that Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping growth was no longer limited just to U.S. retailers. Instead, it was a world-wide phenomenon this year with retailers outside of the U.S. experiencing significant growth. \nAccording to IBM, pre-holiday online shopping rose nearly 10 percent over 2015. This momentum has grown over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend with consumers opening their wallets and taking advantage of the deals being offered online by U.S. and global retailers. \nGlobal retailers saw continued momentum over the weekend, with their online sales increasing 19.5 percent over this four-day period last year. During these days, U.S. retailers saw their sales increasing 9.3 percent over last year. \nIBM noted that over the 2015 holiday season, it powered more than $62 billion in online sales and supported clients that sent more than 1.4 billion emails during this same holiday period without a single interruption. \nAccording to IBM, this holiday season is already showing signs of significant growth with the company driving record levels of engagement with customers online and via mobile. \nOn Black Friday alone, there were nearly 405 million email notifications sent to consumers around the world, while mobile push outreach is on track for 35 percent growth over 2015, IBM said. \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nThe old William Gibson adage “the future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed” has never been more apt. We live in a world where the leading internet companies have modernized their datacenters, software, and processes beyond what the average enterprise can even imagine. The gap has become so wide that we talk in terms of digital transformation to advance from one state to the other. \nOver the years, Zorawar Biri Singh has offered his own unique vision the enterprise’s future—as head of cloud for IBM and HP, as a VC at Khosla Ventures, and until recently as CTO of Cisco. In my interview with Singh in February , he described a next-generation datacenter infused with containerized microservices and pervasive analytics. When I caught up with him again last week, he took stock of technology advances since then, but also outlined the initiatives enterprises must put in place to transform themselves. [ InfoWorld’s quick guide: Digital Transformation and the Agile Enterprise . | Download InfoWorld’s essential guide to microservices and learn how to create modern web and mobile applications that scale. ] \nSingh broadly defines this as “a modern set of capabilities, tools, and a recognition of culture where enterprises are in a continuous improvement cycle.” If you read InfoWorld, you’re familiar with the technology components: Containers as opposed to VMs, microservices instead of monolithic applications, scalable cloud infrastructure, internet-connected devices transmitting telemetry, and analytics coupled with machine learning to make sense of it all. But Singh’s recommendations go beyond technology. The collaborative imperative \nFirst and foremost, Singh believes every transformative initiative begins with a committed culture of collaboration. Like many in the industry, he sees devops as the engine of continuous improvement, yet he also recognizes that devops is more than a toolchain or even a methodology. Done right, it establishes a culture where people across the enterprise can breach silos and form ad hoc groups to concoct new solutions. \nThat sort of collaboration demands the right type of platform. “Collaboration is already moving to video, chat, messaging, and voice converged in one cloud-based platform,” Singh says. He notes that tools and platforms across departments have matured, codifying workflows and allowing them to scale in a cloud-first, mobile-first model–whether you’re talking about Salesforce, Asana, Slack, or Google G Suite, not to mention developer repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. \nYet he sees much more ahead. “The next step is how these platforms evolve to incorporate machine learning, cognitive computing, and even intelligent bots to facilitate that collaboration,” says Singh. In other words, collaborative platforms under development today will eventually help identify the people and resources necessary to pull together a project on the fly and sustain it throughout its lifecycle—enabling the next phase what he calls “people-centric digitization.” \nAccording to Singh, at the heart of people-centric digitization is the ability to “look across enterprises and uncover deeply embedded human workflows, both implicit and explicit—the ‘contracts’ that determine how organizations and culture transform.” Ultimately, he says, this will radically change how business gets done and have a vast impact on traditional definition of jobs within organizations. Machine-to-machine potential \nPerhaps the most productive collaboration of all, says Singh, will be between IT and OT (operational technology), the latter defined as that which characterizes an enterprise’s core business: manufacturing, vertical disciplines, logistics, and so on. In most companies, he notes, IT and OT remain separate: Traditionally, OT roles grew from and focused on the process controls required to operate the manufacturing side of the business. These have historically been custom, siloed tech stacks. In a digital world, the IT and OT domains quickly blur. \nIntegrating the two—in particular culling telemetry from sensors or intelligent devices and applying analytics and machine learning to that data—offers an enormous opportunity. Singh characterizes this as “machine-centric digitization,” where today’s arsenal of agile technologies and methodologies homes in on core industrial systems. The heart of future IT/OT collaboration, he says, will be around IoT deployments: With 200 billion internet-connected “things” predicted by 2030, we will see massive demand for processing analytics/telemetry data at the edge—mainly large, ephemeral machine data that’s only relevant for a few seconds or a few minutes out on the edge of a network. If you don’t think, architect, and operate differently with all that data you’ll be left behind. \nIn fact, supporting this transformation will become a matter of survival for IT as a strategic part of the enterprise. Sustaining the future \nCIOs should either lead the buildout of the agile infrastructure and streaming analytics platforms necessary to extend OT’s capabilities—or get out of the way. As Singh puts it, “OT teams, much like line-of-business teams and their app developers who dove into cloud and mobile development five to eight years ago, will not wait patiently for their IT counterparts to provide tools and platforms to manage their IoT mission.” \nPublic cloud providers, in particular Google, have suggested that they intend to attack vertical markets in manner similar to ERP vendors of a generation ago. Some enterprises may opt to “exit the IT business” entirely and accept configurable cloud offerings rather than sustaining their investments in on-premises solutions, especially if IT drags its feet. \nThat’s one reason why collaborative culture along with investments in agility and analytics that extend deep into OT require a commitment at the highest levels of the enterprise. “If this transformation is not led from the company board and CEO level down, and it’s not truly empowering people, you can forget about it,” says Singh. For enterprise IT to stay relevant, IT management needs to start working toward this strategic vision now.

      "text": "International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said Monday that online sales for U.S. retailers on Thanksgiving jumped 12% from a year ago, and while Black Friday sales rose 10%. Globally, retailers saw online sales increase 24% on Thanksgiving and 28% on Black Friday. Online sales for the four-day weekend rose 9% for U.S. retailers and 20% globally. IBM expects online Cyber Monday sales to grow in the double-digit percentage range, and projects overall online sales for the November-to-December period rising 14%. \"It is clear, online shopping during the US holiday period has become a global phenomenon and more than ever companies are turning to IBM as a trusted technology provider and supporter to help them succeed during this critical period,\" said Harriet Green, general manager at IBM Commerce.

      "text": "The tech industry and the search for a cancer cure Nvidia, Intel, IBM and other Silicon Valley companies are making finding a cure a high priority. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently announced that his company is teaming up with the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy and several national laboratories on an initiative to accelerate cancer research. Nvidia A version of this essay was originally published at Tech.pinions , a website dedicated to informed opinions, insight and perspective on the tech industry. I’ve tracked the tech market for the past 35 years, and there is one major theme I have seen over and over again when it comes to the goals of many tech innovators. They believe and have faith that the technology they create has the possibility to change the world. I have frequently heard tech executives say how they think their inventions or technology are world-changing devices or services. From a historical perspective, that is very true. Technologies like the Gutenberg press, the steam engine, Edison’s light bulbs, Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone or more recent inventions like the semiconductor, PC and smartphones have indeed been world-changing in what they do and how they drive new industries and the world’s economies. Given Silicon Valley’s quest to change the world and its immense problem-solving skills, having the Valley turn its technology and skills to target these diseases perhaps can help speed up the search for treatments and, ultimately, cures for cancer, diabetes and other major health maladies. Steve Jobs was one of the most vocal on this topic, and in many speeches, he talked about Apple’s goal to change the world. Some of his products, especially the iPod, iPhone and the iPad have been world-changing devices in terms of how they expanded personal computing, communications and entertainment. Products like Facebook and Twitter have had a huge impact on connecting people around the world in ways we could not have imagined even 10 years ago. Lately I have been wondering if Silicon Valley, with its innovative thinkers and problem-solving skills, took a stronger aim at some of the huge problems we have in health care and especially in finding cures for diseases like cancer, diabetes and other major illnesses, how this could impact the fight against life-threatening problems. I think most of us either know of people who have had cancer or have it themselves and surely want a cure for this awful disease. Vice President Joe Biden’s son died from cancer, and Biden has devoted his life to what he calls a “moonshot” to try and find a cure. There has been great work and serious strides in the world of health science done to deal with cancer, but even with these advances, there is still no actual cure. It turns out that Silicon Valley has been pretty active already. I recently found out about one of the newest initiatives of a major Silicon Valley company called Nvidia, which, along with key government and private organizations, has made finding a cure for cancer a high priority. Nvidia recently announced that it is teaming up with the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and several national laboratories on an initiative to accelerate cancer research . The research efforts include a focus on building an AI framework called CANDLE (Cancer Distributed Learning Environment), which will provide a common discovery platform that brings the power of AI to the fight against cancer. CANDLE will be the first AI framework designed to change the way we understand cancer, providing data scientists around the world with a powerful tool against this disease. One of Nvidia’s claims to fame is its incredible graphical processors (GPU), which help power some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. These processors are also at the heart of Nvidia’s major push around something called Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning. These processors can handle billions of transactions per second and are central to a new data-science technology used to mine data at its deepest levels, and use AI and deep learning to try to find answers to big problems. I have known Nvidia’s founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang for 15 years, and he is one of the most energetic and visionary leaders in Silicon Valley. He is very passionate about deep learning and its potential impact on our world. “GPU deep learning has given us a new tool to tackle grand challenges that have, up to now, been too complex for even the most powerful supercomputers,” he said. “Together with the Department of Energy and the National Cancer Institute, we are creating an AI supercomputing platform for cancer research. This ambitious collaboration is a giant leap in accelerating one of our nation’s greatest undertakings, the fight against cancer.” The cancer moonshot strategic computing partnership between the DOE and NCI to accelerate precision oncology includes three pilot projects that aim to provide a better understanding of how cancer grows; discover more effective, less toxic therapies than existing ones; and understand key drivers of their effectiveness outside the clinical trial setting, at the population level. Deep learning techniques are essential for each of these projects. Nvidia is not the only tech company taking aim at the cancer “moonshot.” IBM’s Watson has joined with the Veterans Affairs to launch a public/private partnership to provide veterans who have cancer a better chance for recovery. Watson is the supercomputer that won the game show “Jeopardy,” and is one of the most powerful AI-based computers in the world. One of Silicon Valley’s giants, Intel, has invested heavily in AI and deep learning research, and is creating a new AI framework around their most powerful processors which will help power some of the biggest data projects in the world. In terms of cancer research, Intel has teamed up with the Oregon Health and Science Institute-Knight Cancer Center, the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute to create a collaborative “cancer database” they will use to help advance the research on finding better ways to treat cancer, as well as find a cure someday. Given Silicon Valley’s quest to change the world and its immense problem-solving skills, having the Valley turn its technology and skills to target these diseases perhaps can help speed up the search for treatments and, ultimately, cures for cancer, diabetes and other major health maladies.

On Black Friday alone, there were nearly 405 million email notifications sent to consumers around the world. And mobile push outreach is on track for 35% growth over 2015.\nNo longer limited just to US retailers, Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping growth was a world-wide phenomenon this year with retailers outside of the US experiencing significant growth. Key findings holiday shopping findings include:\nThanksgiving Shopping Becomes a Global Sensation: Online sales for global retailers increased by nearly 24 percent (23.9%) over 2015.

      "title": "Why International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Should Be Broken Up",
      "text": "Home > Stock Picks > Stocks to Buy > Why International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Should Be Broken Up Believe it or not, the tech giant is more vulnerable to a takeover than ever. And IBM stock could use it. By Dana Blankenhorn , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 28, 2016, 9:56 am EST Source: Atomic Taco via Flickr \nTo put that in perspective, that’s double the gain you have seen in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), nearly triple that of Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) and four times more than you’ve gotten with Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). \nWhat is going on? \nIBM simply isn’t growing. Revenues for the most recent quarter were $19.226 billion, nearly on par with those of a year earlier, $19.280 billion. Year-over-year net income is down, from $2.962 billion to $2.854 billion. Debt continues its slow march upward, as a percentage of assets, and cash flow is just stable. \nSome people are buying for value. The company’s yield of 3.4% looks attractive, and the dividend is covered twice over by earnings. The price-to-earnings ratio of 13.3 on IBM stock remain low, and analysts are pretty cold toward shares. \nWhat do buyers know that you don’t? Is IBM for Sale? \nWhile IBM has been going nowhere this decade, other tech stocks continue to grow. IBM is no longer the biggest fish in the pond. \nRight now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is worth four times what IBM is worth. Microsoft could buy IBM three times over. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA ) is worth more than IBM, and so is Oracle. \nSo, for that matter, is Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS: TCEHY ). The market cap of this Guongdong, China-based internet and gaming company dwarfs that of IBM . Which brings up the question of a foreign buyer coming in for the company. \nAny overseas bid, whether from an Internet company like Tencent, or another firm backed by China’s sovereign wealth fund, would likely create panic in both New York and Washington . But it would also put IBM stock in play. \nIBM has attractive software assets and has been hiring like mad for its Watson cognitive computing operations. \nDespite this IBM remains a troubled company. Its corporate culture, once the envy of the business world, is now better at turning out talent for others than for itself. It is increasingly unable to execute under CEO Ginni Rometty, who suddenly seems more interested in offering political advice than turning the company around. \nIBM, in short, remains a sleeping giant. It needs a wake-up call. \nA takeover battle could be just what it needs.",

      "text": "Global Retailers See Significant Growth Over Thanksgiving and Black Friday; IBM Holiday Readiness Clients Set Engagement Records Select a topic or year \nARMONK, NY - 28 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today forecasts that shoppers will drive double digit growth for retailers around the world on Cyber Monday. IBM found that pre-holiday online shopping was up nearly 10 percent over 2015. This momentum has grown over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend with consumers opening their wallets and taking advantage of the great deals being offered online by U.S. and global retailers. \nIBM is familiar with what it takes to help retailers achieve success over the busiest shopping days of the year. Over the 2015 holiday season, IBM powered more than $62B in online sales and the supported clients that sent more than 1.4 billion emails during this same holiday period without a single interruption. This holiday season is already showing signs of significant growth with IBM driving record levels of engagement with their customers online and via mobile. On Black Friday alone, there were nearly 405 million email notifications sent to consumers around the world. And mobile push outreach is on track for 35% growth over 2015. \nNo longer limited just to US retailers, Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping growth was a world-wide phenomenon this year with retailers outside of the US experiencing significant growth. Key findings holiday shopping findings include: Thanksgiving Shopping Becomes a Global Sensation: Online sales for global retailers increased by nearly 24 percent (23.9%) over 2015. For example, a major UK retailer saw 2100 hits to their website per second in the early hours of Black Friday shopping. US Retailers Cash in on Thanksgiving: Online sales for US retailers increased by nearly 12 percent (11.7%) over 2015. Global Retailers Experience Double Digital Black Friday Growth: Online sales for global retailers increased by more than 28 percent (28.4%) over 2015.

U.S. retailers also cashed in over these days with sales increasing more than 9 percent (9.3%) over 2015 Online Holiday Sales Will Continue: IBM predicts that online sales on Cyber Monday will increase by double digits over 2015. It also predicts that overall 2016 online sales (November and December) for retailers will increase by nearly 14 percent over (13.89%) over 2015. \n\"It is clear, online shopping during the US holiday period has become a global phenomenon and more than ever companies are turning to IBM as a trusted technology provider and supporter to help them succeed during this critical period,” said Harriet Green, General Manager IBM Commerce. \" The pace at which consumers demand personalized service across multiple channels requires new levels of cognitive capabilities on everything from consumer behaviors, inventory management, marketing and an organization's supply chain -- only IBM can deliver that complete solution for companies. \" \nThis year, IBM’s Holiday Readiness team is supporting 41% more clients -- keeping online shopping up and running for some of the world's largest brands through its highly scalable and secure platform. These clients represent more than 21 countries and a variety of industries including retail, telecommunications, travel, consumer packaged goods, manufacturing and shipping. \nIBM powers the full spectrum of cognitive engagement offerings delivered as a service and on premise for more than 17,000 companies around the world including 7 of the top 10 companies on the Fortune 500. \nThe result of significant investment from IBM, the Cognitive Engagement SaaS portfolio is driving rapid client adoption as companies look for integrated offerings that fit into any IT environment and that span the entire client journey.

      "text": "Erich Bloch, an electrical engineer who helped usher in the era of modern computing during three decades with IBM, and who later directed hundreds of millions of federal dollars toward scientific and technological innovation as director of the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, died Nov. 25 at his home in Washington. He was 91.\nThe cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, said his daughter, Rebecca Rosen.\nThe only child in a German-Jewish family, Mr. Bloch was orphaned during the Holocaust, survived the war years in Switzerland at a home for young refugees, and immigrated to the United States in 1948. He put himself through night school while pumping gas and cleaning laboratory equipment.\nIn 1952, he joined IBM in New York, where he established himself as a preeminent engineer in computing — and where he sharpened a competitive streak that he took to the sometimes fusty halls of government. As NSF director from 1984 to 1990, Mr. Bloch was credited with transforming the agency from a benefactor mainly of pure research into an engine of practical advancement.\nHe “changed NSF’s image,” Science magazine writers Joseph Palca and Eliot Marshall observed when Mr. Bloch left office, “from that of a mother hen for a brood of academic scientists to an agency with a plan for improving the nation.”\nMr. Bloch, displays a TCM, or thermal conduction module, circa 1980. (Courtesy of IBM) Mr. Bloch was the first NSF director to come from a business rather than academic background and the first without a doctoral degree. His qualifications lay in his achievements at IBM, where he helped mastermind revolutionary developments in computing.\nHe was chief engineer of the company’s “Stretch” supercomputer, so named because it stretched what were then the limits of computing. Introduced in 1961 with a $10 million price tag, it was used initially by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Security Agency and was the most powerful computer at the time.\nLater that decade, Mr. Bloch helped develop the IBM System/360, a family of models that are the ancestors of today’s mainframes. Fred Brooks, one of two IBM colleagues who shared with Mr. Bloch a 1985 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, credited Mr. Bloch with managing the development of the computer’s processing chips, called Solid Logic Technology.\nThomas J. Watson Jr., who led IBM at the time, is widely regarded as having “bet the company” on Mr. Bloch, his colleagues and System/360 project, which cost $5 billion — twice the company’s annual revenue. It became, according to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., the “ most successful computer system of all time .”\n“These were really the Apollo astronauts of the computing field,” John C. Hollar, the president and chief executive of the museum, said in an interview. “They were doing things that no one had ever attempted to do before.”\nMr. Bloch’s experience at IBM informed his philosophy at NSF, a federal agency that is the government’s chief funder of non-medical scientific research. His goal, he told the publication Science in 1985, was to make sure “that our own infrastructure and research is the best in the world,” capable of competing with Europe, Japan and other markets.\n“A lot of people are upset about that kind of approach to life. They say science is international, so who cares who does it,” he remarked.“I say science is no more international than commerce is. . . . I think it’s a highly competitive field, I don’t apologize for it.”\nBill Harris, who served at NSF as assistant director for math and physical sciences, credited the approach with saving the NSF from possible elimination during federal belt-tightening. Mr. Bloch persuaded Reagan administration officials not only to spare it, but even to increase its budget.\nUnder Mr. Bloch, the NSF emphasized fields such as computer science, engineering and biotechnology. He oversaw the creation of NSFNET, a precursor to the modern Internet, and the establishment at universities of Engineering Research Centers as well as Science and Technology Centers — long-term collaborations among the public, private and academic sectors to tackle complex matters such as laser applications and earthquake prediction and engineering.\n“The single investigator can’t do it with a Bunsen burner,” he told Science in 1986.\nMr. Bloch’s admirers regarded him as a powerful advocate for results in a bureaucracy that tended toward inertia. Some detractors saw him as insufficiently attentive to individual researchers pursuing questions of pure science. But, in his view, scientists “have no inalienable right to funding.”\n“If all that we are doing is the individual research grant approach to science, then I think this country is going down the drain,” he told Science. “Science is changing, the tools of science are changing. And that requires different approaches. Yeah, it will make some people nervous. Well, they don’t have to participate in it. But that doesn’t mean that the country doesn’t need that approach. It does need it. And it should have started earlier, in my opinion.”\nErich Bloch was born in Sulzburg, a town located in the Black Forest, on Jan. 9, 1925. His father, a businessman, and his mother, a homemaker, were deported by the Nazis and perished in the concentration camps.\n“I have been pretty much on my own my whole life,” he told the New York Times in 1987. “It wasn’t easy getting started. It took a certain amount of drive and aggressiveness. I learned very early I had to do things myself for something to get done.”\nMr. Bloch received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1952 before joining IBM, where he retired as vice president of technical personnel development.\nAt NSF, Mr. Bloch took particular interest in programs benefitting women, minorities, and the disabled in the sciences. After leaving office, he co-founded a consulting firm, the Washington Advisory Group. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the nonprofit Council on Competitiveness and a past board member of Motorola.\nHis wife of 56 years, the former Renee Stern, died in 2004. Survivors include his daughter, Rebecca Rosen of Trumbull, Conn.; two granddaughters; and two great-grandchildren.\nIn recent years, an interviewer from SUNY-Buffalo asked Mr. Bloch if, looking back on his career at NSF and beyond, he would have done anything differently.\n“No,” he replied . “I did what I thought at that time was important. Revisiting that now and coming to a different conclusion is not very helpful to anyone, especially oneself. You live a life only once. You don’t live it twice. You do what you think is right at the time, and you stand on that.”\nRead more Washington Post obituaries",

      "text": "Liberty Capital Management Ups Stake in IBM (IBM) By Daniel Kobialka | November 28, 2016 — 4:37 PM EST \nLiberty Capital Management raised its stake in International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) in the third quarter of 2016. (See also: IBM Director Buys Nearly $195K in Stock .) \nDailyQuint reported Liberty increased its position in IBM by 10 percent in 3Q16. As a result, Liberty thus owns 8,975 shares of IBM's stock worth more than $1.4 million. \nIn addition, DailyQuint pointed out several other institutional investors recently increased their stake in IBM, including: Capital Research Global Investors: Upped its stake in IBM by 81.1 percent in 2Q16. Vanguard Group: Boosted its position in IBM by 2.2 percent in 2Q16. AllianceBernstein: Increased its position in IBM by 45.5 percent in 2Q16. BlackRock Fund Advisors: Bolstered its stake in IBM by 6.4 percent in 2Q16. \nIBM shares boast a 50-day moving average price of $155.55 per share and a 200-day moving average price of $155.73. Also, IBM shares feature a one-year price high of $165.00 and a one-year price low of $116.90. A Closer Look at IBM's Future \nMany institutional investors remain optimistic about IBM, and perhaps it is easy to understand why. IBM delivered $81.8 billion in revenue last year, and the company continues to explore ways to improve its operations and increase its earnings. \nMartin Schroeter, IBM's chief financial officer, pointed out his company's 3Q16 revenue of $19.2 billion was \"essentially flat relative to last year.\" However, Schroeter noted IBM displayed progress in cloud, security, mobile and analytics in 3Q16 — something that bodes well for the company's long-term earnings. \nFurthermore, Schroeter stated IBM continues to invest in its operations and is constantly searching for ways to drive innovation in its existing businesses. With this approach, IBM may be equipped to deliver earnings growth for years to come. \"We are investing organically, and we're acquiring key capabilities. … We continue to have a very high margin business, and we generate a lot of profit and cash,\" Schroeter said.

      "text": "The nerds at IBM posted a bunch of tips to help make sure your identity doesn't get stolen if you shop online today. Some are things you've heard before, like use your credit card instead of your debit so hackers can't drain your bank account. But here are four you might not think about . . .\n1. Don't let websites save your information for future purchases. Your chances of being hacked go way up if you do. Sometimes websites get compromised and don't know it for months. So it's even risky with websites you think you can trust.\n2. Be careful about emails that include coupon codes or links to deals. Especially if it's from a website you're not familiar with. And just to be safe, you should copy and paste any coupon codes into the actual website. Don't click a link in your email to use them.\n3. Never use your work email as your username on store websites. And you should never use the same password you use to SIGN IN to your work email. If the wrong person gets your work email AND password, your company could get hacked.\n4. Look out for fake package-tracking emails over the next few weeks. Experts think there might be a flood of them next month. And if you click the links, hackers could get access to your computer or your financial info.\nFollow @DaddyontheRadio",

      "text": "  Download Current Issue \nTwo inquiries into the Australian census debacle, which saw millions of Australians unable to complete their forms when the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)-run website was taken off line because a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on census night, have put most of the blame on IBM.   \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: “IBM has acknowledged responsibility, they’ve apologised, they’ve made a very substantial financial settlement with the government. There have been a lot of personnel changes at IBM as a consequence. I suppose heads have rolled there. \n“And we’ll be working through the recommendations of Alastair MacGibbon’s review of the incident with the ABS and indeed with other government departments to make sure we learn the lessons from this failure.” \nIBM has remained silent about the reports on the incident and its settlement with the government – in fact it has not issued a single media release in Australia since 1 September – but it has reportedly paid $30m to the government after being paid $9.6m to build the website. \nThe digital census platform had been expected to save the Australian government $100m, largely through a much-reduced need to find, train and pay census field workers. \nWhile the Senate Economics References Committee’s report went into great detail about the events of August and the subsequent apportioning of blame by various participants, the report from the Prime Minister’s adviser on cyber security, Alastair MacGibbon , said it served as an important wake-up call to all agencies to improve security. \nMacGibbon said cyber security was a core platform for successful digital transformation. “The 2016 eCensus was a setback,” his report said. “One of the government’s most respected agencies – the Australian Bureau of Statistics – working in collaboration with one of the world’s most experienced IT companies – IBM – could not handle a predictable problem.” \nHe said better cyber security was essential if the government wanted to rebuild public trust in the quality of its digital services. Read more about the Australian census website The public post-mortem of the Australian census website meltdown continues as the IT industry gives its opinions. Industry experts question why the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ website for the 2016 census, which recently underwent a DDoS attack, was not run on public cloud. The Australian census has triggered a privacy debate after it emerged that the citizen data it collects will be held for years. \nMacGibbon recommended that the Australian Signals Directorate should work in collaboration with the Digital Transformation Agency to strengthen the framework to help agencies improve the security of their networks. \nMeanwhile, agencies might also benefit from a careful read of the Senate report as an example of “how not to”. \nIt noted that ahead of census night, independent load testing had been performed based on ABS expectations that the system would need to handle 250 forms a second, or 900,000 an hour. Penetration testing was also conducted by a third party, with no issues uncovered. \nAlthough the system withstood an initial DDoS attack and was comfortably coping with more than 7,000 census forms a minute, a second and third attack brought it down. IBM was initially unable to restore the system due to an incorrectly installed router which had not been identified before the launch. \nThe system was brought up again later on census night, but the ABS decided to remain offline until it was sure that data collected by the platform would be secure. \nIn its submission to the Senate Committee, IBM attempted to throw some of the blame on Nextgen, which had conducted the geoblocking load testing, and on Telstra, one of the internet service providers involved. Nextgen countered by saying IBM had failed to implement appropriate security measures and relied too heavily on a single avenue of geoblocking to protect itself from overseas attacks. \nMacGibbon said that despite all the finger-pointing, it was clear was that neither the ABS nor the government was well served by the system deployed. \nAccording to the Senate Committee, the long relationship between IBM and ABS had led to a measure of complacency on both sides. \nIt has recommended that before the 2021 census, an open tender be issued to find the best system, and that greater scrutiny be given to both procurement and deployment.

      "title": "American Airlines Lands On IBM Cloud For Some Of Its Tech – Fortune",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. American Airlines Lands On IBM Cloud For Some Of Its Tech \nAmerican Airlines plans to use IBM’s public cloud to run some of its applications, both companies said early Tuesday. \nAmerican Airlines, like most large companies, has legacy applications to manage tasks and will move some of them to IBM’s ibm public cloud and use IBM’s BlueMix tools to modernize them. It did not specify which applications would move. \n“The agreement runs the gamut from software and services to infrastructure and also will include data analytics and Watson going forward,” said Patrick Grubbs, IBM’s vice president of travel and transportation. “ Watson” is IBM’s brand of artificial intelligence software that is being customized to suit various vertical industries. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nNeither he nor an American Airlines spokeswoman would put a dollar figure on the deal, which is not exclusive. In a prepared statement, the airline said that the cloud computing model, which lets companies add and delete resources as needed, will give it more flexibility and scale for some of its business software. \nIn September, American’s chief information officer Maya Leibman told the CIO Journal that the airline was evaluating a move to the cloud and expected to make decisions about it within months. This looks to be one of those decisions. The American Airlines statement noted that IBM was “a cloud partner,” so there is no exclusivity implied. \nAsked about that point, an airlines spokeswoman stressed that it is a big company that works with lots of tech providers. “We use the best and newest tools for the right applications,” she told Fortune . And, since this is new technology, there will be a lot of testing before it goes live. \nThe airline is not alone in this massive technology shift. Most large companies are weighing the need to keep building and operating their own data centers or moving more of those computing and data storage jobs to a third-party cloud provider like Amazon amzn Web Services, Microsoft msft Azure, Google googl Cloud Platform, or IBM SoftLayer. For more on IBM, watch : \nThere will be more discussion about companies moving to the cloud at Amazon’s annual AWS Re:invent conference this week in Las Vegas, where Amazon will undoubtedly claim a list of customer wins . But while AWS is by far the largest public cloud purveyor, it doesn’t have this market to itself anymore. Microsoft , Google , VMware vmw , IBM, and others are all wooing enterprise customers with their respective public clouds. \nIt probably doesn’t hurt that IBM and American have a relationship going back decades. IBM, for example, worked with American Airlines on SABRE , the pioneering online reservation system.",

      "text": "Finnair Adopts iOS Enterprise Apps from IBM to Accelerate Digital Transformation Tue, Nov 29, 2016 09:00 CET \nFirst IBM MobileFirst for iOS applications taken into use in Finnair Technical Operations \nFinnair and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a first-of-its-kind agreement to utilise iOS enterprise apps from IBM to support the airline’s overall digital transformation. \nFinnair is focused on Asia-Europe traffic, carrying over 10 million customers annually and connecting 70 European destinations with 17 Asian mega-cities and three North-American cities via its Helsinki hub. In preparation for growth, Finnair has recruited more than 500 employees, rolled out new aircraft and launched new routes this year. Now, Finnair seeks to improve its processes and enhance the customer experience through digital transformation. \n\"Our collaboration with Apple and IBM is an important building block in our digital transformation,\" says Katri Harra-Salonen , Chief Digital Officer, Finnair. \"We want to link our employees with the insights they need to make better decisions. This collaboration enables a user focused, high quality, yet cost effective way of developing digital solutions, helping us to improve the way we operate as an airline.\" \nFirst applications from the collaboration will be deployed in Finnair Technical Operations in aircraft line maintenance in early 2017. \n“We see a wealth of opportunities for improving productivity as well as adding value to the work flow of our employees, by improving real-time visibility and transparency across the entire maintenance process,\" says Jari Huhtinen , Head of Finnair Technical Operations. \"Our mechanics team participated in the application creation work with Apple and IBM to ensure the best possible design, user experience and fit into our organizational processes.\" \nFinnair is the first organization to take advantage of IBM's new app design and development model for clients that plan to adopt multiple iOS apps, called Mobile at Scale for iOS. This integrated approach, unique to IBM MobileFirst for iOS, increases the speed, efficiency and quality of how iOS apps are designed, developed, deployed, enhanced and maintained over their lifecycle. \nThe airline has a team in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS Garage dedicated to rapidly executing Finnair projects. The MobileFirst for iOS Garage operates as a global hub for the development of iOS, enabling Finnair to tap into the world’s largest concentration of Swift developers, design, integration and iOS device expertise along with consulting services. The Garage team can deliver initial apps in weeks that are tailored to meet Finnair’s enterprise needs and the user requirements of its employees This integrated approach brings consistency to the project, saving 25 percent of development effort, cost and time. \nThe apps will be managed and hosted on IBM Cloud allowing Finnair to implement multiple apps at speed and at scale, transforming everyday tasks for employees across the organisation. The apps combine simplicity with the power of analytics to generate insight for more informed decision-making and better management. \n“Finnair is innovating and setting an example -- not just for its industry, but for all enterprises. Rather than using mobile in silos, the airline is looking to IBM’s industry expertise and solutions to digitize the entire airline,” said Raimon Christiani , global industry leader IBM Travel & Transportation. “Finnair has access to IBM’s full portfolio of MobileFirst for iOS apps and if there’s something else it needs to empower employees and provide Finnair passengers a more seamless travel experience, we can build it.\" \nThe first apps to be rolled out within the agreement are: Inspect & Turn provides aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation with analytics-driven recommendations to complete work assignments to ensure the safe upkeep of aircraft and achievement of on-time arrival and departure targets. Assign Tech provides aircraft mechanic supervisors a clear overview of ﬂight schedules, maintenance process and mechanic availability. Using advanced analytics, the app recommends optimal shift assignments and incorporates the skills and certiﬁcations of each mechanic. Push notiﬁcations also alert supervisors to ﬂight delays process issues, so they can easily make changes on the ﬂy. \nAbout Finnair \nFinnair flies between Asia, Europe and North America with an emphasis on fast connections via Helsinki, carrying more than ten million passengers annually and connecting 17 cities in Asia with more than 60 destinations in Europe. The airline, a pioneer in sustainable flying, is the European launch customer of the next-generation, eco-smart Airbus A350 XWB aircraft and is the first airline listed in the Leadership Index of the worldwide Carbon Disclosure Project. The only Nordic carrier with a 4-star Skytrax ranking, Finnair has also won the World Airline Award for Best Airline Northern Europe for the past seven years running. Finnair is a member of one world, the alliance of the world's leading airlines committed to providing the highest level of service and convenience to frequent international travellers. \nAbout IBM \nFor more information, visit http://www.ibm.com/services/gbs . \nFor more information regarding IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps and services please visit www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/mobilefirst-for-ios.html or www.apple.com/business/mobile-enterprise-apps/ . \nFurther information:",

      "text": " 00 AM EST Townsend Security Announces Major Update to Alliance LogAgent for IBM i \nNew features include full reporting of administrative users, including authority the user adopts through Group Profiles and Supplemental Group Profiles. \nOlympia, WA (PRWEB) November 29, 2016 \nTownsend Security today announced a significant update to its existing Alliance LogAgent for IBM i (AS/400, iSeries) solution, allowing full reporting of administrative users, which includes authority the user adopts through Group Profiles and Supplemental Group Profiles. Alliance LogAgent is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration solution that collects, formats, and transmits security information in real-time to any SIEM or log collection server. \nWhen the new configuration options are enabled, Alliance LogAgent will tag all significant security events as performed by the administrative level user. This enhancement will help security administrators easily identify which users have elevated privileges and enable SIEM solutions to quickly identify and alert on operations. In addition to the new administrative user reporting, Alliance LogAgent now provides an easy-to-use local assessment report that identifies privileged users. This will reduce the overhead of inspecting and adjusting privileges of IBM i users. \nAlliance LogAgent is compatible with all SIEM solutions that accept Syslog messages, IBM QRadar Log Event Extended Format (LEEF), or the HP ArcSight Common Event Format (CEF). The new administrative field reporting will make it easy for SIEM administrators to create dashboards, compliance reports, and alerts based on reported fields. When an administrator privileges are detected Alliance LogAgent adds the following field to the security message: \nadmin_user=yes \nFor IBM QRadar the new field is: \nadminUser=yes \nBy providing a normalized field in the security events sent to the SIEM monitoring platform, the SIEM’s query and forensic tools can be used more effectively. \n“Many IBM i customers have struggled with identifying who on their system has elevated privileges. It is crucial to identify and strictly control these users as cyber criminals often use privilege escalation to enable the exfiltration of sensitive data,” said Patrick Townsend, CEO of Townsend Security. “On first look an IBM i account may appear to have normal user privileges, but may in fact inherit higher privileges through a Group Profile or Supplemental Group Profile. Alliance LogAgent now detects these elevated privileges in real time, and provides the security administrator with an easy-to-use report to identify the source of elevated privileges. We think this is a crucial enhancement that will help IBM i customers better secure their platforms.” \nAlliance LogAgent is in use with a wide variety of SIEM solutions including LogRhythm, SecureWorks, NTT Solutionary, IBM QRadar, Alert Logic, AlienVault, McAfee SIEM, Splunk, SolarWinds, and many others. In addition to collecting the IBM i security audit journal information Alliance LogAgent collects system history messages, operator messages, exit point information, system statistics, and a variety of open source application logs in Unix/Linux format. \nThe solution is licensed on a per logical partition (LPAR) basis, with perpetual and subscription licensing options available. Existing Alliance LogAgent customers on a current maintenance contract can upgrade to the new version at no charge. \n### \nAbout Townsend Security Townsend Security creates data privacy solutions that help organizations meet evolving compliance requirements and mitigate the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks.

      "text": "\nIBM and Nike may be great places to work, but they're fighting a bruising war for digital talent—where even Google is taking some hits. \n[Photo: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images] Maureen Mullen 11.29.16 5:00 AM \nWant to know just how much or how well a given company is innovating? Take a look at the talent it attracts—or loses. These days, acquiring and hanging onto top-notch tech talent isn't easy. IBM is your dad, and Google is his younger brother. Both are kind of lame, but your Uncle Joe drives a Porsche. \nPlenty of companies are fooling themselves that they're keeping their digital skills current simply by changing job titles and adding roles that include the term \"digital.\" The number of professionals on LinkedIn calling themselves \"chief digital officer\" grew from 965 in 2015 to 3,255 in 2016—a 237% increase. \nThat semantic shift conceals a stark reality: A select handful of companies—those that have always lived and breathed digital technology (not to be confused with those other \"digital natives\" )—are sucking up top-notch tech talent, leaving everyone else to pick over the scraps. The Invisible (Working) Hand \nSome things remain true that have long been so. According to our research here at L2 , it's clear that a solid brand makes a company beautiful to strangers. If your company has a reputation as a tech innovator, tech talent will come a-knocking. What's changing, though, is that some of the most traditionally aspirational employers are struggling as a result. \nTake Nike for instance. It's regularly ranked as one of the best companies to work for, and it's consistently more popular than other top consumer brands like L’Oréal, P&G, and LVMH. But Nike’s popularity still pales in comparison to digitally native technology companies. Searches for Amazon, Facebook, or Google \"jobs\" outpace searches for \"Nike jobs\" by an order of magnitude. \nIn fact, it appears there's already been an exodus of digital talent from agencies to digital-native companies. WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, and Interpublic Group bleed talent to Facebook and Google. Based on L2’s analysis of LinkedIn data, the two tech giants employ 2,227 people who have worked at WPP, while WPP has only attracted around 124 former Facebook or Google employees—a net loss of over 2,100 people. \nEmployees who leave agencies tend to be high-value, too. Their expertise tends to beat out the experience of those moving in the opposite direction. Many of the people that agencies can hire away from Facebook or Google are often student ambassadors or interns who weren't given full-time offers by the tech giants. \nYou can almost hear the dejected whispers in the HR departments of the biggest ad firms: \"They get our best people, and we get their interns.\" All In The Family \nWhere do tech companies get their talent? From each other. But all things aren't equal. Legacy tech players are ceding talent to the new titans. Microsoft, in fact, is the top source of talent for all other tech firms. There are nearly 13,000 previous Microsoft employees currently working at the other 10 digitally native companies we examined. \nNot surprisingly, Yahoo is also losing top digital talent to its competitors. While most digital-native companies have also sourced talent from IBM, it's younger organizations like Pinterest and Snapchat that are now sourcing talent from Google. IBM is your dad, and Google is his younger brother. Both are kind of lame, but your Uncle Joe drives a Porsche and is less lame than Dad is. \nThat places the older digital-native juggernauts in something of an unfamiliar position. Google, which makes massive investments in human capital (in terms of compensation as well as culture perks like onsite food and professional training), is seeing a strong \"yo-yo\" phenomenon—employees who leave often return. So while Google loses a lot of talent, it gets some of it back. The likes of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb have no trouble luring away [Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon] alums with offers of equity. \nIn fact, Google has more yo-yo'ers than the other digital natives combined, which seems to validate the ROI on those features of its work culture. The rest of the Big Four (Facebook, Apple, and Amazon) also consistently attract talent from other digitally native tech companies, including younger ones. At the same time, though, the likes of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb have no trouble luring away Big Four alums with offers of equity, which many top tech workers still find appealing. \nThe few firms that have had some success pulling people out of major tech companies have a few things in common: \n1. Proximity to tech hubs. Walmart, whose recent acquisition of Jet.com signals its focus on an omni-channel self-reinvention, leads the way. Opening a San Bruno, California, location has helped the retailer recruit more than 300 workers from the Big Four—including 218 from its biggest rival, Amazon. \n2. Targeting specific firms. Nike has hired several staff recruiters from Apple and used them to recruit leading store personnel who can deliver next-generation retail experiences. In similar fashion, Kimberly-Clark has targeted Amazon, poaching e-commerce leaders who, in turn, have helped the company pull in additional talent. In fact, 6% of Kimberly-Clark's e-commerce team comes from Amazon. And an impressive 46% of the Amazon employees they’ve recruited have arrived with at least 10 years of experience. \n3. Executive access. There's also a pattern of brands successfully recruiting with title inflation and—no surprise here—keys to the executive washroom. L’Oréal, for example, managed to recruit a chief digital officer from Instagram by offering a seat on the executive committee. \nStill, the trend is overwhelming: The youngest digital-native tech companies are vacuuming up their elders' best and brightest. The quarterbacks and prom queens of yesterday find themselves sitting alone at the reunion as people line up to get a selfie with the captain of the chess team, who's just started a SaaS firm. \nAnd while there are tactics the old guard can employ, their still-powerful cache isn't as impressive as it once was. More and more these days, they're pushing a rock uphill. \nMaureen Mullen is chief strategy officer and cofounder of the business intelligence firm L2 . Never miss a story.

      "text": "SHOW LESS (this item is currently being modified/updated with a \"derive\" task) MGE2 is a FORTRAN IV program which computes characteristics of the main propulsion shaft of a ship, assuming that all bearing centers are on a straight line. Output from this program consists of the straight-line bearing reactions and the influence numbers for each support point. These influence numbers indicate the changes in supporting reactions produced by the raising or lowering of a particular bearing. The program also calculates the shear, bending moment, slope, and deflection values, and the weight and stiffness factors for stations designated along the shaft. MGE5 is a program similar to MGE2. It is a design tool for determining the effects of bearing centers at any given elevation relative to the straight line. MGE5 is often used after MGE2 to determine the reactions of realigned bearings. Output from MGE5 includes bearing reactions at each support point and shear, bending moment, and slope and deflections values at designated stations. (Author)",

Your actions match your words, and doing what you feel is right Trump’s doing what others expect (pun intended); so I applaud you and wish you much success in your future. Discovering who you are doesn’t seem to be something you need to be concerned with, so maybe helping others discover who they are is your destiny.",
